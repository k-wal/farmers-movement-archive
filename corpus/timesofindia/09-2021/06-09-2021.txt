Without his knowledge, Manoj had given a ride to a Malabar pit viper that is native to the Western Ghats. Yes, you read that right — a viper! Enroute, Manoj was alerted by a biker on the highway, who was pointing to the roof of his car, but he dismissed it as a joke. When he reached home, he checked the roof of his car out of curiosity, and got the shock of his life. “A snake was coiled up right above the bar on my car’s roof. And it didn’t look like a regular snake. I immediately called my friend, wildlife rescuer Vinay Jadav,” says Manoj. Speaking to Bangalore Times, Vinay says that he was astonished that it was a venomous snake that is endemic to the Western Ghats and is usually only found in the dense forests there. “What also comes as a surprise is that it survived sitting on the roof of the high-speed car for such a long time,” says Vinay. After the rescue, the snake was handed over to the PfA Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Centre, where veterinarians conducted a thorough health checkup. It was then released in the wilderness of Sakleshpur. Commenting on the rescued Viper, Colonel Dr Navaz Shariff, chief veterinarian at PfA said, “Our team of veterinarians carried out the clinical examination for parameters such as its cardiac function, respiratory system and nervous system to ensure the functioning of its reflex are normal. Its skin was also checked for parasites and constant monitoring of its health status was carried out for the 36 hours that it remained with us. The snake was then housed in a humidity-controlled enclosure and we then decided to release the snake into its natural surroundings without wasting any time to safely release the viper in the wilderness of Sakleshpur, about 220 kilometers from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/this-bengalurean-wont-forget-this-unusual-hitchhiker-in-a-hurry/articleshow/85946151.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

The ministry said it has come to know that several states have not yet implemented the provisions which were notified under the amended Motor Vehicle Act. It has listed 19 notified rules aimed at bringing significant relief to vehicle owners and those applying for driving licences. For example, the government has notified one can apply for a learner's licence online and hence there is no need to submit the form physically. Similarly, the new rule mandates that everyone applying for learner’s licence will have to undertake mandatory video tutorial before appearing for the online test. One new rule makes it mandatory for the vehicle owners to seek prior permission to alter or retrofit any motor vehicle. Another new rule for registration says that a vehicle sold by an authorised dealer doesn’t require production before a registering authority. Officials said the notification has also been issued for online issuance of temporary registration for new vehicles. The ministry has also referred to a circular of March 3, 2021 asking states to provide faceless services if the vehicle owners or drivers submit their Aadhaar number. The states have been asked to respond within 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centre-asks-states-to-submit-status-reports-on-faceless-vehicle-related-services/articleshow/85959187.cms||Dipak K Dash

An Afghan official at the airport in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif said that the would-be passengers were Afghans, many of whom did not have passports or visas, and thus were unable to leave the country. He said they had left the airport while the situation was sorted out. The top Republican on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, however, said that the group included Americans and they were sitting on the planes, but the Taliban were not letting them take off, effectively “holding them hostage." He did not say where that information came from. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the accounts. The final days of America's 20-year war in Afghanistan were marked by a harrowing airlift at Kabul's airport to evacuate tens of thousands of people — Americans and their allies — who feared what the future would hold, given the Taliban's history of repression, particularly of women. When the last troops pulled out on August 30, though, many were left behind. The US promised to continue working with the new Taliban rulers to get those who want to leave out, and the militants pledged to allow anyone with the proper legal documents to leave. But Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas told “Fox News Sunday" that American citizens and Afghan interpreters were being kept on six planes. "The Taliban will not let them leave the airport,” he said, adding that he's worried “they're going to demand more and more, whether it be cash or legitimacy as the government of Afghanistan.” He did not offer more details. The Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said it was four planes, and their intended passengers were staying at hotels while authorities worked out whether they might be able to leave the country. The sticking point, he indicated, is that many did not have the right travel papers. Residents of Mazar-e-Sharif also said the passengers were no longer at the airport. At least 10 families were seen at a local hotel waiting, they said, for a decision on their fates. None of them had passports or visas but said they had worked for companies allied with the US or German military. Others were seen at restaurants. The small airport at Mazar-e-Sharif only recently began to handle international flights and so far only to Turkey. The planes in question were bound for Doha, Qatar, the Afghan official said. It was not clear who chartered them or why they were waiting in the northern city. The massive airlift happened at Kabul's international airport, which initially closed after the US withdrawal but where domestic flights have now resumed. Searing images of that chaotic evacuation — including people clinging to an airplane as it took off — came to define the final days of America's longest war, just weeks after Taliban fighters retook the country in a lightning offensive. Since their takeover, the Taliban have sought to recast themselves as different from their 1990s incarnation, when they last ruled the country and imposed repressive restrictions across society. Women and girls were denied work and education, men were forced to grow beards, and television and music were banned. Now, the world is waiting to see the face of the new government, and many Afghans remain skeptical. In the weeks since they took power, signals have been mixed: Government employees including women have been asked to return to work, but some women were later ordered home by lower-ranking Taliban. Universities and schools have been ordered open, but fear has kept both students and teachers away. Women have demonstrated peacefully, some even having conversations about their rights with Taliban leaders. But some have been dispersed by Taliban special forces firing in the air. Some signs of normalcy have also begun to return. Kabul's streets are again clogged with traffic, as Taliban fighters patrol in pickup trucks and police vehicles — brandishing their automatic weapons and flying the Taliban's white flag. Schools have opened, and moneychangers work the street corners. Among the promises the Taliban have made is that once the country's airports are up and running, Afghans with passports and visas would be allowed to travel. More than 100 countries issued a statement saying they would be watching to see that the new rulers held to their commitment. Technical teams from Qatar and Turkey arrived in recent days and are working to get the civilian airport operational. On Saturday, state-run Ariana Airlines made its first domestic flights, which continued on Sunday. The airport is without radar facilities, so flights are restricted to daylight hours to allow for visual landing, said official Shershah Stor. Several countries have also been bringing in humanitarian supplies. The Gulf state of Qatar, where the Taliban maintained a political office since 2013, is making daily flights into Kabul, delivering humanitarian aid for the war-weary nation. Bahrain also announced humanitarian assistance deliveries. Meanwhile, the Taliban stepped up an assault on the last remaining pocket of resistance being led by fighters opposed to their rule. The anti-Taliban fighters in Panjshir province, north of the Afghan capital, are being led by former vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has appealed for humanitarian aid to help the thousands of people displaced by the fighting. A senior Taliban spokesman tweeted Sunday that Taliban troops had overrun Rokha district, one of largest of eight districts in Panjshir. Several Taliban delegations have attempted negotiations with the holdouts there, but talks have failed to gain traction. Saleh fled to Panjshir after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani quit Afghanistan as the Taliban marched on the capital. The fighters' lightning blitz across the country took less than a week to overrun some 300,000 government troops, most of whom surrendered or fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-stop-planes-of-evacuees-from-leaving-but-unclear-why/articleshow/85959361.cms||---

Asked if he would be meeting the Taliban leadership, the ISI chief paused to look at Pakistan’s ambassador to Kabul, Mansour Ahmad Khan, before responding himself, “I have just landed. We are working for peace and stability in Afghanistan.” Afghan crisis live updatesThe first official visit by any top Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the country fell to the Taliban was apparently hastened by the latter’s worsening dispute with allies and factions over its choice of Haibatullah Akhundzada as the supreme leader. News agency ANI quoted the unverified Twitter handle of the Panjshir Observer that the gunfire heard in Kabul on Friday night was the result of a power struggle between Baradar and Anas Haqqani. Read AlsoTaliban battle for Panjshir as US warns of Afghanistan civil warKABUL: Taliban fighters advanced deep into the last holdout province of Panjshir Sunday, as the top US general warned Afghanistan faces a wider civil war that would offer fertile ground for a resurgence of terrorism. Following their lightning-fast rout of Afghanistan's army last month — andWriting for the US-based website 19fortyfive.com, Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute said the Taliban couldn’t meet its target of unveiling a new government on September 3 because the Haqqanis and several other Taliban factions wouldn’t accept Akhundzada as their supreme leader. The delay may have signalled a much greater crisis within the Taliban, bringing ISI out of the woodwork and forcing it to depute a delegation led by Hameed for the “emergency trip” to Kabul, Rubin said. According to him, "a unitary Taliban" has always been an illusion as “the Quetta Shura is different from the Haqqani Network is different from the Northern Taliban”. Read AlsoIndia hopes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s stint as ‘international negotiator’ will have sobering effectAccording to reports, Sher Mohammed Stanekzai as well as Sirajuddin Haqqani may also be given positions of power in the new government while Baradar seems set for a leading role. Born in 1968 in Uruzgan province, Baradar is a Durrani Pashtun from the Popalzai tribe, sharing tribal loyalties withAmid what seemed to be ISI’s open intervention in the crisis within the new regime, former Afghanistan vice-president Amrullah Saleh was quoted as saying in a “dispatch from the frontline” to the UK-based Daily Mail that despite Pakistan’s claims to the contrary, the Taliban were being “micromanaged” by the ISI. “The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy,” he said. The Pakistan Observer reported that the ISI chief was expected to meet Taliban leaders and commanders. “Issues relating to Pak-Afghan security, economy, and other matters will be taken up with the Taliban leadership,” the report said, quoting sources. According to another Pakistan newspaper, Express Tribune, Hameed will also discuss the matter of repatriation and transit through Pakistan of foreign nationals and Afghans fleeing Taliban rule. “The issue of pending requests from countries and international organisations for the repatriation/transit through Pakistan and the need to determine the mechanism through which Pakistan could allow these, in coordination with the ground authorities in Afghanistan will be discussed during the meeting with the Taliban officials,” it said. The intelligence chief will spend a day in the Afghan capital, Geo News reported. Hameed's visit to Kabul came after army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa met British foreign secretary Dominic Raab earlier in the day and said Pakistan would assist in the formation of an inclusive administration in Afghanistan. Raab had arrived in Islamabad on Thursday night to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Some Afghan factions seek a more inclusive government and are not enthusiastic about efforts to fight the Panjshiris, Rubin wrote in 19fortyfive.com. The Taliban largely conquered Afghanistan on the back of political deals rather than military victories and are unenthusiastic about the losses they now sustain in ground fighting in the valley and its approaches, he said. It is Hameed and the factions to which he directly dictates that want to finish off Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, the two main leaders of the resistance, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/talibans-mullah-baradar-hurt-in-clash-with-haqqanis-report/articleshow/85960477.cms||---

While the district administration estimated a turnout of 1 lakh, the farmers’ unions said 10 lakh had arrived in the city over 24 hours for the “historic” meeting. The farmers’ unions called for a “Bharat bandh” on September 27. “We have kicked off ‘Mission UP and Uttarakhand’ from this stage. We will not let BJP win the upcoming elections,” said a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer organisations, which organised the mahapanchayat. “The Muzaffarnagar kisan mazdoor mahapanchayat will be remembered as a historic day and will prove to be a turning point in the Indian political landscape.” Read AlsoFarmers vow to campaign against BJP for UP, Uttarakhand polls: Key pointsNEW DELHI: Thousands of farmers from Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states on Sunday gathered at Muzaffarnagar for a ‘Kisan mahapanchayat' organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM).

Women and young farmers had turned up in huge numbers. Muzaffarnagar was a fortress where, SKM said, farmers from 16 states had arrived for the mahapanchayat. “Farmers won’t be polarised by communal politics. Let us chant Allah Hu Akbar and Har Har Mahadev together,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, sharing the stage with BKU national president Naresh Tikait, social activist Medha Patkar, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav and influential farmer leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola.

I have no idea how long ours will continue.” A host of farmer leaders, each addressing the gathering for a minute or two, spoke from the dais. All of them said the protests would continue until the government promised a “legal guarantee of MSP.” Not even 20% of the promised procurement has been done, they said. While the state government had promised loan waivers for 86 lakh farmers, only 45 lakh had received it, they added. And the number of farmers in UP who got crop insurance dropped from 72 lakh in 2016-17 to 47 lakh in 2019-20, they further said. “We will not give up. The government cancelled two trains in which farmers from Ambala and Delhi were coming to Muzaffarnagar. They stopped our buses on the highway. They installed jammers so there could be no live coverage,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of BKU.

An integrated country strategy paper drafted under new high commissioner Milinda Moragoda, who finally took charge here on August 30, calls for frequent joint military exercises, more high-level military exchanges, utilisation of India's $ 50 million counter-terrorism Line of Credit and for increasing the staff strength of defence advisor's office. The office of the Lankan high commissioner had remained vacant since January, 2020. While Moragoda was named high commissioner last year, it’s only now that he has assumed his official duty. This period coincided with some serious turbulence in bilateral ties following Sri Lanka’s decision to unilaterally banish India and Japan from the Colombo port’s East Container Terminal project that the 3 countries had agreed to jointly develop in a tripartite agreement.

Moragoda is now seeking to address the same through the strategy proposal before President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Outlining key tasks for Lankan missions in India, the proposal seeks to enhance the partnership to a strategic level by expanding bilateral cooperation in defence and Indian Ocean maritime security and says this would safeguard Sri Lanka’s strategic interests. India had in 2019 announced a $ 50 million special Line of Credit for counter-terrorism activities which, as the paper notes, Sri Lanka is yet to utilize. ``Seeking useful ways to utilize this special Line of Credit would be important.

However, in order to strengthen the security arrangements in this regard, guidelines have been issued by the MHA...for the security of the high courts and the district/ subordinate courts. The said guidelines, inter-alia, prescribe that the Protection Review Group (PRG), consisting of state spécial branch, intelligence and home departments will undertake periodic review of the security arrangements for the high courts and the district/ subordinate courts as well as the judges,” the Centre said. As the apex court is examining measures to beef up security of judges after it took suo motu cognisance of the murder of a trial court judge from Jharkhand recently and sought response from states and Centre, the government said that it issued guidelines way back in 2007 as per which specialised unit/branch is required to be created by the states and UTs to look after the security of judges/courts. The court is also to decide whether a special force on the line of Railway Protection Force be set up under the control of judiciary for protection of judges and court premises on a PIL filed by Karaunakar Mahalik through his advocate Durga Dutt. “The guidelines issued by MHA mandate that the Protection Review Group (PRG) will undertake review of security arrangements for the HCs and district/ subordinate courts as well as the judges. The registrar general of the respective HCs shall also be invited to PRG meetings when such arrangements are being discussed. The PRG will approve the security measures . The PRG will undertake security review after every 6 months," the government said in its latest affidavit. The Centre, in its earlier affidavit, told the court that here was no need to create a dedicated security force for judiciary and contended that a special unit or branch should be formed within the state police for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/security-for-judges-and-courts-states-responsibility-says-centre/articleshow/85961111.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Sharing a video of the large turnout at the farmers’ mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar, he tweeted, “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground.” With about 10,000 tweets, “Varun Gandhi” was trending at number 29 in India at the time of filing this report. Over the entire day, “#Muzaffarnagar” was the longest trending in India, over 13 hours. “I have always felt the pain of farmers. That is why, since 2009, I have donated my salary earned as MP to families of farmers who had killed themselves,” Gandhi told TOI. In his book on rural India, he had written about the struggles of marginal farmers. On Aug 31, he had met farmers in his constituency to discuss their problems. And last week, when the Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha was purportedly heard asking cops to “break the heads” of protesting farmers, he had tweeted the video, saying, “I hope this video is edited and the DM (sic) did not say this… Otherwise, this is unacceptable in democratic India to do to our own citizens.” About that, he told TOI, “I had shared my reaction to the Karnal video because it was intolerable under any circumstance.

---||Mumbai||Despite surge in footfall, city restaurants struggle to stay afloat with the 10 pm deadline||Restaurateurs across the state collectively heaved a sigh of relief when their operation timing was extended from 4pm to 10pm. However, it’s been almost a month since these relaxations were announced, but the hospitality industry still struggles to stay afloat. Apart from operations permitted only till 10pm at 50 per cent capacity, it’s the lack of transportation facilities, high rent and property taxes and slow vaccination drives that continue to hinder their growth. “None of the other metro cities in the country have imposed such an unreasonable deadline. We hope that the government will understand our plight and ease the restrictions to allow restaurants to operate till 1.30am,” says Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). ‘Availability of vaccinated staff is a big issue’Rachel Goenka, owner of restaurants chains like The Sassy Spoon and House Of Mandarin, says, “The extension on the operating hours as well as the permission to stay open over the weekend came as a much-needed respite at a time when the hospitality industry was barely holding on. We’re looking forward to the situation across the state getting better by the day. Even with all of these relaxations, we’re dealing with issues such as the availability of staff, especially those who are fully vaccinated, and the limited means of transportation for them to reach the restaurants. Operating at lower capacities is affecting our revenue and the slow vaccination drive is only adding to the fear among patrons.” Mumbaikars feel restricted, miss the city’s long-lost nightlifeNightlife is a substantial part of the city’s culture, and for months, Mumbaikars had been looking forward to dining out late in the evenings after work. “But people either have to rush through their dinner now or, in many cases, they are unable to even finish their meals. Time spent at a restaurant is for leisure and a little relaxation. However, with the 10pm deadline, the experience feels more like following a schedule,” says Pradeep Shetty, Senior Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI). Adding to that, Gurbaxish Singh Kohli shares, “Maharashtra has done a commendable job handling the COVID-19 crisis after the second wave. But, the same cannot be said about the way it has handled the lifting of lockdowns or restrictions imposed on businesses. Restaurants in the state are bearing the brunt of this.” While mentioning the extent to which the curtailed timings are not commercially viable for businesses, Pradeep Shetty informs, “Over 50 per cent of restaurants in Maharashtra have permanently shut down.” Among the many restaurants to go down in the past few weeks is Malini and Rahul Akerkar’s Qualia. “Shutting down a business is painful,” shares Rahul, adding, “As entrepreneurs, we make tough decisions to keep the business running through tough times no matter what. But we are equally responsible for balancing hope and reality, and for knowing when to pull the plug. We were a new restaurant, barely 10 months old, when we had to shut down for the first time. It became economically unsustainable during the pandemic.” For 26-year-old Mumbaikar Prabhaas Dutta, the 10pm deadline has been disappointing, too. “Most of my friends and family members are fully vaccinated and then we have to deal with some really unreasonable rules like the 10pm deadline. We are following all the precautions and still cannot do something basic like dine out at night. Recently, I noticed two restaurants that had to turn away so many guests around 10 pm, and it’s heartbreaking to see them do that while business has been suffering.” Surge in footfall seen after relaxation in guidelinesMost restaurants across the city have definitely seen a major surge in footfall, specifically over the weekends. “In the new normal, we have observed that more consumers are comfortable with making a reservation prior to their visit instead of waiting in line for tables,” says Rachel. Raj Sadvilkar from Angrezi Dhaba chain of restaurants adds, “Dinner business constitutes around 75 per cent of the total revenue for any typical restaurant. We anticipate more relaxation of restrictions in the near future.” Restaurateurs hope for more support from the government while they try to revive the industry. Rachel says, “The hospitality industry could use more government intervention and support in terms of excise discounts, property tax waivers, rent reliefs, preferential vaccination drives for restaurant employees, and restored operating hours.” ‘Restaurateurs need to be on the government task force, too’Last month, owners of restaurants, bars and hotels across Maharashtra protested to restore their original operation timings. Members of three associations — NRAI, HRAWI and AHAR — even met Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to voice their grievances and concerns. “When we spoke to the CM at length, we learnt that the disaster management cell has been guiding him. And while doctors are adept at running hospitals, the concerns of the hospitality industry are different. We can understand the fear they have, but right now, the focus should be on livelihood. The CM’s intentions are actually great, but they aren’t involving the real stakeholders in the decision-making process, so it doesn’t work,” FHRAI’s Gurbaxish Singh Kohli had shared after their meeting. This was followed by CM’s meeting with the disaster management cell, which subsequently led to the relaxation of timings till 10pm. While the deadline extension from 4pm to 10pm did provide some respite to many in this beleaguered food and beverage industry, restaurateurs now hope for further extensions till the licensed timing of 1.30am. “There is no clarity on when things will change. We are really struggling due to lack of communication. We need to be on the government task force to help each other,” says restaurateur Amrish Arora from Flamboyante. “We now plan to submit a representation to the Maharashtra government and then follow it up with a meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray,” adds HRAWI’s Pradeep Shetty.

Mamata needs to be elected to the assembly within six months of having taken oath as CM, with November 5 as the deadline. She had stepped out of her comfort zone to contest the Nandigram seat, which she lost to her estranged aide-turned-BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari by a narrow margin. The CM’s appeal against the election outcome is pending in the Calcutta high court. Bhowanipore is not just Mamata’s home turf, but also the seat that twice elected her — in 2011, when she toppled the then mighty Left, and again in 2016. TMC also named Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam for the two other seats — Jangipur and Samserganj, both in Murshidabad — where bypolls will be held. While Trinamool was first off the blocks in announcing its list, Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacaharya indicated that the party may firm up its list for the three Bengal bypolls after a meeting on Tuesday (September 7). State BJP president Dilip Ghosh indicated they would field a strong candidate against Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-to-contest-from-turf-will-give-tough-fight-bjp/articleshow/85961390.cms||---

At the same time, India reported its lowest weekly death toll from the virus in 23 weeks since March 22-28. There were 2,533 fatalities from the coronavirus during the week, the first time since March 29-April 4 that the toll had dropped below 3,000. Covid cases continued to be relatively high, mainly due to the surge in Kerala. India recorded over 2,89,700 new infections in the week (August 30-September 5), just 0.7% lower than last week’s tally of 2,91,644. Kerala logged 2,00,430 fresh cases in the week, its highest in 16 weeks since May 10-16 and 69% of the national total. The last time any Indian state had recorded over 2 lakh cases (in a week ending Sunday) was 14 weeks ago when Tamil Nadu logged 2.26 lakh in May 24-30. However, amid signs that massive Covid wave in Kerala may have peaked, the state registered a 3.8% surge in weekly cases as compared with a 56% spike last week. Meanwhile, deaths from the virus in India fell by a massive 26% this week as the toll in Maharashtra and Odisha dropped substantially. On Sunday, the country reported 219 fatalities, the first time that the daily toll had dropped below 300 since March 29. This was the lowest single-day Covid toll in 167 days since March 22. The daily case count fell below 40,000 to 39,571 (with Jharkhand data still awaited), with Kerala reporting 26,701 fresh infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hits-2-lakh-weekly-cases-india-covid-toll-at-23-week-low/articleshow/85961468.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Members of the state Covid-19 taskforce urged physicians to suspect Covid even in cases where the hallmark signs of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath are absent. Listing some of the evolving symptoms, Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the Covid taskforce, said difficulty in hearing, conjunctivitis, extreme weakness, dry mouth and reduced saliva secretion, long lasting headache and skin rashes could be signs of Covid-19 too. “Although the disease has been around for 17 months, newer symptoms are still evolving and we need to watch them,” he said, speaking in an online conference chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. Globally, there are few documented cases of sensorineural hearing loss associated with Covid-19. An inflammation of the auditory nerve or a clot caused by the viral infection could affect hearing just like it affects the sense of smell, said Dr Samir Bhargava, head of ENT at RN Cooper Hospital. “But, we haven’t seen any exponential jump in case of sudden hearing loss though we are alert since viral infections are known to cause that,” he said, adding that such patients need treatment with steroids. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the taskforce, said during the second wave that was driven by the Delta variant, most presented only gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Even fever can be present in varying forms, he said. Some do not get any fever, some get it in sudden bursts, some in intervals of two-three days, while in many it completely subsides only to return with severity. “The fever profile could be vastly varied,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/acute-headache-hearing-loss-among-covid-red-flags/articleshow/85961623.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The ministers will formally inaugurate the 3.5-km-long airstrip, which is the first one on any National Highway (NH) in the country. Sources said two such airstrips on national highways have been completed in Andhra Pradesh and two more are under development, one each in West Bengal and J&K. Tenders have been floated for four other such trips on national highways. Originally, 28 national highway stretches were identified for developing them as airstrips for emergency landing by fighter aircrafts. Sources said experts are visiting different spots to assess ground situation. These were identified near the international border in the states including J&K, Punjab, Gujarat and West Bengal. In 2016, the road transport and highways ministry had announced the setting up of an inter-ministerial joint committee with the defence ministry and the IAF to look into the feasibility of setting up these strips. Currently, one such strip is operational on the Lucknow-Agra expressway in Uttar Pradesh. Several countries, including Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland and Singapore have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-drill-iaf-plane-with-two-ministers-to-land-on-highway/articleshow/85961792.cms||Dipak K Dash

ToI has also learnt that while Pakistan has proposed a visit by Indian authorities for an anti-terror exercise of the SCO, in keeping with the group’s protocol, India has not yet decided whether or not to participate. As per the proposal, India has to send 3 officials for the event but the government apparently is not very enthusiastic about participating in an anti-terror exercise in a country it continues to identify as a state sponsor of terrorism. Official sources said Modi will not be visiting Dushanbe for the summit and will address the meeting virtually. In keeping with India’s statements on Afghanistan at UNSC and also UN Human Rights Council, Modi is unlikely to name Taliban in his statement. Despite India’s reservations about Taliban’s links with Pakistan based terror groups, India believes the group has reacted positively to concerns expressed by India and will wait to see if the Taliban actually walk the talk. Before SCO, on September 9, Modi will also participate virtually in the BRICS summit. The BRICS Declaration is also the likely to express concern about the security situation in Afghanistan. At the SCO summit though, which according to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will focus on the consequences of US actions, India may not want to sound excessively hostile to Pakistan. Islamabad clearly has the backing of both Russia and China who dominate the bloc and believe Pakistan’s influence with the Taliban will be important in ensuring stability in the country. Russia and China had recently abstained from voting on a UNSC resolution on Afghanistan that India saw as addressing its concerns related to terrorism perpetrated by UNSC designated individuals and entities. Russia saw the same resolution as an ’’unwillingness to recognize the obvious and an inclination to divide terrorists into ours and theirs” as it didn’t name ISIS and ETIM that is active in China’s Xinjiang province. Moscow also alleged that there was an attempt by Western countries to shift the blame for the US failure in Afghanistan to the Taliban movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-sco-summit-pm-modi-set-to-focus-on-terror-in-imrans-presence/articleshow/85961952.cms||Sachin Parashar

Seven people, including two women have been arrested in the case till now. As per the initial probe, at least 30 candidates are believed to have availed the services of the gang till now. Among the absconding prime suspects is a senior official of Noida-based firm Affinity Education who has gone underground since the raids and a Bangalore-based suspect who colluded with arrested suspect Ranjeet Thakur and arranged for “expert solvers”. These solvers took remote access of the computer assigned to their students and then solved the paper for them in order to get them a higher rank. They are supposedly former engineering exam toppers and a few work as teachers as well. Also under the scanner are a few staffers of the college in Sonipat apart from some invigilators who let the gang take control of the computer systems. CBI is also looking at the role of some other “education consultancy institutes” who were hand in glove with the gang.

I’m sad that these remarks have hurt the sentiments of this community besides causing damage to social harmony,” the CM said on Sunday. “My political thoughts and beliefs are different from my father’s. As his son, I respect him but as the CM, I cannot forgive his remarks or mistakes that could disturb social harmony,” he said, adding: “Nobody is above the law, not even my 86-year-old father. Police will ensure appropriate legal action.” He further said, “The Chhattisgarh government respects and honours the feelings of all castes, religions and communities.” He said he came to know about talk on social media that action is not being taken against Nandkumar because he is the CM’s father. Deen Dayal Nagar police station here took cognizance of a complaint filed by Brahmin Samaj and registered a case against Nandkumar Baghel under the IPC. Nandkumar, known for voicing his views on pro-OBC politics, made the remarks during a visit to Lucknow a couple of days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fir-filed-against-baghels-father-for-derogatory-brahmin-remark/articleshow/85962075.cms||---

The CAC is the apex advisory body under the Real Estate Regulation Act (Rera), a central Act aimed at primarily protecting the interest of homebuyers headed by housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri. In a letter addressed to the Union housing secretary, CAC member and head of a pan-India homebuyers’s body, FPCE, Abhay Upadhyay, flagged how last year the Centre in “the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic” provided a suo-motu extension of six months for completion of real estate projects across the country. It had delegated the authority to state Reras to give another three months extension. “This was done by the CAC meeting in April 2020 only with the sole purpose of giving relief to builders at the huge cost of homebuyers…, Maharashtra, UP and Karnataka have recklessly, in blatant disregard to homebuyer rights, have given another extension to the real estate projects under the garb of Covid-19 second wave,” Upadhyay said. The letter mentioned that on August 6, the Maharashtra Rera extended timelines for project completion for six months; on August 18, UP Rera extended the completion deadline for nine months and on August 27, Karnataka RERA gave a similar extension for six months. The CAC member has said the 2020 advisory by the housing ministry “under pressure from builders has opened floodgates of extensions”. He has said Rera authorities are randomly giving blanket extensions even when there was no work stoppage nor complete lockdown announced either by the central government or by any state government. Upadhyay has said his organisation had opposed any such blanket extension last year when it was brought before the CAC. It had also sought relief for homebuyers since they were facing hardships due to job losses, pay cuts, EMIs and rents. “It is also pertinent to mention that the CAC has not met since, possibly because the handle to give relief to builders has been handed over to the RERA authorities in the states, and as an unwritten rule homebuyer’s agenda is not considered to be worth taking up for consideration by the CAC, which certainly smacks of pro builder bias,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/withdraw-extensions-to-builders-government-urged/articleshow/85962262.cms||Dipak K Dash

Pradeep could hardly believe it until he confirmed it was indeed from the verified account of the acclaimed Brazilian novelist. Since then, Pradeep (55) has been ecstatic. Besides Coelho’s name, the autorickshaw also had the name of his famous novel, “The Alchemist”, written on it in Malayalam. Kerala, India (thank you very much for the photo) https://t.co/13IdqKwsMo— Paulo Coelho (@paulocoelho) 1630797703000 While posting the picture on Twitter at around 4.20 am on Sunday, Coelho wrote: “Kerala, India (thank you very much for the photo).” It garnered around 13,700 likes, 1,143 retweets and 185 comments by evening. Avoracious reader, and at home with world classics, Pradeep, who is from Cherai, said he has always dreamt of traveling to Brazil to meet his favourite writer and to Europe as well. “In every novel, there are lots of things that force readers to think about life. My favourite work is “The Alchemist”. I have read his other works too. I also like to read the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka. My favourite writer in Malayalam is VKN,” said Pradeep. Photos of VKN, Coelho and Osho are pasted inside auto. Pradeep said no other medium can impart knowledge like books, but added that they are becoming costlier and he is struggling to keep up his reading habit. “Everybody used to scold my father saying he spends most of his earnings on books. If he got Rs 500 a day, he would buy books for Rs 400,” said Pranav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/keralas-alchemist-auto-gets-paulo-coelhos-thumbs-up/articleshow/85962672.cms||---

M Mounesh’s parents M Ragavendra and Sunkamma work as labourers and live on the edge of Kudtini town in a makeshift hut. The boy studied up to Class IV in a local school and joined Morarji Residential School in Siruguppa taluk’s Nadavi village for Class V from where he completed Class X where all expenses were borne by the government. When the boy showed interest in pursuing technical education but was about to quit as he couldn’t raise money, principal S Mallappa and staff of Government Polytechnic College at Kudligi arrived at his house with an application form and formally admitted him to the course. After learning that the principal had sponsored the boy’s three-year education at the polytechnic, Karnataka higher education minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan assured the boy and principal that the government will bear his education expenses. Mounesh said his education for the past five years was free and he was in a dilemma about continuing studies. “My parents earn barely enough to keep the kitchen fires burning. It’s my good fortune that Mal- lappa Sir and the higher education minister have extended support to me,” he added. The boy’s elder sister Hemavati notched up 95% in SSLC exams and is now pursuing Arts at a PU college and his brothers Chandrashekar and Mahesh are in Class VIII and III. His mother Sunkamma said, “Since we do not have a shelter or regular income, we couldn’t afford my son’s higher education. He has got an opportunity to study further thanks to the gesture shown by the government and the college.” Mounesh, who opted for cybersecurity in his diploma, said he would plough it back into society by encouraging poor students to continue their education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-college-went-to-nomadic-boys-home/articleshow/85962803.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

The move comes in the wake of the World Health Organisation raising concern last month about counterfeit versions of Covishield circulating in the international market. While the Centre had apprised states about certain parameters that they should monitor to recognise counterfeits, the health ministry again issued a letter to states earlier this week, asking them to keep a close watch. In a letter to states and UTs, Dr Manohar Agnani, additional secretary in the health ministry, highlighted information on genuine vaccine labels and additional information of the vaccines currently in use in India — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V.

The results of the HDMC poll are going to further strengthen the roots of BJP if it bounces back to power again as it is very crucial for BJP to win the election since Hubballi-Dharwad has been the party’s strong hold for more than two decades and it’s also the home town of CM Basavaraj Bommai, former CM Jagadish Shettar and union minister Pralhad Joshi. However, Congress leaders claim that lower voter turnout in this election which recorded 53.81 % voting, is advantage for the Congress and it will benefit the party to win more seats than the BJP. Whether this comes true will be known on Monday. Congress also invested considerable resources to capture HDMC this time as it failed to win election with a clear majority since 2007. HDMC is also going to be the biggest corporation with 82 members after BBMP. Though there is a direct fight between BJP and Congress, AAP and JD (S) are also in the fray. All parties are now setting their eyes on the results which are expected to be out on Monday around 1pm. Even Congress and JD(S) are also working modalities to come together if there is a fractured mandate to keep communal forces away from enjoying power. Anilkumar Patil, former mayor and president, Congress district rural committee told TOI that there is need of a clear majority of 42 seats to come to power. “We are confident that voters will support Congress and will get a clear majority this time since BJP failed to meet basic facilities like 24x7 water to all wards, good roads and other issues during its two tenure from 2007. We will focus on completing the 24x7 water scheme in all wards, develop dust-free roads and take up other works if we come to power”, he added. Gururaj Hunisimard, JD(S) district president said, “JD(S) is contesting in 40 wards and gave tough competition in 28 wards. We are sure that we will win more than 12 seats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/results-of-civic-body-polls-today/articleshow/85962880.cms||---

---||India||Kharif holds promise amid skewed rains||NEW DELHI: In what could signal another good crop year of foodgrain production in the country despite skewed rainfall distribution, sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops has almost caught up with the sown area of last year’s corresponding period, with minimum three weeks of seasonal operation still in hand. Latest sown area data of agriculture ministry shows that the acreage of kharif crops (paddy, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, maize and other coarse cereals), as on last Friday, for the first time this season crossed the total average acreage of last five years (1,073 lakh hectares) which is considered ‘normal’ acreage of the entire sowing season. As of last Friday, the kharif acreage stood at 1,082 lakh hectares which was merely 40 lakh hectares less than the total acreage (1,122 lakh hectares) of summer sown crops in 2020. Officials tracking the sowing operation believe that this gap can easily be bridged in the next three weeks as this period is also expected to get good monsoon rains. Though it had crossed the ‘normal’ acreage threshold of ‘corresponding period’ almost a month ago, the higher than ‘normal’ sown area of the entire season by nearly nine lakh hectares indicates that the overall sown area may almost touch the record level of last year by end of this month. “It has already crossed the ‘normal’ acreage threshold, giving a good sign of recovery in the past one months despite a huge monsoon rain deficit of over 24% in August. As sowing operation continues, the overall sown area figure will definitely reach close to the 2020 mark,” said an official. Asked about the reason for the good progress despite the rain deficit, the official added, “It’s possible due to drought-proofing (setting up irrigation infrastructure) of northwest India which depends less on monsoon compared to rainfed areas of central India. Besides, farmers are also gradually switching from water-guzzler paddy to less water-consuming crops such as coarse cereals and pulses in the region.” Since the practice of using ground water is also highly prevalent in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers in these states invariably resort to such methods of irrigation in absence of rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kharif-holds-promise-amid-skewed-rains/articleshow/85963045.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Asserting that he was not hankering after any organisational post nor looking outside Congress, contrary to reports, Patel told TOI, “AAP has come to Gujarat to stop the voters angry with BJP from voting for Congress. Its job is to tap mid way the drift of angry voters towards Congress, which will hurt Congress and help BJP.” “Somebody is helping them. That somebody may be Delhi,” Patel said, in an allusion to the Modi-led BJP. The young leader added, “You look at the freedom they have got to campaign in Gujarat and the expenditure on it. It is massive. Also, their banners are allowed to stay in public places for 45 days or even longer, whereas those of others are taken down in no time,” he said. Patel said BJP has played the game of inserting new players in the state politics in last three assembly elections through independent outfits launched by BJP dissenters, which took away crucial anti BJP votes and badly undercut the chances of Congress. The star of Aam Aadmi Party started shining in Gujarat after it performed well in the Surat municipal elections in February. Kejriwal and his senior colleagues have since been visiting Gujarat to strengthen the party there. With the Congress said to be planning an organisational overhaul in Gujarat, Hardik denied that he was demanding an elevation and asserted that he will continue to work with “full energy” for the party. “I don’t require a post. I want a good government in Gujarat which can only be given by Congress,” he said. He said the party high command is to take a decision on the state president and the legislature party leader, besides appointing a new state in-charge of the AICC. “We will all abide by the decision of the leadership. Whether they decide to change the present PCC and CLP leaders, or decide to continue with them, we will work with full commitment,” he said. Patel said he is “just 27 years old” and the working president of the state Congress, and “since I was in jail for nine months, I am a man with patience”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hardik-says-aap-trying-to-hurt-congress-in-gujarat-hints-at-bjp-nexus/articleshow/85963087.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

RSS national media head Sunil Ambekar said Infosys has made seminal contributions in the progress of the country and that Panchjanya is not the RSS mouthpiece, in what is a strong refutation of the claims made in the report.  “There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects individual opinion of the author,” Ambekar said in a statement. The RSS functionary further said, “Panchjanya is not a mouthpiece of the RSS and the said article or opinions expressed in it should not be linked with the RSS.” The magazine, other than English weekly “Organiser”, is published by Bharat Prakashan, which is considered to be part of the RSS thought. Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar, however, stuck to the report published on September 5.  “Panchjanya stands by the facts published by it in the cover story. If Infosys has any objections, it should suggest an extensive investigation into the facts and should put forth its point of view,” Shankar told TOI. The editor also said there are certain sections of people attributing the report to the RSS, which is incorrect. The “Organiser” editor Praful Ketkar asserted that there is no denying that the two magazines are ideologically inspired by the RSS. “However, we have objections if you call the two magazines as RSS mouthpieces,” Ketkar said. He said the management of both the magazines are autonomous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rss-distances-itself-from-panchjanyas-infosys-article/articleshow/85963095.cms||---

The organisations demanded that Union home minister Amit Shah declare the hill districts of Karbi Anglong, West Karbi Anglong, and Dima Hasao as ‘autonomous state’ under the provision of Article-244 (A) of the Constitution.  “The BJP government kept the demand for the implementation of Article-244(A) hidden while finalising the agreement. It was not even discussed,” Abinash Ronghang, convener of the forum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/day-after-pact-autonomous-state-demand-in-karbi-anglong/articleshow/85963118.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The survey conducted by Morning Consult, which tracks popularity ratings of a host of global leaders, has put PM Modi with 70% approval on the top of the list.  The list also includes US President Joe Biden and UK PM Boris Johnson, whose approval rating is far below that of Modi. “Self-reliant India and its hard-working leadership are leading the world. PM Narendra Modi continues to top the list of world’s most popular leaders with a 70% global approval rating,” Shah said. Nadda said, “The highest ranking for Narendra Modi in the global approval rating is a matter of pride and honour for the country. This is a result of people’s blessings to his welfare policies for the masses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-nadda-hail-modi-as-global-survey-gives-him-highest-ranking/articleshow/85963142.cms||---

It advised the BJP leaders to go through the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry before criticising the state government.  Speaking to the media at the party office, YSRC legislator Malladi Vishnu said the government appealed to the public to celebrate the festival indoors in view of Covid-19. He said the Union home secretary had on August 18 asked all the states to take appropriate measures to prevent mass gatherings during the festival season in view of the pandemic situation. “The state government had suspended the Teachers’ Day celebrations and the YSR Lifetime Awards function in the backdrop of the spread of Covid-19.” Vishnu criticised BJP state chief Somu Veerraju for trying to create a communal rift. “The state government had also imposed curbs during Ramzan, Bakrid and Muharram. The government is acting with the utmost responsibility. BJP leaders are creating unnecessary controversies,” Vishnu claimed.  “People were not allowed even at Independence Day celebrations as part of Covid-19 regulations. Police have been taking measures to prevent mass gatherings at private functions and festivals. It has become a regular practice for BJP leaders to link chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s religious belief with the government decisions,” Vishnu added.  He asked BJP leaders to focus on getting more funds and projects from the Centre and stop divisive politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/row-over-ganesh-chaturthi-pandals-unnecessary-says-ysrc-legislator/articleshow/85956474.cms||Samdani MN

The attack targeted a Frontier Corps (FC) check post on the Mastung road in Quetta, the provincial capital, deputy inspector General of Quetta police Azhar Akram said. He told reporters that an initial investigations suggested that the suicide bomber drove an explosives laden motorcycle into a vehicle carrying Frontier Corps. “The bomb disposal squad has estimated that the motorcycle was laden with 6kg of explosives,” he said. Akram confirmed that four people were killed in the blast while 20 others, 18 soldiers and 2 bystanders, were injured. “Some of the injured people are in a critical condition and the casualties could rise.” The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack sending a grim signal that the change of government in Kabul might not end the woes of Pakistan as the country looks towards the Taliban to rein in the TTP rebels who are hiding in Afghanistan. According to security forces, the vehicle targeted in the attack was providing security to vegetable sellers belonging to the Hazara community of the province. Condemning the attack, PM Imran Khan took to Twitter to offer condolences to the families of those killed. “Condemn the TTP suicide attack on FC check post. My condolences go to the families of the martyrs & prayers for the recovery of the injured. Salute our security forces & their sacrifices to keep us safe by thwarting foreign-backed terrorists' designs,” he said in a tweet. Balochistan home minister Mir Ziaullah Langove also condemned the attack and sought a report. “These attacks will not lower the morale of the forces,” he said, adding that the war against terrorism would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistani-taliban-bomber-blows-himself-up-in-balochistan-4-security-personnel-killed/articleshow/85963221.cms||---

University classes to be behind veil||KABUL: Women attending private Afghan universities must wear an abaya robe and niqab covering most of the face, the Taliban have ordered, and classes must be segregated by sex — or at least divided by a curtain. In a lengthy document issued by the Taliban’s education authority, they also ordered that female students should only be taught by other women, but if that was not possible then “old men” of good character could fill in. The decree applies to private colleges and universities, which have mushroomed since the Taliban’s first rule ended in 2001. During that period, girls and women were mostly excluded from education because of rules regarding same-sex classrooms and the insistence they had to be accompanied by a male relative whenever they left the house. There was no order for women to wear the all-enveloping burqa in the new regulations issued late on Saturday, but the niqab effectively covers most of the face anyway, leaving just the eyes exposed. In recent years burqas and niqabs have largely vanished from the streets of Kabul, but are seen more frequently in smaller cities and towns. The decree comes as private universities prepare to open on Monday. “Universities are required to recruit female teachers for female students based on their facilities,” the decree said, adding that men and women should use separate entrances and exits. If it is not possible to hire women teachers, then colleges “should try to hire old men teachers who have a good record of behaviour”. While women now have to study separately, they must also end their lesson five minutes earlier than men to stop them from mingling outside. They must then stay in waiting rooms until their male counterparts have left the building, according to the decree issued by the Taliban higher education ministry. “Practically, it is a difficult plan — we don’t have enough female instructors or classes to segregate the girls,” said a university professor. “But the fact that they are allowing girls to go to schools and universities is a big positive step,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/curtains-for-women-freedom-university-classes-to-be-behind-veil/articleshow/85963324.cms||---

The existing 9pm-5am curfew will remain in force during these five days, and people are prohibited from venturing out after 9pm. According to guidelines, only one public pandal is allowed in every municipal ward in urban areas and the local administration will decide how many idols could be installed in rural areas. A pandal cannot be bigger than 50x50ft with a cap of 20 visitors at a time, and organisers must be jabbed and have RT-PCR negative certificate. Vax drive for festival organisers Covid protocol, including wearing of masks and distancing, must be followed.

No idol installation or celebration is allowed at schools and colleges. While the idols should be immersed only at designated tanks or ponds, Ashoka will chair a meeting of BBMP officials on Monday to decide on the modalities and places for immersion.

M Mounesh’s parents M Raghavendra and Sunkamma work as labourers and live on the edge of Kudtini town in a makeshift hut. The boy studied up to Class IV in a local school and joined Morarji Residential School in Siruguppa taluk’s Nadavi village for Class V from where he completed Class X where all expenses were borne by the government. When the boy showed interest in pursuing technical education but was about to quit as he couldn’t raise money, principal S Mallappa and staff of Government Polytechnic College at Kudligi arrived at his house with an application form and formally admitted him to the course. Boy was on the verge of calling it quits: Principal  After learning that the principal had sponsored the boy’s three-year education at the polytechnic, higher education minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan assured the boy and principal that the government will bear his education expenses. Thanking the college and the government, Mounesh said his education for the past five years was free and he was in a dilemma about continuing studies. “My parents earn barely enough to keep the kitchen fires burning. It’s my good fortune that Mallappa Sir and the higher education minister extended support ,” he added. The boy’s elder sister Hemavati notched up 95% in SSLC exams and is pursuing arts at a PU college; his brothers Chandrashekar and Mahesh are in class 8 and 3. Mother Sunkamma said, “Since we do not have a shelter or regular income, we couldn’t afford my son’s higher education. He has got an opportunity to study further thanks to the government and the college.” Mounesh, who was opted for cybersecurity in his diploma, said he would plough it back to society by encouraging poor students to continue studies. Principal Mallappa said he volunteered to foot fees for the next three years as the boy was on the verge of calling it quits and supporting family by taking up a job. ‘‘Polytechnic principal Mallappa won my heart through his gesture. The government will take care of Mounesh’s education expenses. This is also the aim of National Education Policy: Take education to the doorstep of every student,” said CN Ashwath Narayan, minister for higher education.

The woman, named in local media as Banu Negar, was killed at the family home in front of relatives in Firozkoh, the capital of central Ghor province. The killing comes amid increasing reports of escalating repression of women in Afghanistan. Details of the incident are still sketchy as many in Firozkoh fear retribution if they speak out. But three sources have told the BBC that the Taliban beat and shot dead Negar in front of her husband and children on Saturday. Relatives supplied graphic images showing blood spattered on a wall in the corner of a room and a body, the face heavily disfigured, the report added. The family say Negar, who worked at the local prison, was eight months pregnant. Three gunmen arrived at the house on Saturday and searched it before tying members of the family up, relatives say. The intruders were heard speaking Arabic, a witness said. The Taliban told the BBC they had no involvement in Negar's death and are investigating the incident. Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said: "We are aware of the incident and I am confirming that the Taliban have not killed her, our investigation is ongoing." He added that the Taliban had already announced an amnesty for people who worked for the previous administration, and put Negar's murder down to "personal enmity or something else".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-kill-female-police-officer-in-front-of-her-relatives/articleshow/85963438.cms||---

In a statement, Nepal’s home ministry said that the PM has taken a note of “chanting slogans, holding demonstrations and protest and burning effigies to tarnish the image of the neighbouring friendly nation’s PM”. The home ministry statement, however, did not identify the leader. The statement came after students and youth organisations belonging to both the ruling alliance and the opposition burnt effigies of PM Modi during protests over the death of a Nepalese youth when he was crossing the Mahakali river near the border with India in July. The home ministry said it will take action to control the activities targeted against the neighbouring nation and will punish those who involve themselves in such unlawful activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/nepal-govt-warns-citizens-against-acts-that-may-hurt-friendly-nations/articleshow/85963480.cms||---
---||World||Taliban pledge safety for humanitarian workers: UN||UNITED NATIONS: The Taliban on Sunday pledged to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers and aid access in Afghanistan in a meeting with the UN humanitarian chief in Kabul, a UN spokesman said. Martin Griffiths was in the Afghan capital on Sunday for several days of meetings with Taliban leadership amid a looming humanitarian disaster in the country newly under the control of the hardline Islamists. "The authorities pledged that the safety and security of humanitarian staff, and humanitarian access to people in need, will be guaranteed and that humanitarian workers -- both men and women -- will be guaranteed freedom of movement," a statement from UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Griffiths reiterated in the meeting that the humanitarian community was committed to delivering "impartial and independent humanitarian assistance," the statement added. He also called on all parties to ensure the rights and safety of women, both those contributing to aid delivery and civilians. Women's freedoms in Afghanistan were sharply curtailed under the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule. The UN says Afghanistan is mired in a humanitarian crisis affecting 18 million people, or half the population. Even before the Taliban's lightning offensive that ousted the Western-backed government on August 15, Afghanistan was already heavily aid-dependent -- with 40 percent of the country's GDP drawn from foreign funding. But the future of aid missions in the country under the Taliban has been a source of concern for the UN and aid groups, despite Taliban pledges of a softer brand of rule than during their first stint in power. Several relief organizations have previously confirmed to AFP they were in talks with the Taliban to continue their operations, or have already received security guarantees for existing programs. The UN said this week humanitarian flights had resumed to several Afghan provinces. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged "the Taliban and all other parties to exercise utmost restraint to protect lives and to ensure that humanitarian needs can be met" in a report to the Security Council this weekend. The report was compiled as the mandate of the UN political mission in Afghanistan is scheduled to expire on September 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-pledge-safety-for-humanitarian-workers-un/articleshow/85963738.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Authorities gear up to avert crisis at Somasila project gates in Nellore||AMARAVATI: The irrigation authorities at Somasila project in Nellore district are on their toes as flood level is increasing in the reservoir. The authorities had a tough time last year in lifting crest gates during floods. Although they averted a crisis at the eleventh hour by managing to lift the gates, the recent incident of a crest gate washing away at Pulichintala project due to heavy floods is worrying the administration. Irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav recently reviewed the situation and directed the officials to avoid slip-ups. The water level at Somasila project has already touched 68 tmc ft against the full reservoir level (FRL) of 72 tmc ft. Heavy rains in upstream areas are leading to increase in water level at the project. However, the officials are anticipating that the water reserves would reach FRL in another three or four days. Although the project authorities have managed to overcome several issues since the tough time faced during the last flood, the remote control system to operate the crest gates is yet to be fully repaired. This would force the officials to operate the gates in manual mode and any technical glitch in the eleventh hour might repeat the Pulichintala kind of mishap during the floods. The authorities lifted the gates at Somasila on September 16 last year to let out water. However, they faced trouble when they tried to lift the gates a fortnight later when the power supply was snapped due to heavy floods in the region. The diesel generator which was kept on stand-by could not pump energy required to lift the gates. The officials had to down the gates before lifting them again with difficulty. The gantry crane available at the project was yet to be tested for its operational efficacy in spite of knowing it was the most needed machine to fix the stop gates during the emergency. “We have kept everything ready to operate the gates. We will go for manual operation of the gates,” said K Dhanunjay, executive engineer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/authorities-gear-up-to-avertcrisis-at-somasila-project-gates/articleshow/85958405.cms||Samdani MN

According to police, Rai, who works in a factory in Karanj village near Mandvi, is a native of Khamhori village in Shivan district of Bihar. The accused is a married man and father of two children. “On August 24, a woman was found brutally murdered near railway tracks in Nandurbar district. The victim’s throat was slit while the face too was cut up to cover identity and even the skin on the face was removed. Police in Nandurbar alerted Surat police after they found out that the accused and victim were both from Surat. “After we detained Rai, he confessed to the crime and told the police that he had murdered Seeta Bhagat (23), a resident of Bihar, with whom he was having an affair for the past two years. He brought Seeta from Bihar to Surat 10 days ago and then came to know that Seeta had been in love with another man earlier against whom she had lodged a complaint of rape. She allegedly threatened Rai that if he will not marry her, she would lodge a complaint of rape against him too. So fearing rape complaint, he decided to eliminate her,” police said. Rai took Seeta by train to Nandurbar and duo deboarded one stop before Nandurbar. He then took her to a remote location near the railway track where he brutally murdered her with a blade. After committing the crime, Rai returned to Karanj village and started working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fearing-rape-plaint-surat-man-kills-lover/articleshow/85958217.cms||---

Felicitating 20 schoolteachers selected from different parts of the state at the education department’s conference hall here on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, the minister said the process of appointment of teachers in a transparent manner is already on and qualified and competent teachers are being appointed by authorised bodies against sanctioned posts. Chaudhary said there would be no dearth of teachers anywhere in the state now. “Teachers will have to give their 100% to the students. Teachers happen to be the backbones of the education system and a state can’t develop without the effective and meaningful contribution of teachers. Children of the state have suffered a lot owing to the pandemic and now it is the responsibility of the teachers to compensate for the academic loss by making some extra efforts,” he added. Paying his tribute to former President S Radhakrishnan whose birthday is celebrated as Teachers’ Day, the minister said teachers should be role models for their students. “Selected schoolteachers are awarded every year on Teachers’ Day with a view to motivating and encouraging others for giving their best to the future generation of the society. This creates a better academic environment by infusing positive energy in the teaching community,” he said. The minister presented a cash award of Rs 15,000 and a citation to all the teachers felicitated on the occasion. Two of the felicitated teachers – Chandana Dutt of Govt Middle School, Ranti (Madhubani) and Haridas Sharma of R K Middle School, Dahrak (Kaimur) – also received ‘Rashtriya Shikshak Puraskar’ awarded by the Union ministry of education on Sunday.

In his autobiography, he mentions “its (the site’s) vicinity to the Sabarmati Central Jail was for me a special attraction. As going to jail is understood to be normal for many Satyagrahis, I liked this location. And I knew that sites selected for jails have generally clean surroundings”. Indeed, the jail witnessed Mahatma’s first imprisonment in India in 1922 when he was lodged from March 11 to 20 on charges of sedition. He came back to Sabarmati Central Jail later for only a day on August 1, 1933 before he was sent to Yerawada jail in Pune. Gandhi Yard today is the site of reforming prisoners’ lives – while a section is used as a classroom for distance education initiative. Prison inmates, mostly convicts, also record audio books at a studio here for persons with visual impairment.Today, the Gandhi Yard at Ahmedabad Central Jail stands witness to the landmark. Rohan Anand, superintendent of the prison, said that a lamp and incense sticks are burnt in the morning and evening daily amid bhajans by the inmates. “The inmates also keep the yard clean which also houses a small museum of sorts – including copies of his prison order, his correspondence and a few pictures/ illustrations,” he said.

According to records, he celebrated his 53rd birthday here. In later years, luminaries ranging from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to Kakasaheb Kalelkar and from Mahadev Desai to Ravishankar Maharaj were lodged here,” he said.

With the government appointing merchant bankers for what is likely to be the largest government divestment and largest IPO, there is speculation on LIC’s valuation. Many have used the private sector listed companies or SBI Life as a proxy for embedded value (EV) and EV multiple at which LIC shares could be offered. According to Sathe, the corporation’s valuation would be influenced by the extent of contribution from single premium policies to its assets under management (AUM) that would determine valuation. According to numbers released by LIC, its asset base has crossed Rs 38 lakh crore which is more than 15 times the AUM of the top private life companies like HDFC Life or ICICI Prudential. “Taking into consideration the AUM, if we think its embedded value will be 15-20 times of private listed companies it will be wrong because the calculation of embedded value is based on the actuarial calculation, which takes into account present value of future benefits,” said Sathe while speaking at the Indian Insurance Institute Kolkata recently. “Since single premium policies have less EV (present value of future benefits) and it reduces profitability, private insurers are reluctant to do single premium policies,” he said. Besides being with the insurance regulator, Sathe has been executive director at LIC earlier. The distribution of surplus in the life fund among policyholders and shareholders is different for LIC compared to private players. While private companies are allowed to distribute 10% of their surplus to shareholders, LIC has been paying out only 5% to the government with the rest given to shareholders. “IRDAI regulations state that consequent to listing 10% of surplus can be given to shareholders. “But it is unlikely that LIC will suddenly bring down the surplus distribution to 90%,” said Sathe. He suggested that this could be brought down gradually as a prudent measure. Sathe said that to clear the way for an IPO the government has increased the paid-up capital in LIC from Rs 100 crore to Rs 25,000 crore and has allowed the board to be reconstituted where 50% of the directors will be independent with expertise in specific areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/pvt-cos-cant-be-used-as-benchmark-to-value-lic/articleshow/85959772.cms||---

The teachers were honoured by PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary on the occasion of Teachers’ Day at Wheeler Senate House of the university. Former PU VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh was the chief guest. Teachers who were felicitated included former vice-chancellors Jagannath Thakur, Shambhu Nath Guha, Asheshwar Yadav and Sarfe Alam. Altogether 48 teachers received their mementos and citations in person. PU vice-chancellor Chaudhary said a university is known by its teachers and their academic activities, including research. “If the present generation of university teachers take active interest in research and get their work published in national and international journals of repute, there is no reason PU would not be awarded A+ grade by NAAC,” he added. Chief guest Singh also called upon the teachers to work whole-heartedly for ensuring all-round development of the university and restoring its old glory. He suggested the students to take inspiration from the life of President S Radhakrishnan and try to devote their time and energy in academic pursuits. PU pro-VC Ajay Kumar Singh welcomed the guests. A large number of university officials, heads of departments, principals of colleges and teachers attended the function and paid their floral tributes to the portrait of Radhaksihnan.

Education loan institutions are seeing a jump in outbound student enquiries. But banks are not seeing any such spike in their education loan book. According to HDFC Credila MD & CEO Arijit Sanyal, there is a 209% growth in overseas education loan applications in Q1FY22 over the first quarter of the previous year. “The growth is across geographies — the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries,” he said. Last month, the US embassy said that over 55,000 Indian students and exchange visitors are travelling to study in the US this year and it is “an all-time record”. In the UK, a record number of 3,200 students from India have been accepted into university and higher education courses through the country’s centralised application system in 2021, an increase of 19% over the previous year. A fall in lending rates has helped. Rates are down by 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) during FY21, and now start at 9.5% for applications to premier schools overseas. A senior SBI executive described the growth as emergence of pent-up demand. Also, the ticket size for an average overseas education loan has increased to Rs 35 lakh in FY21 as compared to Rs 30 lakh in previous year. Mayank Batheja, co-founder of fintech company Credenc, which has a book size of Rs 150 crore, said, “Demand has more than doubled in recent months. We see more traction from students who want to pursue higher education in the UK, Ireland, the EU and Singapore, as compared to the US. We also see a growing interest in Russia and the Czech Republic for the first time.” However, Germany, Australia and New Zealand have not officially communicated visa and travel guidelines for overseas students. Batheja said, “We are not very clear on how Germany will accept overseas students currently.” International education loan provider Prodigy Finance, which has a $1.5-billion education loan book, sees India as its fastest-growing market with a 60% increase in loans as of August this year. China, Brazil, Pakistan, Mexico and Peru are its other key markets. “There is a 10-15% increase in the average ticket size of loans from Rs 30 lakh, driven by a marginal increase in the tuition fee,” said Mayank Sharma, India head for Prodigy Finance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/surge-in-queries-for-overseas-study-loans/articleshow/85959859.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Meanwhile, Srikalahasti YSRC legislator Biyyapu Madhusudhan Reddy rubbished allegations and said the need of the hour was to reach out to the poor and the needy through welfare schemes. “Besides implementing welfare schemes, the state government is also executing various development works across the state and the BJP-led Union government is aware of this,” the legislator added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-pumping-all-funds-into-welfare-schemes-alleges-bjp/articleshow/85957166.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Patna||Bihar: Death of 5 in a family within 10 days shrouded in mystery||MOTIHARI: Five members of a family, including four children, have died within 10 days in East Champaran district, triggering panic among the villagers at Sirsa, 8km away from the district headquarters town Motihari. Rakesh Prasad, the guardian of the family said on Sunday that Anshu Kumar (11), son of Thag Prasad, died on August 26 while Ravindra Prasad (32) , son of Parshuram Prasad, and Ravindra’s son Priyanshu (10) passed away on September 1. Rakesh’s daughter and son, Munni Kumari (14) and Satyam (4), also died on September 3. The victims first complained of pain in stomach followed by froth in their mouth, before death. The district health officials are still clueless while the villagers are up in arms against the district administration. They blocked the Motihari-Madhubani Ghat road on Saturday. The doctors, who were part of the medical board to conduct autopsy, said there was mysterious reason behind all the deaths. The reason behind their deaths could be ascertained only from the forensic science lab report after sending the viscera for test as no cause was detected in the autopsy, they said. Motihari Sadar PHC in-charge medical officer Shrawan Paswan and district Indian Medical Association chief (IMA) member Dr Ashutosh Sharan said on Sunday that snakebite or some poisonous insect bite could be the reason as the victims complained of stomachache, respiratory failure and froth oozing out of their mouths. Parshuram said the local doctors initially treated them for snakebite, but could not save them. Locals, however, did not rule out black magic as four others in the family have also died this year itself under mysterious circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/death-of-5-in-a-family-within-10-days-shrouded-in-mystery/articleshow/85958752.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: High tech drones to reach out to New Town residents||KOLKATA: The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is operating special drones across the township with speakers fixed on them. This is being done to reach out to all residents living in highrise complexes in New Town to make loudspeaker announcements on different public schemes and services like Covid vaccination, Duare Sarkar and dengue prevention awareness as to when and where these schemes and services are being provided. NKDA officials said they have been making mike announcements on the roads but they were getting feedback that the announcements were not reaching many residents who live inside the large gated communities and highrise complexes. “To reach out to all residents living in highrise complexes, we are using special high tech drone technology. High volume speakers have been installed in the drones and a day-wise schedule has been chalked up as to on which day in which locality the drone will be operated to make the announcements,” an NKDA official said. Officials said they were making the announcements through drones in residential areas and market places mainly on four issues right now - Duare Sarkar, Lakshmir Bhandar, Covid vaccination and generating awareness on following Covid safety protocols and dengue prevention measures. The announcements are both in Bengali and Hindi. Other than making loudspeaker announcements on public awareness, the authorities said the drones could be used for spraying larvacide on the Bagjola and its periphery canals to prevent mosquitos, to keep a watch on roof tops to check if there was any stagnant water accumulation, keeping an eye on bio-mass and waste burning and other issues. The authorities have already set up a drone port in one of its utility buildings in New Town Action Area II with a drone pad above the tank on the fourth floor roof. The set-up has servers, ultra-high speed computers with dual screens and a host of other software and drone accessories. NKDA has already procured three drones and there is a control room to keep monitoring the drones while they are operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-tech-drones-to-reach-out-to-new-town-residents/articleshow/85959231.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The woman lodged a complaint against one Md Kalim, on Saturday, accusing him of sexually assaulting her for over two months after holding her captive from Bhimpur police station area on June 30. The woman, in her complaint, said she was forced to convert her religion during illegal confinement, but somehow came to know about the place she was kept and informed the family members with the help of a neighbour. The woman’s relatives reached the Forbesganj railway station on Saturday with a group of activists and rescued her when Kalim was trying to shift her to another location. The woman, a mother of two, was allegedly kidnapped by Kalim and his accomplices in a car when she had gone to relieve herself in a nearby field around 7pm on June 30. According to the police complaint, the accused stuffed a piece of cloth in the woman’s mouth and also covered her eyes. “When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a solitary room,” she told the police. SHO of Bhimpur police station Subodh Kumar said the accused, who was taken into custody on Saturday, was subsequently produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. “The woman’s medical report is awaited,” he added. Meanwhile, the Chhatapur unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has demanded stern action against the culprits. Mukesh Kumar, a functionary of the organization, alleged that women belonging to a particular community were being targeted by a section of people from another community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/supaul-man-held-on-sexual-assault-charge/articleshow/85958975.cms||Ramashankar

However, the Robusta variety of coffee has not been affected. Bose Mandanna, an experienced coffee grower and former vice-chairman of the Coffee Board in Sunticoppa, said that in different locations in the district, the quantity and timing of rain varied. Nakooru village near Sunticoppa received 40 inches of rain, which is less than the average of 50 inches, whereas Sunticoppa received 70 inches of rain, which is more than the average of 60 inches. The crops in Sunticoppa zone were in a better condition than the crops in Nakuru village. The Arabica coffee growing locations in the district were affected by the hot climate towards the end of June, and in July, though it rained in August. “Though we received rain before June the gap in rain, between the end of June and July, and erratic rain in different places, has created problems for growers. The rain in August is not beneficial, because it causes the coffee yield to drop. However, the robusta coffee crops are doing well this year,” Mandanna said. The average rain this year so far in Kodagu is 84 inches, which is 4 inches more than last year’s record. However, the rain varied in different places, between 40 inches to 200 inches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/erratic-rain-affects-arabica-coffee-pepper-crops-in-kodagu/articleshow/85957488.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Two shot over land dispute near Bihta||PATNA: Two people were killed and another was seriously injured following a land dispute at Kishunpur under Bihta police station area in Patna rural on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. The deceased were identified as Rahul Kumar (30) and Pradip Kumar (28), both residents of Kishunpur. The injured, Ajit Kumar (26), has been admitted to a private nursing home in the state capital. Agitated over the killings, the villagers blocked the Patna-Ara road and disrupted vehicular traffic. The protestors allowed the police to lift the bodies for postmortem only after Patna City SP (West) Ashok Mishra visited the spot at around 11am on Sunday and pacified the mob. Mishra said two suspects, including a woman, have been detained for interrogation. Raids were on to arrest the shooters involved in the crime. A posse of armed forces has been deployed at the village as a precautionary measure, he added. The incident took place at around 1am when the three were sleeping in a makeshift room on a plot of land purchased by Rahul from a co-resident Pramod Mahto recently. The assailants reached there and fired indiscriminately causing grievous injuries to the trio. While Rahul and Pradip died on the spot, Ajit received bullet injury in his head. The assailants escaped after committing the crime. An investigating officer said Rahul had purchased the land from Pramod Mahto a few years ago. Later, the wife of Pramod's brother, Manoj Mahto, demanded her share in the land, leading to a dispute with Rahul. Some locals blamed Sonu Kumar, stated to be the nephew of an MLA, for the crime as he (Sonu) had intervened on behalf of Manoj’s wife. Maner MLA Bhai Virendra had also tried to settle the dispute, but in vain. The police said the incident was meticulously planned. The CCTV camera of a nearby school was also damaged before the incident. Ramesh Singh, father of Rahul, said his son had started fencing the land, which was damaged by the rival group. “After that he decided to stay there at night, which proved fatal for him,” he added. Last month, six people were killed and three others were injured in a land dispute under Chhabilapur police station area in Nalanda district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-shot-over-land-dispute-near-bihta/articleshow/85958642.cms||Ramashankar

Then mask up and maintain safe distance in crowded areas as you will be under the watch from up above. In a bid to ensure that Covid-19 guidelines are followed strictly, the city police have decided to use drones during the Ganesh festivities.  While the cops have been using drones on the day of Ganesh immersions for the last few years, this is the first time that they will be operated for all the 10 days of the festival. “We have given permission to a limited number of Ganesh pandals and asked the organizers to follow Covid norms. But the police need to be on alert too. This year, we have decided to deploy drones, especially in the Walled City,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner.  “During the festival, people will be on the roads and it is not possible to keep an eye on every nook and corner in some areas. The drones will help us monitor the main roads as well as interior lanes. If we spot large crowds gathering at some spot, our team will immediately reach there and urge people to follow Covid norms,” Singh told TOI. Police have been given a high-resolution drone that can be put on auto mode too. This drone has a high-vision camera that can zoom in on faces and hover around for a long time. If a route is fed in its system, this drone moves around on its own and gives live feed of the happenings around. The police said that it also hires several other drones from the local firms. On the day of Ganesh immersion, many drones will be deployed in the old city, the police said.  “We have also formed several teams that will monitor the areas where Ganesh pandals have been installed. People should wear face masks when out in public places and follow Covid protocols,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/drones-to-monitor-ganesh-pandals/articleshow/85957861.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||Visiting Tagore’s VB, working with AR Rahman on wish list: Yohani||Kolkata: When her manager called Yohani up to say that Amitabh Bachchan had shared her song, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’, the singer couldn’t believe it. “I had thought he was pulling a prank on me and I went back to sleep. The next morning, I had many calls and messages from so many people congratulating me. It still feels unreal. I’m humbled by the recognition,” she said in an interview with TOI. A fan of Bachchan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh, Tiger Shroff, Deepika Padukone and Jacqueline Fernandez, Yohani also listens to a lot of music from India. Recently, she has watched the Indian covers of her song, including Anirban Sur’s Bangla folk mash-up. “It feels very new to me. I haven’t had an experience like this before. I am happy to see the cover versions,” she said. Thanking all her Indian admirers, she said, “I can’t wait to perform live for you. I want to make friends and do collaborations with many of you. I also look forward to learning more about the culture and possibly speaking your language too. I love you all.” It is difficult for her to explain how the song broke the language divide to reach so many so fast. “I never think of a strategy or format when doing a song. I purely do it because I like it. When I first heard this song, I liked it,” she said. Yohani said the song’s composer Chamath Sangeeth was a “long-time” friend and they have worked on multiple projects together. During lockdown, Yohani had made a TikTok version of this song. “Chamath called me and said why don’t we do your version of this? I went to the studio and he had invited the video crew too. It was a fun project. We never imagined this would reach this far. Special thanks to Satheeshan, who sings the rap in this version and had also sung the original, lyricist Dulan ARX, who did the original rap, and Pettah Effect and Theewra Teams, who have been behind me from the beginning,” she said. However, her road to success has been challenging. Her father is a retired major general of Sri Lanka. According to her, the early days of growing up were “tough”. “We moved a lot because of the civil war that prevailed in the country. Even though the life was not luxurious, it was privileged,” she said. Both her sister and she had freedom to do whatever they wanted as kids. “My parents pushed us to do new things. They don’t have any music background, but we were drawn to music from a young age. I first got piano lessons and then learned the guitar via youtube. I did a song about my childhood as a tribute to my father titled ‘Rawwath Dasin’. It encompasses my experience as an army kid,” she said. Yohani also plays the ukulele, trumpet and French horn. She holds a bachelor’s degree in logistics and supply chain management and has a first-class master’s degree in professional accounting from Australia. “I didn’t realize how important my passion for music was while I was studying. But once I completed my masters in Australia, I decided to switch from pursuing a corporate life to doing something I love,” Yohani said. Currently, she is recording her upcoming album which has 12 Sri Lankan numbers. There are plans of including a Hindi number too. “I can’t wait to show it to all the new fans. I never did music looking for fame. Even in my debut song, I say ‘No amount of fame will change who I am’. I don’t want it to. I also have a great team behind me who are helping me with everything,” she added. She is hoping to come to India soon. “Our national anthem was written by Ananda Samarakoon. He had come to Visva-Bharati. I have studied Rabindranath Tagore’s work in school but not extensively. I love travelling. So, I’d visit as soon as I get a chance,” she said, adding, “I love doing new things. If I ever get to work with A R Rahman, it would be a dream come true. I’m a big fan of all of his works.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/visiting-tagores-vb-working-with-ar-rahman-on-wish-list-yohani/articleshow/85959878.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Watch-&-report task for New Town walkers||KOLKATA: A section of New Town morning walkers on Sunday was inducted as volunteers and tasked with keeping a watch on the township’s stretches in small groups during the day and call coordinating officers for action the moment they notice something suspicious. Bidhannagar police rolled out the dos and don’ts to the Resistance Group members in New Town who volunteered to help cops in crime prevention and reporting. Though cops thanked them for the initiative, they repeatedly cautioned the volunteers not to intervene during any untoward incident and limit their duty to surveillance and reporting of the crime. “Detection and investigation of crime is our job. We are asking the volunteers to only continue their morning walk sessions every day but in the areas we ask them to and walk in groups. Whenever they see something suspicious, they need to take a photograph of the incident and share the location with the cops on duty. They need not intervene by themselves at any cost,” said New Town DCP Bishop Sarkar at the meeting held near Biswa Bangla gate in presence of 200-odd residents and volunteers at 7am. According to the plan, the volunteers will be divided into three large sections for three different action areas in New Town. Volunteers in each section will be further divided into smaller groups of five or six persons who will walk, exercise or cycle together during the morning vigil. “Volunteers should always move in groups. Moving alone can make them soft targets. The idea is to increase presence and deter criminals from committing offence,” said Sarkar. New Town Kolkata Development Authority chairperson Debasis Sen, who attended the meeting, spoke of the unique problems with New Town that need special solutions. “New Town is a new township with new problems which require new solutions. All of us need to come together to make this a safer place to live in,” said Sen. He added that NKDA will install more CCTV cameras and ensure better illumination of the streets. He had also brought drones and made a presentation about how they can be used to make announcements in case of emergencies. Cops said large uninhabited portions of New Town — many of them still under construction — attract a number of outsiders, which poses a threat to the security at times. The multiple escape routes from New Town also makes the township an easy target for criminals. “The pandemic has made the situation worse with many people resorting to crime to make ends meet. There have been at least two instances where the arrested snatchers have turned out to be carpool drivers operating in Sector V who are now out of jobs,” said Sarkar, who also launched a WhatsApp number — 7478746864 — where residents can text the DCP with photos, locations and brief mention of the problems that need police intervention. Residents and volunteers attending the meeting were enthusiastic about their new responsibilities. “A journey of a thousand miles started today. The Resistance Group was formally launched and all our volunteers are excited to be part of the same and will do our level best to safeguard society along with the cops,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News, the residents’ body that had organized the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/watch-report-task-for-new-town-walkers/articleshow/85959822.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Chief secretary Adityanath Das wrote to the ministry, highlighting the steps being taken by the state to fulfil India’s INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) goals that help achieve high economic growth with lower per capita emissions. The chief secretary, in his letter, said the state government wants to lay a balanced emphasis on economic development and the environment. “The state is determined to promote cost-effective energy efficiency measures in the industrial sector where electricity consumption and carbon emission are high,” said Adityanath Das. The Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) has conducted a detailed audit in three MSME clusters of fisheries in Bhimavaram, foundry units in Vijayawada and refractory units in East Godavari district as a pilot project with the financial support from Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). It has been identified that the MSME sector holds immense potential in fostering energy efficiency and upgradation of technologies. The state government has decided to implement energy efficiency in fisheries, refractory and foundry clusters across the state in the first phase and requested financial assistance from the Union ministry of power through BEE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-seeks-central-aid-to-take-up-energy-efficiency-projects/articleshow/85956733.cms||---

The private bank currently holds just below 52% in the non-life company. The approval to reduce promoter stake was conveyed to the bank, while approving the scheme of demerger of the general insurance business of Bharti Axa, which was acquired by ICICI Lombard last year through a scheme of arrangement. The scheme will result in the merger of Bharati Axa General Insurance with ICICI Lombard. Last year, ICICI Lombard had signed a deal to purchase Bharti Axa, as part of which Bharti Axa shareholders will receive two shares of ICICI Lombard for every 115 shares held by them. Last month, a senior finance ministry official said that the Indian insurance industry is moving from being a promoter-led to a market-led one with the capital markets becoming a dominant source of capital for the companies. The RBI too has been asking lenders to bring down their stake in insurance companies below 50%. In May 2021, HDFC sold overe 44 lakh shares in HDFC Ergo to bring down its stake below 50% and comply with RBI norms. Approving the reduction in stake, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) said that the private insurer must ensure that its solvency margin ratio should remain above control level at all times. Also ICICI Bank is required to infuse capital to meet business growth or solvency in proportion to shareholding after merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-bank-gets-irdai-nod-to-cut-stake-in-non-life-arm-to-30/articleshow/85959729.cms||---
---||Kolkata||South Kolkata club takes to 22 yards to strengthen ties with Afghan traders in city||KOLKATA: Twelve Afghan youths met their opponents across 22 yards at Dhakuria on Sunday morning. The hosts were amateur cricketers of Dhakuria Tarun Dal, a club that is into social welfare activities. The idea was to start a bond over a match and sow seeds of hope for a better tomorrow. The game ended with winning hosts tying rakhis on the wrists of their guests. The Afghan team comprised traders who meet at Maidan every weekend to play cricket. Some members of the club, who are regulars at Maidan, had been noticing them, so, when trouble started in Afghanistan, the idea of a cricket match struck them as a way to celebrate Indo-Afghan friendship. “Most have left their families behind and are worried. We wanted to stand by them. Let political decisions sort themselves out. We, as common people, should stand by these innocent people from the strife-torn land,” said club spokesperson Srikumar Ghosh. On Sunday, the flags of the two countries were hoisted and national anthems were sung before the match started. Afghanistan was led by Rashid Khan while the local side was captained by Rahul Nath. Afghanistan lost all wickets in the eighth over and managed to score 69, while the hosts met the target in six overs and four balls with a loss of just one wicket. Batsman Amir Khan was the highest scorer with 33 runs while Rahul Nath scored 22, the highest contribution on the Indian side. “However, we broke tradition and declared Amir Khan the man of the match, though the Afghan side lost. The idea was to forge a union and competition took a back seat,” Ghosh said. The club had tied up with All India Pakhtoon Jigra-e-Hind, led by Yasmin Nigar Khan, the great grand-daughter of Frontier Gandhi, to get the Afghans to agree to play the match. “They are worried about the safety of their families and were in no mood to lighten up. However, they finally agreed. The match and the love the local people showed the team have overwhelmed them,” Yasmin said. “For generations, Kolkata has been our second home. We are grateful to the club for this respite. We hope this will send out the right message,” said Rashid Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/south-kolkata-club-takes-to-22-yards-to-strengthen-ties-with-afghan-traders-in-city/articleshow/85959905.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The new recruitment process is aligned with its vision for the permanent campus, to move towards specialisations in management programmes, and to offer sector-specific training programmes. IIM-V director, Prof Chandrasekhar, said the institute currently has 32 faculty on rolls with a best student-faculty ratio among the seven new-age IIMs. “The institute is getting several enquiries for the training programmes from reputed public sector banks, PSUs and other organisations. To meet the demand, the institute has started the faculty recruitment process in specialisations in management areas like applied econometrics, micro-economics, fintech, product and brand management, investment banking, inventory management, etc. Considering the agrarian economy of Andhra Pradesh, agriculture and water resources will also be a focus area in recruitment,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. Meanwhile, the permanent campus of the business school is fast shaping up in Gambheeram and is expected to be ready by the next academic year. Prof Chandrasekhar said the hostels at the permanent campus can accommodate 300 students per batch. “This will give a scope for the institute to increase its annual intake. New management disciplines are evolving with the changing business environment and technology-enabled innovations. IIM-V also wants to diversify its offerings—both in terms of academic programmes and training programmes,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. The IIM-V director added that the institute may hire about eight to 10 new faculty in emerging areas in this recruitment. “IIM-V also wants to harness expertise in areas like health and nutrition, considering the recent experiences with the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-initiates-fresh-faculty-recruitment/articleshow/85956951.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The associations alleged that the state government is trying to create obstructions only for Hindu festivals. The state government has prohibited Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in public places following warnings from the health department about a possible outbreak of the third wave of Covid-19. The Hindu Yuva Shakti (HYS) has appealed to the government to revise its decision and permit celebrations with restrictions. “YSR’s death anniversary was celebrated with huge gatherings, government schemes are launched with huge crowds, Muharram is celebrated in public. No restrictions were imposed for the above events and festivals. Why does this government only prohibit Ganesh Chaturthi even though the Covid-19 situation is under control across the state. The government should impose restrictions and permit pandals with nominal crowds,” said Chikkala Rajanikanth, state president of HYS. BJP state president Somu Verraju has demanded the government permit Ganesh pandals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-urged-to-withdraw-curbs-on-ganesh-festival/articleshow/85957060.cms||Venu Lanka

Posing as Anayasingh, Mankar had weaved younger sister’s kidnapping story and convinced the doctor to visit Yavatmal and hand over Rs2 crore in cash to be paid as ransom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/yavatmal-honeytrap-accused-sent-in-pcr/articleshow/85959178.cms||---
---||Mumbai||With surge, Mumbai back in Maharashtra’s top 5 on active Covid cases||MUMBAI: With a surge in Covid-19 detections in the last few days, the city is back among the top five districts in the state on the parameter of active cases. Covid cases in Mumbai had stabilised between 200 and 300 in the first three weeks of August, making the city slip to the seventh rank. Now, the weekly positivity rate of the state too has reported a rise: 2.71% as of the week ending on September 4 against 2.58% during the last week of August. “There has been a slight increase in active cases in the state in the last 10 days,” said additional chief secretary of the health department, Dr Pradeep Vyas, in a presentation at Majha Doctor — a virtual medical conference on Covid-19 management in the state. Data presented in the meeting shows that the top five districts account for nearly 72% of the state’s total active cases. Pune accounts for nearly 30% of the load, followed by Thane (14%), Satara (12%), Ahmednagar (10%), and Mumbai (8%). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who addressed the conference, once again appealed to the public as well as political parties to avoid crowding or any activity that puts lives at risk. “We have augmented the health infrastructure but there is a limitation to oxygen production and its availability,” said Thackeray. “Even today, we are using 150 metric tons daily for non-Covid patients and 200 metric tons for Covid patients,” he said. He criticised the opposition which has been holding agitations seeking a reopening of places of worship. “There are a few people who want us to reopen everything… temples. But, we don't want to be in a situation where everything has to be shut down once again. Let us keep in mind that we don’t put the lives of the public in our politics,” the CM said. Eight districts in the state have reported a higher weekly positivity rate than the state's average. These are Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Osmanabad, and Nashik. “These are districts of concern. Also, the Ganpati festival is celebrated in a big way in these districts and so we need to be on our guard,” said Vyas. He said there was a drop in testing in some districts. “Testing needs to be increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-surge-mumbai-back-in-states-top-5-on-active-cases/articleshow/85962939.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Bad weather, landslides spell doom for hotels||NAINITAL: Owners of several hotels, homestays and trekking agencies in Uttarakhand, who were already reeling under heavy economic losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, say that bad weather conditions, frequent landslides and panic among people due to such occurrences over the last few weeks, have dealt a body blow to the tourism sector in Uttarakhand, leading to many tourism ventures being on the verge of closure. Speaking to TOI, Pramod Kumar, a hotel owner in Mukteshwar near Nainital, said that tourist numbers in hill stations were “very good till the first week of August but since then, numerous landslides in and around Nainital have scared away people.” “We have only seen cancellations since the past few weeks. The situation was expected to improve this week but now, schools in Delhi-NCR have opened up and not many families are willing to travel,” Kumar said. Munesh Bhatt, owner of a homestay in Joshimath in the Garhwal hills, who organises treks to the Valley of Flowers and other spots, alleged that for several weeks now, he has not received a single query from tourists. “Monsoons are anyway lean season for us but people do come to visit the Valley of Flowers in August since it is the blooming period for most of the flowers. However, visuals of landslides on Char Dham Yatra routes have scared tourists and even we tell them not to travel if there is forecast of rain,” he added. Similar concerns were echoed by those in the tourism industry in places like Munsyari, Uttarkashi, Kausani, Khirsu and Lansdowne. In Musnsyari’s Sarmoli village, Beena Devi, who runs a homestay, said that after the Covid months of April to July, they were finally hoping to get some tourists but the road to Munsyari collapsed a few days ago and the area was cut off. “No one wants to travel in these conditions. The road is prone to landslides and tourists are scared,” she said. Amongst the gloom though, a glimmer of hope lingers. “We are hoping that bookings will pick up in September and are praying that Covid cases do not escalate. Many of us have invested lakhs of rupees in our ventures and if there are any more bottlenecks, we will have no other option but to close down,” said Naveen Rana, a hotelier from Lansdowne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-covid-bad-weather-landslides-spell-doom-for-hotels-homestays-in-hills/articleshow/85956916.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||Natpac survey to start next week||Kochi: A survey as part of the feasibility study about extending the service of mofussil buses from Vypeen side to Kochi city, will start next week by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac). The survey is aimed at collecting the opinion of passengers and motorists from the island, their origin and destination, bus operators in Vypeen and the city, and the police. It will also check whether the mofussil buses from the island side can be parked in some of the existing bus stands in the city. The survey will look into the most common destination of islanders to know where to extend the services “We will conduct an OD (origin and destination) survey among passengers from Vypeen side. Two-wheeler and car passengers will also be included in the survey as they constitute majority of the vehicle traffic on Goshree bridges. They do not prefer buses as they have to get down at High Court Junction and board another bus to reach destination. If the buses ply up to Metro station, they would have utilized Metro services,” said S Shaheem, principal scientist conducting the study. If the buses are plying on long distance on the Vypeen route, the services of these will be extended to Vyttila. Otherwise, it will be till Kaloor. While some private operators from Vypeen voiced reservations, others are in favour of extending the service. The study team will have to look into whether the extension of service will create any traffic congestion as claimed by the operators of city buses and police. The major problem hindering the extension of service to the city is that two roads — Shanmugham Road and Banerjee Road — are currently nationalized routes, where service of mofussil buses are not allowed and there are limitations on number of city services too. Mofussil bus services also cannot convert into city service. Natpac will look into the legal aspect of all the challenges arising. Natpac is also collecting data on the number of mofussil buses operating to High Court Junction via Vypeen from North Paravoor and other areas. The extension of service of mofussil buses to the city is a long-standing demand of islanders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/natpac-survey-to-start-next-week/articleshow/85959211.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie: Kempty Falls reopened day after heavy rains force evacuation of tourists, shopkeepers||MUSSOORIE: Heavy rains on Saturday caused an increase in the flow of water at Kempty Falls, prompting police to evacuate nearly 200 tourists and 20 shopkeepers from near the waterfall. The waterfall, a popular tourist destination, reopened on Sunday after remaining off-limits for visitors on Saturday. Mussoorie and adjoining areas were lashed by very heavy rains on Saturday morning, resulting in the sudden increase in the flow of water at the waterfall, which sees heavy visitor footfall. "The flow of water increased suddenly in the afternoon on Saturday. Fearing for the safety of tourists and shopkeepers, nearly 50 tourists, who were near the waterfall and around 20 shopkeepers of the area were relocated while about 150 tourists waiting nearby were also shifted,” said Naveen Jural, station officer of Kempty. The further entry of tourists was prohibited on Saturday and police personnel were deployed in the area, Jural said, adding that on Sunday, the waterfall was opened for tourists since the water level had gone down. To recall, after heavy rains on July 12, the entry of tourists at the waterfall was prohibited for several days while on August 29, a tourist from UP had slipped and drowned in the waterfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kempty-falls-reopened-day-after-heavy-rains-force-evacuation-of-tourists-shopkeepers/articleshow/85956956.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan guard rails||Dwaipayan.Ghosh Kolkata: Lalbazar has ruled out removing guard rails across the city, whether in the morning or at night, calling it a necessary tool and ruling out complaints that these were a hindrance for motorists and bikers, especially at night, when most of them do not even have blinkers that makes it visible from a distance. In reply to an online query on the actual usage of guard rails, Lalbazar stated that "placement of guard rails is a professional decision taken case to case by each traffic guard factoring in demands and requirements of both pedestrians and motorists. Inputs are appreciated and worked on without having a prejudiced notion about the utility of any such placement, the cops claimed." The reply was shared on the Kolkata traffic Police Twitter page. The reply was in response to a tweet on this page by motorist Sujoy Deb Burman who questioned the "unplanned and illogical placement of guardrails along major arterial thoroughfares of the city." Lalbazar said that on roads - where there are narrow link roads opening on to bigger ones like APC Road, AJC Bose road, SP Mukherjee road or the Kasba Connector, these guard rails help to control speed right before the crossing at night. Guardrails that are placed for night checks are usually removed by the morning. Senior police officers at Lalbazar said that at some places, especially near busy intersections, they were not removed in the morning because they also served the purpose of streamlining vehicle movement. "We had some issues about removing them by morning. The civic volunteers and home guards have been assigned beats to complete the work as quickly as possible," claimed an officer at Lalbazar. Lalbazar has also instructed all guards to ensure that all guard rails that are used on the main roads of the city have compulsory reflectors on them. Sources said that all officers on rounds during night patrolling have been asked to check on the same and submit compliance reports. Police said that it will be the prerogative of the 25 guards to replace the yellow tape on the guard rails if they are worn out or are not visible from a distance. "The idea is to finally replace them with solar blinkers. 95 percent of guardrails on main roads have retro-fitted reflectors. those on the Bypass and its connectors - and the Basanti highway where visibility is an issue - are already getting solar blinkers," said an officer. However, most motorists cite the example of a biker who knocked down a pedestrian and then fell off the vehicle after failing to negotiate through the space between a guardrail and a bus on the Prince Anwar Shah Road-EM Bypass connector last July to point to the futility of the exercise. They also cite another example recently on AJC Bose Road where a bike rider Simanta Ghosh had to spend several days at hospital to question the very need of the guard rail. "It is a sheer nuisance on roads. If you use guard rails, have flashers, proper reflectors. And it does not slow down bikers or those who want to speed, they take the extreme left or right lane and speed right through crossings. It is always safer to drive in the middle lane because if someone suddenly enters from left or right, you have reaction time whereas when one is on the extreme lane, that one is forced to due to the placement of guardrails in the middle at night, there is zero reaction time when someone from a lane on a bike or cycle or even a car flouts a signal and comes right in front,' complained one of them adding the guard rail cannot replace a signal. "What is a signal for if one needs a guardrail?" asked another motorist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-guard-rails/articleshow/85959331.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Music, food & fun: Kashi-Chunar cruiseride on Ganga off to a flying start||Varanasi: The chants of Har Har Mahadev (Hail Lord Shiva) reverberated in the air on Sunday as the luxury vessel, Alaknanda cruise, started its maiden ride from Ravidas Ghat in Varanasi to Chunar Fort in Mirzapur, and back. Excited passengers climbed atop the upper decks where they clicked selfies and made videos to make the moment memorable. A live band kept passengers entertained all through the ride. Some of them even got up to dance too. At least 200 passengers took the first ride. The service, initiated by UP tourism department to promote waterways tourism in the state, provides an eight-hour two-way ride on the Ganga from Varanasi to Chunar Fort. The 55 meter-long, twin engine vessel cruise was flagged off by Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal in the presence of Vivek Malaviya, Vikas Malaviya, Jayant Malaviya and Manish Poddar, the directors of Alaknanda Cruiseline, the startup managing the cruise. Congratulating the team, Agarwal said, “This is a novel venture and we are sure that tourists will find the service attractive. A lot of hard work has gone into the initiative and we hope it will give a boost to tourism in the state.” Alaknanda Cruiseline has been running cruise services on the Ganga in Varanasi for the last two years. Vikas Malaviya, one of the directors, said: “We have been getting a good response which encouraged us to manage this tour too. We are grateful to the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath for reposing faith in our capabilities and entrusting us this huge responsibility.” During the ride, the passengers were served vegetarian breakfast, lunch, tea and heavy snacks. After two hours of sailing, the cruise made a brief halt at Shool Tankeshwar Temple, situated 15km from Varanasi. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and folklore suggests that this is the spot where the Ganga entered the holy city (Uttarayani) on the command of Lord Shiva. People believe that the temple is located at the spot where Lord Shiva had put his trishul (trident). In Chunar, divisional commissioner of Mirzapur, Yogeshwar Ram Mishra, also came onboard for some time. Impressed with the vessel and the facilities, he said that he would take the ride soon. Lata Khatri, an octogenarian, who travelled all the way from Delhi to take the maiden ride, said: “I came to know about this cruise from my family and I didn’t want to miss it. I belong to Varanasi and a thing like an air-conditioned cruise in the city is nothing short of a marvel to me.” RP Chaturvedi, a Varanasi-based doctor, said: “I have seen cruise service abroad, and in Goa, but such a facility in Varanasi instils a feeling of pride. I had expected a boat but this vessel is huge and will be a new experience for the people of Varanasi.” “We read about it in the newspapers and had planned to make a booking in July itself when it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Although we had thought it would be a temple hopping ride, we went to just one temple. Overall, it has been a fun ride,” said Rakhi, who was part of a group on the cruise which danced to the songs presented by the music band.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/music-food-fun-kashi-chunar-cruiseride-on-ganga-off-to-a-flying-start/articleshow/85961495.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Spatial planning for 27 gram panchayats with census towns||Thiruvananthapuram: Spatial plans will be formulated soon for census towns included partially or fully within 27 grama panchayats in the district. In total, the chief town planner has submitted the list of 323 grama panchayats across the state within which census towns have been included as urban areas for spatial plan formulation. Master plans, zoning regulations and town planning have till now been done for the city corporation and four urban local bodies in the district. The draft master plan of the city corporation for 2040 is awaiting discussion in the corporation council. As per the recent amendment of the Town and Country Planning Act, census towns within grama panchayats which show urban characteristics have been identified for spatial planning. The act also incorporated the scope for spatial planning. The local self-government department (LSGD) recently issued an order for mapping of census towns which states there is a need to prioritise gram panchayats which can be considered for thematic sectoral plans which have been proposed within the ambit of the ‘rebuild Kerala’ initiative. Spatial plans are being promoted as a strong tool for dealing with climate change, better preparatory mechanisms for disaster management and thereby reducing the impact on people affected by calamities, the order said. Officials said the Town and Country Planning Act gives the provision for preparing plans for gram panchayats, however, it has not been implemented yet. “At present grama panchayats with census towns showing urban nature have been mapped. Spatial plans will be prepared in a phased manner and priority will be fixed based on density of population in each panchayat,” said a senior town planning official associated with the project. According to the government order issued in this regard, the grama panchayats have been identified as census towns since these local bodies are likely to be population hubs on their own and showing characteristics of urban activity. This means that such panchayats have to be considered as urban areas for spatial plan formulation. The government recently authorised the chief town planner to map the census towns to such panchayats which fall wholly or partly within them. The census towns satisfy a threefold urban criteria relating to population, density and main working force engaged in non-agricultural activities. These include a minimum population of 5,000; at least 75 per cent of the male main working population engaged in non- agricultural pursuits and a density of population of at least 400 persons per sq. km. As per the 2011 census, six districts have urban population above 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spatial-planning-for-27-gram-panchayats-with-census-towns/articleshow/85959263.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Random lights signal chaos for traffic||AHMEDABAD: On a busy Monday morning, while you are calibrated to run on the rush hour mode, it appears that the traffic lights are against you. The light at junction after junction flashes red. Your plight, shared by all Amdavadi commuters, is not karma but the result of the lack of calibration of traffic lights. Cycle length is the time in seconds that it takes a signal to complete one full sweep of indications for all sides. DCP traffic Tejas Patel admitted that the calibration of cycle lengths of various junctions in the city are yet to be done and that an analysis is underway. While police are on the job, an insightful study by three researchers studied five junctions on the 2.5km Nehrunagar Crossroads to Vijay Crossroads stretch. That is one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city. The study found that the green-time and the red-time either differed between junctions, or differed within the same junction. The study was carried out by Maryam Kaveshgar, Nishant Patel, and Parishi Naik of the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Ahmedabad University in collaboration with the city traffic police. The study found that if Nehrunagar Crossroads had green-time of 50 seconds and red-time of 159 seconds for each of the four directions, the cycle lengths differed greatly when one reached Sahjanand Crossroads. The green-time at Sahjanand Crossroads hovers between 20-25 seconds and 40 seconds for various directions, while the red-time ranges between 74 seconds and 89-94 seconds. By the time one reaches Vijay Crossroads, the red-time goes as high as 122 seconds while the green-time varies between 15 seconds and 42 seconds. The researchers spent hours measuring traffic flow at the junctions and even applied mathematical models such as the Webster’s algorithm and drew a time-space diagram based on the Kell method. The study found that the speed of vehicles past these junctions can significantly improve if each traffic cycle operates for 45 seconds. The average speed of vehicles increases from a little above 15 kmph to above 25 kmph. If one follows the Indian Road Congress Guidelines of traffic cycle lengths of 80 seconds and 90 seconds, one can see a 5 kmph speed increase in vehicles above the existing 12 kmph. While elaborating on their study, the researchers said that optimizing the traffic cycle length will “improve various traffic parameters such as queue length, travel time, delay, fuel consumption, occupancy rate, and pollution.” The researchers said: “We believe that this study is an important step towards the enhancement and increase in efficiency on busy central roads, which will help improve traffic conditions and therefore reduce economic wastage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/random-lights-signal-chaos-for-traffic/articleshow/85959268.cms||Paul John
---||Dehradun||Gang hacks banks' ATMs, withdraws lakhs||Dehradun: A gang of cybercriminals swindled a public sector bank of lakhs by cheating it twice — by withdrawing cash from its ATMs using cloned debit cards and then claiming a “reversal” of money — with 300 fake “failed” transactions in 10 days at Rishikesh. On February 28 this year, the bank started receiving more “failed transaction” complaints than usual. RBI guidelines state that banks have to re-credit a customer’s account within five days of a failed transaction. So, the complaints were processed fast but the bank started its own investigation. “On the basis of what they found, they filed a complaint and we lodged an FIR … We are now investigating how much money was fraudulently withdrawn this way,” Rishikesh SHO Shishupal Negi told TOI. What is believed to be a group of cybercriminals started out by cloning debit cards they could use to withdraw money. “The ATMs used by the frauds were all made by the same Japanese company. It is possible that they knew how to tamper with these specific machines,” a cop said. The members would then approach the bank’s complaint management system, claiming that the ATM never dispensed cash. They would get the money “back”. But they did leave behind some traces. The bank officials, while investigating, found evidence in the electronic journal. An electronic journal is the ATM’s own record, telling the bank what it did. Banks reconcile these records regularly, because of which they can reverse failed transactions even when there is no complaint. In this case, the bank found irregularities in the log. The fact that over 300 complaints had come in from just one town also made them suspicious. Then, they went over CCTV footage of ATMs to check if money had not been dispensed, as had been claimed by the frauds. After nearly six months of investigation, with digital evidence of the fraud, they filed a complaint, cops said. Bank officials declined to comment on the case. Negi said, “Similar cases are being reported from Ranipokhri, Muni Ki Reti and Laxman Jhula.” Police are trying to identify the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gang-hacks-banks-atms-withdraws-lakhs/articleshow/85956988.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Suraj alias Sudhi, son of Sunil Kumar and Molly of Surya Bhavan at Paravilakom near Ayiroorpara outside the city, is the deceased. The tragedy struck when he was returning home after dropping his wife Midhuna at a nursing institute at Thiruvallam, where she studies. The police said that the accident occurred around 9am. As per eyewitness accounts, Suraj was knocked down by a speeding car, a Hyundai Creta, from behind while trying to overtake him. Though he was taken to hospital, his life could not be saved. There were four men in the car, one of them fled the scene after the accident. Local people apprehended them suspecting that they were under the influence of alcohol, and handed them over to the police. The driver of the car, identified as Brown, 52, of Varkala was arrested on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Relevant sections for drunken driving and dangerous driving under Motor Vehicles Act were also invoked. The police have also collected the blood sample of the driver and sent it for test to confirm whether he was under indeed drunk. The police said that Suraj, who worked as a driver, got married two years ago. The car that caused the accident was going from Kovalam to Varkala. The police have also confiscated the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-killed-as-car-rams-scooter/articleshow/85959289.cms||---
---||Mumbai||At 495, Mumbai’s new Covid cases rise to 52-day high||MUMBAI: Covid-19 cases in Mumbai rose to a 52-day high, but the state reported a dip in new detections overall. The state reported 4,057 cases and 67 deaths, taking the total case tally to 64.86 lakh and toll to 1,37,774. Mumbai reported 495 cases on Sunday, the highest since July 15 (528) and two deaths. With this, total cases in the city rose to 7.46 lakh and deaths to 15,993. Active cases in the state dropped to 50,095 from over 52,000 on Saturday, while Mumbai's active cases rose to 4,003 from 3,561 a day ago.  Among existing Covid patients, 52% are in home isolation or in Covid care centres as they have little to no symptoms; 48% patients are in hospitals of which 16.7% are on oxygen support and nearly 7% in ICU. State officials as well as members of the state task force have said that testing numbers must be increased. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday that it is in people’s hand to invite a third wave or prevent it. He said that although cases have dropped in the state, we cannot let our guard down. “We cannot let the pandemic become endemic. We have to completely defeat it, "said Thackeray. He claimed that perhaps Maharashtra is the only state which has upgraded its health infrastructure to tackle the pandemic “like no other country has done”. Health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state has the capacity to perform 3 lakh tests a day and more than 2.5 lakh tests have been done on several days. “However, testing has started to drop from the end of August, partly because fewer cases are being detected and hence there are fewer contacts to be tested,” he said. Officials said that with cases rising in districts where the Ganpati festival is celebrated in a big way, it is required that district administrations do not let their guard down. “We have empowered the district administration to undertake local restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-495-mumbai-city-new-covid-cases-rise-to-52-day-high/articleshow/85962960.cms||Bhavika Jain

Rahul Singh, 33, was the centre head of Adroit Synergies Private Limited in Noida. Bhanu Murti, also 33, was a manager there. They, along with seven others, were on a weekend trip to Rishikesh. “The group reached Rishikesh on Sunday morning and checked into a hotel at Tapovan. They were walking towards the main city when the accident occurred near Ram Jhula,” said inspector Kamal Mohan Singh Bhandari, in charge of the Muni Ki Reti police station. “Rahul entered the river to wash his hands. He lost his balance, slipped and fell into the river. As he was washed away, Bhanu jumped in to rescue him. He, too, was swept away by the strong current,” Sunil Kumar, their colleague who was also on the trip with them, told TOI. “Neither knew how to swim.” Rahul was from Bulandshahr and had been living in Noida with his wife and two children. Bhanu was from Delhi. The group members reached the police station and reported the case. A team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) was dispatched with motor rafts to look for the missing people. “The search operation was on till Sunday evening,” an SDRF official said. “The water level of the Ganga has been near the danger mark with strong currents because of the rainy season, making it very dangerous for anyone to venture into the water.” Last month, three students from Mumbai had drowned while bathing in the Ganga at Haridwar — one of them waded deep into the water and slipped, the two others swam towards her to help her and all of them died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/noida-bpo-centre-head-washed-away-by-ganga-manager-dies-trying-to-rescue/articleshow/85957020.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Lucknow||Now, plan 2nd Metro corridor for Lucknow: Union minister Durga Shankar Mishra||LUCKNOW: On the fourth anniversary of the operations of Lucknow Metro, secretary, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, Durga Shankar Mishra, urged the state government to consider construction of second Metro corridor in the city to improve mobility. “We should focus on multi-modal integration of transportation along with last-mile connectivity to make metro service more comfortable and convenient for people. Ease of living is the only objective of all the plans and policies of the central government,” said Mishra, who is also the chairman of the UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC). “While serving people, our prime focus should be on making Metro the preferred mode of travel. Kanpur Metro will help in decongestion and bring down pollution level which will bring back the glory of the industrial city. To improve mobility in Lucknow, which is evolving rapidly, I have urged the state government to consider construction of the second (east-west) corridor in the city.” The detailed project report of the second corridor was prepared by Rail India Technical and Economic Service Limited (RITES) around 2011 but it never saw the light of the day. The east-west corridor is expected to have 11 stations connecting Vasant Kunj to Charbagh via heavily congested Old Lucknow areas. UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said, “We have urged the central government for a better financial model for the Metro project along with better terms and conditions.” “Lucknow Metro has achieved a new benchmark in punctuality, safety, comfort and passenger service. The DPR of Gorakhpur Metrolite has already been approved by the state government and has been sent to public investment board (PIB) for approval. Many other cities, like Varanasi, will soon benefit from Metro,” he added. By next year, Kanpur Metro priority corridor is expected to start commercial operations, while construction work of Agra Metro is underway. Since the first day (September 5, 2017) of commercial operations on the priority corridor, the Lucknow Metro has ferried 3.35 crore commuters in over 1,200 days of operation covering 62 lakh km distance. The operation on the entire 23km long north-south corridor – Munshipullia to Amausi airport (22 stations) started from March 8, 2019. Development of the entire project cost the exchequer nearly 200 million euros (Rs 6,900 crore) which was taken as loan from EIB (European Investment Bank).

---||Nagpur||Hospitals ink pact with crowdfunding platform to help needy patients||NAGPUR: A trust which runs four hospitals – two each in Nagpur and Wardha — has raised over Rs22 lakh for three of its needy patients through three campaigns started by a crowdfunding agency. The success of the campaigns led to a first of its kind arrangement in which Meghe Group of Hospitals signed an MoU with a fundraising platform, Ketto.org, to initiate crowdfunding for its needy patients. The four hospitals — Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital and Shalinitai Super Speciality Centre, both at Wardha, and Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre and Nelson Hospital in Nagpur, will now have a kiosk manned by Ketto.org representatives for initiating medical crowdfunding. The group chief executive officer, Dr Sandeep Shrivastava, said that emergency cases won’t be delayed and patients would receive complete treatment even as the crowdfunding campaign goes on. He said that several critical procedures, including organ transplantation or neuro surgeries, are not covered or have limitation under government schemes. “In such a situation, patients struggle to arrange funds and some are forced to move out to government hospitals,” he said. A month-old baby with brain enlargement got the help of Rs5.74 lakh while Rs2.74lakh have so far been raised for a two-month-old baby. “Both the patients were helped by another crowdfunding agency, Milaap, though we don’t have any tie up with them. Now, we will start with Ketto,” said Dr Shrivastava. Dr Shrivastava said that last year informal crowdfunding had helped raise Rs14lakh for a 17-year-old boy. The boy had complete paralysis and his family couldn’t afford the costly treatment. A press release issued by the group said that the company is closely working with hospitals, NGOs and individuals to bring positive change in the community. Currently, Ketto campaigns are raising over Rs300 crore per year for various causes, it read. “With about 80% of the population without any form of health insurance and 63% out-of-pocket medical expenses, most families spend all their savings and borrow money at high interest rates to cover the medical expenses. Medical crowdfunding is an alternative option for those who urgently need money. Crowdfunding platform Ketto has launched more than one million fundraisers for medical campaigns since its inception, raising more than $600 million,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-ink-pact-with-crowdfunding-platform-to-help-needy-patients/articleshow/85961222.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Ruckus at VSSC after nokkukooli demand||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Dramatic scenes were witnessed outside Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre’s (VSSC) gate at South Thumba when a section of trade union members and local residents blocked the movement of trailer transporting massive cargo to the VSSC demanding ‘nokkukooli’, following which the movement of the vehicle was delayed for more than two hours. The consultant of the logistics firm that was transporting the cargo took a stance refusing the demand for nokkukooli. According to police, the trailer was blocked by the members of an unaccredited trade union that functioned at the South Thumba gate of VSSC around 11 am. When the officials refused to pay the nokkukooli more local residents gathered disregarding lockdown restrictions in effect on Sunday. Following this, more police personnel were summoned to the spot to bring the situation under control. Rajeswari S Pillai, the consultant of Express Global Logistics Private Limited, the firm that was transporting the cargo, said no man power or even external machinery was needed to unload the cargo. The cargo consisted of two settling chambers of a trisonic wind tunnel project Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station at the VSSC. One chamber weighed 128 tonnes while the other weighed 28 tonnes which were being transported in a high axle trailer. The chambers could be installed to the wind tunnel by lowering the axle. ''The police and the government officials were of great help,'' Rajeswari S Pillai said. When the situation got worse she contacted the Chief Minister's office. Soon she was contacted by the labour minister's office and the district labour officer visited the spot and held talks with the agitators. After over two hours, the agitators dispersed and allowed the trailer to pass through. The cargo was supposed to enter through the Canal Gate of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. But, since a small bridge located there was not strong enough to carry the weight of the cargo, the route was changed via the South Thumba gate of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The police have registered a case against over 50 people for causing obstruction in public space and rioting. Charges under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance were also invoked against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ruckus-at-vssc-after-nokkukooli-demand/articleshow/85959310.cms||---

However, the composition of the about 200ml green liquid found in his abdomen is till not confirmed and sample of the same has been sent to the central forensic laboratory in Bangalore. The current postmortem report and forensic report did not find any injury to Mirza’s private parts, so the theory of applying epoxy adhesive, and that causing death could not be confirmed. “We have availed the first forensic report of Salman Mirza who died on June 25 in mysterious circumstances. But we haven’t yet been able to ascertain the exact cause of his death,” said a police officer. Several witnesses said that Mirza along with his former fiancee, both of whom were addicted to drugs, had gone to a hotel. There, they applied an epoxy adhesive on his private parts to substitute for a condom. “The two had reportedly gone to the hotel with another woman in an autorickshaw on June 22. We checked CCTV footage and found Mirza and his girlfriend entering the hotel. He was found unconscious the next day,” said a police officer. The officer said that using the adhesive on private parts worsened Mirza’s health condition and he died of complications, including multiple organ failure. Mirza was found unconscious in the shrubs near Amber Tower on June 23. His acquaintance, Firoz Shaikh, found him and brought him home. Mirza’s condition deteriorated and he was taken to Sola Civil Hospital where he died. Mirza’s younger sister Heena claimed that her brother’s former fiancee had conspired and killed him, but cops did not taken any stern action against her even after three months have passed. “My brother broke his engagement with her as he found her talking to some other man when she was about to marry my brother. She took revenge by applying adhesive on his private parts which took his life,” said Heena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adhesive-case-no-drugs-in-body-mystery-deepens/articleshow/85959303.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The scheme, which was notified on February 24 this year, has received 36 applications, of which three are being rejected, according to a source. The winners — who would be notified soon — have committed Rs 3,455 crore as proposed investments. Of the ‘global’ companies that have applied, seven out of the eight applicants have made the cut and these are Taiwanese Foxconn (proposed investment Rs 208 crore), Rising Stars Hi-Tech (Rs 125 crore), Finnish Nokia Solutions (Rs 125 crore), American makers Flextronics (Rs 102 crore), Jabil Circuit (Rs 176 crore), CommScope (Rs 209 crore), and Sanmina-SCI (Rs 110 crore), sources told TOI. On the domestic side, 26 companies have made the cut, nine large ones, and 17 in the MSME category. The Indian companies include Akashastha Technologies (proposed investment Rs 593 crore), VVDN Technologies (Rs 400 crore), Neolync Tele Communications (Rs 188 crore), Dixon Electro Appliances (180 crore), ITI (Rs 120 crore), Tejas Networks (111 crore), GDN Enterprises (Rs 46 crore) and STL Networks (Rs 49 crore). The application of Sterlite Technologies, filed under the ‘global’ companies category, is being rejected for falling short of the minimum threshold criteria of Rs 10,000-crore revenue. “In the certificate for global revenue, the company has taken the revenue of ‘Vedanta’. It is also mentioned in the certificate by the applicant that the said revenue is not from electronic, IT/ITeS, including software, telecom and networking segment. If Vedanta’s revenue is excluded, the global revenue stands at Rs 5,180 crore, which is lower than the minimum threshold of Rs 10,000 crore for global companies,” a source said. On the domestic side, the application of Tech Mahindra is also being rejected as it is not engaged in manufacturing of telecom equipment, but only in software. “The company has applied for product, namely ‘software development’ in category ‘any other product’, as decided by empowered group of secretaries. The scheme only envisages manufacturing of goods, and ‘software’ is not covered under specified ‘telecom and networking products’ category,” the source said. Kenstel Networks, which has applied under MSME, has certified its revenues at Rs 6.4 crore, which is less than the stipulated Rs 10 crore threshold mandated for the category. The government had floated the scheme to encourage domestic manufacturing in the telecom sector, including core transmission equipment, 4G/5G next-generation Radio Access Network, IoT access devices and enterprise products such as switches and routers.  The government feels that with the transition to 5G and other futuristic technologies, India should have a robust, manufacturing eco-system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/33-companies-set-to-make-cut-for-rs-12k-crore-telecom-incentives/articleshow/85963889.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Wildlife lovers against Cheetah project in Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The exercise taken by the state forest department to introduce cheetah in Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) by neglecting tiger management has invited sharp criticism from wildlife experts, animal lovers and environmentalists. Many accused the over-ambitious forest department of jeopardising the tiger reintroduction programme, which started in 2018 with much fanfare. In the campaign ‘Say No To Cheetah’ initiated by wildlife lovers in the state, it was highlighted that the department overlooked tiger management problems and conducted rapid site assessment for cheetah on November 22 and 23, 2020. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, a local advisory committee member said, “After spending approximately Rs 30 crore of public money to develop infrastructure, tigers were reintroduced at MHTR. Unfortunately, mysterious deaths of tigers and cubs were reported. But, it is not the end of the road. The department should have worked on a recovery plan to relocate tigers.” Due to forest department’s apathy and lack of political will, the lone tigress MT-4 is living a miserable life in an enclosure without a companion. “The four-and-a-half-year-old tigress is living a caged life for past one year. The forest department should have expedited deliberations with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and make efforts to seek permission to bring a male tiger. However, no move was made in this direction,” said a state wildlife board member, who wished not to be named. The technical note, “Assessment of Cheetah Introduction Sites and Proposed Actions, 2021” reads for the area outside the enclosure, MHTR would require investments on a large scale in terms of reducing anthropogenic pressures through village relocation, grazing control of goats and cattle and mitigating infrastructure (roadways and railway).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wildlife-lovers-against-cheetah-project-in-mukundra/articleshow/85961572.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala health department readies plan to fight Nipah virus||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With Nipah virus outbreak being reported for the third time in the state, health department has formulated a Nipah management plan in Kozhikode. The health department has asked all districts to be prepared based on the Nipah management plan it published after the first two outbreaks of the virus in 2018 and 2019. A core committee consisting of 14 doctors have been formed, and a 24x7 control room has been opened in Kozhikode. The core committee will focus on aspects including surveillance, sample testing and result management, linkage of suspected new patients to the index case, contact list management, patient transportation management, material and logistics management, case treatment, expert visit coordination, management of infrastructure, call centre and the media, management and scientific funeral of dead bodies, data analysis, providing psychological support and inter-sectoral coordination. Daily core committee meetings will be held, along with review meetings that will be held twice a day. The round-the-clock call centre with 10 landline connections will be linked with the DISHA system to answer medical queries, logistics and administrative issues regarding Nipah and related health problems. A surveillance team consisting of district surveillance officer and epidemiologists will be in charge of overall coordination of active case finding, diagnosis and reporting of cases. Scrutiny of all encephalitis deaths in the past one month and route map of the cases for establishing any association will also be prepared. The cases will be categorised as suspect, probable and confirmed Nipah cases based on various criteria. Person from an area affected by a Nipah virus disease outbreak who has acute fever with new onset of altered mental status or seizure or acute fever with severe headache or acute fever with cough or shortness of breath will be put as a suspected case. A contact tracing team, including field workers under community medicine department and DMO, will be actively involved in contact tracing. Those who have been in contact with a confirmed or a probable Nipah case through body fluids, or those who have been in close proximity of the confirmed or probable case for more than 12 hours, will be classified as high-risk contacts. Those who have been in contact through touch or by using anything that was touched by the confirmed or probable case of Nipah will be in the low-risk category. Those at high risk but are asymptomatic will be in home quarantine for 21 days with active monitoring by the health team, while those who are symptomatic will be admitted to isolation wards immediately. While it has been assessed that sufficient consumables are in stock at present, KMSCL has been instructed to mobilise necessary consumables as per need. An inter-departmental team involving the animal husbandry department will engage in identifying the source. As per funeral guidelines, the bodies will be buried in the corporation limits itself. The treatment will be as per the treatment protocol and the infected and suspected will be discharged only on the basis of discharge guidelines. The suspect will be put on continued intense supportive care and will be considered for monoclonal antibody (MAB), Remdisivir, Favipiravir or Ribavirin after discussing with the patient. The treatment plan will be formulated by the institutional medical board. During the NiV outbreak in Kozhikode in 2018 the m102.4 monoclonal antibody (MAB), an experimental therapeutic, was imported for treatment of Nipah-infected patients on compassionate grounds. The SOP (standard operating procedures) and protocols were prepared with support from ICMR. But it was not used as the outbreak had ended by that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-dept-readies-plan-to-fight-nipah/articleshow/85959405.cms||KP Saikiran

The officials advised people to not just eliminate mosquitoes with the help of sprays but also to ensure that mosquitoes do not breed inside the house or in surrounding areas. “This is a good strategy to keep families and people safe from dengue. Also, since schools have reopened, it is better to tell students to keep away from water stagnation points,” an official said. Though mosquito nets can help prevent malaria, they do not help in the case of dengue mosquitoes as the dengue mosquito bites only during the day. “We provided about 4.75 lakh mosquito nets this year in regions where cases of malaria were detected,” officials said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/check-mosquito-breeding/articleshow/85961550.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Beed district received heavy rain with Madalmohi (180 mm) in Georai taluka and Raymoha (159 mm) and Nintarwani (156 mm) in Shirur-Kasar taluka reporting highest rainfall. The incessant showers temporarily snapped road connectivity in few parts of rural areas. Farms were inundated due to excess rainwater in some parts of Marathwada that have received 700 mm showers since June 1, accounting for 103% of the expected rain during the four months of the rainy season. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, more rain is in the store for Marathwada during the next 48-hours with some places likely to witness heavy to very heavy showers. “In Hingoli district, Nandgaon from Aundha taluka and Chinchordi from Kalamnuri taluka have reported one rain-related deaths each, whereas Jarandi from Soygaon taluka of Aurangabad district, Kolhari from Kinwat taluka of Nanded district, Gaundgaon from Deoni taluka of Latur district and Ruidhoki — falling within tehsil limits of Osmanabad — have reported one casualty each,” Aurangabad deputy divisional commissioner Parag Soman said. Further details of rain-related deaths were not available till late Sunday evening. The district administrations have issued alerts for people living on the banks of Godavari river and its different tributaries among other vulnerable areas in the wake of possibility of more rainfall over a period of next few days. Among revenue circles with heavy rainfall of more than 65 mm, Beed district tops the chart with 33 such areas followed by Jalna (16), Osmanabad (12), Latur (10), Aurangabad (11) and Nanded, Parbhani and Hingoli (one each).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/6-dead-as-heavy-rain-lashes-85-circles-across-mwada/articleshow/85954837.cms||---

A recent advisory issued by the cybercrime cell of the CID (crime) of Gujarat Police urges people to cover the cameras of their devices when they are not being used. “There are many applications which can use your device’s cameras for snooping on you. So you have to be alert and cautious,” said the advisory issued by the CID (crime) on August 28 for common users. Senior police officers said that they have come across many cases in which a person’s private information has been leaked using a device’s cameras. “While installing apps, people often permit access to the phone camera, gallery, and other crucial folders,” said an officer of the cybercrime cell of the CID (crime). “This gives cyber crooks easy entry into your cellphone or laptop. They can then access your camera or any app.” Another officer said that sometimes cyber crooks capture people when they are watching porn. Persons thus targeted are sent videos of themselves watching porn and subjected to blackmail. An officer of Ahmedabad Police said: “There are applications with which cyber criminals get access to people’s cellphones and the victims never know they are being monitored.” Hackers using such tricks keep track of the victims’ activities and the organizations they work for. The cyber criminals can even use the microphones of the devices to surveil their targets. A retired IPS officer of the state said, “A cellphone is a very dangerous thing and I don’t keep it near me when I am discussing a matter that requires privacy.” The officer added: “Once a conversation got leaked though nobody in the room was recording it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/your-cellphone-is-crooks-cctv/articleshow/85959372.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt ensures raw materials for English Indian Clays||Thiruvananthapuram: Industry minister P Rajeeve has directed the mining and geology department to ensure that English Indian Clays Limited (EICL) receives the raw materials required for its smooth functioning. The decision was taken at the high-level meeting convened by the minister here on Friday. The mining and geology department will now look into the necessary legal options for permitting the company to mine the raw materials required for the production. The meeting was convened in the wake of the company’s demand that unless they are allowed to mine the required raw materials, they will have to shut down its operations. The company's operations have been in a downturn for the last couple of years on account of the continuing shortage of raw materials. This eventually led to the closure of the factories at Thonnakkal and Kochu Veli in August 2020. However, the company chose to resume partial operations at Thonnakkal after the government intervention. The minister said the meeting has also decided to ensure the smooth functioning of the company and provide the government’s full support. The company management representatives who took part in the discussion guaranteed new investment proposals if the government could ensure the raw materials required for their production at their units. Meanwhile, the government also decided to convene a meeting with the labour minister to settle the labour issues in the company. The company had claimed that it has suffered a substantial drop in market share and sales in its wake inflicting upon it a huge financial loss. The company also remains apprehensive of its potential for future investments in the state. The investments have been directed to Gujarat where operations have already started. The company had claimed earlier that if things do not improve, the operations at its Thonnakkal factory might also go down along the lines of what was witnessed at its unit at Veli. Clay mined from Thonnakkal has been found wanting both in terms of quality and quantity for sustained operations thanks mainly to the restricted permit for mining activities. The drop in market has had a cascading effect worsening the situation further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-ensures-raw-materials-for-english-indian-clays/articleshow/85959334.cms||---

There are 19 such special camps, with the highest 77,156 shots administered at the booths set up at Eidgah Aishbagh, followed by Naka Gurdwara 48,520, Chhota Imambara 30,020, Sant Nirankari Bhawan 17,183, Sadar Gurdwara 15,745 and Radha Swami Satsang 6,299. The remaining 13 are also administering doses at a high rate. Eidgah Aishbagh was the first religious place to double up as a vaccination centre on May 19. “We took the initiative and got ourselves inoculated first, which helped in diluting hesitancy among people, particularly minorities. Vaccination drive hasn’t stopped here even for a single day since the rollout,” said Eidgah Imam Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali. People are preferring these places because of good amenities and care. Nodal officer of the vaccination centre at Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Naka Hindola, Dr Ankush Shukla, said proper management and special arrangements for women, elderly and people with disabilities have made this centre a favourite among the recipients. “We have made arrangements to vaccinate elderlies and people with disabilities in their vehicles parked outside the gate as they have difficulty in walking till the booth. Tokens are distributed to avoid overcrowding,” he said. “There are proper seating arrangements for others with an observation room. Another reason for the good turnout is that langer is offered by Sewadaars to everyone. Initially, 200-300 beneficiaries were getting the jab daily, but now the number has increased to 1,000 per day,” said Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee president Rajendra Singh Bagga. Adil Faraz Jawad, spokesperson, Majlis e ulama-e-hind, the body managing vaccination at Chhota Imambara, said, “We provide all the basic facilities to people. Inoculation process has been stopped right now because of Muharram, but will resume after Chehlum.” Harpal Singh Jaggi, president, Gurdwara Sadar, “We have a big air-conditioned hall and a parking space where beneficiaries can easily wait for their turn. Besides, volunteers make sure that Covid protocols are followed. Wheelchairs and other basic amenities are also available.” “Our mission is to serve. Such camps are running in all the places where we have a centre,” Aryan Srivastava, caretaker, Sant Nirankari Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/10-of-28-2l-covid-shots-in-city-given-at-religious-places/articleshow/85961547.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

A house index of 16 indicates that dengue mosquito is present in 16 out of every hundred dwellings. This is the highest value for the mosquito house index since 2018, officials said. The health department’s house index survey in areas with a high number of cases has also shown that the mosquito container index at 19 is the highest in the state. “The container index reveals the number of households where mosquito breeding is prevalent. An index of 15 means that larval presence is found in 15 houses for every 100 buildings,” officials explained. Dengue house and container index of more than 10 suggests a sensitive scenario with a higher number of cases. Along with Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Rangareddy and Peddapalli have a house index value higher than 10. Officials said water stagnation in households is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. Mosquitoes also breed on overhead tanks and open septic tanks as well as flower pots and discarded liquor bottles. “Dengue mosquitoes thrive on unused plastic objects, tyres and beer bottles which are dumped on rooftops,” an official said. According to Dr Suresh Babu Yakkala, consultant physician at Apollo Hospitals, dengue fever is preventable. “Taking care of the surroundings is very important, especially during the rainy season. In this season, no serious cases have been reported, but incidence of fever is high,” he said. Dr Suresh said that in some cases only platelets were required. “In general, if the platelet count is below 10,000, we will recommend platelet infusion. In extraordinary circumstances, platelet infusion is required even if the count is above 10,000,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dengue-mosquito-index-high-in-hyd/articleshow/85961543.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||30% vehicles, 15 years old or more, unregistered in Pune||PUNE: More than 30% vehicles 15 years old or above are unregistered in Pune, regional transport officials said. Records maintained by the Pune RTO reveal that around 68,100 non-transport vehicles in Pune are more than 20 years old and another 16,200 transport vehicles are close to touching 20 years. “There are many non-transport or private vehicles which are more than 20 years old in Pune. Our calculations show that around 30% vehicles (both private and commercial) are still to be re-registered. The reasons could be many, including the fact that many of these vehicles might have been sold as scrap or discarded. Every day, around 100 vehicles come to the RTO office for re-registration. With the scrappage policy announced now, the owners of vehicles opting to go for scrapping rather than re-registration are in for sops and benefits,” an RTO official told TOI. The Centre recently announced the new scrappage policy, which will come into effect from April of 2023 for commercial vehicles and from June 2024 for private vehicles. “We haven’t received any direction from the transport department till now. Presently, we don’t have much idea as to how the system will work and whether the government will officially appoint a vendor for scrapping. However, the fact that commercial vehicle owners might now hold on to their old vehicles rather than immediately discard them is a possibility,” the official pointed out. In March, the state transport department had said that there were around 16 lakh vehicles, which could be scrapped. The state transport department had asked the Pune RTO office recently to look out for around 11 lakh vehicles, which might be running without any registration after 15 years of age. This came to light after vehicle registration numbers in Pune, which was around 41lakh, mismatched with the figure of around 30lakh on the Parivahan portal of the ministry of roads and transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/30-vehicles-15-years-old-or-more-unregistered-in-pune/articleshow/85959386.cms||Joy Sengupta

Malik, a resident of Jaat Colony situated near the GIC ground, was at home on Sunday morning. Several farmers on their way to the GIC ground - the venue of the 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' - were asked to take a different route. "The administration may have felt that extra police personnel should be deployed for security, so they have done it," Malik said of the security arrangement outside the house. When contacted, SSP Abhishek Yadav, said, "Umesh Malik's house is next to the GIC ground. So, we had deployed a police team in front of his house in the backdrop of the recent incident." The Budhana MLA's motorcade recently came under attack in Sisauli. It ensued a war of words between the BJP and some BKU members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cautious-up-administration-beefs-up-security-outside-netas-house/articleshow/85957100.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Banas dairy, the largest milk union of Gujarat, will be spending nearly Rs 500 crore for setting up the milk processing plant that can process five lakh litres (LLPD) milk every day.  “Our board members visited the site at Varanasi on Sunday, saw the place and discussed the boundaries among other technicalities,” said dairy’s in-charge managing director Sangram Chaudhary.  “The 51 bigha land parcel belonged to UP State Industrial Development Authority which has been handed over to us. It is located at Karkhiyaon, 18 km away from Varanasi. We have already started work like levelling the land and are expecting the plant to come up in the next 18-20 months,” he said. Initially, the plant is proposed to process 5 LLPD with provision of future expansion. Earlier in the day, dairy’s chairman Shankar Chaudhary thanked PM for his support in acquiring land for the project. “Farmers of UP as well as Banaskantha will immensely benefit from this dairy plant,” he said. After Kanpur and Lucknow, Varanasi plant will be Banas Dairy’s third plant in Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/banas-dairy-to-have-plant-in-varanasi/articleshow/85957118.cms||---

---||Jaipur||BJP lost farmer support in phase-2 of Rajasthan rural elections||JAIPUR: The panchayat poll results of six districts is set to change the equation of several BJP leaders. The party seems to have lost the confidence of farmers, who had given a thumbs up to farm bills during the first phase of the rural polls held in 21 districts in December 2020. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot was quick to snatch the narrative claiming that the victory was a result of farmers opposed to the three farm laws. The loss in Jaipur and Jodhpur affect the positioning of the two tallest leaders — BJP state president Satish Poonia and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Poonia, who held roadshows and door-to-door campaigning in his assembly segment Amber, got less than half (24) of what Congress secured (51). BJP lost in Jodhpur under Shekhawat bagging 21 wards while Congress got 37 to snatch the board from the BJP. The party leaders defended the results blaming the government for misusing the government machinery. Reiterating the party’s stand, Poonia said, “The Congress doesn’t need to be happy over the results and overall mandate has gone against them. BJP along with the Independents secured more seats than the ruling party.” Former CM Vasundhara Raje congratulated the party workers and said: “BJP needs to work harder and we will do it together.” Congress retained its board in Sawai Madhopur and Dausa while BJP has clear numbers in Sirohi. In Bharatpur, it emerged as the single largest party. The independents play a decisive role in the formation of the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-lost-farmer-support-in-phase-2-of-rural-elections/articleshow/85961606.cms||---

Among the stretches that were worst affected were internal roads, especially those in colonies which were not yet taken care of when the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) was preparing to meet monsoon contingencies. Roads in Anjaneya Nagar at Moosapet, Krishna Nagar in Yousufguda, P&T Colony and Reddy Brothers lane in Saroornagar, Malakpet, Dilsukhnagar and Safilguda seem to have gone from bad to worse. “The rains coupled with construction activity have made this entire stretch so bad that we cannot take a walk without the vehicles driving through the potholes splashing water on us. There is also sewage that flows into the colony due to lack of silting works in manholes and drains in the area,” said R Sharath, a resident of Aanjaneya Nagar colony in Moosapet. While the GHMC workers have temporarily stopped the sewage from overflowing into the colony, the uneven and pothole-ridden roads continue to haunt the residents. Potholes of various sizes can be observed at vital by-lanes, including the ones at Nampally, First Lancer, Yakutpura, Shaikpet, Langer Houz and many other parts of Old City. Prominent among the damaged roads were also the Old Malakpet road, the entire stretch from Kondapur to Hi-Tec City and some vital by-lanes of Madhapur and Gachibowli. While a GHMC official said that the monsoon emergency teams are constantly working to identify damaged roads and repair them, mayor G Vijayalakshmi who was addressing the issue of roads damaged by rain recently said, “Stretches that have been damaged due to rains will be repaired once dry weather prevails... Restoration work during rains is not possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rains-lay-bare-potholes-city-roads-go-from-bad-to-worse-yet-again/articleshow/85961592.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Residents and tourists in Mussoorie eagerly wait for the fag end of the rainy season, when these flowers, typically grown in gardens, bloom in the wild. However, with growing urbanisation and the hills getting warmer, these flowers are disappearing. The dahlias came to the Queen of Hills along with the British. In fact, the flowers can be found in other towns in Uttarakhand as well, which used to be British settlements like Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora. “Dahlias are native to Europe and were brought to these parts by the British, who planted them in their gardens as ornamental species, but one can say that they ‘escaped’ and over the years, adapted to the wild,” said divisional forest officer, Mussoorie, Kahkashan Naseem. She added that increased construction on the natural vegetation had affected the growth of wild dahlias. “The number of dahlias is dwindling due to habitat destruction owing to increasing urbanisation and also due to rising temperatures,” she added. Today, blooming wild dahlias are found mostly in the town’s outskirts in areas which have been spared of relentless construction. The flowers are particularly abundant on the slopes of Gun Hill, on the hill near Mussoorie Girls School and parts of Landour Cantonment at this time of the year. They are also found in lesser numbers on some parts of the Mall road, on Camel’s Back road, on the slopes near Hampton Court School, on Circular road and near Guru Nanak Fifth Centenary school. Some flowers can also be found scattered along the Tehri Bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wild-dahlias-which-bloom-at-fag-end-of-monsoon-slowly-fading-from-mussoorie/articleshow/85957133.cms||Anmol Jain

The National Centre for Seismology informed, through its Twitter handle, about the earthquake of 3.9 intensity on the Richter scale around 19-km away from Kolhapur. The depth of the epicentre recorded was around 38-km. As a result, the tremors were not felt. As per disaster management officials, the epicentre might be near Kale village. No damage to private or public property was reported. Prasad Sankpal, Kolhapur district disaster management officer, said, “As per the longitude and latitude shared by BhooKamp app of the National Centre for Seismology, the epicentre is near Kale village. The locals claimed they did not feel any tremors. The low intensity earthquake was recorded at 11.49 pm on Saturday. The quakes above intensity of 3.0 on the Richter scale are usually recorded by the app whereas those less than 3 are not.” Sankpal said though the National Centre for Seismology recorded the tremors, the earthquake measuring system set up at Warna dam too recorded the same intensity tremors. The earthquake measuring system set up at Koyna dam in Satara district recorded tremors of 2.5 intensity on the Richter scale which is considered weak. The epicentre recorded was in neighbouring Ratnagiri district in Khovi village. The epicentre depth was 12 km. The tremors were felt at 3.21 am on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/low-intensity-tremors-recorded-near-kolhapur/articleshow/85954949.cms||---

The drive will continue in all 200 assembly segments on Monday and Tuesday with an aim to project Pilot as the most popular Congress leader. This is not for the first time that supporters of Pilot have gone out of the way to celebrate their leader’s birthday. Last year, in a statewide blood donation drive, over 45,000 units were collected in 400 camps on his birthday. The event marked a strong political message of his hold in the state even after he was removed from the post of and deputy CM. The drive is coinciding with the massive victory of Congress candidates in the gram panchayat polls in areas known to be dominated by Pilot supporters. In every constituency, the minimum number of plantations would be 5,000 to achieve the target of 10 lakh in the next two days. MLA Ladnun Mukesh Bhakar, considered close to Pilot, has committed 5,100 plants with 101 each in all gram panchayat (GP) under his constituency. “I have purchased saplings from nurseries locally in a bid to give a boost to farmers. Other than GPs, I will plant saplings across the roads in my constituency,” said Bhakar. Another staunch supporter of Pilot, MLA Dausa Murari Lal Meena, has appointed two volunteers each at 50 GPs for the drive. “My target is to plant 10,000 saplings in schools, hospitals, government buildings and on either side of roads. Every plant will be documented and efforts will be made to ensure that every sapling grows into a tree,” said Meena. Leaders associated with the drive said they were getting massive support from the party workers and locals everywhere. “The message has spread like wildfire across the state. The party workers and locals have been providing saplings, water tankers and tools to coordinators of the drive. Many have committed to carrying on the drive by themselves displaying support to the cause of the environment,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-supporters-to-plant-10l-saplings/articleshow/85961664.cms||---

Slamming the central government, Gehlot said, “First they had made a false promise to double the income of farmers by 2022 and now they have introduced the anti-farmers’ bill without discussion with the farmers. The nation has understood that farmers law is intended to hand over the farmland to big businessmen.” He called that NDAs ant-farmers move is known to everyone and farmers will leave anything to teach BJP a lesson.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Be alert as Nipah has Covid-like symptoms’||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The first episode of Nipah was due to direct bat-to-human contact. The index case was an animal lover and from the index case it had spread, said Dr Anoop Kumar, who detected the first Nipah case in 2018 in Kozhikode. Since it has Covid-like symptoms, we have to be very careful now, especially when the fatality rate is very high, he said. “Finding the source of Nipah is important. There are three chances for spreading — direct bat to human, human to human or from bat to animals then to human. In the first episode of Nipah, it was direct bat to human. The index case was an animal lover and it was found that he had come into direct contact with the infected bats,” said Dr Anoop Kumar A S, critical care expert at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode. In the present case, this kid was taken to three hospitals and he was admitted to the general ICU. Hence, there are chances that healthcare workers and the other ICU patients might have come into direct contact. Hence the key is to isolate all these people who have come into direct contact. Since the fatality rate is high, it is more important to isolate these people and to have constant monitoring, he said. “It is a droplet infection and hence it can be spread through pigs, cats and dogs. Hence, people coming in contact with such animals where bat population is high are under tremendous risk. Nipah has a similar symptom that of Covid. Hence, those who tested Covid-negative but if symptoms still persist, then they will have to immediately get tested for Nipah too,” said Dr Anoop. It would not spread like a pandemic and will be confined to a specific area from where the index case has been reported. Isolation of direct contacts and maintaining social distancing are the only way to prevent the spread, he added. On May 17, 2018, a 28-year-old was admitted to the hospital and the patient had developed myocarditis and severe circulatory failure. Dr Anoop and his team decided to send the samples to Manipal Institute of Virology for diagnosis. But the patient died on May 18 and the result was positive for Nipah. During that outbreak, 19 people were infected, of which 17 succumbed to Nipah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/be-alert-as-nipah-has-covid-like-symptoms/articleshow/85959510.cms||---

In 2015, the BJP bagged 584 seats – then in government - against Congress’ 542, a difference of 42. Hanuman Beniwal-led Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) was at a distant third with 40 seats. Among others, BSP won 11 and Independents bagged 290 wards. The results in two wards couldn’t be declared as polling was not held. In 2015, out of 1,328 panchayat samiti seats, the Independents had won 196. The increase in the number of seats this time can be attributed to delimitation and creation of new panchayat samitis in all districts, including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa and Sirohi, where elections were held. The difference in the number of panchayat samiti member seats in 2021 (1564) over last time’s 1328 (2015) is 236.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/cong-has-slight-edge-over-bjps-performance-in-2015/articleshow/85964975.cms||---

It is only KCR who decides,” he said.

Speaking on “Guru-Shishya Parampara - A Georgian Perspective” at the function on the campus to mark Teachers’ Day, head onco-surgery department, Prof Arun Chaturvedi said, "There was relentless teaching. The day was spent in classroom teaching, but even after that if any teacher would walk into the café in the evening, she/he would sit with us and start answering our queries. Even in the night, if by chance, a teacher would come across us at hostel gates, he would start explaining medical topics.” KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri said that Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on whose memory the day is celebrated said that teaching is not a profession but a purpose. Lucknow University V-C Prof Alok Rai, who was chief guest on the occasion, said a teacher’s responsibility was not just to impart education but also make students morally strong.

Ex-minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir on Sunday demanded that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre release a white paper on the funds and grants released to various states in the country since 2014, which he said would expose the injustices done to Telangana. He claimed that BJP and TRS took the spirit of federalism to a new low with their governments adopting informal approach to several public issues. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and submitted a bunch of 16 representations. It was nothing but a formality as none of them had any pre-briefing on issues to be discussed in the meeting. KCR had submitted similar representations during his earlier visits to New Delhi. The petitions submitted by CM KCR now will meet the same fate as the previous ones and all will remain unresolved,” he said. The Congress leader demanded that KCR release a white paper on representations made to the Centre in the last seven years and the response from the Modi government to those submissions. He said that both BJP and TRS were secret allies and they survive on the plank of ‘Gali mein kushti, Delhi mein dosti’. He sought to advise BJP state president Bandi Sanjay to wind up his padayatra as his party’s friendship with KCR has been exposed. “While Bandi Sanjay was threatening to send KCR family to jail, KCR and PM Modi were doing ‘chai pe charcha’ in Delhi. It is time that both parties stop misleading people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-trs-secret-allies-took-federalism-to-new-low-cong/articleshow/85961689.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jawaharnagar police on Saturday booked two people, including a minor for allegedly transferring LPG from domestic cylinders into commercial cylinders. Police have also seized over 80 cylinders among other machinery worth Rs 3.63 lakh. Shaikh Mukhtar Shaikh Osman (48), a resident of Peerbazaar, and one minor have been booked in connection with the incident, said an official release. An offence under enabling provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and Section 286 (Negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) ofthe Indian Penal Code have been invoked against the accused. While the price of subsidized domestic LPG cylinder is around Rs 492, the commercial cylinders costs nearly Rs 1,545 each. Police said the accused were engaged in the business of stealing LPG from domestic cylinders and refilling the commercial ones for easy money. Earlier, in August, Satara police had registered an offence in connection with alleged stealing of LPG from refill cylinders. Followed by the incident, consumer rights activists have appealed to the citizens to carry out weight check and leak tests while accepting LPG refill. As per public advisory issued by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the gross weight of LPG and empty cylinder together should be 29.5 kg — 14.2 kg gas and 15.3 kg of the cylinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minor-among-two-booked-for-stealing-lpg-from-cylinders/articleshow/85954993.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Can’t keep kids at home always, abiding by SoPs only solution’||MUMBAI: Even as uncertainty continues over reopening of schools in the state, the paediatric task force on Sunday presented a list of standard operating procedures (SoP) to be followed if physical schools are to resume. In a virtual presentation organised by the state Covid task force and the state government, Dr Suhas Prabhu, chairperson of the paediatric task force, said that apart from the already recommended protocols of staggered school hours, school days, lunch time and distancing, all contact sports should be avoided. Also, children from containment zones should not be sent to school. “The new procedures have been drawn up to assure parents who may worry that their child will contract the infection at school and, in turn, infect the entire family,” said Dr Prabhu, while speaking at the ‘Majha Doctor’ virtual seminar. He said that with reopening of playgrounds and schools, it is likely that infection in the under-18 age group will spiral due to increased exposure and lack of vaccination in this category. “But that does not mean we can keep them at home all time. This will lead to other psychological issues among them. The only way to keep them safe is to mask up, keep social distancing and sanitisation,” said Dr Prabhu. He said teachers should be advised to care for the psychological health of students and in the first few days of the schools reopening, focus should not be only on academics. “Teachers must be aware of the different backgrounds the students are coming from. Some may have lost a family member to Covid, parents of some may have been jobless. Dealing with the children in a sensitive manner will be required,” he said. The task force has also suggested setting up health clinics run by a trained school staff or volunteer with basic amenities like thermometre, oximetre and medicines; and in case a student is reported sick, the child should be referred to the nearest dedicated centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cant-keep-kids-at-home-always-abiding-by-sops-only-solution/articleshow/85962973.cms||Bhavika Jain

The difference in the number of panchayat samiti member seats in 2021 (1564) over last time’s 1328 (2015) is 236.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-has-slight-edge-over-bjps-performance-in-2015/articleshow/85961682.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Become a Covid warrior by taking jab||with Protect UP logo Drop cap Slug: By Invitation The Union ministry of health and family welfare recommends that a person who has recovered from Covid-19 should take the first jab after three months from the date of clinical recovery. And if a person contracts Covid after the first dose of the vaccine, then the second dose should be delayed by three months from the date of clinical recovery. Pregnant and lactating women, who were initially not included in the vaccination drive, have now been given a go ahead to take the vaccine, based on the recommendations of NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization) as the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant women outweighs its potential risk. The gap between the two doses of Covishield has been increased to 12 to 16 weeks while that for Covaxin remains the same at 4 to 6 weeks. When coronavirus enters a human body, the immune system recognises it and starts making antibodies against it to curtail its proliferation and spread. As this is a slow process and can take up to 5-7 days, by then a great degree of damage is already done. In the form of a vaccine, a part of the inactivated virus is injected, which by itself does cause any clinical infection but makes antibodies against it, so that when the actual infection occurs the already existing antibodies can ward off its spread. Enough evidence is now available to confirm that vaccines are safe and effective and any side-effect, if it occurs, is rare. The Central government plans to vaccinate all 137 crore eligible citizens free of cost in the world’s largest vaccination drive. And even now if you decide not to take the vaccine you should know that when the Covid enters your body, it not only infects you, but there is high probability that it may infect others through you and while doing so the virus may mutate and may cause further havoc. Hence if you refuse to take the jab you are not only harming yourself but also posing a significant threat to the health of the society as a whole. In the UK and the US, where the vaccination coverage is more than 60%, hospitalisation for the number of people infected during the second wave is very low. Thus further emphasizing the fact that even after vaccination if you suffer from a breakthrough infection your chances of contracting a severe disease, getting hospitalised and dying are almost negligible. It is also important to note that even after taking both the jabs, you can still contract the virus without showing any symptoms of the disease and can still infect others. So observing Covid appropriate behaviour in the form of maintaining adequate social distance, frequent sanitisation of hands and wearing the mask is of utmost importance. Today, we are lucky to be in a country where the vaccination is being provided free of cost and more than 67 crore doses of the vaccines have already been administered and thousands are being vaccinated daily. In August alone, India vaccinated more than 180 million doses. Hence, it is your time to be a Covid Warrior by getting vaccinated and strengthening the country’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The RLD chief, who was busy trying to arrange a chopper till the last moment and could not attend the event, later tweeted, "What is the danger to the government with respect to farmers?" “I wanted to pay respect and welcome farmers by showering flowers on them from a helicopter. The DM, ADG, city magistrate, principal secretary and CM were informed, but the permission was not granted,” he claimed in his tweet. And then added, “People have given me a lot of love and respect. The government puts nails on the roads, but cannot allow us to shower flowers on farmers. Till they remain, I will not accept a garland.” RLD workers were, however, present in large numbers at the venue. Some of them stood on top of cars and used spray machines to shower petals. The former MP, in a video statement recorded at Delhi airport, further said, “Farmers are protesting on the roads for months. Hundreds of them lost their lives.

Business owners are keeping their fingers crossed as they hop for a steady recovery of business. Vikas Ladhe, centre head, SGS Mall that compared to footfalls in August, there was a 100% increase in customers during the first week of September. “But when we think of pre-covid numbers, sales are 40% of what they used to be. Though we have to face the brunt of the pandemic, we can hope for sales to grow steadily over the upcoming festive season to encourage recovery of business,” said Ladhe. Malls in other parts of the city also reported a growth in footfall from the last weekend. The management personnel of a mall in Pimpri Chinchwad said footfalls are increasing as more and more people are getting their second dose of the vaccine. “We will not be able to see footfalls anywhere near the numbers of 2019 unless the vaccination rider is disregarded but then again, we can only hope to get back to full scale operations when there is no longer the threat of another wave. Only vaccination can help control things,” he said. The bustle is back in shopping hubs such as Laxmi Road, Camp and FC Road as well. Cawas Pundole, president, Camp Merchants Association, said, “Sales have improved significantly as the situation seems to come back to normal now. But we hope for a better boost after Navratri.” A garment shopkeeper from FC Road said that youngsters are his target customer and since many of them still have to get fully vaccinated, they are shopping outside malls. “Sales of clothing and footwear have also increased as people have started going out more and are getting ready for the festive season,” he said. A saree shop owner on Laxmi Road said business rose by 50% in the first week of September and many shops are hoping it to increases further as the festive season gets under way. Customers, too, are eager to go shopping while ensuring that they adhere to safety protocols. “Throughout the pandemic we have been stuck at home and mostly shopping online. Now, we prefer to go out. The whole experience of going out to shop with your family is part of the festivities for us,” said Sulochana Das, a resident of Yerawada. Rujuta Adekar, from Rasta Peth, said, “Though my husband and I are fully vaccinated, we cannot take our children to the malls. Hence we have been doing our shopping from standalone shops.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekend-shopping-boosts-business-in-malls-shops/articleshow/85959499.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Sources said that CM was keen on meeting Shekhawat to press for state’s rights in water row with AP and demand setting up of a river water tribunal at the earliest Earlier, CM could not meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday as the latter left for a three-day visit to Goa for a Navy event. KCR’s meeting was intended to explain to the President the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme introduced by the state. “KCR is of the firm opinion that the water sharing ratio between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should be 50:50. Also, he would seek delisting of some irrigation projects of Telangana from Centre’s gazette notification. The CM wants to explain the factual situation on genuine share of water for Telangana from Godavari and Krishna, large quantities of which was presently being diverted by AP outside the basin in violation of rules,” said a TRS leader. The TRS leaders did not rule out the possibility of KCR returning to Hyderabad if the appointment with Shekhawat is not finalised on Monday. “The CM’s trip has already been highly successful as he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, and submitted various representations in the interests of Telangana,” said a leader. KCR had gone to New Delhi on a three-day visit to lay the foundation stone for TRS party office. But his visit got extended after the PMO and Union home minister responded to his request for a meeting.

Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) Rahul Patil last week inspected the road after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) submitted a proposal. Patil told TOI, “We received a proposal from the PMC road department on August 27 requesting the forest department to handover a part of the open plot of reserved forest for widening the right side of the road which is just 9.5m wide to 24m, and to reduce the slope.” They have inspected the road to ascertain if the forest land should be handed over to the PMC. “Traffic flow can be eased if the road infrastructure is improved. We will forward the PMC’s proposal to the state government for sanction, but the land will remain with the forest department,” he added. The forest department does not have the technical and engineering expertise like other government departments to deal with the slope’s levelling. The PMC will have to take it up if the proposal is sanctioned by the state government. The road stretch links the chowk at Hotel Jyoti with Mohammadwadi and is used by water tankers, heavy and construction vehicles going to the high rise building sites towards Mohammadwadi and Undri. Often, these vehicles suffer from breakdowns while driving uphill and end up blocking the road. Water spillage adds to the poor road condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-proposal-to-widen-reduce-nibm-road-slope-begins-with-forest-dept-visit/articleshow/85959549.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Gafoor said that the authorities checked the area to find the source of infection. “It is true that there was a Rambutan tree near the house. But we are not sure whether this is the source. Families here say that bats are commonly seen in the area,” said Gafoor. Health minister Veena George, meanwhile, said that there is no need to panic. “Every minute detail is being analysed and there is no need to worry or panic. However, there should be a high level of alertness. If you have any information to be shared, the helpline numbers can be used for that. For instance, the family of the child had a goat.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab GST collection up in August at Rs 1,188 crore||CHANDIGARH: Punjab recorded Rs 1,188 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue collection in August, a growth of over 20% on the corresponding period last year. This can be seen as an indicator of the economic recovery after the second wave of Covid-19. As per the Punjab taxation commissionerate, the sectoral analysis of the GST receipts of the state suggest a healthy recovery in sectors such as iron and steel, electronic goods, fertilisers, telecom and banking. The officials claimed that besides the base effect of the abnormal previous year, last month’s growth is attributed to the strong anti-evasion activity of the department involving rigorous monitoring of bogus billing and unscrupulous trade practices as well as deployment of advanced data analytics for holistic and effective tax administration. The officials expect the robust GST growth witnessed so far to continue in the coming months as well. In addition to the regular IGST settlement, Punjab has received an ad hoc settlement of Rs 448 crore in August for the first quarter of the financial year 2021-22. As a result, the GST revenue up to the month of August has witnessed a high growth of nearly 80% as compared to the corresponding period last year. The tax collection from the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Central Sales Tax (CST) during the month of August is Rs 648 crore and nearly Rs 27 crore, respectively. As compared to the same period last year, VAT and CST revenue collection have displayed an impressive growth of 24% and 40%, respectively, this year thereby pointing to the upward curve of the economic recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-gst-collection-up-in-aug-at-rs-1188cr/articleshow/85961756.cms||---

---||Pune||Virtual gallery finds many takers, gives Indian artists global platform||Pune: By a stroke of luck, Niranjan Ingale’s plans for setting up ArtPRESENT, a global, virtual gallery and marketplace for artists, coincided with the onset of the global pandemic early last year as he was planning to increase representation of Indian artists in global art exhibitions. “When I lived in the US for a couple of years and spoke to art curators and promoters, I barely found work of any Indian contemporary artists. All the Indian art I found was by masters, such as MF Husain,” said Ingale. A view of the “exhibition” on the ArtPRESENT platform, on phone or on computer screen, almost feels like the real thing, with contemporary Indian art being exhibited in a neutral-coloured gallery, accompanied by classical Indian music in the background. Using data analytics and augmented reality, ArtPRESENT sources, values, and exhibits the works of painters and sculptors on its platform, both to introduce the artist to the global art market, and to sell the artworks, with pricing determined by various factors. The exhibition model even allows buyers to figure out the suitability of paintings to their homes, using projection. Recently, ArtPRESENT teamed up with the Pune-based art gallery Art2Day to reach out to artists and help them subscribe to the platform. Altogether 16 artists from in and around Pune have registered on the platform, which creates a portfolio of artists, and connects them to key players in the art market across the world, such as curators, art collectors, and others, for wider visibility and sales. The sign-ups have yielded results. The works of two artists Madhuri Bhaduri and M Narayan, from the Art2Day tie-up, have been selected for exhibition at the Hamptons Fine Art Fair in New York to be held in September. “Our plan now is to reach out to other artists in cities beyond Pune, so as to get more of them on board and increase Indian representation in the global art market,” Ingale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/virtual-gallery-finds-many-takers-gives-indian-artists-global-platform/articleshow/85959574.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Lucknow||Oppn pumped bullets into our culture & nationalism: UP BJP chief in Ayodhya||Lucknow: Unleashing a frontal attack on the Opposition, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh accused it of “pumping bullets into Indian culture and nationalism”, while speaking at a ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ organised in Ayodhya. Singh referred to an incident in 1966, during the tenure of then PM Indira Gandhi, when police opened fire on seers who were demanding a law criminalising cow slaughter outside Parliament. “Even the previous SP government fired at Ram Bhakts. These bullets were fired on the culture of India and the ideology of nationalism,” he said. Singh maintained the entire country had faith in Lord Ram. “Ram is in every particle. But the Congress government formed after independence denied the existence of Ram. The previous Congress-led UPA government did not believe in Ram Setu. The Shankaracharya was arrested after independence. The term Hindu terrorism was coined. They would feel ashamed of calling themselves Hindu and going to temples. All this happened for the sake of vote-bank politics,” he said. The state BJP president further said, it was because of the politics of minority appeasement that no SP leader went to pay homage to former UP CM late Kalyan Singh, who died after a prolonged illness on August 21. He said, when Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was going to Kashmir, people stopped him. “On reaching Kashmir, he was arrested and later martyred. After this the responsibility fell on Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who too was murdered,” he recalled. The UP BJP president said, UP has been freed of crime and corruption. “Now if someone tries to usurp a poor man’s hut, a bulldozer runs over his house. Even goons living in prison are scared. There are no communal riots in UP anymore,” he said, praising the Yogi Adityanath government. Singh said, the BJP government maintains equality between Hindus and Muslims. “Various government schemes are meant for both communities. Let us together develop this country and talk about harmony, not riots,” he said. He said, in previous Congress governments, only 15% funds trickled down to beneficiaries. “Now, 100% reaches accounts of poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-pumped-bullets-into-our-culture-nationalism-up-bjp-chief-in-ayodhya/articleshow/85961730.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Hearing loss, conjunctivitis among new signs of Covid||MUMBAI: Reduced hearing, dry mouth, throbbing headache and conjunctivitis are some of the newer symptoms seen in Covid-19 patients. Members of the state Covid task force urged physicians to suspect Covid even in cases where the hallmark signs of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath are absent. Listing some of the evolving symptoms, Dr Rahul Pandit, a task force member, said difficulty in hearing, conjunctivitis, extreme weakness, dry mouth and reduced saliva secretion, long-lasting headache and skin rashes may be signs of Covid too. “Although the disease has been around for 17 months, newer symptoms are still evolving and we need to watch them,” he said in an online conference chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. Globally, there are few documented cases of sensorineural hearing loss associated with Covid-19. An inflammation of the auditory nerve or a clot caused by the viral infection could affect hearing just like it affects the sense of smell, said Dr Samir Bhargava, head of ENT at RN Cooper. “We haven’t seen any exponential jump in case of sudden hearing loss, though we are alert as viral infections are known to cause that,” he said, adding that such patients need steroid treatment. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the task force, said that during the second wave driven by the Delta variant, many had only gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Fever can be present in varying forms, he said. Some do not get any fever, some get it in bursts, some in intervals of two to three days, while in many it fully subsides, only to return with severity. The taskforce members emphasised that early testing is of utmost importance. Dr Oak said family physicians have a crucial role in advising a Covid test, preferably an RT-PCR. “If the test is done immediately, the person can be administered antivirals or monoclonal antibodies that are effective when administered early,” he said. At the event, Dr Shashank Joshi, an endocrinologist and member of the task force, said people who test positive must watch six vital parameters — temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and blood sugar levels. Dr Pandit said blood sugar is a parameter that can prevent many complications, including the risk of mucormycosis. The experts stressed that full recovery takes at least three weeks. Cardiologist Dr Ajit Desai said that post-Covid up to 40% patients may grapple with neuropsychiatric impairments, including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, post-traumatic stress disorder, while up to 5% may have thromboembolic events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hearing-loss-conjunctivitis-among-new-signs-of-covid/articleshow/85962979.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The development, which comes as the festive and wedding season sets in, will see the brick-and-mortar chain position mid-size stores in the economy range, said three people familiar with the development. A Reliance Retail spokesperson did not respond to a questionnaire emailed by TOI. The company’s move comes against the backdrop of Tanishq, which is primarily a jewellery brand, foraying into the ethnic wear space. Aditya Birla’s ABFRL, too, has shown a strong interest in the segment by snapping up significant stakes in domestic designer wear labels such as Sabyasachi and Tarun Tahiliani. Despite a proliferation of global apparel brands, ethnic wear continues to be the dominant segment in India, leading to several domestic and foreign brands specialising in western wear to launch desi clothing collections. Apart from selling private labels in sarees and ethnic wear, Avantra will partner with regional weaver clusters and several third-party brands, including Nalli Silks and Pothys. “Jewellery, accessories and tailoring services will also be part of the offerings,” said a source. “The first store is set to come up in Bengaluru, followed by others in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.” Women’s ethnic wear market is set to grow 10% annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-retail-set-to-launch-saree-ethnic-wear-stores/articleshow/85964029.cms||John Sarkar

The latest death of a 60-year-old woman is also suspected to have been killed in a leopard attack in Vadgaon Patole village in Khed tehsil. Forest officials said that leopard population has increased in the last two decades. “The first leopard census is underway in our limits,” said Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar, which has eight range forest offices in Junnar, Ambegaon, Shirur and Khed tehsils. “These deaths have mostly taken place on farms and near people’s homes. So, we will have to take measures at these places to prevent attacks,” Gowda told TOI on Friday. “We have told villagers to construct compound walls, set up proper cattle sheds and avoid visiting farms at night. Also, we have requested the MSEDCL to supply electricity to motor pumps during the day so that farmers do not have to water the crops at night,” he added. Altogether 9,455 domestic animals have been killed by leopards during this period. Also, stray dogs and chickens have fallen prey to big cats, said forest officials. “We have given compensation of Rs1.44crore ,” said Gowda. To reduce attacks by female leopards, the division has been reuniting the mother with her cubs. “Since January, we have reunited 16 cubs with their mothers,” said a range forest officer. Wildlife experts said ‘hyperlocal’ reach is necessary to mitigate the conflict and create awareness.Vidya Atherya, an ecologist, who has worked extensively in Junnar and carried out a study on human-leopard conflict, said, “ Leopard attacks have reduced compared to the period between 2000 and 2005 . The efforts by the forest department have helped. However, leopards are around and will remain so. We need a strategy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/33-killed-in-leopard-attacks-in-2-decades/articleshow/85959621.cms||Sandip Dighe

The CM invited Shetti and two other representatives to attend the meeting at Varsha bungalow, the official residence of the CM in Mumbai, at 3 pm on Monday. The invitation came after thousands of farmers marching with Shetti reached Narsinhawadi, the confluence point of the Panchaganga and Krishna rivers. It is also one of the severely flood-affected towns in Kolhapur district. After floods, Thackeray had also started his tour of the affected areas from Narsinhawadi. Shetti said: “Our main demands are: compensation as per the policy adopted by the government after the 2019 floods; loan waiver for the flood-hit farmers as they have no crops left to sell and repay the loans; and a permanent solution to the floods in the Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The CM has requested us to attend the discussion and we are ready to do that.” Some Shetti supporters jump into water, rescued After the farmers’ march reached Narsinhawadi on Sunday, a few of Shetti’s supporters jumped into the river. However, they were brought out of the water by rescuers. Anticipating a law and order situation, the Kolhapur police had deployed more than 500 personnel in the town and along the ghat areas. As many as seven rescue boats were positioned in the river to prevent Shetti and his supporters from taking ‘Jal Samadhi’. However, after the local administration met Shetti with the invitation from Thackeray, the farmers gathered at the Narsinhawadi bus stop. The Panchaganga Parikrama had started on September 1 from Prayag Chikali, where several rivers meet and form the Panchaganga. Prayag Chikali is the first village to get affected by the floods every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cm-invites-shetti-home-to-discuss-flood-hit-farmers-demands-today/articleshow/85955127.cms||---

He was speaking at BJP’s ‘Prabuddha Varg Sammelan’ in Lucknow. He said, the party has been working on suggestions of the people and it was an honour to get connected with the educated class, including teachers, professors, engineers, doctors and litterateurs. Bansal said, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, BJP got the privilege of becoming the world’s largest cadre-based party with significant supporters in UP alone. Bansal said, everyone has felt the change in the state under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “Earlier, UP was known for its soaring crime, mafia raj and corruption, but today after four-and-half years of government, crime has been curbed, mafia are either in jail or outside the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-largest-cadre-based-party-in-world-bansal-at-lucknow-prabuddh-meet/articleshow/85961765.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to link new Farmer Producer Organisations to govt departments||LUCKNOW: Even as farmers, protesting against the new farm laws, held a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, the ruling BJP has hammered out a plan to expedite formation of new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and getting them linked to various government departments under convergence mode. The step is being seen as an attempt to help the FPOs get direct benefits from the various government schemes. While UP at present has a little over 600 FPOs, the state government plans to set up another 200 more in the forthcoming months, top sources in the state government said. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said that scores of FPOs have already been engaged in various agro-marketing and other farm-related activities. “The department seeks to lend a further boost to the sector that would help the farming community as a whole,” he told TOI on Sunday. According to agriculture department officials, as many as 107 FPOs have been engaged in organic farming in 28 villages which have been taken up under the Namami Gange programme. Likewise, 300 FPOs have been working as farm machinery banks, 60 are engaged in seed processing and many have been roped into the conservation of cattle. Chaturvedi said that an FPO in Agra has, in fact, started its own mandi, for procuring farm produce directly from the farmers. The move to step up setting up of more FPOs is seen as an attempt to boost farmers’ income and rev up the agriculture sector amid the ongoing standoff between the farmers and the Centre. It was only in September last year when the UP government formulated the state FPO policy. Later, the agriculture department directed all the district authorities to set up FPOs in developmental blocks which do not have one. “A majority of FPOs have been lying defunct despite their formation a few years ago. We have only revived them and lent them the requisite support,” Chaturvedi said. The UP government's accentuation on the FPOs comes even as the ruling BJP attempts to assuage the resenting farmers who have also been seeking government attention towards sugarcane state advisory price (SAP) for sugar cane which has remained unchanged for the past three years. As a matter of fact, CM Yogi Adityanath has announced that the state government would effect a hike in SAP, a move that becomes imperative in the election year, sources said that the state government may seek to tread cautiously in a bid to avoid burdening of the sugar mills which are already facing a financial contraction in the wake of Corona pandemic. ------- BOX Need to understand farmers' pain: Varun While the Centre has been vehemently against revoking the new farm laws, BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi on Sunday lent covert support to farmers who had called a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar. Lodging an appeal to understand the pain of farmers, Varun tweeted: “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground." Varun has also tweeted a video, which seems to be of Kisan mahapanchayat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-link-new-fpos-to-govt-departments/articleshow/85961789.cms||Pankaj Shah

The Congress now has 9 zila parishads, having won five during panchayat polls in December last year. BJP had won 13 zila parishads and independents three at that time. While Congress had a clear majority in Dausa, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Sawai Madhopur zila parishads, the opposition BJP led in Sirohi zila parishad. However, in Bharatpur, no party had a clear majority with BJP winning 17 seats, Congress bagging 14, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) winning two and independents winning four seats. Though some Gehlot supporters believe that winning Jaipur and Jodhpur is a referendum on CM’s handling of Covid and his focus on pro-poor welfare programmes - amid the tussle between him and Sachin Pilot, and his dexterity in dilly-dallying the much-awaited expansion of his council of ministers, which is proving to be an irritant for the party high command - others believe it is too early to say so. “These are local body elections. They are fought on local issues and have local implications. Both parties try to portray these numbers as their own victory. The referendum on the Congress, in the larger context, will be seen in 2023,” said Jaipur-based political analyst Avinash Kalla. “If we look at history of elections, the party that is in power has the upper hand in local body polls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rural-poll-results-give-boost-to-cong-ahead-of-2023-test/articleshow/85961775.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

NMC has received a good response to the expression of interests (EoI) it had recently invited the private agencies to develop, finance, operate and maintain the Dadasaheb Phalke Memorial . A total of six private agencies have responded and submitted their concept to the NMC. Of them, two agencies have been shortlisted, who recently presented to municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav about the concept for the renovation. One of the two Mumbai-based agencies have made a plan to set up a partial film city at the memorial to boost film and serial shootings and provide employment to the locals. The agency has plans to start drama classes for local artists. Apart from this, the agency has also mooted an idea of organising an event, inviting celebrities for the event that will generate revenue, said NMC officials. Recreation centres will also be established there. Jadhav has asked the Mumbai-based agency to chalk out the exact plans about the use of every space of the memorial and how they are going to execute the project, and give a presentation in the next two-three weeks. When contacted, Jadhav said, “The condition of the memorial has deteriorated in the last few years and we are spending around Rs 2 crore for its maintenance. We want to renovate the memorial through a private agency on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. The memorial will be renovated without destroying the present structure there. The revenue generated through the project will be shared by both private agencies and the NMC.”  Constructed in 2001, the memorial dedicated to Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of the Indian cinema, has been in shambles for many years Initially, there was a good number of footfall of visitors at the memorial, but people have turned their back to the site for the past many years due to negligence by the NMC.

Of these, 42 were from Ludhiana, 34 patients were of other districts of Punjab and nine were from other states and union territories. Most of the district cases were from urban areas (34), three from Sahnewal, one each from Sidhwan Bet, Sudhar, Koom Kalan, Hathur and Jagraon.On September 1, there were 69 cases.The data of health department shows that between August 26 and 31, as many as 14 cases were reported and between August 17 and 25, there were 18 cases. From July 30 to August 16, as many as 11 dengue cases were registered.The health department officials said the cases are expected to rise.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said, “We are taking steps to check breeding of mosquitoes that cause dengue. The recent rains gave favourable conditions, temperature and humidity to mosquitoes to breed.” A health department officer said, “The municipal corporation must conduct fogging in the city frequently to contain cases.” “In September, October and November, dengue cases may rise. There are ways to check it. The mosquito causing the disease flies at lower height and goes out in morning and comes inside houses in evening as it is attracted by light. So, one can open doors and windows in the morning so that the mosquitoes go out and close these spaces in the evening so that they don’t return. Also, it is important to ensure that water doesn’t get accumulated in containers, especially in coolers, tyres, among others. The authorities, too, should ensure fogging is conducted across the district,” said Dr Daljeet Singh, former principal of DMCH. On September 4 evening, the number of suspected cases reported from Ludhiana was 728, of which 680 were from the district.The 34 cases reported from urban areas were from Model Town, Ferozepur Road, Ashapuri, Civil Lines, Rani Jhansi Road, Kailash Chowk, Chander Nagar, Bhamia Road, Janta Nagar, Kundanpuri, Sua Road, Dhandari Railway Station, Basant City, Jahangir Road, Sant Nagar, Rajguru Nagar , BRS Nagar, Gurdev Nagar and Basti Jodhewal.The 34 cases from other districts were from Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Moga, Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Mansa, Faridkot, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot and Patiala districts.

Though some Gehlot supporters believe that winning Jaipur and Jodhpur is a referendum on CM’s handling of Covid and his focus on pro-poor welfare programmes - amid the tussle between him and Sachin Pilot, and his dexterity in dilly-dallying the much-awaited expansion of his council of ministers, which is proving to be an irritant for the party high command - others believe it is too early to say so. “These are local body elections. They are fought on local issues and have local implications. Both parties try to portray these numbers as their own victory. The referendum on the Congress, in the larger context, will be seen in 2023,” said Jaipur-based political analyst Avinash Kalla. “If we look at history of elections, the party that is in power has the upper hand in local body polls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/rural-poll-results-give-boost-to-cong-ahead-of-2023-test/articleshow/85964935.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

On Saturday, a youth from Kochi died in Kundara Chola waterfall. In December, a youth from Ottapalam died and another was seriously injured at Seetharkundu viewpoint. In January, two tourists from Tamil Nadu drowned in the Karapara river near Vannathi bridge. Once tourists cross Pothundy forest checkpost, in the 20km route to Kaikatti junction, there is no monitoring of their movements. Some tourists venture into the numerous waterfalls formed due to heavy rains. The forest department has put up sign boards in dangerous zones, but most tourists ignore it. The tourists also chase wild animals along the road, provoking the animals to attack them. Since Nelliyampathy is a forest area, the forest department does not allow the tourism department or the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) to make arrangements for safety and regulation.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nelliyampathy-lacks-tourist-safety-checks/articleshow/85959683.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The administration has now appealed to the youths to turn up for blood donation before getting vaccinated as after getting either of the jabs, the beneficiary cannot donate blood for two weeks. Authorities also claimed that erratic weather conditions have led to rise in viral diseases mainly dengue. Prakash Ghunghurkar, president of Kolhapur Blood Banks Association, said, “Every day large number of enquiries are being placed with blood banks by relatives of the patients as well as hospitals for platelets. Before vaccination for 18 to 44 years age group started we had appealed to the youths to turn up in large number, which they did not. The platelets extracted from the blood have a shelf life of just 5 days and therefore it is necessary for banks to replenish the stock.” The blood banks have now appealed the authorities to step in as early as possible and conduct blood donation camps. The platelets are extracted directly from the body of the donor by high-end technology which is costly and also by centrifugation from the blood donated by the donor which is cheaper. The relatives also demand platelets of the donors with same blood group as that of the patient despite the fact that the blood group doesn’t matter for platelet therapy. The platelet therapy is effective in early days of dengue infection and therefore testing after early signs is key to quick recovery. Amol Mane, medical officer of KMC, said, “We have started a drive to destroy the breeding grounds of dengue spreading mosquitoes. We have started door-to-door survey to find dengue suspects. They are being tested for early detection. We have intensified fogging in the areas where cases are reported in large numbers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-shortage-of-platelets-as-dengue-cases-increase/articleshow/85955175.cms||---

As many as 1,306 women cops have been deployed in the range since September 1. These beat officers are interacting with women and solving their problems. “A woman Laxmi, who was not receiving her widow pension for three months, complained to a woman beat officer Rinki Kumari in Shivgarh police station of Rae Bareli. The cop got in touch with seniors and solved the problem within three days,” added IG Singh. Similarly, a woman beat officer, Priyanka Upadhyay, when told about no facility of toilets for women in Rae Bareli’s Bhadokhar village, got in touch with seniors and ensured that development officer looked into the issue. Singh said that the overall objective of the third phase of the mission is to provide police service at the doorstep of every woman. “Shakti ‘Kakshas’ (rooms) are being opened in Panchayat Bhawans where women cops can meet survivors/victims of heinous crimes of last three years and see whether or not they are satisfied with the development in their case. “If the accused is out on bail, then find out the reasons and if they are absconding then inform senior officer for their arrest,” IG said. She also held an ‘e-communication’ with all 1,306 women beat officers under her jurisdiction in the districts of Unnao, Hardoi, Sitapur, Lucknow rural, Kheri and Rae Bareli. Women beat officers will also look after single mothers, and elderly through women help desks of police stations, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1306-beat-officers-reaching-out-to-women-in-distress/articleshow/85961832.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Airport-New Garia Metro crosses a hurdle near Baghajatin bridge||Kolkata: One of the two yawning gaps along the viaduct corridor at the New Garia-Ruby stretch of the New Garia-Airport Metro alignment was bridged on Saturday and Sunday. The gap between two piers (P-14 and P-15) near the Baghajatin bridge could not be bridged for a long time, thus stalling the project, and it could be done after the relocation of occupants with the help of the local authorities. Officials of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Railway PSU — the executing agency for most of the Metro projects in the city — heaved a sigh of relief with the bridging of the crucial gap, which prevented the viaduct from having a continuous run along this 5km stretch with five stations of the 32km long New Garia-Airport alignment. It is set to change the travel patterns of people from the southern fringes of the city to Sector V and New Town and the airport. With the bridging of this gap, only one more gap remains — a 160 meter one over the canal at Kalikapur. The work for diversion of the canal to construct the the pier is over. A 50 meter composite steel girder will be laid to accelerate the completion of the viaduct as the stretch is slated to be commissioned by early 2022. The discontinuities between New Garia (Kabi Subhash) and Kalikapur (Kabi Sukanta) between pier 12 and 19 have been delaying the project. Unless there is a continuity in the viaduct, all the major tasks like laying lines, bringing electricity and placing signalling and telecommunication equipment remain pending with inevitable consequence of time and cost-overrun, said another RVNL official. The New Garia-Airport Metro corridor project has gathered momentum with Rahee Infratech bagging the contract to supply and install ballastless tracks along the Nicco Park-Titumir section. RVNL was laying tracks along the Ruby-Kavi Subhas section. In July 2020, Rahee had started the track installation work for the first 6.5km stretch (New Garia to VIP Bazar). The third rail is also being installed along the 5km stretch for the 32km Line 6 that will link New Garia with the airport. Linxon India has started installing the 750 V third rail electrification system between Ruby crossing and Kavi Subhas station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-new-garia-metro-crosses-a-hurdle-near-baghajatin-bridge/articleshow/85959667.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The FIR was registered on the complaint of BJP member Akash Saxena at Civil Lines police station in Rampur district, on Sunday night. Qureshi, who was a senior Congress member, had also served as the 15th governor of Mizoram in 2014-15. He was in Rampur to meet Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan’s wife Tazeen Fatima at her residence on Saturday. Later, while addressing the media, he had allegedly compared the Yogi government with "demons". Akash, in his complaint to police, also said the "remark made by Qureshi is getting traction on social media which can create tension between two communities and even lead to communal riots". Police have slapped sections 153A [promoting enmity between two groups on ground of religion, race etc], 153B [imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration], 124A [sedition] and 505[1] [B]-[intent to cause fear or alarm to the public].

According to a state government spokesperson, the department of women and child welfare will disseminate information about various laws and provisions related to violence against women and children. Officials said the awareness campaign – which would be a part of the Mission Shakti programme – would be conducted at gram sabha level. The drive will deal with issues such as harassment of women and children, domestic violence, drug abuse, trafficking, child marriage, discrimination, child labour and other forms of exploitation. Besides making women aware, efforts are also being made to directly connect them with the schemes of the state government. Through Swavalamban camp organized in August, women were informed about welfare schemes such as Destitute Women Pension Scheme, Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana, Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana and applications for availing benefit under schemes were also accepted. Officials said at least 6,314 applications were received for Kanya Sumangala Yojana of which 4,489 were accepted.

Balasaheb Bajare, the secretary of the Pimpalgaon APMC, said there has been a huge rise in supply. However, the demand has not kept up. As a result, there has been a further drop in the average wholesale price. The situation will continue to remain the same for at least the next few days, he said. Currently, around 3 lakh crates of tomatoes have been coming into the markets across Nashik district every day. Out of the 3 lakh crates, more than 2.25 lakh crates come into the Pimpalgaon APMC alone. Each crate contains around 20 kg of the produce. “There has been good production of tomatoes this year, but the demand in the domestic market is comparatively low. Moreover, the quality is not very good. All these factors have had an impact on the wholesale prices,” Bajare said. The minimum and maximum wholesale prices of tomatoes have been recorded at Rs 2.55 per kg and Rs 7.5 per kg, respectively, while the average wholesale price was Rs 2.5 per kg. The farmers are still dumping the produce to protest against the crash in prices. The Centre has already sent a letter to the state government, asking it to utilise the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for the benefit of the tomato farmers, but the state government is yet to take a call on the matter. According to sources in the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB), it is a policy decision to be taken by the state government. Uttam Avhad, a tomato farmer, said he has incurred heavy losses. “We should get at least Rs 13 per kg to make production and transportation viable. But I had to dump the produce on the market premises as I was getting only Rs 2 per kg a few days ago. I was not even able to pay the transport costs,” he said. Ajit Navale, the general secretary of the All-India Kisan Sabha (AIMS), said “Tomato farmers are going through a bad phase. Both the central and state governments have not taken any cognizance of this and have not made efforts to provide relief to the farmers.” “We had sought the immediate relief of Rs 50,000 per acre for the tomato farmers, but the Centre and the state have ignored our demand. The entire tomato season has been a waste. The Centre should have made efforts to remove the obstacles in the export of tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. But that has not happened,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wholesale-tomato-price-crashes-to-rs-2-5/kg-at-pimpalgaon-apmc/articleshow/85955163.cms||Tushar Pawar

The Rs 758-crore scam had come to light in September 2010. ED had lodged a case on September 30, 2013, to probe money laundering. It invoked Section 44 (1) (c) of PMLA, which states that if a court that has taken cognisance of the offence is other than the special court, it will commit the case on receipt of an application from ED. ED’s counsel had told the special judge in Alibaug the accused had diverted investors’ funds illegally through bogus, forged and fake loan accounts to acquire immovable properties worth Rs 270 crore, so it should be tried under PMLA. Special public prosecutor Vaibhav Bhole said, “It was jointly decided to try the case in a PMLA court. Hence, no objection was made. The order was thus passed. ED has attached the properties.”The around 40 accused include Shishir Dharkar, then bank chairman, Prem Kumar Sharma, expert director and board of directors. The bank had 18 branches, including three in Mumbai.  It had nearly 2 lakh depositors and 42,000 shareholders. Part of the fraud money was allegedly used to purchase land around Navi Mumbai international airport in Panvel, Pen, Roha and Sudhagad Pali talukas of Raigad district, and Dubal too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pen-co-op-bank-scam-case-committed-to-pmla-court-by-spl-judge-after-ed-plea/articleshow/85962996.cms||Umesh K Parida

The services of the contractual employees, who served patients in the Covid facility during the peaks of both Covid waves, were to be terminated by August 31, after the funds for the same were stopped. But now they have got an extension. “The 255 employees — comprising ward boys, doctors and others — recruited temporarily have got an extension till November-end. This is good news considering the third wave, that is being expected in September,” said Dr Jeetendra Dhaneshwar, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation-run Bytco Hospital. The 1,000-bed Bytco hospital has served more than 10,000 patients during Covid so far and the employees recruited on a contractual basis have treated these patients. “The staff is involved in Covid treatment and vaccination, both of which are very important considering the third wave of Covid as warned by the experts. The retention of the employees will ensure our preparedness to take on the infection from day one if and when the third wave strikes,” Dhaneshwar said. After the National Health Mission (NHM) funds from the central government dried down, NMC faced the issue of payment for these employees. The employees raised this issue with district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who directed the NMC to take up it with the state government and resolve it at the earliest. The NMC has now earmarked funds for the salary of the employees and accordingly they will continue to serve the corporation at least till the end of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/255-contract-employees-at-bytco-hosp-get-extension/articleshow/85955226.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Trader’s body found 3 days after mishap||JAIPUR: Three days after a car plunged into a nullah in Ambabari, the driver’s body was fished out by civil defence teams on Sunday. Shastri Nagar police identified the deceased as Prashant Panwar (26), a resident of Vishwakarma colony. He ran a successful tour and travel business in the city and was heading home in his newly purchased car on Thursday late night when it plunged into the nullah. There are no railings or barrier walls on either side of the road also known locally as Ambabari Puliya. SHO Dilip Singh said some stray dogs had come before Panwar’s vehicle due to which he veered off the road and fell into the nullah. Panwar tried to escape from the sinking vehicle by breaking its windows. “He leapt out of the vehicle but could not save himself and got stuck in the muck,” added Raj Krishan, a cop who was part of the rescue team. According to police, the incident took place shortly before Thursday midnight. The submerged car was discovered on Friday. Local administration summoned civil defence and disaster relief teams to the spot to undertake the search operation. “For the past three days, we had been hoping that he would be found alive. We thought that he had managed to escape from the vehicle. We were shocked when his body was found,” said Panwar’s friend Sumit Singh. The deceased’s friends and relatives told TOI that Panwar had gone to a friend’s house in Jhotwara to book tickets for his customers. “Barely a few minutes before the accident, he had spoken to his father to inform him that he was on his way home,” said Umesh Sharma, a friend of the deceased. Panwar got engaged in April this year. His wedding was scheduled for December 11. “He was busy in his wedding preparations and handling business,” Singh said. Relatives said they had not informed Panwar’s elderly parents about his death immediately, because the entire family was hopeful that he would be found alive somehow. “He was very hardworking. He had told his father to retire because he was making good money and could take care of the family. He had organised his elder sister’s wedding all by himself,” Sharma said. While relatives and friends praised the rescue operation, they lamented the fact that local administration had turned a blind eye to the sorry state of affairs of the road. “There are no proper street lights, and the entire nullah is infested with water plants, it was an avoidable death. The city administration always waits for a tragedy to occur before they wake up,” said a relative. The deceased’s post-mortem was conducted at the Kanwatia hospital on Sunday. Several relatives, neighbours and friends gathered outside the mortuary. “ Prashant’s family is still in disbelief. We don’t know how they will react to the news,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-body-found-3-days-after-mishap/articleshow/85961844.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mask norm violation in Kolkata markets: 1,842 booked last weekend||KOLKATA: Cops have prosecuted 1,842 people in the city last weekend for not wearing masks properly. About 80% of these special checks have taken place outside the city’s major markets and malls that are now witnessing a steady footfall of shoppers with the festival season barely a month away. The total number of prosecutions, claimed Lalbazar, is one of the highest since May when the second Covid wave hit the city. According to the figures provided by Lalbazar, total 772 people were pulled up for not wearing masks properly on Friday. On Saturday, this number hovered around 759. Till noon on Sunday, 311 people without masks were prosecuted. Last month, cops had taken action against 220-260 people daily for not wearing masks properly. The number is more than three times that this weekend. “We found that even till July, people at least had the masks near their chins. But at the beginning of August, we found it missing completely. We have targeted a few places, where there are regular aberrations. This includes the markets and malls, where we are conducting special drives because of the pre-Puja weekend,” said an officer. A visit to the city’s main markets also shows the prosecutions are unable to instil discipline in people to wear masks. Lalbazar is now banking on another round of intense campaign before the pujas, even as it has asked cops in certain pockets to step up prosecution. They are planning to using the popular Durga Puja video with the tagline — Ebar pujoy mask must, mathai rakhun safety first — from last year. At New Market, cops have discontinued arresting the violators and bringing them to the police station. “There is a big crowd due to the festive season and we will continue with the drive. We are distributing masks and setting up kiosks to spread awareness among people,” said an officer. At Gariahat too, cops said they are relying more on campaigning than prosecutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mask-norm-violation-in-mkts-1842-booked-last-weekend/articleshow/85959693.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The slain consultant, however, had some reservations in allowing EoT (Extention of Time) of 171 days, following which a meeting was scheduled in Jaipur on August 26. Additional DCP (west) Ram Singh said as per rules, a penalty of 10 per cent of the project cost amounting to Rs 35 crore was levied on Sheoran’s company for delay. Even before the meeting, the four accused including Sheoran (29), Naveen Bisla, Vikas Singh (33) and Amit Nehra (26), plotted to eliminate Chawla, cops added. Police said they got whiff of the conspiracy in the hospital itself. According to Singh, a local representative of Chawla’s company had ferried the consultant to SMS Hospital in a cab, which was hired by Sheoran’s company to bring his two engineers to Jaipur for the meeting.

The health officials said during the 30-day period, Nashik district witnessed 15 new cases of mucormycosis while 39 patients recovered from the infection and three people succumbed to it. The number of recovered patients has increased from 613 to 652. According to Dr Prashant Khaire, the resident medical officer (outreach), the number of mucormycosis cases is reducing steadily and hence the active cases that hovered around 300 at one point of time, has now dropped to 28. “This is a satisfactory figure and the major reason behind this is the drop in Covid cases. The patients – mostly with comorbidities – suffering from Covid are likely to catch this infection during or after the treatment. Since the number of critical Covid patients has reduced, the number of patients infected by mucormycosis has also dropped,” the officer said. A total of 498 mucormycosis patients underwent major surgeries. The surgeries include removal of eyes or a nasal portion, after being heavily infected by mucormycosis. The number of patients undergoing treatment within the limits of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has dropped from 36 to 18 while the numbers of patients taking treatment in Nashik rural has dropped from 19 to 10. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has welcomed the drop in cases but asked the people to be very careful. “Citizens should be very careful against any spike in cases and ensure protection against Covid,” he said on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-mucormycosis-case-tally-drops-to-28-in-one-month/articleshow/85955279.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The police have arrested the youth, who took the Ludhiana girl along on the pretext of marriage, and his friend for helping him.Cops said, “The main accused is 17-year-old and his friend, a resident of Ghaziabad, is 22-year-old. We are adding Section 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) to the case. The medical examination of the girl will ascertain if she was sexually assaulted or not.”After the girl went missing, her family lodged a complaint with the police and it was found that a neighbour had abducted her on the pretext of marriage.Investigating officer sub-inspector Jaswinder Singh said, “We had the mobile number of the accused, but he had switched it off. His call details showed he had called up his relative in Uttar Pradesh. A police team reached there on August 31 and the relative told them that the accused had called her, saying he had come to Uttar Pradesh in search of work. The relative asked him to contact her acquaintance in Ghaziabad. The police team then reached Ghaziabad.”“There, we saw him in a CCTV footage withdrawing cash from an ATM kiosk of Indirapuram and using debit card at a filling station in the same locality. The Ghaziabad man was also with him. So, we were sure that the accused was in Indirapuram. After we got the location of the Ghaziabad man, we reached Indirapuram,” he added.Inspector Surinder Chopra said, “When the police reached at the location in Indirapuram, the girl and both the accused were there. There are chances that the girl was sexually assaulted. However, it will be ascertained after her medical examination. Thereafter, more sections might be added to the FIR.”The parents of the girl alleged that the accused had been harassing their daughter for some time. They had warned him, but he continued to chase her. A case was then registered under Section 366-A (procuration of minor girl) against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/13-year-old-missing-girl-traced-to-ghaziabad/articleshow/85957353.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Mumbai||BMC to scrap Rs 2 crore per year contract to agency to handle its social media accounts||MUMBAI: After flak for the cost of Rs 2-crore a year contract for managing its social media accounts, BMC said it will scrap its present social media management contract and appoint a new agency by floating fresh tenders. BMC said it has begun drafting a fresh tender. Despite dwindling revenue, BMC awarded a contract worth Rs 5.9 crore to S2 Infotech to manage its 34 Twitter handles from July 2019 to July 2022, without inviting tenders. MLAs and corporators had slammed BMC for spending around Rs 2 crore on Twitter and alleged that there was no technical analysis to gauge the reach and impact of @mybmc, and the 34 other official BMC handles, many of which are unverified. “The three-year contract was given under section 72 (3) of Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act through the state-run Maharashtra IT Corporation to an empanelled agency. The IT department appointed a consultant to gauge the current scope of work along with public relations department. Based on this and human resource requirements, estimates are being prepared for a one-year contract,” deputy municipal commissioner (disaster management) Prabhat Rahangdale said in a written reply to MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh. “Once a new contractor is appointed the existing contract will be closed before its period ends. BMC has so far paid Rs 2.85 crore to Maha IT Corporation for work from July 2019 to February 2021,” Rahangdale stated. While Mumbai Police, one of the first government agencies to join Twitter to address citizens’ grievances, has only one Twitter account, @MumbaiPolice, BMC set up 34 handles, which increased costs and led to confusion, said Shaikh. Corporators and citizens groups said having so many unverified handles creates confusion and poses a security threat, as many fake handles have been set up. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said BMC must have only one handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-scrap-rs-2-crore-per-year-contract-to-agency-to-handle-its-social-media-accounts/articleshow/85962998.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: SMS doctors replant bone of teen after removing cancer||JAIPUR: In a rare surgery, Sawai Man Singh Hospital’s orthopedicians removed one of the femur bones from a 14-year-old boy, sent it for high-dose radiotherapy since it contained a malignant tumour, and returned it to the operation theatre where doctors re-implanted it after getting rid of the sarcoma from the bone within minutes. “The technique is known as extra corporeal radiotherapy and re-implantation (ECRR). It was a six-hour-long surgery, which started at 8.30am. The surgery was done under Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana,” said Dr DS Meena, unit head and senior professor (orthopedics), SMS Medical College. The bone was removed and sent for radiotherapy because the high dose would have been harmful if it was given to the teen. Ewing’s sarcoma is rare and one case in 10 lakh population is generally reported. “The boy belongs to a poor family and his father works as a labourer.The cost of the treatment for Ewing’s sarcoma must be Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh in other hospitals but under Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana, he got it for free,” said Dr Rajkumar Harshwal, associate professor (orthopedics), SMS Hospital, who performed the surgery. It is the third such surgery done with ECRR technique in SMS Medical College, the first being done in January 2016. “We had three options, one was replacing the sarcoma bone with a metallic implant. Second was bringing an allograft from bone bank in Mumbai and implant it in place of sarcoma bone. Since allograft is a bone of a human, there are chances of its rejection. The third was to perform ECRR. Since the first two ECRR done in the hospital were successful, we decided to do it,” said Dr Harshwal. ECRR is a complicated technique as it requires coordinated efforts of radiologists, anesthesia specialists and orthopedicians. Doctors found that 60% of the femur bone was involved by Ewing’s sarcoma. The length of the cancerous part of the bone was 20 cm. The doctors harvested the bone and provided chemical treatment to clean it and sent it to radiotherapy department. Dr Sandeep Jain, unit head of radiotherapy department, ensured that the bone was provided with radiotherapy and returned to the operation theatre in 10 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sms-docs-replant-bone-of-teen-after-removing-cancer/articleshow/85961904.cms||---

The main complaint was lodged by a married woman. The accused has been identified as Md Sameer (20), a resident of Ibrahim Road. Police sources said that during questioning, the youth claimed to have sent these messages to only those women who liked his profile. This made him think that he had already “befriended” them and that these women had a “liking” for him. “We have received a written complaint from a woman’s father, a resident of Ekbalpore, that his daughter was sent some obscene messages between 1am and 1.30am. They were purportedly sent to her by the youth, as the complainant alleged. This was immediately objected to by the woman and her husband. The accused thereafter sent filthy voice messages that outraged the modesty of the complainant's daughter. A specific case under IPC 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) was registered at the local police station. The accused was arrested on Saturday and the mobile phone used by him for the crime was also seized,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-held-for-sending-vulgar-messages-on-instagram/articleshow/85959714.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The health department should conduct vaccination on ‘camp’ mode during the Ganeshotsav and even if the cases start rising. This will help us in minimising mortality,” he said. The number of active cases has been hovering at around 40 for the past month in Yeola taluka even though the number has declined in other parts of the district. “It is important that the number of cases reduces. But that should be the result of testing, tracing and treating all patients. The hospitals should also ensure to cut down on visitors so that the spread, if any, is brought under control,” said Bhujbal. He has also asked the health and other officials to coordinate and find out the reason for the number of Covid cases not declining. Oxygen generation plant has been set up at Yeola sub-district hospital and liquid medical oxygen (LMO) with 13,000 litre capacity has also been set up. This should be commissioned at the earliest, he said. The minister also asked the police authorities to ensure Ganeshotsav was celebrated peacefully and overcrowding is avoided at all times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-stresses-on-vaccination-in-yeola/articleshow/85955334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Senior police officials said that one of the key accused Mohammad Umar visited Bharuch several times over the last two years for conducting the meetings. “Bharuch was an epicentre for planning the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and Shaheenbaug protests. Md Umar and Vadodara resident Salahuddin Sheikh conspired to help the accused in Delhi riots during their meetings in Ankleshwar,” a senior police official said. Investigating officials said that a businessman from the UK had sent Rs 60 crore to Sheikh via Dubai. “This businessman is originally from Nabipur village in Bharuch and hence has a lot of contacts there. So, the meetings to launder hawala money and fund protests were mostly held in Bharuch. The UK-based businessman had organized community meetings there to raise the money,” an investigating official told TOI. “We have got evidence of how a huge portion of the hawala money and even legal donations that Sheikh received were illegally diverted for funding these agitations and financing costs including food expenses of Shaheenbaug protestors,” the official said. The hawala money was sent from Dubai to Mumbai to escape attention of Delhi-based agencies. This money was then routed to Delhi and Gujarat. “Once we get custody of Salahuddin Sheikh and Md Umar, we will get complete details of their contacts in Bharuch. Many more arrests will follow,” the police added. Accused of funding conversion activities across the country, Sheikh had allegedly received nearly Rs 60 crore through hawala and Rs 19 crore by donation for his trust over the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/delhis-anti-caa-protests-conspired-in-bharuch-cops/articleshow/85957908.cms||Tushar Tere

The Nashik Mahanagar Ganeshotsav Mahamandal, led by Sameer Shete, has decided to stick to the norms considering the possibility of the third Covid wave. “We have assured police commissioner Deepak Pandey that we will not take out processions on the days of ‘aagaman’ (arrival) and ‘visarjan’ (immersion). At the same time, we will ensure there is no crowding at the mandals,” said Shete. The mahamandal has asked all its members to stick to government norms including height of idols, numbers of people visiting the mandal at a time, the availability of masks and hand sanitisers at every venue. The Mahamandal have also asked the mandals to ensure that they do not call celebrities for the ‘aarti’ performed every day. “The local civic body elections are due and, therefore, there will be many elements who may be interested in canvassing for themselves or for their leaders. The mandals have been advised against calling the big-shots at of their venues, especially when the presence of such celebrities may lead to crowding,” Shete pointed out. Shete has requested the commissioner of police to arrange for a ‘single window’ system so that there is no harassment of the mandals in seeking the permissions for the celebration. “The mandals have to run from one office to another to get permissions. After the permission from the police, they have to get the NoC from the corporation, then from the fire brigade. After that they seek electrical connections etc. A single window will ensure a hassle-free process,” Shete said. Shete also added that the mandals have been asked to carry out the ‘helmet awareness’ drive in the city so that the people understand the message of personal safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ganesh-mandals-to-follow-govt-norms-during-celebrations/articleshow/85955365.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Shah added, "Uttarakhand finally got it's own cricket association after a 19-year wait, and I purposely took the responsibility of becoming the in-charge of overseeing the running of cricket in Uttarakhand. Currently, Uttarakhand doesn't have it's own stadium, but soon it will get one along with some assistance from CAU secretary Mahim Verma. With it's own stadium and other assets as well, CAU will become aatmanirbhar." Meanwhile, Shukla said, "No association, I am aware of, conducts 55,000 matches every year. Our BCCI secretary Jay Shah is doing a lot for the state association. He has done a lot for Gujarat Cricket like Home Minister Amit Shah and PM Modi have done before Jay Shah took charge."

We will ask the offenders to go through a lecture organised by the counselors on safety measures before they get their two-wheelers back,” said Sitaram Gaikwad, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic). Starting September 9, flying squads of the city police will ensure that all helmetless riders are stopped at the nakabandis and their vehicles are seized. There will be more than 15 nakabandis in the city. The motorists would then be taken to Nashik First training centre, where experts will guide them on road safety in a two-hour session. “Only after producing the certificate of two-hour counselling will the riders get back the vehicles,” Gaikwad said. On August 15, the Nashik city police launched a special No Helmet No Petrol drive. After the first few days, people started coming to the fuel pumps with helmets. However, the cops have observed that while more than 90% of the motorists coming to fuel pumps wore helmets, only 50% on the roads had the safety headgear. “People often fill more fuel in the tank to reduce visits to the petrol pumps to avoid carrying a helmet every day,” said Sanjay Patil, a traffic cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-2-hr-counselling-for-helmetless-riders-in-city/articleshow/85955377.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: ‘Kidnap’ case unearths gold smuggling racket||VIJAYAWADA: In an interesting turn of events, a woman who claimed to be a kidnap victim turned out to be the brains behind a gold smuggling and cheating racket here. PS Nagamani cheated people, mostly employees of railways, to the tune of Rs 7 crore. According to sources in police department, the number of victims is likely to increase. Meanwhile, most of the victims are not coming forward and lodge complaint as they dealt with unaccounted money. Nagamani lodged a complaint against two railway ticket inspectors alleging that they kidnapped her about four days ago. Acting on her complaint, police launched an investigation. But the plot was exposed when the ticket inspectors were questioned by the police. According to sources, Nagamani is in a relationship with one Venkateswara Rao working as chief ticket inspector (CTI) in Vijayawada railway division. She lured people, mostly employees of railways, offering them Rs 5 lakh worth gold for just Rs 4 lakh. She assured them of returning Rs 5 lakh if she could not deliver gold a month after the payment. Nagamani gained the trust of the victims by claiming that she has connections in Saudi Arabia and routes gold from there via Singapore. She even delivered gold to some of them but from the past four months, she neither gave gold nor returned money. Recently, two of the railway employees who gave money to Nagamani demanded their money back. There was a heated exchange of words between them. Later, Nagamani lodged a complaint against the employees alleging that they kidnapped her in a bid to escape from paying the money. However, the police investigation revealed the entire story behind the complaint. As the news broke, more victims started to approach police alleging she has also cheated them after promising gold. Police are also examining the role of Venkateswara Rao and one A Raghavendra Rao both employees of railways in the scam. According to sources, Rao visited Qatar in 2018 along with the Indian sports team as part of Asian Games. He allegedly established some contacts for gold smuggling and started working with Nagamani and Venkateswara Rao. The trio have been running the racket since 2018 and have done several transactions, said sources. M Venkateswarlu, Vijayawada south ACP, said they are still investigating the case to find out all the victims and the amount involved in the scam. Nagamani’s Saudi connections are also being probed, he said. No arrest has been made yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kidnap-case-unearths-gold-smuggling-racket/articleshow/85959775.cms||---

Teachers said that now most school managements expected them to join back with no assurance on pending dues or commitment on full salaries this year. The pandemic even led to at least 43 teachers dying during the last 18 months, with 35 being suicides, the Telangana Private Teachers’s Forum (TPTF) said. Stressing that the state must support them amid this crisis as they worked equally hard as government teachers, TPTF president Shabir Ali said: “While government teachers are being felicitated on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, we are struggling even for basics. There is no recognition or job security for us despite private teachers teaching more than 50% of students in the state.” He said that the state should announce ex gratia for the families of private teachers who lost their lives during the pandemic. “All these deaths are because of the financial crisis,” said Ali, adding that many teachers had to take up odd jobs for survival as most managements did not even bother to check on them. Of the total 52.85 lakh students in Telangana, over 31.91 lakh students are in private schools. In all, there are over 10,000 private schools in which more than 3 lakh teachers were employed until schools shut down last year. According to TPTF, hardly 50,000 teachers have rejoined as managements were unwilling to give any assurance on salaries. The teachers have now demanded that the state should ensure that they were paid their pending salaries and management be directed to rehire those who were sacked amid the pandemic. “The managements are not even talking about our pending salaries. They are expecting us to forgo everything and join back,” said Bhaskar R, a private teacher, adding that they should be given assurance that they would be paid full salaries this academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-must-help-us-get-back-jobs-pay-pvt-teachers/articleshow/85963000.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools take middle path, stream classes live for students at home||HYDERABAD: With physical classes resuming in the state from September 1, the online or digital classes are now giving way to live classes as many schools have decided to live stream from the classroom for the benefit of those studying from home instead of using apps or sharing recorded content. Managements said that apart from aiding students who are not ready to attend physical classes, sharing the live stream will increase transparency and also keeps a tab on corporal punishment. “Most of the schools have opted for the hybrid model so that they can cater to students studying in online and offline mode at the same time,” said B Shiva, a mathematics teacher working in a well-known group of schools in the city. He said that this mode will also help in completing the syllabus as they need not alternate between online and offline classes. Teachers said that staff scarcity is one of the reasons why managements are opting for the hybrid model. While few said that students, especially those attending classes remotely, are finding it hard to follow the concepts in the hybrid model, others pointed out that hybrid classes are better than digital classes. “When a student is unable to physically attend class, livestreaming is the best option as they get to learn from the subject teacher and interact with other students and teacher,” said M Ravindar, a government teacher.Private budget school managements, meanwhile, said that they too are going to opt for a hybrid model instead of app-based teaching. “Schools which have resumed physical classes have already shifted to the hybrid model. Remaining schools will make the shift once they start offline classes,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association adding that about 50% of budget schools are yet to reopen schools. Managements said that apart from aiding students who are not ready to attend physical classes, sharing the live stream will increase transparency||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-take-middle-path-stream-classes-live-for-students-at-home/articleshow/85963001.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Meerut||UP kisan mahapanchayat, attended by over a lakh, calls for Bharat bandh on September 27||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Farmers in large numbers converged on the Government Inter College Ground at Muzaffarnagar for the mahapanchayat on Sunday. While the district administration estimated a turnout of 1 lakh, the unions said 10 lakh had arrived in the city over 24 hours for the “historic” meeting. “We have kicked off 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' from this stage. We will not let BJP win the upcoming elections,” said a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer organisations, which organised the mahapanchayat. “The Muzaffarnagar kisan mazdoor mahapanchayat will be remembered as a historic day and will prove to be a turning point in the Indian political landscape.” Farmers unions have called for a “Bharat bandh” on September 27. When TOI visited the grounds, which can hold a lakh, it was packed beyond capacity, with crowds spilling over onto the streets and even on the flyover next to the venue. Women and young farmers had turned up in huge numbers. Muzaffarnagar was a fortress where, SKM said, farmers from 16 states had arrived for the mahapanchayat. “Farmers won’t be polarised by communal politics. Let us chant Allah Hu Akbar and Har Har Mahadev together,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, sharing the stage with BKU national president Naresh Tikait, social activist Medha Patkar, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav and influential farmer leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola. A founding member of BKU, Jola had quit the organisation after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Announcing a farmer association for UP, like SKM, Tikait said it will “defeat the Yogi (Adityanath) government” in 2022. “They sold our rivers, our water. We will not let them sell our land … I will lay down my life if needed but will not leave the protest site until we emerge victorious,” he added. “The struggle for Independence went on for 90 years. I have no idea how long ours will continue.” A host of farmer leaders, each addressing the gathering for a minute or two, spoke from the dais. All of them said the protests would continue until the government promised a “legal guarantee of MSP.” Not even 20% of the promised procurement has been done, they said. While the state government had promised loan waivers for 86 lakh farmers, only 45 lakh had received it, they added. And the number of farmers in UP who got crop insurance dropped from 72 lakh in 2016-17 to 47 lakh in 2019-20, they further said. “We will not give up. The government cancelled two trains in which farmers from Ambala and Delhi were coming to Muzaffarnagar. They stopped our buses on the highway. They installed jammers so there could be no live coverage,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of BKU. The next meeting, the farmer leaders said, will be in Lucknow. “Yogi asked Tikait sahib to come to Lucknow,” a farmer leader said. “We have come up to Muzaffarnagar. We will soon be in Lucknow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/lakhs-of-farmers-from-16-states-gather-for-up-mahapanchayat/articleshow/85957514.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||2,600 children lost both their parents to Covid-19 in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has identified 2,600 child and 219 adult beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Vatsalya Yojana, launched to help state residents — below the age of 21 years — who were orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the preliminary data compiled by the state government, at least 2,600 children (below 18 years of age) have lost both their parents to Covid-19 in the state since the outbreak of the pandemic. Besides, 219 others, in the age group of 18-21 years, were orphaned during the pandemic. The latest data from the state women empowerment and child development department reveals that 1,706 children, who were orphaned during the pandemic, are being provided free education (till Class XII) and are being given a stipend of Rs 3,000 per month under the Mukhyamantri Vatsalya Yojana. “The data from hill districts suggests that fewer children lost their parents in that phase in comparison to the plains. However, our data collection process to identify these children is ongoing because we suspect that more children might need the state government’s support,” said Rekha Arya, women empowerment and child development minister of Uttarakhand. District-wise, the highest cases of children being orphaned during the pandemic surfaced from Dehradun (561), followed by Tehri (348), Pauri (313), Nainital (310), Haridwar (256), Udham Singh Nagar (242), Almora (177), Uttarkashi (164), Champawat (132), Rudraprayag (103), Pithoragarh (93), Bageshwar (73), and Chamoli (57). Based on available data, the state has started giving benefits of the scheme to 309 orphans from Dehradun, 270 from Nainital, 208 from Tehri, 154 from Haridwar, 141 from Udham Singh Nagar, 137 from Uttarkashi, 121 from Pauri, 85 from Champawat, 70 from Almora, 75 from Rudraprayag, 58 from Bageshwar, 50 from Pithoragarh, and 28 from Chamoli. Meanwhile, more applications to avail of the scheme are being scrutinised by respective district administrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2-6k-children-lost-both-their-parents-to-covid-19-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/85957477.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS’ focus shifts after civic polls disappointment||HYDERABAD: Against the backdrop of a resurgent BJP, the ruling TRS has decided to focus on strengthening the party in Greater Hyderabad and regain some of its lost ground in the state capital. After a good performance in 2016-GHMC polls—which saw TRS sweeping 99 out of the total 150 divisions—and emerging victorious in 14 of the 24 constituencies in the city in 2018-Assembly elections, the graph of the ruling party has been on the decline in Greater Hyderabad. The TRS failed to win Secunderabad and Malkajgiri constituencies in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In fact, the TRS has never won the two parliamentary constituencies despite the fact that these two constituencies comprise a major geographical area and voters of Greater Hyderabad. Another major Parliamentary seat of Hyderabad was regained by TRS’ friendly party AIMIM. The only solace for the TRS was that it moved to second place in 2019 parliamentary elections from the fourth place it ended up in 2014-Lok Sabha polls in Secunderabad constituency. In Malkajgiri, the TRS continued to end up second place in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But what hit the ruling party badly was its below par performance in the elections held to 150 wards of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in 2020. Despite TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself participating in the campaign by addressing a public meeting, the pink party managed to win only 55 of the total 150 divisions in GHMC. A resurgent BJP won 48 seats, a tally which was reduced to 47 later after it lost the Lingojiguda by-poll to the Congress. With TRS supremo and CM KCR having decided to restructure the party from village to the state level, TRS working president and municipal minister KT Rama Rao has shifted his focus on strengthening the party right from the slum and basthi level to the division and Assembly constituency level in Greater Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-focus-shifts-after-civic-polls-disappointment/articleshow/85963012.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC finds 20-year-old US citizen alert, rejects parents’ plea for evaluation||MUMBAI: Bombay high court dismissed a couple’s petition which sought directions for a health expert’s evaluation to “safeguard the interest and mental health” of their child, an over 20-year-old US citizen who came to India to study in 2019 and has been here since. The parents, also permanent US inhabitants but currently in the city, had invoked the high court’s plenary powers and the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 for a writ of habeas corpus to produce ‘S’ (name given by HC to the child to protect identity) as they expressed grave concern after seeing a “sudden” and “disturbing personality change accompanied by irrational anger” last year. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, in their August 25 order, after speaking and interacting with the child of the petitioners (whose names too the HC withheld), said, “We do not find any justifiable material which makes out a strong prima facie case that requires such evaluation.” The parents said the child had come to India from the US to pursue a course at an academy near Mumbai in November 2019. In the second half of last year they became “alarmed” at the communication they received from their child and “threats” of harm to self and others. The parents said they petitioned the HC as their efforts to persuade officers of the state to act “turned futile”. Their petition through Jaykar & Partners also focused on Section 100 of the Mental Healthcare Act which “casts a duty on every officer in-charge of a police station to take under protection any person whom he has reason to believe to be suffering from mental illness”. The judges interacted with ‘S’ for a “fair length” in chamber at the first hearing and suggested mediation between child and parents to bridge their distance. ‘S’ declined consent for a mediation process on August 6 and the parents’ senior counsel D Khambata with Mohan Jaykar said directions for an expert evaluation is warranted, given their concern. Khambata argued that choice of words “betray a deep problem, which ‘S’ appears to be grappling with’’ and cited a certificate by a doctor that suggested presence of a behavioural disorder linked to “depressive features”.The HC gave the matter its “anxious consideration’’ and found ‘S’ to be “mentally alert and fully alive to developments unfolding around’’ with a “strong sense of individuality’’ to live life on own terms. The HC said ‘S’ expressed regret for some alarming communication and “took full responsibility for actions’’ pursued. It said “it seems relentless efforts’’ by the parents to wean away ‘S’ from the course alienated them further. It said Supreme Court requires the court to “see to it that a person’s right to defend himself must be adequately protected” and cannot order a “roving inquiry’’. Having interacted with ‘S’, HC said it was “unable to infer” need for an evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-finds-20-yr-old-us-citizen-alert-rejects-parents-plea-for-evaluation/articleshow/85963027.cms||Swati Deshpande

He questioned the IAS officer as to who ordered the probe into of land-grabbing allegations. “Who gave him the power to order the probe,” he questioned pointing at the Mysuru regional commissioner GC Prakash’s probe into the charges pertaining to the land grabbing in the vicinity of the convention hall. “When the Mysuru regional commissioner has probed the land grabbing charges in Mysuru and submitted the report, who gave the authority to Moudgil to order another probe? What is the use of ordering another probe when the officials from his own department have investigated it and submitted a report,” he asked.“Some babus, especially IAS officers, are under the impression that they are honest and efficient while others are corrupt. We need to fight against such mindset,” he told reporters. He said IAS officials have indulged in revenge politics. Somashekar said Moudgil is yet to complete his task of correcting the land records in the aftermath of farm loan waivers even two years after he was assigned the task. “He is yet to correct the land documents related to 53,000 farmers, but he is keen to order another probe into an issue which has been investigated already,” he stated. Moudgil had ordered the probe on August 31 following a petition filed by a Mysuru-based activist and has sought the report in 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/sts-lashes-out-at-moudgil-for-new-probe-into-land-grabbing-allegations/articleshow/85957509.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Sanjay, teachers were scared that chief minister KCR might disband the teacher’s unions, hence they voted for TRS in the MLC election. He advised teachers not to be fearful, saying that if they are afraid, they will be unable to fulfil their duty in shaping the country. He said that the replacement of new teacher positions is not in the works and that many schools are cutting their teaching staff. In an appeal to all teachers in the state to support his padayatra, he said that teachers have a history of changing governments and that there is no need to fear anyone anymore since the BJP will stay by them.

---||Ahmedabad||Cow entrepreneurship derailed||Ahmedabad: The hugely successful cow entrepreneurship network which the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog (RKA) built over the past two and a half years appears to be getting derailed as the aayog has been defunct since February this year. Cow entrepreneurs feel it will become increasingly difficult for them to market their products in the absence of a nodal agency like the RKA to connect them with prospective buyers. Acting as a facilitator, the RKA got cow entrepreneurs across the country to take up the task of making several items from cow products like cow dung and cow urine. Last festive season, the RKA set a target of making over 10,000 Ganesha idols and helped cow entrepreneurs sell much more than the target. Similarly it set a target of making 11 crore ‘diyas’ (Diwali lamps) last year, and they were made and sold in the festive season. A source who has been connected with cow entrepreneurship programmes said that while cow entrepreneurs have now begun networking on their own to market their items, then absence of a nodal agency like RKA will make it increasingly difficult for them to market their products. However, sources said that “unscientific claims” made by the RKA have been responsible for the predicament of cow entrepreneurs. “The announcement of conduction of Gau Vigyan Prachar-Prasar Examination by RKA was a flashpoint as claims made in its study material were construed to be unscientific in nature,” said a source. The examination – meant to be held in four categories from primary school level to post graduate level – which was scheduled to be held on February 25 this year, was postponed and no fresh dates have been announced. The term of Vallabh Kathiria as chairman of RKA ended on February 20 and no new chairman has been named since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cow-entrepreneurship-derailed/articleshow/85959892.cms||---

The MLA, Ajit Yadav, on the occasion of 'Sampoorna Samadhan Divas' in Gunnaur on Saturday claimed, “The lekhpals are corrupt. They take bribes from people who visit them, and ask people to get liquor for them before doing their work. The district administration must intervene in the matter. Several people are turning up with their complaints on every 'samadhan divas' as these matters are never taken up.” “Taking legal action against even one such person would send a strong message among others. If complaints are received against me, take legal action against me as well,” Yadav added, pointing out that he would take up the matter with "higher authorities" if the issue is not addressed at a local level. Several people thronged the 'Sampoorna Samadhan Divas' event held under Gunnaur police station limits to address public grievances.

If approved by the government, this rule is likely to come into effect at the end of this month, according to health department sources. “The proposal will be first implemented in Hyderabad as 90% of city population has received their first dosage,” an official said. Telangana has been given 1.1 crore doses by the Centre for September and October. Apart from Hyderabad and neighbouring districts, in most districts the first dose has not even touched 80%. The health department is now trying to ensure that at least 80% of the population in each district receives their first vaccination before Dasara. “Many people are hesitant to take the vaccine in districts. Therefore, the rule is being proposed to be implemented only in Hyderabad for now. Once the rule is in place in the city, others will come to take the jab,” an official stated. With schools being opened in the state since September 1, chief secretary Somesh Kumar has directed staff to go all out to speed up the vaccination drive. Earlier, the GHMC launched a house-to-house contact effort in the last week of August in approximately 4,856 colonies. In Hyderabad district, 28.9 lakh have received their first dose out of 39.9 lakh. In GHMC areas of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal, a total of 24.2 lakh have received both doses, while while 64.5 lakh are yet to take the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-1st-dose-may-soon-be-must-to-enter-public-places-in-hyd/articleshow/85963028.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The Congress has objected to fresh maintenance tenders for the enclosure, alleging that costs have been inflated. BMC has floated a tender of around Rs 15 crore for the upkeep of the seven penguins housed in the enclosure for three years, amounting to an annual bill of around Rs 5 crore. “The existing contract will end soon. The ongoing contract was also for three years and was started in September 2018. This was a Rs 11.5-crore contract,” the official said. Asked about costs, he said, “The money will be spent on maintenance and air-conditioning of the enclosure, life support and electrical systems. It will also cover veterinary costs and feed.” In July 2916, BMC brought eight Humboldt penguins from Coex Aquarium, Seoul, South Korea. It spent Rs 2.5 crore on the procurement. Zoo authorities came under fire after a one-and-a-half-year-old penguin, Dory, died in October 2016 due to intestinal complications. Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is opposition leader in BMC, said, “This kind of high maintenance cost is not justified. BMC is spending more on this than on hospitals. It must review the cost of penguin maintenance. In five years, BMC should have built in-house maintenance capacities. The enclosure has become a white elephant for the BMC and a golden egg-laying hen for tainted contractors,”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-attacks-rs-15cr-tender-for-penguin-pen/articleshow/85963033.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

These applications represent solar power projects with the aggregate generation capacity of 1,546.45MW. However, 1,400 applicants with the cumulative capacity of 955MW have not applied for the exit option. They will continue to set up solar projects in Gujarat under the state’s policy for the development of small-scale distributed solar projects (SSDSP-2019), said sources aware of the developments. In early August, GUVNL had announced a onetime exit option for small-scale distributed power developers to walk out of power purchase agreements (PPAs) they had signed with the state-run company. The agreements were for solar projects to be established under the SSDSP policy. GUVNL had extended the last date for the submission of written request and prescribed undertaking to September 5, 2021. With this, about 65% of the total number of applicants have decided to exit PPAs and 62% of the total capacity has been offered for surrender. The exit option was provided to the developers after many of them complained of project unviability following the state government clarification that the projects under the SSDSP policy will not be eligible for any subsidy. The four discoms affiliated to GUVNL had signed PPAs at a tariff of Rs 2.83 per unit for 4,005 small-scale solar power projects with cumulative power generation capacity of 2,501MW under this policy. Initially, the projects were estimated to bring an investment over Rs 10,000 crore in green energy and allied sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/small-solar-projects-2605-applications-for-one-time-exit/articleshow/85962061.cms||Kalpesh Damor

He said that the chief minister believes that poverty should not come in the way of children getting good education. He said the state government has initiated revolutionary programmes in the education sector to make the children from the downtrodden sections to compete with the affluent sections in society. He appealed to teachers to take lead in shaping young brains as assets of the nation by making use of latest infrastructure being readied by the government. Addressing a virtual conference held on the occasion of Teachers’ Day on Sunday, Sajjala said students were spending more time with the teachers rather than at home particularly after the arrival of latest technologies. He said that top class teachers were accessible to students in remote locations. “Teachers have always had a bigger role to play in shaping the careers of students and their responsibilities have only increased in the recent past,” said Sajjala. He said that the government is spending close to Rs 16,000 crore on Nadu-Nedu to renovate all public schools in the state. Education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh said that the government is taking measures for upgrading skills of teachers by providing them quality training with experts. He said availability of quality teachers was crucial to provide quality education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-focusing-on-quality-edu-for-poor-students-says-sajjala/articleshow/85959939.cms||Samdani MN
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: After dengue, diarrhoea emerges as new threat to kids in Firozabad||AGRA: After confirmation of a dengue outbreak in Firozabad district by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and a few cases of other vector-borne diseases, diarrhoea has emerged as a new threat to children, according to health department sources. More than 40% of the estimated 150 patients reporting at the government centres are children suffering from diarrhoea, they said. This is posing a fresh challenge to hospitals with beds already full with patients suffering from high fever, body ache and low platelets. On Sunday afternoon, the Firozabad Medical College was fully occupied with more than 500 patients suffering from dengue-like symptoms admitted there. Out of these two-third were children. Patients were adjusted in corridors and even the storeroom of the hospital. The toll in the district rose to 79 on Sunday with four more deaths reported in the last 24 hours. In fact, in the past three weeks, at least three people died of dengue-like fever on an average every day in Firozabad district and most of them were children. The situation in Firozabad is so grim that patients in critical condition are now being referred from Firozabad without any diagnosis and initial treatment, claimed doctors in Agra. Additional director of the health department, Agra division, AK Singh confirmed a spurt in diarrhoea cases at government centres. He advised, “People need to maintain sanitation and hygiene and ensure drinking water is clean. Special care needs to be taken where children are concerned.” In reply to another query, he said, “We are increasing the number of beds. There is no shortage of platelets or required medicines at the government centres. Additional ambulances have been arranged to ferry patients to hospital. Civic body teams are carrying out special cleanliness drives in the affected areas. Helpline numbers have also been issued. All the recent deaths of patients suffering from viral fever are being investigated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-dengue-diarrhoea-emerges-as-new-threat-to-kids-in-firozabad/articleshow/85957532.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad prisons were industrious even before Jail na Bhajiya!||AHMEDABAD: The prison at Sabarmati might be famous today for its ‘jail na bhajiya’ near RTO, but even before that, the city jails were industrious, mention the book, ‘Jail: History and Present’ published recently by the state prisons department. The book mentions that before Sabarmati Central Jail, which became functional in 1894, the city had two prisons in the early 19th century – one in Azam Khan Sarai besides Bhadra fort, and another in the area identified as ‘Dhuliakot.’ ‘The convicts were employed to make carpets, carpentry and weaving, whereas the city’s parks and gardens were maintained by the undertrial prisoners... The new norms of the prison – as part of a major reform in 1854 – mandated training the convicts in at least one trade. According to records, the skills training worked well for both the inmates and the jail. The sales even managed the expenses of the prison department due to its quality goods,’ mentions the book. Today the prisons department of Gujarat produces goods worth Rs 8 crore annually as products made behind the bars include furniture, cloth, phenyl, sanitary napkins, bakery products, Ganesha idols and so on. Anecdotes Snippets from Behind the Bars: Excerpts from the prison department bookSardar’s only ‘literary work’ at Sabarmati JailSardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s correspondence and speeches are part of India’s freedom movement and post-Independence era. But his own writings are very few. One of such rare publications is the diary that he maintained during his imprisonment at Sabarmati Central Jail ahead of the historic Dandi March in 1930. The work is now a book: ‘Sardar ni Jail diary.’ Sabarmati Jail seen through literary luminariesThe Sabarmati Central Jail also provided the backdrop of two well-known non-fictions of Gujarati language. While Kakasaheb Kalelkar wrote prose about his time at the jail in 1923 in ‘Otrati Diwalo,’ Jhaverchand Meghani – whose 125th birth anniversary is celebrated this year – gave voice to the window of the prison to report all it witnessed in ‘Jail office ni bari’ written in 1930. Both were however on different ends of the spectrum from description of trees and birds in the former, to pleas of inmates in the latter. Several other writers such as Swami Anand, Dayalji Desai, Pranshankar Bhatt, Indulal Yagnik, etc. had also served time in  Sabarmati Jail. Jail superintendent and medical officer get the first dish from prison kitchenIn 1928, Mahatma Gandhi famously rubbished the claims of the government officials about the good quality of the food served in Sabarmati Jail with account of ‘wretched greens and hotchpotch of dry leaves inducing stomach ache’ by the Satyagrahis. Today, the food quality is assessed by the jail superintendent and staff doctor who get the first dish after the meals are prepared. The meal timings are 9am and 4pm. One-third of convicts get education, degreesPrison officials said that the correctional facilities include reforming the inmates and preparing them for life outside the walls of prison. Officials said that out of 3,000-odd convicts across the state, one-third get enrolled and get at least one certificate/ diploma/ degree before they get released. The former prisoners often employ their skills once released to start their own ventures or get jobs. Election behind barsLike the elections of panchayat, the jail inmates also have their own ‘qaidi panchayat.’ Conducted annually in December, the election witnesses canvassing by the candidates, allocation of election symbols and ballot voting. The elected members, identified as ‘Sevak,’ have a one-year period in office where they look after health, sanitation, food quality and coordination with prison staff. Seven hangings in state prison since 1960Since the foundation of the Gujarat state, the prisons have recorded seven death penalties by hanging. The first hanging was in July 1962 in Ahmedabad prison of Kodar Mala, followed by Chunilal Jadavji and Diego Anthony in Rajkot in 1963, Amra Kanji in Vadodara in 1964, and Batuk Raghavji and Rony Jack in Rajkot in 1965. The last death by hanging was recorded in 1989 when Shashikant Mali got the capital punishment in Rajkot prison. Jadavji and Anthony had donated their eyes, whereas Mali had donated his body. Qaidi No. 6,357M K Gandhi was denoted the number 6,357 when he was brought to Sabarmati Central Jail in 1922. The preserved records of prison mention his age as 53 and height as 5’6”. The identity mark was mentioned as a white glazed mark on his left chest and raised brown mole on neck. His profession was shown as ‘cultivator and weaver.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-prisons-were-industrious-even-before-jail-na-bhajiya/articleshow/85962167.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Now, companies to make potable water from atmosphere||HYDERABAD: Ever wondered whether the water droplets formed on the surface of a cold bottle kept outside the refrigerator for a while can be tapped for drinking? Well! It is exactly what scientists are up to now, with an endeavour to generate water from atmospheric air to make packaged drinking water, top officials of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) said on Sunday. BIS has just granted a licence to a company to produce packaged drinking water with the help of a new technology that uses giant Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs). An AWG uses refrigeration techniques to condense the humidity from moisture-laden air. It draws air from the atmosphere and the air flows into the machine through a filtration system where contaminants up to 10 microns are filtered out, explained KV Rao, head of Hyderabad BIS. “The filtered air then passes over the condenser, where cooling coils are in the path. This provides a temperature differential between the air and the coil surface, resulting in condensation and formation of water in a gigantic water tank,” he explained. The water in the tank then goes to ultra-filtration water purification system to remove solids and odour, if any. Then it is dosed with added minerals, further treated with UV and ozonised to eliminate micro-organisms, explained Praneeth, plant manager of Iconic Technologies, known for its technical expertise. Officials said the technology will also help in reducing the load on groundwater. A total of seven AWGs, each having a capacity of generating 1,000 litres of water per day and having energy consumption of 9 kilowatt per hour (KWH), will be used to begin with. “Output of AWG depends on prevailing atmospheric conditions like Relative Humidity(RH), and temperature. Moreover, extracting moisture from the air won’t affect the natural balance as moisture from air is an everlasting source of water,” Praneeth explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-cos-to-make-potable-water-from-atmosphere/articleshow/85963036.cms||Sunil Mungara

The employees have also requested for a meeting on to resolve the disputes. Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Officers’ Association and the Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Employees’ Union have written to Naik urging him to resolve the disputes of the staff. “We request your appointment on Monday at the head office to discuss and sort out all the issues and grievances of the staff members,” said president of the association and the union Prasanna Utagi in a letter to Naik. The bank’s licence was cancelled on July 27 and Naik, a former bureaucrat, was appointed as the liquidator for settling the accounts of the bank and winding up the operations. At a meeting on August 23, the staff members and officers had urged Naik to pay the salaries for July and August before Ganesh Chaturthi. “We hope that the salary for the months of July and August would be released shortly with the updating of the withheld benefits with effect from January 2018,” said Utagi adding that the arrears towards the withheld benefits should be released as the staff members are going through financial and psychological stress. The union has also said that the stance regarding the service benefits taken by the management after the bank’s licence was cancelled was contrary to the provisions of the bipartite memorandum of the settlement signed by the management and the officers’ association and the employees’ Union on July 29, 2010. “The circular has irked all the staff members and there is a great resentment against the managing director due to the same,” Utagi said. The staff and officers have also demanded an apology from the managing director for threatening the staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/madgaum-urban-staff-want-pending-wages-paid-before-chaturthi/articleshow/85960074.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Move to hire agency to guard premises turns controversial||Pune: The proposal to recruit a security agency to guard all premises and offices of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has led to a controversy. The political parties in the opposition, including NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress, have opposed the proposal claiming that it favours a particular BJP leader, who runs the firm that has bagged the contract. The civic body will spend Rs41 crore on appointing the security guards. The standing committee has approved the proposal. The opposition parties are now trying to get the proposal reviewed and rejected. The ruling BJP has supported the process and allotment of tender. “The corporators of opposition parties have not expressed their dissent in the tenders while it was discussed at the meeting. The due process was carried out for allotment of the tender,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of BJP in PMC. As per PMC data, 666 guards’ posts have been approved in total, while 345 are filled and 321 remain vacant. According to the proposal, security will be provided at water purification plants, swimming pools, hospitals, cultural centres, vehicle department, gardens and crematoriums. The tender to recruit the security personnel was issued in May 2021. The process was completed in July. “We are against the proposal. The approval of tender may cause financial losses to the civic body. So, it should be scrapped,” said NCP corporator Prashant Jagtap. “The tenders have not been issued with good intent. We must oppose it. The bids have been called to favour a company, which is run by BJP MLAs. The terms and conditions for the tender have been set to favour these leaders,” said Arvind Shinde, a Congress corporator. Bala Oswal, a Shiv Sena corporator, added that the tenders seem inflated. “The civic body has to allot the tenders to those, who are offering services at minimum rate. However, the tenders for the security agency have been given at a very high price. So, we have demanded to stop this allotment of work,” he said. Six companies had submitted their proposals and of them four were unable to validate proposals due to technical issues. Some of them had no experience certificate, while some had not renewed their licence for deployment of security guards. Eventually, only two companies were considered for awarding the contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/move-to-hire-agency-to-guard-premises-turns-controversial/articleshow/85960050.cms||---

Later, a video showing the crowd chasing her, began to trend on social media.  The protesters said they were reacting against the journalist and the TV channel she represented for an alleged bias in reporting farm protests. According to the police, the woman journalist was reporting from the Mahaveer Chowk outside the GIC Ground where the mahapanchayat was being held, when a bunch of people started raising slogans against her. Within minutes, a huge crowd gathered on the spot and stopped her from reporting. She was chased by the crowd, following which, she was escorted to a local press office. When the crowd also gathered outside the press office and began to raise slogans, a local police team led by SP (city) Arpit Vijayavargiya moved her to safety with the help of local journalists. Later, the visibly shaken woman journalist said, “I am safe and want to thank the police officer and journalist friends who helped me.” Asked about the incident, the BKU media in-charge, Dharmender Malik, said, “The incident happened outside the mahapanchayat venue. We made special arrangements for the media and have full respect for them.

It advised the BJP leaders to go through the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry before criticising the state government.  Speaking to the media at the party office, YSRC legislator Malladi Vishnu said the government appealed to the public to celebrate the festival indoors in view of Covid-19. He said the Union home secretary had on August 18 asked all the states to take appropriate measures to prevent mass gatherings during the festival season in view of the pandemic situation. “The state government had suspended the Teachers’ Day celebrations and the YSR Lifetime Awards function in the backdrop of the spread of Covid-19.” Vishnu criticised BJP state chief Somu Veerraju for trying to create a communal rift. “The state government had also imposed curbs during Ramzan, Bakrid and Muharram. The government is acting with the utmost responsibility. BJP leaders are creating unnecessary controversies,” Vishnu claimed.  “People were not allowed even at Independence Day celebrations as part of Covid-19 regulations. Police have been taking measures to prevent mass gatherings at private functions and festivals. It has become a regular practice for BJP leaders to link chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s religious belief with the government decisions,” Vishnu added.  He asked BJP leaders to focus on getting more funds and projects from the Centre and stop divisive politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/row-over-ganesh-chaturthi-pandals-unnecessary-says-ysrc-legislator/articleshow/85960071.cms||Samdani MN

The government has approved a proposal of Rs 6.5 crore to set up the first floating jetty in coastal Karnataka, said Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath. He was speaking at the launch of eight insulated cold storage trucks of the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC) here on Monday. The proposed floating jetty will come up near the Old Port where work on the third phase of fisheries harbour is under progress. The state cabinet has approved Rs 22 crore for the completion of the third phase of the fisheries harbour. Meanwhile, a jetty to anchor traditional boats of fishermen will be constructed at Thota Bengre at an estimated cost of Rs 3.5 crore. A proposal to upgrade the Old Port by providing all basic amenities at an estimated cost of nearly Rs 100 crore has been sent to the Central government after it was approved by the state government. Altogether, the government has proposed 16 development projects in the fisheries sector spending nearly Rs 1,100 crore in the coastal districts of the state, the MLA said. In his inaugural address, minister for fisheries, port and inland water transport S Angara said the government has plans to promote inland fishing along with marine fisheries. Cautioning about the harmful effects of excessive fishing on the marine ecology, the minister said fishermen have the responsibility of protecting the fish species as well. He added that the fisheries department will set up cold storage units at various places to ensure supply of fresh fish. He suggested that arecanut farmers, who have suffered loss due to yellow leaf disease in plantations, may consider pisciculture as an ideal alternative. KFDC chairman Nithin Kumar said the insulated cold storage vehicles have been procured at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). The corporation has procured three trucks with four-ton capacity, four with two-ton capacity and another one-ton capacity vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/floating-jetty-for-mangaluru-coast-planned-mla/articleshow/85986902.cms||---

The ED had summoned Parab too in the case to record his statement, but he sought two weeks’ exemption. During the money-laundering case investigation against Deshmukh, the ED recorded statements of a few accused and witnesses who told them that Kharmate had collected money from government officials, including police officers, for helping them secure plum postings. The ED wants to examine if Kharmate has any financial connection with Deshmukh or Parab. Last week, the ED had raided Kharmate’s premises in Pune and found that he had allegedly amassed ill-gotten wealth by managing postings in government departments. The agency also found that Kharmate, along with a relative, ran three franchisees of a multinational electronics appliances company, two franchisees of a branded jewellery company in Pune, and owned the premises where these establishments were housed. The ED also found that he owned a commercial premise in Pune which he rented out to a public sector bank apart from substantial land parcels at his village.

The TRS government had last released Rs 1,200 crore towards payment of interest on loans obtained by SHGs before the Assembly polls in 2018. Now, with an eye on the vote bank of women, the government announced release of Rs 54 crore to SHGs in Huzurabad Assembly constituency, he said. Uttam alleged that the government has not been paying the interest on the loans taken by the Woman Self Help Groups) scheme (interest-free loans to women SHGs) after K Chandrasekhar Rao took over as the Chief Minister for the second term in December 2018. He charged the TRS government of even stopping payment of ex-gratia to the family members of the deceased. The government has to pay Rs 25,000 in case of natural death and Rs 75,000 for accidental death within 24 hours. “What’s more, the government is exerting pressure on the SHGs to pay the interest from their own pockets to the banks. During the election campaign, KCR had promised to increase the Rs 5 lakh loan component to Rs 10 lakh for the SHGs and that the government would pay the interest on it,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-owes-rs-4-2k-cr-to-shgs-uttam/articleshow/85963052.cms||---

The city’s reputed sweet houses are eagerly awaiting orders from Ganesh pandal organisers to prepare jumbo sized laddus. Auctioning laddus has been a three-decade-long tradtion in the city. “This year we have decided to auction the Balapur laddu. In fact, last year, for the first time since 1994, the Balapur Ganesh Utsav Samithi did not auction the 21-kg laddu because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, the laddu auction had fetched Rs 17.60 lakh. We hope that this year the prasadam may fetch more,” Kallem Niranjan Reddy, president of Balapur Ganesh Utsav Samithi, told TOI. In 2020, a 100-kg laddu was offered by the Tapeswaram sweet-maker to the jumbo Khairatabad Ganesha idol. But doubt persists over the offering of a Tapeswaram laddu to the Khairatabad Ganesha this year as the sweet-maker—PVVS Mallikarajuna Rao (Malle Babu)— has not taken a decision yet. “We have been preparing the Ganesh laddus in different sizes for more than a decade. This year, preparing a laddu with all ingredients, including dry fruits, has become a costly affair. Last year, the price of the sweet material was Rs 560 per kg. This time, the price has gone up to Rs 700 per kg. We will prepare Ganesh laddus based on orders received from the pandal organisers,” a popular sweet house in Banjara Hills said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/big-biddings-for-ganesh-laddu-prasadam-set-to-make-a-return/articleshow/85963055.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ludhiana||Nine months on, Ludh-Delhi NH is still not fully repaired||Khanna: Nine months after a portion of the main flyover on Ludhiana-Delhi national highway had caved in here, a part of the stretch remains problematic for commuters as it is yet to be fully repaired. A road safety expert said it was the main highway, and keeping national security in mind, it should have been repaired within days. In November last year, part of the stretch from Ludhiana to Delhi had caved in near Amloh Road and the authorities had attributed the collapse to rodents, who fed on the garbage dumped near it. The authorities had diverted the vehicles to service lanes, causing a traffic mess for commuters coming from Amritsar, Jammu, Jalandhar, Ludhiana on way to Delhi. However, even as the road was fixed in January this year, it again needed repairs, which had been undertaken recently. The Times of India found that the road construction agency had dug up the right side (from Ludhiana towards Delhi) for repairs, and it is yet to complete the work. Diversions continue on either side of the road with traffic being turned to a single lane on a small stretch. NHAI officials said the road was dug up on the left side of the four-laned way because of some technical issues after it was repaired following the cave-in. They added that after it was repaired, the road was dug up on the right side too as it was a part of the problematic stretch.NHAI project director didn’t respond to repeated calls, but sources in the authority claimed that the repair would be completed soon. Road safety expert Kamaljit Soi, who is member of National Road Safety Council, said, “They don’t have the resources and the will to carry out repairs. The road, which is part of the national highway network from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and has major defence-related significance as it leads to roads to Pakistan borders, should have been repaired in days. There are traffic jams on the stretch especially in the morning and evening hours.” He also raised questions over the quality of material used at the time of construction. Harsh Kumar Bhalla, a social activist from Khanna, who has raised the issue multiple times, said the repair has missed many deadlines. “It has been around nine months since the repair started and it has missed four or five deadlines. The result is that a part of traffic is put on the service road because of which it is in bad shape. There have been accidents as well because of heavy traffic on the narrow road,” he added.“Instead of a raised road, it should have been on pillars. It would have served two purposes: vehicles could have been parked under it and it wouldn’t have divided Khanna in two parts and hindered traffic movement.

The NGT’s join inspection committee also observed that Oorakunta Cheruvu has to be restored immediately. Removal of debris dumped adjacent to Oorakunta is under progress. The project authority has agreed to remove debris within two months. A proposal on ‘Assessment of the contamination status and environmental damages of Oorakunta Cheruvu, Yadagiripally, Telangana’ was submitted by NEERI, Hyderabad zonal centre, has sought Rs .22.7 lakh and four-month time period to complete the damage assessment study. NGT South Zone had in December 2017 appointed a joint committee, comprising Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district collector, representatives from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, Telangana State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, roads & buildings departments and minor irrigation department, to inspect the area and submit a factual as well as action report, if there was any violation found. The joint committee had submitted its report on June 30, 2021, along with recommendations for restoration of Oorakunta. Subsequently, NGT issued additional terms of reference, directing the committee to submit a detailed report. NGT had earlier questioned the prior requirement of environmental clearance (EC) for laying six-lane road around Yadagirigutta Temple. “The proposed project neither falls under National Highway nor State Highway; it is major district road governed by local authority. The requirement of environmental clearance for the formation of six-lane ring road is not under the purview of EIA notification,” the committee opined. The project authority has submitted that construction of presidential suite and VVIP cottages in an extent of 13 acres with built up area of about 11,193 square metres on Yadagirigutta-Cheriyal Road was in completion stage. YTDA had granted approval for these constructions. YTDA has submitted a proposal for the construction of township and Yadagirigutta Temple city. “The proposal submitted by YTDA for prior environmental clearance does not include the constructions, which are already taken up by R&B department at Yadagiripally village,” the NGT-appointed committee said. The joint committee had submitted its report on June 30, 2021, along with recommendations for restoration of Oorakunta.

During the wee hours of Sunday, four friends — Md Haneef (25), an electrician from Gangabowli, Md Mustafa (24), an auto driver from Chintalmet, Rasheed (30), a labourer from Jhirra, and their friend Ajju (26), a private employee from Mangalhat — sat on the chabutra in front of Mustafa’s relative house at Church lane in Gufa Nagar, talking to each other. A little later, Haji, a labourer from Mangalhat, and his friend reached there. “About 10 days ago, Haneef and his three friends had an argument with Haji and his friend regarding some issue related to gambling. When Haneef and his friends saw Haji, they picked up an argument with accusing him of being an informer about gambling,” Mangalhat inspector G Ranveer Reddy said. The rival groups initially indulged in a fist fight. Subsequently, Haji and his friend left the place and returned with knives. They stabbed Haneef, Mustafa, Rasheed and Ajju. Haneef was declared dead at OGH, while the other three were out of danger, the inspector said. Special police teams are formed to nab the accused, who went absconding. A case was registered under Section 302 (Murder) IPC. Haneef and his three friends had an argument with Haji and his friend regarding gambling.

At a recent council meeting, a proposal by Worldwide Veterinary Services India was discussed to undertake comprehensive sterilisation to “improve the welfare of stray dog population”. The programme is a part of animal birth control scheme under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. The state government has notified a scheme, The Goa Small Animal Rescue Management Scheme, 2014, to take care of stray dogs and to reduce their population by sterilising and vaccinating them against rabies. The council officials said that this proposal was under “serious consideration”. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by MMC with the South Goa Animal Welfare Trust that ran the dog shelter has lapsed. MMC said it is not inclined to renew the MoU as councillors had pointed out a number of complaints from the public against the organisation. Besides bills raised by the trust with MMC are yet to be cleared by the civic body pending verification of the work done, it was informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stray-dog-sterilisation-under-serious-consideration/articleshow/85960174.cms||---
---||Business||Delay in legislation on crypto boosts lobbying||NEW DELHI: The delay in the government finalising the legislation on cryptocurrency has prompted intense lobbying, with agencies worried over the risks emanating from an unregulated segment with extreme price volatility, posing a threat to investors, many of whom do not understand the instrument. Besides, there are concerns over the instrument being used for money laundering and terror funding, an issue that has been flagged by other agencies across the globe, sources told TOI. While the Supreme Court had lifted the ban imposed by the RBI, the government had listed a bill on cryptocurrency to be introduced during the Budget session of Parliament but with the session cut short, the legislation could not make it. During the monsoon session, the government remained silent on the future of the proposed bill with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently saying that it has been sent for clearance by the Union Cabinet before it can be introduced in Parliament. The next session is at least two months away. But crypto exchanges have used the interim period to launch a massive lobbying initiative with several governments and regulatory agencies, raising concerns. The exchanges have argued that a ban on digital currency transactions will result in job losses. While there are fears that a ban will lead to investors getting locked into the instrument, sources indicated that a three-six month window will be provided for investors to exit. Several officials have junked the argument that crypto currencies are an asset class. Besides, there are worries over the legal basis for the presence of some of the exchanges, which remain outside the jurisdiction of either Sebi or the RBI. “There has to be global coordination to combat the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies. They are not a currency as only the sovereign can issue currency. There is a grave danger in allowing these instruments,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/delay-in-legislation-on-crypto-boosts-lobbying/articleshow/85964199.cms||Surojit Gupta

The project, which was taken up at the cost of Rs 675 crore is claimed as the second longest flyover in Telangana, is being delayed inordinately due to the process of land acquisition and it is taking more time than expected, officials said. The prevailing hurdles seems to have added to the woes of motorists and residents living in the surrounding areas. This six-lane corridor which starts at Uppal Junction is aimed at decongesting traffic going towards the Warangal highway and provide a smooth thoroughfare for people of Uppal. The flyover ends at the Central Power Research Institute, Medipally. Once completed, the 6.2 km long flyover in Uppal will become the second longest flyover in the State after the PV Narasimha Rao Expressway, which stretches for over 11.5 km. “It has been over two years since the project commenced. The slow pace of work is leading to traffic jams on the entire stretch. The authorities should act on these issues and see that the project is completed soon,” said Philip Fernandis, a resident of Uppal. Officials of the Roads & Buildings (R&B) Department said that they are still awaiting one hectare of land acquisition near Nalla Cheruvu. “Other than completing this project, we don’t see any other solutions to this problem of bad roads and traffic jams. We want them to expedite the works by speeding up the land acquisition,” said Ganga Raju, a commuter. When contacted, Saroja Rani, chief engineer (projects), GHMC said, “Land acquisition for the Uppal elevated corridor is still in progress.” “The corridor will have 148 pillars and the works were expedited for erecting slabs on pillars through pre-cast method. The State government is doing land acquisition for 1.5 km,” said an official from R&B department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/traffic-jams-due-to-delay-in-land-acquisition-for-uppal-flyover/articleshow/85963060.cms||---

Sisodia made the announcement during the State Teachers’ Award held on Sunday to honour 122 teachers and principals for their contribution in the field of education. “In the last five years, we have sent our teachers and principals to Cambridge, Finland, Singapore and the US. The courses for which our teachers went there had been prepared for us by the universities,” Sisodia said during the function organised by the Delhi government on the occasion of Teachers’ Day at Thyagaraj Stadium. He said that the best universities in the world are known for their own tailored courses and if Delhi government teachers apply for these, they can get selected on merit. “That’s why Delhi government has decided on Teachers’ Day that our teachers will be able to apply for prestigious courses in the field of education in the world’s 100 top ranked universities. And if they get selected, then the government will bear the full cost of their programme,” he announced, adding that the department of education will issue the guidelines within a few days. While the annual State Teachers’ Award is given only in the academic field, this year, many other fields have also been added and the number of awards has increased from 103 to 122, compared with last year. The teachers who were honoured included special educators, music and art teachers, librarians, mentor teachers, sports teachers and vocational teachers. Director of education, Udit Prakash Rai, said that the last two years have seen the toughest phase of the century, but in this difficult period, we have seen our teachers perform their duty with extreme courage. He said teachers not only made sure that education doesn’t stop but also played a big role in fighting against the Covid crisis. “Our education system was badly affected due to the pandemic, because after the closure of schools, no one had any idea how to proceed. But the teachers and principals of our schools showed incredible grit and determination in responding to this situation,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-back-teachers-going-to-100-varsities/articleshow/85960162.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ludhiana||In poll season, govt likely to announce taxation reliefs for bizmen||Ludhiana: With the Punjab assembly elections due in the next few months, all the political parties are trying their best to appease the business community. Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) inducted several leaders, like Madan Lal Bagga and Kulwant Sidhu, who have an influence in the business community. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has been organising meetings with businessmen and their associations. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal is himself presiding over some of these meetings. The ruling Congress is a step ahead. It is contemplating several relief measures for businessmen, especially traders, and a high-level meeting of senior bureaucrats and other stakeholders will be organised on September 7 at the office of Punjab Traders’ Board in Chandigarh. It is likely that major demands of traders like one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for all VAT-related cases and professional tax will be accepted.Bhupinder Singh Basant, senior vice-president of Punjab Traders’ Board, said, “On September 7, all office-bearers and members of the board along with senior officers of the departments, including excise and taxation, will hold a meeting. The main agenda will be to discuss the demands of the traders, including OTS for VAT cases and introduction of an amnesty scheme for professional tax payments. Besides, other important matters, like abolishing institutional tax introduced by the previous SAD-BJP government and increasing the purview of the existing OTS scheme for VAT assessments, will also come up for hearing.”Basant added, “We are also planning to form advisory committees at state and district levels for matters related to excise and taxation and a mechanism will be formed to convert the working of the taxation department in total paperless mode so that businessmen need not visit the offices for even the smallest task. On September 7, several revolutionary steps will be taken to benefit the traders of Punjab, especially Ludhiana. We request the businessmen to forward their suggestions and demands at the earliest so as we can include these in our agenda for the meeting.” According to Rajkumar Singh, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association, Ludhiana, “All the political parties and leaders are now trying to please the business community because not only votes, they need election fund too from us. But every time the story is the same. They forget us when they come to power. The Congress party ignored us for over four years and now it has woken up and is trying to appease us by announcing reliefs, which should have been offered long ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/in-poll-season-govt-likely-to-announce-taxation-reliefs-for-bizmen/articleshow/85957738.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Other charges’ collected by builder to attract 18% GST||MUMBAI: A recent ruling given to Puranik Builders by the GST-Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) is likely to adversely impact both the builders and buyers as it may escalate costs. The AAR has held that “other charges” collected by a builder under a sale agreement will not be a composite supply and will attract goods and services tax (GST) at 18%. From April 1, 2019, on housing projects that do not fall in the affordable housing category, GST is levied at 5% without input tax credit (ITC). For ongoing projects the builder has the option to pay GST at the old rate of 12% with ITC, which means taxes paid on inputs can be set off. A CA said advance rulings favourable to the tax department are inevitably followed during assessment. If the taxpayer (say, builder) takes a different approach, litigation results. The agreement for sale, drawn by the residential construction company Puranik Builders of Thane, was typical of most builder agreements with two components separately shown. These were charges for the main construction activity and “other charges”. The latter included charges for installation of electric meters, water connections, advance maintenance and club-house maintenance (till the time a society was formed), legal fees and such. These charges were collected from the buyers at the time of entering into the agreement or at the time of giving possession of the flats. While the builder was collecting GST at 18% on such “other charges”, it approached the AAR for a ruling on the applicable rate. It submitted that the services underlying the “other charges” should be treated as a composite supply (bundled with the supply of the main construction activity). Thus, GST rate on the main supply (currently 5% for new projects) should apply. The AAR noted that the consideration is charged separately for different services. It added that it was ironical that while stamp duty was paid on the value of the sale of the flat (excluding the value of “other charges”), which translated into a lower stamp duty; when it came to GST payments, the builder submitted that the other charges were part of the main construction activity. The AAR held that GST at 18% will apply on services underlying the other charges. The builder will have to pay GST on the entire amount received as “other charges” without any rebate. An advocate specialising in indirect taxes said: “No one will buy a flat without an electricity or water connection. Buyers expect common amenities to be maintained by the builder till a society is formed. Thus, treating such charges as non-composite will add to complexities and costs for real estate sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-other-charges-collected-by-bldr-to-attract-18-gst/articleshow/85963066.cms||---

Excited passengers climbed atop the upper decks where they clicked selfies and made videos to make the moment memorable. A live band kept passengers entertained all through the ride. Some of them even got up to dance too. At least 200 passengers took the first ride. The service, initiated by UP tourism department to promote waterways tourism in the state, provides an eight-hour two-way ride on the Ganga from Varanasi to Chunar Fort. The 55 meter-long, twin engine vessel cruise was flagged off by Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal in the presence of Vivek Malaviya, Vikas Malaviya, Jayant Malaviya and Manish Poddar, the directors of Alaknanda Cruiseline, the startup managing the cruise. Congratulating the team, Agarwal said, “This is a novel venture and we are sure that tourists will find the service attractive. A lot of hard work has gone into the initiative and we hope it will give a boost to tourism in the state.” Alaknanda Cruiseline has been running cruise services on the Ganga in Varanasi for the last two years. Vikas Malaviya, one of the directors, said: “We have been getting a good response which encouraged us to manage this tour too. We are grateful to the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath for reposing faith in our capabilities and entrusting us this huge responsibility.” During the ride, the passengers were served vegetarian breakfast, lunch, tea and heavy snacks. After two hours of sailing, the cruise made a brief halt at Shool Tankeshwar Temple, situated 15km from Varanasi. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and folklore suggests that this is the spot where the Ganga entered the holy city (Uttarayani) on the command of Lord Shiva. People believe that the temple is located at the spot where Lord Shiva had put his trishul (trident). In Chunar, divisional commissioner of Mirzapur, Yogeshwar Ram Mishra, also came onboard for some time. Impressed with the vessel and the facilities, he said that he would take the ride soon. Lata Khatri, an octogenarian, who travelled all the way from Delhi to take the maiden ride, said: “I came to know about this cruise from my family and I didn’t want to miss it. I belong to Varanasi and a thing like an air-conditioned cruise in the city is nothing short of a marvel to me.” RP Chaturvedi, a Varanasi-based doctor, said: “I have seen cruise service abroad, and in Goa, but such a facility in Varanasi instils a feeling of pride. I had expected a boat but this vessel is huge and will be a new experience for the people of Varanasi.” “We read about it in the newspapers and had planned to make a booking in July itself when it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Although we had thought it would be a temple hopping ride, we went to just one temple. Overall, it has been a fun ride,” said Rakhi, who was part of a group on the cruise which danced to the songs presented by the music band.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/music-food-fun-kashi-chunar-cruise-ride-on-ganga-off-to-a-flying-start/articleshow/85955782.cms||---

Patel peeped inside through a window and realized that the shop had been burgled as empty mobile boxes were lying scattered on the floor. When the duo went inside to check CCTV camera footage, they discovered that burglars had taken away the DVR too. Later, on estimation it was learnt that 82 smartphones of different companies worth Rs 13.8 lakh were missing, besides accessories worth Rs 50,000 which included ear pods, battery banks and speaker among others.

He also attended a programme of teacher’s felicitation organised by the Samajwadi Shikshak Sabha at Inar Gaon Duhiya in Bhadohi. He exuded confidence that SP would overthrow the BJP government in UP in the forthcoming assembly election as every section of the society is feeling neglected under the present regime. “People have made up their mind to dethrone the BJP government and bring back SP with absolute majority,” Akhilesh said. Akhilesh promised to enhance the electricity facility to the farmers and weavers after the formation of SP government. “The SP government will put back the state on development track, which was derailed by BJP,” he added. Attacking the ruling party, he said the BJP has failed to fulfil its promises in the last 4.5 years. “Everybody including farmers, students, business community and youth are suffering in the BJP rule,” he said “Government assets are being sold out to industrialists... BJP had promised to double the income of farmers, but today their rights are being snatched. The new farming law will deprive the farmers from farming. The BJP government failed to produce even a single unit of electricity, but it increased the power tariff.” Akhilesh alleged that the BJP government completely failed to handle the Covid situation, and many people died in want of oxygen and hospital beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-will-overthrow-bjp-govt-in-2022-akhilesh/articleshow/85955835.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy corpn planning to step up tax collection||Trichy: Trichy corporation has planned to intensify tax collection drive as lockdown relaxations have let businesses open up apart from put the civic body’s financial situation back on track. “We have started distributing demand notices to all property owners. In the coming days, tax collection will improve,” a senior revenue official said. Although only around 18% of expected revenue has been netted through taxes and user charges till August, the civic body said it is better than the corresponding period last year. For the current financial year the civic body’s property tax demand is Rs 121.6 crore, which includes arrears of Rs 61.6 crore, of which 21% has been collected. The slowdown in tax collection drive due to Covid-19 shows that arrears make up more than 50% of current demand for vacant land tax, professional tax and non-tax revenue. The civic body is expecting around Rs 287 crore in taxes through taxes and user charges. “We are opening our 37 tax collection centres even on Sundays. People can pay their taxes online on tnurbanepay.tn.gov.in. Compared to last year, our tax collection drive is better by 10-12%,” a senior corporation official said. Around 100 users are paying taxes online daily, officials added. As educational institutions and cinema theatres have remained shut, officials said such properties were not insisted to pay outstanding taxes. However, since most commercial activities are now open, the civic body has planned to gradually resume outstanding tax. Collecting non-tax revenue (rent for civic body’s properties in commercial hubs) will be an uphill task for the civic body as commercial establishments may cite slowdown as a reason to delay payment. As the civic body is under severe fund crunch to even carry out annual maintenance of properties such as public parks, the corporation said that they have to intensify the tax collection drive further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-planning-to-step-up-tax-collection/articleshow/85960269.cms||Deepak Karthik

The school education department has been closely monitoring the developments ever since schools reopened for the senior students across the state on September 1, he said in Trichy on Sunday. “We will observe the response after the first eight days of the school opening for class IX to XII. We are also examining the attendance status. Elementary education is vital, and at the same time we are considering the Covid-19 situation too. We will have discussions with officials, and the chief minister will take a decision after September 8,” Anbil Mahesh said. As school students and teachers have tested positive in various districts recently, the minister said that around 800 medical professionals across the state under the RBSK initiative are involved in the surveillance to ensure the safety of both teachers and school children. “Classrooms of the students who tested positive were sanitised and closed, students were moved to alternative rooms,” the minister said. As there were complaints about school teachers on their own cleaning campuses in the absence of adequate sanitation workers, the minister said that arrangements through local bodies and district education office will be made to mobilise workers to maintain the hygiene at schools. Reacting to a question on clearing the grievances in the appointment of school teachers, he said that there are more than 12,000 pending litigation pertaining before the teachers’ recruitment board (TRB) and the school education department. We will resolve the issues one after another, he said. “The announcement on spoken English course was received well among the public, as there is a demand. Good aspects in the national education policy will be adopted,” he said. Reacting to the criticism on the best teacher award being conferred to the same schools repeatedly, the minister clarified that the school education department has identified teachers based on certain parameters and qualifications. The minister at the district collectorate handed over the best teacher awards to 13 teachers in the Trichy district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/decision-on-reopening-schools-for-lower-classes-after-sept-8-minister/articleshow/85960282.cms||---

Yogi also taunted the Opposition leaders saying those who used to go to religious places secretly are now competing with each other to grab public attention on their visits. Addressing the intelligentsia at the party’s ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ in Varanasi on Sunday, Yogi said, “Kashi has always been an attraction for people from across the world as it is the ancient centre of Sanatan Dharma and spirituality. Despite this, Mahatma Gandhi made his displeasure known over the poor sanitation in and around the Kashi Vishwanath temple when he visited the shrine in 1916.” “Many leaders ruled the country for decades by taking the name of Mahatma Gandhi and claiming his legacy but never even tried to ensure the development of the city as per its stature and cleanliness at the shrine,” the CM added. “After becoming MP from this holy city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ensured development of Varanasi and launched Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project while preserving the soul and culture of the city,” said Yogi. Varanasi will emerge on the global platform with a grand and new image after the completion of KV Dham project, he added. “We are replicating PM Modi’s vision and model of Kashi’s development for development work in Vindhyachal, Mathura and Ayodhya,” said Yogi. “Those who opposed development of Somnath temple after Independence ruled the country for decades and left Hindus struggling for Ram temple in Ayodhya. The Modi government not only cleared the way for the temple in Ayodhya but also started its construction in a grand way,” the CM added. In the past many decades, a culture was developed where people having deep faith in the country’s traditions were termed inferior, while those who portrayed a poor image of the country and its heritage were promoted and awarded, said Yogi. “This was why many people used to visit religious places secretly to conduct rituals. But, after PM Modi showcased the Sanatan traditions on a global platform gloriously by promoting Yoga globally and holding Kumbh as the largest spiritual event, now the same personalities are competing with each other for public attention when they visit Hindu religious sites, he added. Talking about the ‘Atmanirbhar’ campaign, the CM said, “When I planned to hold Deepotsava at Ayodhya on Diwali eve for the first time, arranging 51,000 earthen lamps was proving difficult. But, recently when I reviewed preparations for Deepotsava this year, I was told that over 7.50 lakhs of earthen lamps have already been prepared.” Yogi also mentioned how the pottery industry is flourishing with the measures initiated by his government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pms-kashi-devpt-model-beingreplicated-in-ayodhya-mathura/articleshow/85955848.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa University researchers invent cheaper way to create nanorod, may aid clean energy||PANAJI: Two researchers at Goa University’s school of chemical sciences have invented a method to create nano material, which is ten times less expensive than the commercial process presently used to design nanorods. The tungsten trioxide nanorods produced through their methods can now be explored for many applications, including clean energy storage, cancer diagnostics, among others. After a rigorous process, researchers Pranay Morajkar and Akshay Salkar have earned an Indian patent for their ‘method for synthesising tungsten trioxide nanorods’. While tungsten trioxide nanorods are already being explored for their large applicability around the world, the process to produce it remains expensive, requiring developing countries like India to import 5g of it at approximately Rs 5,000, the researchers said. The method uses the inexpensive urea in the process and helps produce 5g of nanorods for less than Rs 500. “For a developing country like India, an active nano material produced at low cost will allow us to explore its scalability and industrial production in an economical way for varied applications in clean energy and environmental sector, instead of importing it,” said Morajkar. He is currently serving as an assistant professor at the school of chemical sciences, and his research focuses on designing nanostructured materials for energy and environmental applications. “High pressure autoclave and expensive template synthesis is commercially used, which makes the process expensive. Our method, instead, uses internal fuel in the process. We have innovatively used cheap protonated urea to give internal energy and nano-structural directionality for the material during the growth phase of the synthesis process,” Morajkar said. Morajkar and Salkar have already worked on applicability of the nanorods in preparing sustainable or alternative clean energy storage systems such as supercapacitors. This could help in minimising or eliminating the use of fossil fuels in the future. The researchers said that applicability of tungsten trioxide nanorods in cancer diagnostics and treatment also needs to be explored. “To detect cancer, you use imaging technology, where the high X-ray absorption coefficient of tungsten can strongly enhance the visibility of tissue structure. Its photocatalytic properties are being explored for use in photodynamic therapies by researchers around the world. Therefore, the photoactive and sensing potential of these nanorods and its composites needs to be further explored for use in the biomedical domain,” said Morajkar. His partner, Salkar, is a young researcher with a masters degree in physical chemistry from GU (pursued through St Xavier’s College, Mapusa) and is currently pursuing his PhD degree with Morajkar at the school of chemical sciences. “Different particles are available in the commercial market, but few are available in the rod shape, and even those which are there, are expensive. Now, we attempt to scale up the process. We need to find a buyer for large scale production and the process to find a buyer will start soon through the Goa University’s intellectual property cell. Our aim is to produce a Goa University’s indigenous product in the market and contribute towards the Make in India mission,” said Morajkar, who received his doctorate in 2012 from the University of Lille in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, France, and returned to GU in 2014, to serve his motherland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-researchers-invent-cheaper-way-to-create-nanorod-may-aid-clean-energy/articleshow/85960312.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu had said during the demand for grants in the state assembly on Saturday that Annadhanam (distribution of free food) will be conducted for the whole day at the temple, one of the long-pending demands of devotees. A leading revenue-grosser in the state, the Mariamman temple situated on the Trichy-Chennai NH records an average hundial collection of about Rs 1 crore a month. Recognising the big footfall of devotees, mainly rural population from across the state as well as tourists accessing Chennai-Trichy NH, HR&CE department announced in the assembly that prasadham (holy food) will be given to all devotees. The temple management said it is discussing the appropriate products like savouries for launching the scheme at the earliest. Other infrastructure proposals for the temple include Kungumam (vermilion) production unit, first aid centre and redevelopment of its sub-temples. “Kungumam production unit is planned on 2,000 squarefeet space near the upcoming queue complex. Devotees may be allowed to take a tour,” an official source in HR&CE said. Oduvar training centre is also planned at the temple complex. “All announcements will embellish the temple’s infrastructure and improve footfall, but a solution for pedestrians coming to the temple amid accident threats is missing,” V B Jaganath, a Trichy city resident said. A sum of Rs 250 crore was sanctioned for the development of five temples including Samayapuram. Similarly, announcements such as a pilgrim accommodation centre at a cost of Rs 75 lakh for Vayalur Subramaniaswamy temple on the suburbs of Trichy city and redevelopment of Arulmigu Vekkaliamman temple at Woraiyur were also received well by the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/devotees-hail-govts-development-plans-for-samayapuram-mariamman-temple/articleshow/85960327.cms||---

According to the data, around 23.34 lakh beneficiaries have received their first jab of Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik V, while 6.67 lakh beneficiaries have received their second shot from paid sites. The data added that around 440 paid vaccination sites have been registered across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune rural, of which 233 were in Pune, 141 in Pimpri Chinchwad, and 65 in rural. The maximum paid vaccination has been recorded in Pune civic limits with 19.73 lakh doses. Of the total Covid shots administered in the district so far across government and private sites since January 16, the paid sites contributed around 37% of the total vaccination. So far, the Pune district has recorded total vaccination of 81 lakh beneficiaries with the first and second shots. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India told TOI, “Despite the vaccine quota of 25% from manufacturers, the private vaccination sites in Pune district have done remarkably well. However, the response for paid vaccination is dropping, with more free vaccination centres available now.” According to Patil, the working class and the corporates are the ones, who have opted for paid vaccination to save on time and energy. H K Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital, Hadapsar, said that though daily respondents have gone down, but there are over 11,000 bookings for the second dose from the corporate. “We had four booths offering Covid vaccination a few months back, but now there is only one but that too is getting a low response,” he said. Jitendra Oswal, deputy director, Bharati Hospital, told TOI that private sites have played a key role in Covid vaccination, but people are more inclined towards free vaccination now. “In the past, we had transferred our doses to the Pune civic body, but still have around 17,000 doses with us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-30l-take-paid-vaccine-in-district/articleshow/85960344.cms||Piyush Bhusari

After a 24-hour search, the car was found parked on an interior road near Amrut Nagar slum in Ghatkopar. Two persons have been detained for using a duplicate number plate. Anil Shashtri recently called up the Ghatkopar traffic police division and complained that he had been fined thrice though his car was in Pune. He said he last visited Mumbai in January for treatment. “He expressed his inability to pay the fine due to financial problems...He did not travel to Mumbai for a long time, but had got e-challan messages while his Santro was in Pune. He requested us to take action against the wrong-doers,” said traffic police inspector Nagraj Majage.  Three teams looked for the car in Jagdusha Nagar, Golibar Road, Bhatwadi, Amrut Nagar, Andheri-Goregaon Link Road as it was fined in these areas. One team found the car with Shashtri’s number plate at Amrut Nagar and towed it. Later, Andheri resident Ashraf Memon (33) and Dharavi resident Shahrukh Khan arrived at the traffic police chowky to claim it. “While questioning them, traffic police found that the registration number was different from Shashtri’s car. The engine number and chassis number were also different,” said a source. After paying the Rs 3,800 fine, the duo said they had bought the car from a woman. “We suspect overwriting on the chassis number and the car was given to the men with duplicate number plates. The case has been transferred to the Parksite police station,” said an officer. Zubaida Shaikh, senior inspector of Parksite police station, said they were making inquiries in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/car-in-pune-but-fined-in-mumbai-2-detained-for-duplicate-no-plate/articleshow/85963091.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The state is in the second position after Andhra Pradesh. Despite the lack of internet penetration, the initiative has now completed 1 crore consultations across the nation, of which nearly 20 lakh is from Karnataka. Interestingly, some of the backward districts of North-Karnataka are also leading, indicating the dedicated field work carried out by the district health departments. As OPDs were closed during the lockdowns, more people started to use this service and now continue the same for risk-free consultations. According to the data shared by the Union health and family welfare department, Ballari has recorded the highest engagement registering 1,34,967 consultations which is also higher than Bengaluru urban district. It is ranked 13th place in the country. The NTS comprises of two variants of eSanjeevani namely — doctor to doctor (eSanjeevani AB-HWC) telemedicine platform that is based on a hub and spoke model and patient to doctor telemedicine platform (eSanjeevaniOPD) which provides outpatient services to the citizens in the confines of their. The former was introduced in 2019 and the latter was in April 2020. In the state, according to the ministry, the numbers jumped dramatically during and post lockdown. While Ballari is in 13th position in the country, Chikkamagaluru is in 15th place having recorded 1,26,540 consultations. The patients and doctors are engaging in both audio and video modes. Belagavi, Hassan and Dharwad have secured 18th, 19th and 21th position and Bengaluru urban has settled for 22nd position. Bidar, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Yadgir, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Kalaburagi, Haveri, Koppal, Bengaluru rural, Chamarajanagar, Tumkur and Kolar are also among the leading districts. The percentage of females engaging the facility is 56.17% and men are lagging behind with 43% in the nation. Speaking to TOI, Ballari district health officer H L Janardhana said the district bounced back after lagging behind at 29th position in the state. The health department later started giving targets to community health officials, district health officials, junior health workers and Aasha workers due to which the district picked up pace. The Asha workers, who are visiting the households, are helping the public download the app and are educating them on booking consultations.Yadgir DHO Dr Indumati Patil said several government programmes including mass vaccination has helped target more number of people to participate in the programme. The district has set up hubs at taluk levels and e-hospital manager reminds all the stakeholders about the target on a daily basis.

This is crucial to keep underprivileged students in the educational loop in the event of a prolonged pandemic, he said. “When we opened schools, the threat of a third wave was cause of concern. Since we still have a big section of society that lacks digital connect, hi-tech phones or tabs, teachers should hammer out a strategy to ensure these children should not be left out, if Covid-19 persists,” said Yogi, while addressing the intelligentsia of Kashi to mark the launch of BJP’s statewide ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ on Teachers’ Day. Recalling his interaction with a child in Gorakhpur, Yogi said, the boy could remember studying in class 4, the last time he attended class before lockdown was clamped in 2020. “Like this child, several bright children have been forced to discontinue studies. While a large section of society has access to digital platforms, there are many who don’t even have a television at home,” he said. Teachers seamlessly used technology to continue online classes during the lockdown, but catering to children without resources is a big challenge, he said. “Now, they should explore possibilities and conceptualize new formats to teach underprivileged children. They could experiment with the ancient gurukul tradition by holding open classes in small groups under trees, panchayat buildings or ghats,” said Yogi, while appealing to the intelligentsia of Kashi to work on this front. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Covid-19 management, he said, when mortality rates were soaring in developed countries, PM’s guidance yielded results. He said, though the first Covid wave was not as deadly as the second, it had its challenges of bringing back stranded students from Kota or tackling the influx of 40lakh migrants. “We did not have Covid testing labs, when the first wave hit us. Today, we have the capacity to test 4lakh samples every day and 555 oxygen plants have ended need to outsource oxygen,” said Yogi. Explaining the giant makeover of UP, Yogi said, “Different governments came to power and were ousted since 1947, but they could not ensure development due to their narrow vision. PM Modi’s vision and strategy triggered a positive change.” He said, when his government was formed, everybody had doubts about the state’s law and order due to recurrent riots and rampant corruption. “Youths from UP did not receive good response when they sought jobs in other states. Today, people are praising UP’s law and order and ease of doing business. Huge investments have come to the state even during the pandemic, clocking Rs 66,000 crore. This did not happen overnight. Also, per capita income of UP had plummeted over past seven decades, but in next five years, UP will equal India’s per capita income,” said Yogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-dont-let-school-kids-without-digital-connect-languish-experiment-with-gurukul-system/articleshow/85955865.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The Navy was the first to receive the President’s Colour, which it did in 1951. Naval Aviation will get the honour in the same year when INS Hansa celebrates its diamond jubilee. “About 122 pilots and aircrew have done the supreme sacrifice during air operations. So, it has been paid for in blood, bravery, sweat, and tears of our founding fathers and it is a matter of huge pride for all of us that it’s happening in Goa, because Goa is intrinsic to Naval Aviation,” Flag Officer Naval Aviation (FONA) Rear Admiral Philipose George Pynumootil told TOI. What makes the presentation of the President’s Colour even more special is that the present chief of the naval staff, Admiral Karambir Singh, and the deputy chief of naval staff, vice admiral Ravneet Singh, are both aviators, Philipose said. The Rear Admiral, who is also the Flag Officer Goa Area, said along with the pilots, the observers, maintainers, air traffic controllers, MET officers, medical staff and divers play a huge role in keeping the aircraft airworthy. From acquiring its first aircraft, the Short Sealand IN 101, on January 13, 1951 to operating potent platforms such as the Boeing P-8I, the Sikorsky MH-60 Seahawk and the General Atomics MQ-9B drones, the Navy’s aviation arm has taken massive strides in protecting India’s maritime and strategic interests, Philipose said. Rear Admiral Philipose George Pynumootil said Indian Navy has seen a phenomenal growth and today it is a formidable forceToday, the Navy has over 250 fixed wing and rotary aircraft in its arsenal operating from 12 air stations across the country, including three on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and three air enclaves. “It’s a phenomenal growth for the Indian Navy,” he said. “Today, the Indian Navy is a formidable force, which contributes to all aspects, whether it is low-intensity maritime operations, anti-piracy operations, a constabulary role or disaster relief due to the vagaries of nature.” The President’s Colour is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon any military unit of India. Historically, armies carried their monarch’s colours into battle and these flags served as a rallying point, well defended in battle. Capturing the enemy’s flag indicated victory and that the adversary had fled. When India gained Independence, the 33 King’s Colours awarded during British rule were laid to rest at the Indian Military Academy and since then the colours have been awarded by the President. Looking to strengthen India’s credentials in maritime security, the Navy knows that interoperability with friendly nations and heightened maritime domain awareness is the key. Going forward, the Navy will emphasise on standardisation of aircraft, weapons and sensors. India is already operating state-of-the-art aircraft like the P8I and MH60R enabling seamless interoperability with the US Navy and several navies that operate the same aircraft. “Our emphasis will be to optimise the number of platforms. It is good to have a smaller number of types of aircraft, as it would facilitate effective training and inventory management. Interoperability also increases,” Philipose said. “For example, the sonobuoys on the MH60Rs are compatible with the P-8I. We are focusing on standardisation as it would result in huge cost saving. Also, our focus is on self-reliance and indigenisation,” he said. Notwithstanding the challenges ahead, the honour of bearing the President’s Colour will serve as a worthy recognition for the service rendered and the motivation to soar to greater heights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-blood-bravery-naval-aviation-earns-prezs-colour/articleshow/85960398.cms||Newton Sequeira

When TOI tried to take stock of the drive being carried out by the department, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and others, chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said, 108 dengue cases have so far been confirmed in the district and the number of hotspots has mounted to 41. These figures are enough to paint a clear picture of the massive surge in dengue cases since July 1. Till August 25, the department had a list of 53 confirmed dengue cases and 34 hotspots. Regarding the increasing pathological tests for dengue and long queues being witnessed at blood banks for platelets, the CMO said as per governments guidelines, NS-1 Antigen kit test report is not sufficient to confirm dengue. Test of samples in sentinel surveillance laboratory is a must for confirmation. In view of these guidelines, only those samples, which are sent to the microbiology department laboratory of Banaras Hindu University for Elisa test and are tested positive, are considered as dengue positive cases, he said. To ensure that the same guidelines are followed by private practitioners, hospitals and pathology labs, he said, a special drive was launched in the district from Saturday. On the initial day, 16 teams of health officials checked 61 hospitals and pathology centres and issued strict instructions to treat patients as per the guidelines prescribed by the government and avoid charging exorbitantly to avoid punitive action. Mega cleanliness drive, including source reduction exercises like clearing water from solid waste, scraps and coolers, fogging, spray of anti-larval and bio-chemicals, has also been ordered, said CMO, who also inspected areas like Pandeypur. If the officials are to be believed major problem is being noticed in the villages, which have been included in VMC limits recently, as they lack proper drainage system. The areas, which remained inundated during flood in Ganga and Varuna, are also a big challenge as waterlogging is still there on vacant plots despite clearing of flood waters. Most of the dengue hotspots have been identified in the same areas. Municipal commissioner Pranay Singh, who is leading the special cleanliness drive, said some areas in Sarnath, Seer Gowardhan, Khujwa, Susuwahi and Chitaipur have been identified as highly sensitive. Nodal officers appointed for each ward have been asked to ensure cleaning of even grass from vacant plots in their areas, he said adding extra attention is also being paid on schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/noose-tightens-around-pvt-hosps-as-dengue-stings-kashi-hard/articleshow/85955902.cms||---

---||Goa||FC Goa have the best team, want to win all trophies this season: Edu Bedia||Panaji: Had it not been for Manuel Lanzarote, Edu Bedia would not have ended up at FC Goa. In 2017, when it was time to draw curtains on the Zico era and start a new one under Sergio Lobera, Bedia was a last-minute addition. It was Lanza, his teammate at Real Zaragoza, who recommended the Spanish midfielder to Goa. The profile seemed too good to be true. Bedia was just 27, had never played below Segunda level in Spain, and having made his La Liga debut when only in his teens, India seemed like an unlikely destination. Goa tried their luck. The rest, they say, is history Bedia is now into his fifth season at Goa and remains the longest-serving foreign player at the club. He’s been consistently good too, leading a young side quite well last season, particularly in the AFC Champions League where his importance to the team was there for all to see. “Last year in the second part of the season, we were the best team in ISL,” Bedia told TOI during an online interaction on Monday. “In the first part, we had a new coach, new players and many of them quite young. Maybe it was little difficult. This year, we know the coach, we know our teammates and there are youngsters who are very good. We have a very strong team.” Goa logged a 15-match unbeaten run in the Indian Super League (ISL) that stretched to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Mumbai City FC on penalties. For all their efforts and record, though, they got nothing in return. “We want to win all the trophies this season. In this moment, we are one of the best teams in India,” said the Goa captain. The first chance for a trophy will be at the Durand Cup, Asia’s oldest football tournament. Goa have fielded their best-possible side with four national team players and four foreigners. No wonder everyone is counting them as favourites. “Our target is to win, not just the Durand Cup but everything. The target is to improve as a team. As captain, my target is to help the young players,” said Bedia, whose team will open their campaign against Army Green at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Tuesday. Even coach Juan Ferrando agrees that Goa will be a better team than the one he took over last season. “It helps to have the foreign players from last season,” said Ferrando, explaining the benefits of retaining the likes of Bedia, Jorge Ortiz, Alberto Noguera and Ivan Gonzalez, all Spaniards. “The choice is perfect. I know the players. They helped me a lot and know my methodology. They are like second teachers for young players.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-have-the-best-team-want-to-win-all-trophies-this-season-edu-bedia/articleshow/85989693.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Simha is at the centre of a raging controversy with opposition leaders accusing him of claiming credit for the expressway.Lakshmana and Manjula slammed for Simha for not agreeing to a debate on the issue, despite the Congress having invited him to a public discussion on the subject. “Simha did not turn up for the debate, instead of which he released a two-page long letter. We are ready for a public debate with Simha anytime. We will continue our fight against him till the MP confesses to having misled the people,” they said.Meanwhile, former public works minister HC Mahadevappa, in a lengthy Facebook post, hit out at Simha, who had questioned the senior Congress leader’s contribution during his stint as a minister. Mahadevappa even uploaded photographs of his being felicitated by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa and other BJP leaders in acknowledgement of his contribution to Mysuru.Lakshmana and Manjula said that they had thrice extended an invitation to Simha for a public debate on the expressway, which, once completed, will enable completion of a journey between Bengaluru and Mysuru in 90 minutes. “We will hold a demonstration in front of the BJP office next Saturday. We want Simha to accept the truth about the project. This stretch of the state highway was upgraded into a national highway in March 2014 when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister. Oscar Fernandes was the Union minister for road transport, Siddaramaiah was the CM and Mahadevappa the public works minister. Adagooru H Vishwanath and R Dhruvanarayan were the Lok Sabha MPs.

There are a total of 56,189 teachers and non-teaching staff working across schools in the region. Of them, 35,624 have received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine so far while 77% of staff have received the first dose. The percentage of vaccination with the first dose is higher (92%) in government/municipal corporation-run schools. “Creating of separate categories on the centralised CoWin portal will prioritise and facilitate 100% fully immunisation of teachers and non-teaching staff in the next few days,” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region, said. As a separate category for teachers and non-teaching staff has been introduced on the CoWIN portal, it will be easier for teachers to book the slot at government and municipal corporation run vaccination centres to avail the benefit of free immunisation. For walk-in, they (teachers) can show their identity cards to get the shot on priority, he added. The Union government has introduced ‘teacher’ and ‘non-teaching staff’ categories on the portal to accelerate full immunization in this the segment from September 1. Many states are considering reopening schools after Diwali. There are 97 lakh teachers in the country. Besides, the central government has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to the states to vaccinate this group on a priority. Most of the teachers have had already received the first dose of the vaccine and the move to introduce the separate categories is primarily to expedite full vaccination in the segment. “It is crucial for teachers and school support staff to get fully vaccinated as part of the preparation of reopening the schools,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association of Hospital Board of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-35k-teachers-support-staff-in-pmr-fully-inoculated/articleshow/85960421.cms||Umesh Isalkar

While speaking on the occasion, CM said the state was writing a new story of development and getting freed from mafia, mosquito and filth. There was a time when East UP was a hub of mafia and cases of diseases like malaria, encephalitis and dengue were on the rise, but now the situation has changed. “With proper sanitization and adequate measures, encephalitis has been controlled in the state. We need to make sanitization our sanskar (ritual) and if we are aware of cleanliness, we’ll be away from diseases,” CM said. “The sanitization workers are making new records of cleaning. Under the guidance of PM Modi, they are providing healthy environment to people with their hard work. Encephalitis has reached a minimum level with toilets in every home,” CM said while praising the sanitization workers. CM also remembered former president Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan on the occasion of Teacher’s Day and said, “The sanitization drive has begun on the birth anniversary of former president Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan and it will continue till September 12. Teachers show a path to the society and everyone should take the role of a teacher and motivate others for the sanitization drive.” Under the drive, proper cleaning, water drainage work, sanitization and fogging will be carried out to check the diseases. The chief minister appealed to the people not to litter or throw garbage on roads or in drainage channels. The rivers are flowing above the danger mark and due to high level of water and overflow, the regulators were switched off because of which some parts of the city faced the issue of water logging. A joint team of GDA and GMC will find out the permanent solution of the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-getting-freed-from-mafia-mosquito-filth-cm/articleshow/85955966.cms||---

Keelakuyilkudi and its foothills that are also a popular shooting spot is home to a variety of lizards, frogs, toads, owls and bats.Fauna here is affected by the pollution caused by the visitors, Vishwanath said. The organisation said that such menace is affecting other hills, hillocks and urban forests in the district as well. “People leave behind wastes after consuming snacks, food and liquor. The government cannot monitor such hills and hillocks. Sadly, the pollution is not only caused by tourists but also the locals. It is the responsibility of the people visiting these places to ensure that the wastes are disposed before they descend the hill,” Vishwanath added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/waste-cleared-from-keelakuyilkudi-hill/articleshow/85960428.cms||---

The NCC unit has now constructed separate barracks with a capacity to accommodate 350 boys and 250 girls respectively, at its campus. A senior NCC officer said, “In the absence of such barracks, we were forced to opt for makeshift arrangements but the same were causing inconvenience to the cadets. The tents offer limited space and do not have facilities, such as bathrooms, toilets, etc.” “The regimental funds of the NCC have been utilised for constructing the barracks,” the officer added. About 35 camps of durations ranging from 5 to 15 days are conducted in a year at the NCC campus. In total, over a thousand cadets attend these camps. “The new facility has not been used owing to closure of training activities due to Covid-19 restrictions,” the officer stated. “Parents would express their concern over the makeshift living arrangements and lack of facilities during the camps. Now, their concerns have been addressed,” said another NCC officer.

This is the highest monthly vaccination figure recorded by the district health office. Earlier, July held the record for the highest vaccination with 17.81 lakh doses being administered across government and private sites. According to health department officials, the number would have been much higher had the vaccine supply in the first half of August been more consistent. An official from the health department said that the second half of August included the mega vaccination drive and gave a much-needed boost to the district. The drive was held on August 31 and it benefited around 2.58 lakh beneficiaries, largely from the rural areas in Pune district. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India, said, “The health department and the administration must set a target of 20 lakh vaccinations, per month to cover the entire eligible population in the district at the earliest. The only issue we are struggling with is the consistency of vaccine availability. If we can address vaccine availability, the figures from Pune will be highest in the state.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, had earlier said that the district is likely to get around 20 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin in September. Thereby, coupled with the private vaccination effort, the August figures could easily be surpassed. Meanwhile, as many as 19,176 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Sunday. According to the district immunisation office, new stock of Covishield and Covaxin will be made available on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-18-80l-aug-records-highest-vaccination/articleshow/85960457.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Two of the three family members had taken both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The third member is a 4-year-old girl in the family. On the same lines, three members of a Chandan Nagar-based family tested positive on September 3. Officials said that more than one member of a family testing positive was quite common during the peak of the second wave, when the Delta variant was active in Vidarbha. Doctors said Delta variant is still active in Vidarbha and hence family members of positive patients are getting infected. “Delta is still very much active across Vidarbha region and all over the world. However, we have to see for at least 10 days how their disease progresses,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. Though members from the same family testing positive is a cause of worry, it has a strong positive side too. Genome sequencing is the only way to confirm the variant. But, experts said their experience suggests present cases are Delta cases. Vaccines are working effectively on Delta variants too, observed the doctors. “Vaccinated positive patients have no symptoms. Some members from the same family have tested negative too. This shows vaccines do work. They are effective on Delta variant,” said Dr Shinde. NMC authorities had taken action on war footing as soon as the patient tested positive on September 3. They took more than 120 samples from the neighbourhood. None of them tested positive. Doctors said this could be due to physical distancing practised in the apartment. DOCTORS ASKED TO BE CAREFUL A senior intensive care specialist, who also heads a Covid care facility in a leading private hospital of Nagpur, told TOI that two doctors have tested positive in the last five days in city and they were infected through patients in out-patient departments (OPDs). “I have alerted doctors who work in OPDs to follow Covid protocol after these two incidents. The doctors are already vaccinated and having nothing more than mild symptoms. But, being casual in OPD is still dangerous,” said the doctor. BOX ONE CASE, MANY CONCLUSIONS Vaccine good | Patient who tested +ve on Sept 3 had taken 1 jab 1 jab worked | Though positive, he had only mild symptoms, required no hospitalization or oxygen Seniors saved | Two 65+ members in family tested negative, both had taken both doses Positive but strong | 2 middle-aged members (under 35) in family tested positive, but no symptoms Kids safe | 4-yr-old girl found positive; but no symptoms; recovering now Distancing worked | Neighbours, flat mates followed physical distancing; 120+ of them negative||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-family-members-of-covid-19-patient-test-positive-delta-still-active-say-docs/articleshow/85960487.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Madurai||Two villages in Madurai fully covered by central pension, accident plans||MADURAI: Two hamlets, Chinnamanaikkenpatti and Thumichampatti, in Madurai district have managed to fully enrol their eligible members in three key social security schemes of the central government which entitle them to accident coverage and pension. Various social security schemes including Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Atal pension scheme and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) are being implemented for the benefit of the rural people. People pay annual premiums ranging from Rs 12 to Rs 300 or more, which will give them accident cover benefits up to Rs 2 lakh. The PMSBY is implemented for those above 70 while PMJJYBY is for the 18 to 50 age group, where they have to pay an annual premium of Rs 330 or more. The Atal pension scheme aims at ensuring a better retirement life for the elderly, especially from the unorganised sector. Many villagers who work as agricultural coolies and construction industries among others come under this category. They invest between 18 to 40 years of age and get a monthly pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 based on their investment. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said that only 5% of the population benefited from these social security schemes while the remaining 95% did not know how to avail of it or were unaware of it. It was in this context that officials of Union Bank of India took the schemes to the doorsteps of the villagers and covered all the eligible people ensuring social security. The two villages of Chinnamanaikkenpatti and Thumichampatti in Andipatti panchayat in Vadipatti panchayat union were fully covered. Thus the people there were secure in terms of their medical expenses and old-age pension. The collector complemented the representatives of the local bodies including the panchayat presidents and bank officials for achieving the task. Chinnamanikkenpatti had 654 people living in 191 houses and Thumichampatti just 191 people in 72 houses. Sources said that the small size of the population had made it possible to achieve this for the entire eligible people with the help of the panchayat representatives. Panchayat president A Meenal Asaithambi had also instilled awareness in her people about the benefits of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/two-villages-fully-covered-by-central-pension-accident-plans/articleshow/85960461.cms||---

Garbage dumping has been a continuing problem around the old palace, and local people say that they were hopeful that the Smart City projects being implemented around the Meenakshi Amman temple that also includes the Mahal area, would bring a solace to the issue. G Venkatesh, a resident of Mahal fifth street, said that the people who had been living in the streets had given up hope of seeing a beautification of the exterior of the Mahal. “When newspapers report the issue, the very next day corporation officials come and remove the bins and spread bleaching powder in the area. But, the bins arrive the very next day and the menace continues,” he said. “Garbage is making the place ugly, and in addition the entire area emanates urine smell. People still urinate on the walls of the major tourist attraction,” C Hari Saravanan from Chennai who visited the Mahal with his family said. Huge dumps of garbage are seen in all the streets around the Mahal, including, Palmal Cross Street, Panthadi 1st street, Mahal 5th street, Mahal fourth street, Mahal Vadampokki street on Sunday evening. Madurai Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said they were trying their best to make people dispose of their garbage properly. People dump garbage outside the bins and need a lot of behavioural change, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/garbage-still-strewn-on-streets-around-naicker-mahal/articleshow/85960446.cms||---

Swimmers and trainers have been the most affected by the pandemic compared to other sportspersons. In Madurai, as many as 45 swimmers regularly attend professional swimming competitions and train under Tamil Nadu State Aquatic Association. So far, around 30 swimmers have returned to training. “We expect the others to also turn up eventually. But there have been no competitive events for two years. Timings of swimmers have dropped and they haven’t been able to get to their previous best. It will take at least a year of regular training for them to get their speed and endurance back,” said association district secretary N Kannan. Swimmers too said they hadn’t been able to work out properly on their fitness. “We have workouts to practise on dry land too to build strength and endurance. At first it was a bit tough, but once gyms reopened, we could work out there. Even then, it is not the same as in water. I have not been able to reach my best timing immediately after coming back. It will take some time to pick up,” said P R Chandru, a second year college student and a national level medallist. “I’ve been swimming for 10 years. It was tough but I tried to continue training outside when swimming pools were closed. Hopefully, we can be prepared for the state-level meet next month,” B Roshini, 13, another national-level swimmer, said..  “Usually, several swimmers of ours get picked up for nationals but this time we are not sure of the performance of swimmers. Also, because of lack of competitions, many talented swimmers have also been unable to qualify to get sports quota in colleges over the past two years,” said Kannan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/swimmers-struggle-to-get-back-timings/articleshow/85960509.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Without his knowledge, Manoj had given a ride to a Malabar pit viper that is native to the Western Ghats. Yes, you read that right — a viper! Enroute, Manoj was alerted by a biker on the highway, who was pointing to the roof of his car, but he dismissed it as a joke. When he reached home, he checked the roof of his car out of curiosity, and got the shock of his life. “A snake was coiled up right above the bar on my car’s roof. And it didn’t look like a regular snake. I immediately called my friend, wildlife rescuer Vinay Jadav,” says Manoj. Speaking to Bangalore Times, Vinay says that he was astonished that it was a venomous snake that is endemic to the Western Ghats and is usually only found in the dense forests there. “What also comes as a surprise is that it survived sitting on the roof of the high-speed car for such a long time,” says Vinay. After the rescue, the snake was handed over to the PfA Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Centre, where veterinarians conducted a thorough health checkup. It was then released in the wilderness of Sakleshpur. Commenting on the rescued Viper, Colonel Dr Navaz Shariff, chief veterinarian at PfA said, “Our team of veterinarians carried out the clinical examination for parameters such as its cardiac function, respiratory system and nervous system to ensure the functioning of its reflex are normal. Its skin was also checked for parasites and constant monitoring of its health status was carried out for the 36 hours that it remained with us. The snake was then housed in a humidity-controlled enclosure and we then decided to release the snake into its natural surroundings without wasting any time to safely release the viper in the wilderness of Sakleshpur, about 220 kilometers from Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/this-bengalurean-wont-forget-this-unusual-hitchhiker-in-a-hurry/articleshow/85946151.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty
---||Business||Centre asks states to submit status reports on ‘faceless’ vehicle-related services||NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has asked all state governments and UTs to submit status reports on “faceless/ contactless” and other people-friendly vehicle-related services including online learners’ licences and temporary registration and permanent registration for new vehicles without the need to bring the new vehicles to the RTO. The ministry said it has come to know that several states have not yet implemented the provisions which were notified under the amended Motor Vehicle Act. It has listed 19 notified rules aimed at bringing significant relief to vehicle owners and those applying for driving licences. For example, the government has notified one can apply for a learner's licence online and hence there is no need to submit the form physically. Similarly, the new rule mandates that everyone applying for learner’s licence will have to undertake mandatory video tutorial before appearing for the online test. One new rule makes it mandatory for the vehicle owners to seek prior permission to alter or retrofit any motor vehicle. Another new rule for registration says that a vehicle sold by an authorised dealer doesn’t require production before a registering authority. Officials said the notification has also been issued for online issuance of temporary registration for new vehicles. The ministry has also referred to a circular of March 3, 2021 asking states to provide faceless services if the vehicle owners or drivers submit their Aadhaar number. The states have been asked to respond within 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/centre-asks-states-to-submit-status-reports-on-faceless-vehicle-related-services/articleshow/85959187.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Taliban stop planes of evacuees from leaving but unclear why||KABUL: At least four planes chartered to evacuate several hundred people seeking to escape the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan have been unable to leave the country for days, officials said Sunday, with conflicting accounts emerging about why they flights weren't able to take off as pressure ramps up on the United States to help those left behind to flee. An Afghan official at the airport in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif said that the would-be passengers were Afghans, many of whom did not have passports or visas, and thus were unable to leave the country. He said they had left the airport while the situation was sorted out. The top Republican on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, however, said that the group included Americans and they were sitting on the planes, but the Taliban were not letting them take off, effectively “holding them hostage." He did not say where that information came from. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the accounts. The final days of America's 20-year war in Afghanistan were marked by a harrowing airlift at Kabul's airport to evacuate tens of thousands of people — Americans and their allies — who feared what the future would hold, given the Taliban's history of repression, particularly of women. When the last troops pulled out on August 30, though, many were left behind. The US promised to continue working with the new Taliban rulers to get those who want to leave out, and the militants pledged to allow anyone with the proper legal documents to leave. But Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas told “Fox News Sunday" that American citizens and Afghan interpreters were being kept on six planes. "The Taliban will not let them leave the airport,” he said, adding that he's worried “they're going to demand more and more, whether it be cash or legitimacy as the government of Afghanistan.” He did not offer more details. The Afghan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said it was four planes, and their intended passengers were staying at hotels while authorities worked out whether they might be able to leave the country. The sticking point, he indicated, is that many did not have the right travel papers. Residents of Mazar-e-Sharif also said the passengers were no longer at the airport. At least 10 families were seen at a local hotel waiting, they said, for a decision on their fates. None of them had passports or visas but said they had worked for companies allied with the US or German military. Others were seen at restaurants. The small airport at Mazar-e-Sharif only recently began to handle international flights and so far only to Turkey. The planes in question were bound for Doha, Qatar, the Afghan official said. It was not clear who chartered them or why they were waiting in the northern city. The massive airlift happened at Kabul's international airport, which initially closed after the US withdrawal but where domestic flights have now resumed. Searing images of that chaotic evacuation — including people clinging to an airplane as it took off — came to define the final days of America's longest war, just weeks after Taliban fighters retook the country in a lightning offensive. Since their takeover, the Taliban have sought to recast themselves as different from their 1990s incarnation, when they last ruled the country and imposed repressive restrictions across society. Women and girls were denied work and education, men were forced to grow beards, and television and music were banned. Now, the world is waiting to see the face of the new government, and many Afghans remain skeptical. In the weeks since they took power, signals have been mixed: Government employees including women have been asked to return to work, but some women were later ordered home by lower-ranking Taliban. Universities and schools have been ordered open, but fear has kept both students and teachers away. Women have demonstrated peacefully, some even having conversations about their rights with Taliban leaders. But some have been dispersed by Taliban special forces firing in the air. Some signs of normalcy have also begun to return. Kabul's streets are again clogged with traffic, as Taliban fighters patrol in pickup trucks and police vehicles — brandishing their automatic weapons and flying the Taliban's white flag. Schools have opened, and moneychangers work the street corners. Among the promises the Taliban have made is that once the country's airports are up and running, Afghans with passports and visas would be allowed to travel. More than 100 countries issued a statement saying they would be watching to see that the new rulers held to their commitment. Technical teams from Qatar and Turkey arrived in recent days and are working to get the civilian airport operational. On Saturday, state-run Ariana Airlines made its first domestic flights, which continued on Sunday. The airport is without radar facilities, so flights are restricted to daylight hours to allow for visual landing, said official Shershah Stor. Several countries have also been bringing in humanitarian supplies. The Gulf state of Qatar, where the Taliban maintained a political office since 2013, is making daily flights into Kabul, delivering humanitarian aid for the war-weary nation. Bahrain also announced humanitarian assistance deliveries. Meanwhile, the Taliban stepped up an assault on the last remaining pocket of resistance being led by fighters opposed to their rule. The anti-Taliban fighters in Panjshir province, north of the Afghan capital, are being led by former vice president Amrullah Saleh, who has appealed for humanitarian aid to help the thousands of people displaced by the fighting. A senior Taliban spokesman tweeted Sunday that Taliban troops had overrun Rokha district, one of largest of eight districts in Panjshir. Several Taliban delegations have attempted negotiations with the holdouts there, but talks have failed to gain traction. Saleh fled to Panjshir after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani quit Afghanistan as the Taliban marched on the capital. The fighters' lightning blitz across the country took less than a week to overrun some 300,000 government troops, most of whom surrendered or fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-stop-planes-of-evacuees-from-leaving-but-unclear-why/articleshow/85959361.cms||---

Asked if he would be meeting the Taliban leadership, the ISI chief paused to look at Pakistan’s ambassador to Kabul, Mansour Ahmad Khan, before responding himself, “I have just landed. We are working for peace and stability in Afghanistan.” Afghan crisis live updatesThe first official visit by any top Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the country fell to the Taliban was apparently hastened by the latter’s worsening dispute with allies and factions over its choice of Haibatullah Akhundzada as the supreme leader. News agency ANI quoted the unverified Twitter handle of the Panjshir Observer that the gunfire heard in Kabul on Friday night was the result of a power struggle between Baradar and Anas Haqqani. Read AlsoTaliban battle for Panjshir as US warns of Afghanistan civil warKABUL: Taliban fighters advanced deep into the last holdout province of Panjshir Sunday, as the top US general warned Afghanistan faces a wider civil war that would offer fertile ground for a resurgence of terrorism. Following their lightning-fast rout of Afghanistan's army last month — andWriting for the US-based website 19fortyfive.com, Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute said the Taliban couldn’t meet its target of unveiling a new government on September 3 because the Haqqanis and several other Taliban factions wouldn’t accept Akhundzada as their supreme leader. The delay may have signalled a much greater crisis within the Taliban, bringing ISI out of the woodwork and forcing it to depute a delegation led by Hameed for the “emergency trip” to Kabul, Rubin said. According to him, "a unitary Taliban" has always been an illusion as “the Quetta Shura is different from the Haqqani Network is different from the Northern Taliban”. Read AlsoIndia hopes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s stint as ‘international negotiator’ will have sobering effectAccording to reports, Sher Mohammed Stanekzai as well as Sirajuddin Haqqani may also be given positions of power in the new government while Baradar seems set for a leading role. Born in 1968 in Uruzgan province, Baradar is a Durrani Pashtun from the Popalzai tribe, sharing tribal loyalties withAmid what seemed to be ISI’s open intervention in the crisis within the new regime, former Afghanistan vice-president Amrullah Saleh was quoted as saying in a “dispatch from the frontline” to the UK-based Daily Mail that despite Pakistan’s claims to the contrary, the Taliban were being “micromanaged” by the ISI. “The Taliban's spokesperson receives directions, literally every hour, from the Pakistani embassy,” he said. The Pakistan Observer reported that the ISI chief was expected to meet Taliban leaders and commanders. “Issues relating to Pak-Afghan security, economy, and other matters will be taken up with the Taliban leadership,” the report said, quoting sources. According to another Pakistan newspaper, Express Tribune, Hameed will also discuss the matter of repatriation and transit through Pakistan of foreign nationals and Afghans fleeing Taliban rule. “The issue of pending requests from countries and international organisations for the repatriation/transit through Pakistan and the need to determine the mechanism through which Pakistan could allow these, in coordination with the ground authorities in Afghanistan will be discussed during the meeting with the Taliban officials,” it said. The intelligence chief will spend a day in the Afghan capital, Geo News reported. Hameed's visit to Kabul came after army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa met British foreign secretary Dominic Raab earlier in the day and said Pakistan would assist in the formation of an inclusive administration in Afghanistan. Raab had arrived in Islamabad on Thursday night to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Some Afghan factions seek a more inclusive government and are not enthusiastic about efforts to fight the Panjshiris, Rubin wrote in 19fortyfive.com. The Taliban largely conquered Afghanistan on the back of political deals rather than military victories and are unenthusiastic about the losses they now sustain in ground fighting in the valley and its approaches, he said. It is Hameed and the factions to which he directly dictates that want to finish off Ahmad Massoud and Amrullah Saleh, the two main leaders of the resistance, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/talibans-mullah-baradar-hurt-in-clash-with-haqqanis-report/articleshow/85960477.cms||---

Let us chant Allah Hu Akbar and Har Har Mahadev together,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, sharing the stage with BKU national president Naresh Tikait, social activist Medha Patkar, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav and influential farmer leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola.

All of them said the protests would continue until the government promised a “legal guarantee of MSP.” Not even 20% of the promised procurement has been done, they said. While the state government had promised loan waivers for 86 lakh farmers, only 45 lakh had received it, they added. And the number of farmers in UP who got crop insurance dropped from 72 lakh in 2016-17 to 47 lakh in 2019-20, they further said. “We will not give up.

An integrated country strategy paper drafted under new high commissioner Milinda Moragoda, who finally took charge here on August 30, calls for frequent joint military exercises, more high-level military exchanges, utilisation of India's $ 50 million counter-terrorism Line of Credit and for increasing the staff strength of defence advisor's office. The office of the Lankan high commissioner had remained vacant since January, 2020. While Moragoda was named high commissioner last year, it’s only now that he has assumed his official duty. This period coincided with some serious turbulence in bilateral ties following Sri Lanka’s decision to unilaterally banish India and Japan from the Colombo port’s East Container Terminal project that the 3 countries had agreed to jointly develop in a tripartite agreement. India was then forced to publicly remind Sri Lanka of the need to adhere to international commitments. Read AlsoChina expands its activities to Sri Lanka’s north; India worriedNEW DELHI: Red flags are going up in India over China’s fresh attempts to expand its footprint in northern Sri Lanka in the garb of infrastructure projects, with Beijing even making efforts to woo the ethnic Tamil community there. China, which has already made deep strategic inroads into Sri LankaThe Rajapaksa family’s apparent proximity to China further fuelled the ‘’trust deficit’’ in recent times. Moragoda is now seeking to address the same through the strategy proposal before President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Outlining key tasks for Lankan missions in India, the proposal seeks to enhance the partnership to a strategic level by expanding bilateral cooperation in defence and Indian Ocean maritime security and says this would safeguard Sri Lanka’s strategic interests. India had in 2019 announced a $ 50 million special Line of Credit for counter-terrorism activities which, as the paper notes, Sri Lanka is yet to utilize. ``Seeking useful ways to utilize this special Line of Credit would be important. It is understood that more Lines of Credit in the defence sector are in the pipeline,’’ it says.

Sri Lanka on Friday extended its nationwide lockdown till September 13 amidst a surge in the number of Covid-19 deaths and mounting pressure on the healthcareAmong the key implementation tasks for the Lankan missions are securing and fully utilising all training berths offered by India’s defence ministry and seeking new training opportunities with Indian paramilitary forces and police. Admitting that there is growing trust deficit because of ’’the changes in the geo-political equilibrium’’, the paper calls for transcending the transactional approach that has dominated the bilateral relationship. One of the objectives is to strengthen the bilateral relationship through regular high-level political visits between the 2 countries and enhance cooperation with India at multilateral and regional level.

---||India||As China tightens grip, Sri Lanka looks to boost India defence ties||NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over growing Chinese footprints in Sri Lanka, the neighbouring island nation is looking to boost defence and security ties with India. An integrated country strategy paper drafted under new high commissioner Milinda Moragoda, who finally took charge here on August 30, calls for frequent joint military exercises, more high-level military exchanges, utilisation of India's $ 50 million counter-terrorism Line of Credit and for increasing the staff strength of defence advisor's office. The office of the Lankan high commissioner had remained vacant since January, 2020. While Moragoda was named high commissioner last year, it’s only now that he has assumed his official duty. This period coincided with some serious turbulence in bilateral ties following Sri Lanka’s decision to unilaterally banish India and Japan from the Colombo port’s East Container Terminal project that the 3 countries had agreed to jointly develop in a tripartite agreement. India was then forced to publicly remind Sri Lanka of the need to adhere to international commitments.

China, which has already made deep strategic inroads into Sri LankaThe Rajapaksa family’s apparent proximity to China further fuelled the ‘’trust deficit’’ in recent times. Moragoda is now seeking to address the same through the strategy proposal before President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Outlining key tasks for Lankan missions in India, the proposal seeks to enhance the partnership to a strategic level by expanding bilateral cooperation in defence and Indian Ocean maritime security and says this would safeguard Sri Lanka’s strategic interests. India had in 2019 announced a $ 50 million special Line of Credit for counter-terrorism activities which, as the paper notes, Sri Lanka is yet to utilize. ``Seeking useful ways to utilize this special Line of Credit would be important. It is understood that more Lines of Credit in the defence sector are in the pipeline,’’ it says.

Sri Lanka on Friday extended its nationwide lockdown till September 13 amidst a surge in the number of Covid-19 deaths and mounting pressure on the healthcareAmong the key implementation tasks for the Lankan missions are securing and fully utilising all training berths offered by India’s defence ministry and seeking new training opportunities with Indian paramilitary forces and police. Admitting that there is growing trust deficit because of ’’the changes in the geo-political equilibrium’’, the paper calls for transcending the transactional approach that has dominated the bilateral relationship. One of the objectives is to strengthen the bilateral relationship through regular high-level political visits between the 2 countries and enhance cooperation with India at multilateral and regional level. Another objective mentioned is to resolve the contentious issue of externally displaced persons. ”The presence of Tamil externally displaced persons from Sri Lanka in India, particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu gives rise to complications in bilateral relations.

---||India||Security for judges and courts states’ responsibility, says Centre||NEW DELHI: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that it is the state governments’ responsibility to provide security to judges and court premises as police and public order are state subjects and it can just issue some guidelines which it has already done. “Public order and police are covered under List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and, hence, security to the courts and the judges is within the purview of the States/UTs concerned. However, in order to strengthen the security arrangements in this regard, guidelines have been issued by the MHA...for the security of the high courts and the district/ subordinate courts. The said guidelines, inter-alia, prescribe that the Protection Review Group (PRG), consisting of state spécial branch, intelligence and home departments will undertake periodic review of the security arrangements for the high courts and the district/ subordinate courts as well as the judges,” the Centre said. As the apex court is examining measures to beef up security of judges after it took suo motu cognisance of the murder of a trial court judge from Jharkhand recently and sought response from states and Centre, the government said that it issued guidelines way back in 2007 as per which specialised unit/branch is required to be created by the states and UTs to look after the security of judges/courts. The court is also to decide whether a special force on the line of Railway Protection Force be set up under the control of judiciary for protection of judges and court premises on a PIL filed by Karaunakar Mahalik through his advocate Durga Dutt. “The guidelines issued by MHA mandate that the Protection Review Group (PRG) will undertake review of security arrangements for the HCs and district/ subordinate courts as well as the judges. The registrar general of the respective HCs shall also be invited to PRG meetings when such arrangements are being discussed. The PRG will approve the security measures . The PRG will undertake security review after every 6 months," the government said in its latest affidavit. The Centre, in its earlier affidavit, told the court that here was no need to create a dedicated security force for judiciary and contended that a special unit or branch should be formed within the state police for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/security-for-judges-and-courts-states-responsibility-says-centre/articleshow/85961111.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Varun Gandhi backs protesting farmers, calls them own ‘flesh and blood’||BAREILLY: BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from PIlibhit Varun Gandhi on Sunday backed farmers protesting against the three new farm laws, saying that they are “our own flesh and blood”. Sharing a video of the large turnout at the farmers’ mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar, he tweeted, “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground.” With about 10,000 tweets, “Varun Gandhi” was trending at number 29 in India at the time of filing this report. Over the entire day, “#Muzaffarnagar” was the longest trending in India, over 13 hours. “I have always felt the pain of farmers. That is why, since 2009, I have donated my salary earned as MP to families of farmers who had killed themselves,” Gandhi told TOI. In his book on rural India, he had written about the struggles of marginal farmers. On Aug 31, he had met farmers in his constituency to discuss their problems. And last week, when the Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha was purportedly heard asking cops to “break the heads” of protesting farmers, he had tweeted the video, saying, “I hope this video is edited and the DM (sic) did not say this… Otherwise, this is unacceptable in democratic India to do to our own citizens.” About that, he told TOI, “I had shared my reaction to the Karnal video because it was intolerable under any circumstance. I have been meeting farmer leaders to understand their issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/varun-gandhi-backs-protesting-farmers-calls-them-own-flesh-and-blood/articleshow/85961240.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Despite surge in footfall, city restaurants struggle to stay afloat with the 10 pm deadline||Restaurateurs across the state collectively heaved a sigh of relief when their operation timing was extended from 4pm to 10pm. However, it’s been almost a month since these relaxations were announced, but the hospitality industry still struggles to stay afloat. Apart from operations permitted only till 10pm at 50 per cent capacity, it’s the lack of transportation facilities, high rent and property taxes and slow vaccination drives that continue to hinder their growth. “None of the other metro cities in the country have imposed such an unreasonable deadline. We hope that the government will understand our plight and ease the restrictions to allow restaurants to operate till 1.30am,” says Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, Vice President, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI). ‘Availability of vaccinated staff is a big issue’Rachel Goenka, owner of restaurants chains like The Sassy Spoon and House Of Mandarin, says, “The extension on the operating hours as well as the permission to stay open over the weekend came as a much-needed respite at a time when the hospitality industry was barely holding on. We’re looking forward to the situation across the state getting better by the day. Even with all of these relaxations, we’re dealing with issues such as the availability of staff, especially those who are fully vaccinated, and the limited means of transportation for them to reach the restaurants. Operating at lower capacities is affecting our revenue and the slow vaccination drive is only adding to the fear among patrons.” Mumbaikars feel restricted, miss the city’s long-lost nightlifeNightlife is a substantial part of the city’s culture, and for months, Mumbaikars had been looking forward to dining out late in the evenings after work. “But people either have to rush through their dinner now or, in many cases, they are unable to even finish their meals. Time spent at a restaurant is for leisure and a little relaxation. However, with the 10pm deadline, the experience feels more like following a schedule,” says Pradeep Shetty, Senior Vice President, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI). Adding to that, Gurbaxish Singh Kohli shares, “Maharashtra has done a commendable job handling the COVID-19 crisis after the second wave. But, the same cannot be said about the way it has handled the lifting of lockdowns or restrictions imposed on businesses. Restaurants in the state are bearing the brunt of this.” While mentioning the extent to which the curtailed timings are not commercially viable for businesses, Pradeep Shetty informs, “Over 50 per cent of restaurants in Maharashtra have permanently shut down.” Among the many restaurants to go down in the past few weeks is Malini and Rahul Akerkar’s Qualia. “Shutting down a business is painful,” shares Rahul, adding, “As entrepreneurs, we make tough decisions to keep the business running through tough times no matter what. But we are equally responsible for balancing hope and reality, and for knowing when to pull the plug. We were a new restaurant, barely 10 months old, when we had to shut down for the first time. It became economically unsustainable during the pandemic.” For 26-year-old Mumbaikar Prabhaas Dutta, the 10pm deadline has been disappointing, too. “Most of my friends and family members are fully vaccinated and then we have to deal with some really unreasonable rules like the 10pm deadline. We are following all the precautions and still cannot do something basic like dine out at night. Recently, I noticed two restaurants that had to turn away so many guests around 10 pm, and it’s heartbreaking to see them do that while business has been suffering.” Surge in footfall seen after relaxation in guidelinesMost restaurants across the city have definitely seen a major surge in footfall, specifically over the weekends. “In the new normal, we have observed that more consumers are comfortable with making a reservation prior to their visit instead of waiting in line for tables,” says Rachel. Raj Sadvilkar from Angrezi Dhaba chain of restaurants adds, “Dinner business constitutes around 75 per cent of the total revenue for any typical restaurant. We anticipate more relaxation of restrictions in the near future.” Restaurateurs hope for more support from the government while they try to revive the industry. Rachel says, “The hospitality industry could use more government intervention and support in terms of excise discounts, property tax waivers, rent reliefs, preferential vaccination drives for restaurant employees, and restored operating hours.” ‘Restaurateurs need to be on the government task force, too’Last month, owners of restaurants, bars and hotels across Maharashtra protested to restore their original operation timings. Members of three associations — NRAI, HRAWI and AHAR — even met Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to voice their grievances and concerns. “When we spoke to the CM at length, we learnt that the disaster management cell has been guiding him. And while doctors are adept at running hospitals, the concerns of the hospitality industry are different. We can understand the fear they have, but right now, the focus should be on livelihood. The CM’s intentions are actually great, but they aren’t involving the real stakeholders in the decision-making process, so it doesn’t work,” FHRAI’s Gurbaxish Singh Kohli had shared after their meeting. This was followed by CM’s meeting with the disaster management cell, which subsequently led to the relaxation of timings till 10pm. While the deadline extension from 4pm to 10pm did provide some respite to many in this beleaguered food and beverage industry, restaurateurs now hope for further extensions till the licensed timing of 1.30am. “There is no clarity on when things will change. We are really struggling due to lack of communication. We need to be on the government task force to help each other,” says restaurateur Amrish Arora from Flamboyante. “We now plan to submit a representation to the Maharashtra government and then follow it up with a meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray,” adds HRAWI’s Pradeep Shetty.

Mamata needs to be elected to the assembly within six months of having taken oath as CM, with November 5 as the deadline. She had stepped out of her comfort zone to contest the Nandigram seat, which she lost to her estranged aide-turned-BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari by a narrow margin. The CM’s appeal against the election outcome is pending in the Calcutta high court. Bhowanipore is not just Mamata’s home turf, but also the seat that twice elected her — in 2011, when she toppled the then mighty Left, and again in 2016. TMC also named Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam for the two other seats — Jangipur and Samserganj, both in Murshidabad — where bypolls will be held. While Trinamool was first off the blocks in announcing its list, Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacaharya indicated that the party may firm up its list for the three Bengal bypolls after a meeting on Tuesday (September 7). State BJP president Dilip Ghosh indicated they would field a strong candidate against Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-to-contest-from-turf-will-give-tough-fight-bjp/articleshow/85961390.cms||---

At the same time, India reported its lowest weekly death toll from the virus in 23 weeks since March 22-28. There were 2,533 fatalities from the coronavirus during the week, the first time since March 29-April 4 that the toll had dropped below 3,000. Covid cases continued to be relatively high, mainly due to the surge in Kerala. India recorded over 2,89,700 new infections in the week (August 30-September 5), just 0.7% lower than last week’s tally of 2,91,644. Kerala logged 2,00,430 fresh cases in the week, its highest in 16 weeks since May 10-16 and 69% of the national total. The last time any Indian state had recorded over 2 lakh cases (in a week ending Sunday) was 14 weeks ago when Tamil Nadu logged 2.26 lakh in May 24-30. However, amid signs that massive Covid wave in Kerala may have peaked, the state registered a 3.8% surge in weekly cases as compared with a 56% spike last week. Meanwhile, deaths from the virus in India fell by a massive 26% this week as the toll in Maharashtra and Odisha dropped substantially. On Sunday, the country reported 219 fatalities, the first time that the daily toll had dropped below 300 since March 29. This was the lowest single-day Covid toll in 167 days since March 22. The daily case count fell below 40,000 to 39,571 (with Jharkhand data still awaited), with Kerala reporting 26,701 fresh infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hits-2-lakh-weekly-cases-india-covid-toll-at-23-week-low/articleshow/85961468.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Members of the state Covid-19 taskforce urged physicians to suspect Covid even in cases where the hallmark signs of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath are absent. Listing some of the evolving symptoms, Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the Covid taskforce, said difficulty in hearing, conjunctivitis, extreme weakness, dry mouth and reduced saliva secretion, long lasting headache and skin rashes could be signs of Covid-19 too. “Although the disease has been around for 17 months, newer symptoms are still evolving and we need to watch them,” he said, speaking in an online conference chaired by CM Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. Globally, there are few documented cases of sensorineural hearing loss associated with Covid-19. An inflammation of the auditory nerve or a clot caused by the viral infection could affect hearing just like it affects the sense of smell, said Dr Samir Bhargava, head of ENT at RN Cooper Hospital. “But, we haven’t seen any exponential jump in case of sudden hearing loss though we are alert since viral infections are known to cause that,” he said, adding that such patients need treatment with steroids. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the taskforce, said during the second wave that was driven by the Delta variant, most presented only gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Even fever can be present in varying forms, he said. Some do not get any fever, some get it in sudden bursts, some in intervals of two-three days, while in many it completely subsides only to return with severity. “The fever profile could be vastly varied,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/acute-headache-hearing-loss-among-covid-red-flags/articleshow/85961623.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The ministers will formally inaugurate the 3.5-km-long airstrip, which is the first one on any National Highway (NH) in the country. Sources said two such airstrips on national highways have been completed in Andhra Pradesh and two more are under development, one each in West Bengal and J&K. Tenders have been floated for four other such trips on national highways. Originally, 28 national highway stretches were identified for developing them as airstrips for emergency landing by fighter aircrafts. Sources said experts are visiting different spots to assess ground situation. These were identified near the international border in the states including J&K, Punjab, Gujarat and West Bengal. In 2016, the road transport and highways ministry had announced the setting up of an inter-ministerial joint committee with the defence ministry and the IAF to look into the feasibility of setting up these strips. Currently, one such strip is operational on the Lucknow-Agra expressway in Uttar Pradesh. Several countries, including Germany, Sweden, South Korea, Taiwan, Finland, Switzerland and Singapore have dedicated stretches on their highways and expressways for aircraft to land and take off in emergencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-drill-iaf-plane-with-two-ministers-to-land-on-highway/articleshow/85961792.cms||Dipak K Dash

ToI has also learnt that while Pakistan has proposed a visit by Indian authorities for an anti-terror exercise of the SCO, in keeping with the group’s protocol, India has not yet decided whether or not to participate. As per the proposal, India has to send 3 officials for the event but the government apparently is not very enthusiastic about participating in an anti-terror exercise in a country it continues to identify as a state sponsor of terrorism. Official sources said Modi will not be visiting Dushanbe for the summit and will address the meeting virtually. In keeping with India’s statements on Afghanistan at UNSC and also UN Human Rights Council, Modi is unlikely to name Taliban in his statement. Despite India’s reservations about Taliban’s links with Pakistan based terror groups, India believes the group has reacted positively to concerns expressed by India and will wait to see if the Taliban actually walk the talk. Before SCO, on September 9, Modi will also participate virtually in the BRICS summit. The BRICS Declaration is also the likely to express concern about the security situation in Afghanistan. At the SCO summit though, which according to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will focus on the consequences of US actions, India may not want to sound excessively hostile to Pakistan. Islamabad clearly has the backing of both Russia and China who dominate the bloc and believe Pakistan’s influence with the Taliban will be important in ensuring stability in the country. Russia and China had recently abstained from voting on a UNSC resolution on Afghanistan that India saw as addressing its concerns related to terrorism perpetrated by UNSC designated individuals and entities. Russia saw the same resolution as an ’’unwillingness to recognize the obvious and an inclination to divide terrorists into ours and theirs” as it didn’t name ISIS and ETIM that is active in China’s Xinjiang province. Moscow also alleged that there was an attempt by Western countries to shift the blame for the US failure in Afghanistan to the Taliban movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-sco-summit-pm-modi-set-to-focus-on-terror-in-imrans-presence/articleshow/85961952.cms||Sachin Parashar

Seven people, including two women have been arrested in the case till now. As per the initial probe, at least 30 candidates are believed to have availed the services of the gang till now. Among the absconding prime suspects is a senior official of Noida-based firm Affinity Education who has gone underground since the raids and a Bangalore-based suspect who colluded with arrested suspect Ranjeet Thakur and arranged for “expert solvers”. These solvers took remote access of the computer assigned to their students and then solved the paper for them in order to get them a higher rank. They are supposedly former engineering exam toppers and a few work as teachers as well. Also under the scanner are a few staffers of the college in Sonipat apart from some invigilators who let the gang take control of the computer systems.

Police will ensure appropriate legal action.” He further said, “The Chhattisgarh government respects and honours the feelings of all castes, religions and communities.” He said he came to know about talk on social media that action is not being taken against Nandkumar because he is the CM’s father. Deen Dayal Nagar police station here took cognizance of a complaint filed by Brahmin Samaj and registered a case against Nandkumar Baghel under the IPC.

The CAC is the apex advisory body under the Real Estate Regulation Act (Rera), a central Act aimed at primarily protecting the interest of homebuyers headed by housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri. In a letter addressed to the Union housing secretary, CAC member and head of a pan-India homebuyers’s body, FPCE, Abhay Upadhyay, flagged how last year the Centre in “the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic” provided a suo-motu extension of six months for completion of real estate projects across the country. It had delegated the authority to state Reras to give another three months extension. “This was done by the CAC meeting in April 2020 only with the sole purpose of giving relief to builders at the huge cost of homebuyers…, Maharashtra, UP and Karnataka have recklessly, in blatant disregard to homebuyer rights, have given another extension to the real estate projects under the garb of Covid-19 second wave,” Upadhyay said. The letter mentioned that on August 6, the Maharashtra Rera extended timelines for project completion for six months; on August 18, UP Rera extended the completion deadline for nine months and on August 27, Karnataka RERA gave a similar extension for six months. The CAC member has said the 2020 advisory by the housing ministry “under pressure from builders has opened floodgates of extensions”. He has said Rera authorities are randomly giving blanket extensions even when there was no work stoppage nor complete lockdown announced either by the central government or by any state government. Upadhyay has said his organisation had opposed any such blanket extension last year when it was brought before the CAC. It had also sought relief for homebuyers since they were facing hardships due to job losses, pay cuts, EMIs and rents. “It is also pertinent to mention that the CAC has not met since, possibly because the handle to give relief to builders has been handed over to the RERA authorities in the states, and as an unwritten rule homebuyer’s agenda is not considered to be worth taking up for consideration by the CAC, which certainly smacks of pro builder bias,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/withdraw-extensions-to-builders-government-urged/articleshow/85962262.cms||Dipak K Dash

M Mounesh’s parents M Ragavendra and Sunkamma work as labourers and live on the edge of Kudtini town in a makeshift hut. The boy studied up to Class IV in a local school and joined Morarji Residential School in Siruguppa taluk’s Nadavi village for Class V from where he completed Class X where all expenses were borne by the government. When the boy showed interest in pursuing technical education but was about to quit as he couldn’t raise money, principal S Mallappa and staff of Government Polytechnic College at Kudligi arrived at his house with an application form and formally admitted him to the course. After learning that the principal had sponsored the boy’s three-year education at the polytechnic, Karnataka higher education minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan assured the boy and principal that the government will bear his education expenses. Mounesh said his education for the past five years was free and he was in a dilemma about continuing studies. “My parents earn barely enough to keep the kitchen fires burning. It’s my good fortune that Mal- lappa Sir and the higher education minister have extended support to me,” he added. The boy’s elder sister Hemavati notched up 95% in SSLC exams and is now pursuing Arts at a PU college and his brothers Chandrashekar and Mahesh are in Class VIII and III. His mother Sunkamma said, “Since we do not have a shelter or regular income, we couldn’t afford my son’s higher education. He has got an opportunity to study further thanks to the gesture shown by the government and the college.” Mounesh, who opted for cybersecurity in his diploma, said he would plough it back into society by encouraging poor students to continue their education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-college-went-to-nomadic-boys-home/articleshow/85962803.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

The move comes in the wake of the World Health Organisation raising concern last month about counterfeit versions of Covishield circulating in the international market. While the Centre had apprised states about certain parameters that they should monitor to recognise counterfeits, the health ministry again issued a letter to states earlier this week, asking them to keep a close watch. In a letter to states and UTs, Dr Manohar Agnani, additional secretary in the health ministry, highlighted information on genuine vaccine labels and additional information of the vaccines currently in use in India — Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Agnani asked states to share the information with the program managers and service providers.

The results of the HDMC poll are going to further strengthen the roots of BJP if it bounces back to power again as it is very crucial for BJP to win the election since Hubballi-Dharwad has been the party’s strong hold for more than two decades and it’s also the home town of CM Basavaraj Bommai, former CM Jagadish Shettar and union minister Pralhad Joshi. However, Congress leaders claim that lower voter turnout in this election which recorded 53.81 % voting, is advantage for the Congress and it will benefit the party to win more seats than the BJP. Whether this comes true will be known on Monday. Congress also invested considerable resources to capture HDMC this time as it failed to win election with a clear majority since 2007. HDMC is also going to be the biggest corporation with 82 members after BBMP. Though there is a direct fight between BJP and Congress, AAP and JD (S) are also in the fray. All parties are now setting their eyes on the results which are expected to be out on Monday around 1pm. Even Congress and JD(S) are also working modalities to come together if there is a fractured mandate to keep communal forces away from enjoying power. Anilkumar Patil, former mayor and president, Congress district rural committee told TOI that there is need of a clear majority of 42 seats to come to power. “We are confident that voters will support Congress and will get a clear majority this time since BJP failed to meet basic facilities like 24x7 water to all wards, good roads and other issues during its two tenure from 2007. We will focus on completing the 24x7 water scheme in all wards, develop dust-free roads and take up other works if we come to power”, he added. Gururaj Hunisimard, JD(S) district president said, “JD(S) is contesting in 40 wards and gave tough competition in 28 wards. We are sure that we will win more than 12 seats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/results-of-civic-body-polls-today/articleshow/85962880.cms||---

---||India||Kharif holds promise amid skewed rains||NEW DELHI: In what could signal another good crop year of foodgrain production in the country despite skewed rainfall distribution, sowing of kharif (summer sown) crops has almost caught up with the sown area of last year’s corresponding period, with minimum three weeks of seasonal operation still in hand. Latest sown area data of agriculture ministry shows that the acreage of kharif crops (paddy, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, maize and other coarse cereals), as on last Friday, for the first time this season crossed the total average acreage of last five years (1,073 lakh hectares) which is considered ‘normal’ acreage of the entire sowing season. As of last Friday, the kharif acreage stood at 1,082 lakh hectares which was merely 40 lakh hectares less than the total acreage (1,122 lakh hectares) of summer sown crops in 2020. Officials tracking the sowing operation believe that this gap can easily be bridged in the next three weeks as this period is also expected to get good monsoon rains. Though it had crossed the ‘normal’ acreage threshold of ‘corresponding period’ almost a month ago, the higher than ‘normal’ sown area of the entire season by nearly nine lakh hectares indicates that the overall sown area may almost touch the record level of last year by end of this month. “It has already crossed the ‘normal’ acreage threshold, giving a good sign of recovery in the past one months despite a huge monsoon rain deficit of over 24% in August. As sowing operation continues, the overall sown area figure will definitely reach close to the 2020 mark,” said an official. Asked about the reason for the good progress despite the rain deficit, the official added, “It’s possible due to drought-proofing (setting up irrigation infrastructure) of northwest India which depends less on monsoon compared to rainfed areas of central India. Besides, farmers are also gradually switching from water-guzzler paddy to less water-consuming crops such as coarse cereals and pulses in the region.” Since the practice of using ground water is also highly prevalent in Punjab and Haryana, the farmers in these states invariably resort to such methods of irrigation in absence of rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kharif-holds-promise-amid-skewed-rains/articleshow/85963045.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Asserting that he was not hankering after any organisational post nor looking outside Congress, contrary to reports, Patel told TOI, “AAP has come to Gujarat to stop the voters angry with BJP from voting for Congress. Its job is to tap mid way the drift of angry voters towards Congress, which will hurt Congress and help BJP.” “Somebody is helping them. That somebody may be Delhi,” Patel said, in an allusion to the Modi-led BJP. The young leader added, “You look at the freedom they have got to campaign in Gujarat and the expenditure on it. It is massive. Also, their banners are allowed to stay in public places for 45 days or even longer, whereas those of others are taken down in no time,” he said. Patel said BJP has played the game of inserting new players in the state politics in last three assembly elections through independent outfits launched by BJP dissenters, which took away crucial anti BJP votes and badly undercut the chances of Congress. The star of Aam Aadmi Party started shining in Gujarat after it performed well in the Surat municipal elections in February. Kejriwal and his senior colleagues have since been visiting Gujarat to strengthen the party there. With the Congress said to be planning an organisational overhaul in Gujarat, Hardik denied that he was demanding an elevation and asserted that he will continue to work with “full energy” for the party. “I don’t require a post. I want a good government in Gujarat which can only be given by Congress,” he said. He said the party high command is to take a decision on the state president and the legislature party leader, besides appointing a new state in-charge of the AICC. “We will all abide by the decision of the leadership. Whether they decide to change the present PCC and CLP leaders, or decide to continue with them, we will work with full commitment,” he said. Patel said he is “just 27 years old” and the working president of the state Congress, and “since I was in jail for nine months, I am a man with patience”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hardik-says-aap-trying-to-hurt-congress-in-gujarat-hints-at-bjp-nexus/articleshow/85963087.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

RSS national media head Sunil Ambekar said Infosys has made seminal contributions in the progress of the country and that Panchjanya is not the RSS mouthpiece, in what is a strong refutation of the claims made in the report.  “There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects individual opinion of the author,” Ambekar said in a statement. The RSS functionary further said, “Panchjanya is not a mouthpiece of the RSS and the said article or opinions expressed in it should not be linked with the RSS.” The magazine, other than English weekly “Organiser”, is published by Bharat Prakashan, which is considered to be part of the RSS thought. Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar, however, stuck to the report published on September 5.  “Panchjanya stands by the facts published by it in the cover story. If Infosys has any objections, it should suggest an extensive investigation into the facts and should put forth its point of view,” Shankar told TOI. The editor also said there are certain sections of people attributing the report to the RSS, which is incorrect. The “Organiser” editor Praful Ketkar asserted that there is no denying that the two magazines are ideologically inspired by the RSS. “However, we have objections if you call the two magazines as RSS mouthpieces,” Ketkar said. He said the management of both the magazines are autonomous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rss-distances-itself-from-panchjanyas-infosys-article/articleshow/85963095.cms||---

The survey conducted by Morning Consult, which tracks popularity ratings of a host of global leaders, has put PM Modi with 70% approval on the top of the list.  The list also includes US President Joe Biden and UK PM Boris Johnson, whose approval rating is far below that of Modi. “Self-reliant India and its hard-working leadership are leading the world. PM Narendra Modi continues to top the list of world’s most popular leaders with a 70% global approval rating,” Shah said. Nadda said, “The highest ranking for Narendra Modi in the global approval rating is a matter of pride and honour for the country. This is a result of people’s blessings to his welfare policies for the masses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-nadda-hail-modi-as-global-survey-gives-him-highest-ranking/articleshow/85963142.cms||---

It advised the BJP leaders to go through the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry before criticising the state government.  Speaking to the media at the party office, YSRC legislator Malladi Vishnu said the government appealed to the public to celebrate the festival indoors in view of Covid-19. He said the Union home secretary had on August 18 asked all the states to take appropriate measures to prevent mass gatherings during the festival season in view of the pandemic situation. “The state government had suspended the Teachers’ Day celebrations and the YSR Lifetime Awards function in the backdrop of the spread of Covid-19.” Vishnu criticised BJP state chief Somu Veerraju for trying to create a communal rift. “The state government had also imposed curbs during Ramzan, Bakrid and Muharram. The government is acting with the utmost responsibility. BJP leaders are creating unnecessary controversies,” Vishnu claimed.  “People were not allowed even at Independence Day celebrations as part of Covid-19 regulations. Police have been taking measures to prevent mass gatherings at private functions and festivals. It has become a regular practice for BJP leaders to link chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s religious belief with the government decisions,” Vishnu added.  He asked BJP leaders to focus on getting more funds and projects from the Centre and stop divisive politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/row-over-ganesh-chaturthi-pandals-unnecessary-says-ysrc-legislator/articleshow/85956474.cms||Samdani MN

The attack targeted a Frontier Corps (FC) check post on the Mastung road in Quetta, the provincial capital, deputy inspector General of Quetta police Azhar Akram said. He told reporters that an initial investigations suggested that the suicide bomber drove an explosives laden motorcycle into a vehicle carrying Frontier Corps. “The bomb disposal squad has estimated that the motorcycle was laden with 6kg of explosives,” he said. Akram confirmed that four people were killed in the blast while 20 others, 18 soldiers and 2 bystanders, were injured. “Some of the injured people are in a critical condition and the casualties could rise.” The banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack sending a grim signal that the change of government in Kabul might not end the woes of Pakistan as the country looks towards the Taliban to rein in the TTP rebels who are hiding in Afghanistan. According to security forces, the vehicle targeted in the attack was providing security to vegetable sellers belonging to the Hazara community of the province. Condemning the attack, PM Imran Khan took to Twitter to offer condolences to the families of those killed. “Condemn the TTP suicide attack on FC check post. My condolences go to the families of the martyrs & prayers for the recovery of the injured. Salute our security forces & their sacrifices to keep us safe by thwarting foreign-backed terrorists' designs,” he said in a tweet. Balochistan home minister Mir Ziaullah Langove also condemned the attack and sought a report. “These attacks will not lower the morale of the forces,” he said, adding that the war against terrorism would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistani-taliban-bomber-blows-himself-up-in-balochistan-4-security-personnel-killed/articleshow/85963221.cms||---

University classes to be behind veil||KABUL: Women attending private Afghan universities must wear an abaya robe and niqab covering most of the face, the Taliban have ordered, and classes must be segregated by sex — or at least divided by a curtain. In a lengthy document issued by the Taliban’s education authority, they also ordered that female students should only be taught by other women, but if that was not possible then “old men” of good character could fill in. The decree applies to private colleges and universities, which have mushroomed since the Taliban’s first rule ended in 2001. During that period, girls and women were mostly excluded from education because of rules regarding same-sex classrooms and the insistence they had to be accompanied by a male relative whenever they left the house. There was no order for women to wear the all-enveloping burqa in the new regulations issued late on Saturday, but the niqab effectively covers most of the face anyway, leaving just the eyes exposed. In recent years burqas and niqabs have largely vanished from the streets of Kabul, but are seen more frequently in smaller cities and towns. The decree comes as private universities prepare to open on Monday. “Universities are required to recruit female teachers for female students based on their facilities,” the decree said, adding that men and women should use separate entrances and exits. If it is not possible to hire women teachers, then colleges “should try to hire old men teachers who have a good record of behaviour”. While women now have to study separately, they must also end their lesson five minutes earlier than men to stop them from mingling outside. They must then stay in waiting rooms until their male counterparts have left the building, according to the decree issued by the Taliban higher education ministry. “Practically, it is a difficult plan — we don’t have enough female instructors or classes to segregate the girls,” said a university professor. “But the fact that they are allowing girls to go to schools and universities is a big positive step,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/curtains-for-women-freedom-university-classes-to-be-behind-veil/articleshow/85963324.cms||---

M Mounesh’s parents M Raghavendra and Sunkamma work as labourers and live on the edge of Kudtini town in a makeshift hut. The boy studied up to Class IV in a local school and joined Morarji Residential School in Siruguppa taluk’s Nadavi village for Class V from where he completed Class X where all expenses were borne by the government. When the boy showed interest in pursuing technical education but was about to quit as he couldn’t raise money, principal S Mallappa and staff of Government Polytechnic College at Kudligi arrived at his house with an application form and formally admitted him to the course. Boy was on the verge of calling it quits: Principal  After learning that the principal had sponsored the boy’s three-year education at the polytechnic, higher education minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan assured the boy and principal that the government will bear his education expenses. Thanking the college and the government, Mounesh said his education for the past five years was free and he was in a dilemma about continuing studies. “My parents earn barely enough to keep the kitchen fires burning. It’s my good fortune that Mallappa Sir and the higher education minister extended support ,” he added. The boy’s elder sister Hemavati notched up 95% in SSLC exams and is pursuing arts at a PU college; his brothers Chandrashekar and Mahesh are in class 8 and 3. Mother Sunkamma said, “Since we do not have a shelter or regular income, we couldn’t afford my son’s higher education. He has got an opportunity to study further thanks to the government and the college.” Mounesh, who was opted for cybersecurity in his diploma, said he would plough it back to society by encouraging poor students to continue studies. Principal Mallappa said he volunteered to foot fees for the next three years as the boy was on the verge of calling it quits and supporting family by taking up a job. ‘‘Polytechnic principal Mallappa won my heart through his gesture. The government will take care of Mounesh’s education expenses. This is also the aim of National Education Policy: Take education to the doorstep of every student,” said CN Ashwath Narayan, minister for higher education.

The woman, named in local media as Banu Negar, was killed at the family home in front of relatives in Firozkoh, the capital of central Ghor province. The killing comes amid increasing reports of escalating repression of women in Afghanistan. Details of the incident are still sketchy as many in Firozkoh fear retribution if they speak out. But three sources have told the BBC that the Taliban beat and shot dead Negar in front of her husband and children on Saturday. Relatives supplied graphic images showing blood spattered on a wall in the corner of a room and a body, the face heavily disfigured, the report added. The family say Negar, who worked at the local prison, was eight months pregnant. Three gunmen arrived at the house on Saturday and searched it before tying members of the family up, relatives say. The intruders were heard speaking Arabic, a witness said. The Taliban told the BBC they had no involvement in Negar's death and are investigating the incident. Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said: "We are aware of the incident and I am confirming that the Taliban have not killed her, our investigation is ongoing." He added that the Taliban had already announced an amnesty for people who worked for the previous administration, and put Negar's murder down to "personal enmity or something else".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-kill-female-police-officer-in-front-of-her-relatives/articleshow/85963438.cms||---

In a statement, Nepal’s home ministry said that the PM has taken a note of “chanting slogans, holding demonstrations and protest and burning effigies to tarnish the image of the neighbouring friendly nation’s PM”. The home ministry statement, however, did not identify the leader. The statement came after students and youth organisations belonging to both the ruling alliance and the opposition burnt effigies of PM Modi during protests over the death of a Nepalese youth when he was crossing the Mahakali river near the border with India in July. The home ministry said it will take action to control the activities targeted against the neighbouring nation and will punish those who involve themselves in such unlawful activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/nepal-govt-warns-citizens-against-acts-that-may-hurt-friendly-nations/articleshow/85963480.cms||---
---||World||Taliban pledge safety for humanitarian workers: UN||UNITED NATIONS: The Taliban on Sunday pledged to guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers and aid access in Afghanistan in a meeting with the UN humanitarian chief in Kabul, a UN spokesman said. Martin Griffiths was in the Afghan capital on Sunday for several days of meetings with Taliban leadership amid a looming humanitarian disaster in the country newly under the control of the hardline Islamists. "The authorities pledged that the safety and security of humanitarian staff, and humanitarian access to people in need, will be guaranteed and that humanitarian workers -- both men and women -- will be guaranteed freedom of movement," a statement from UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Griffiths reiterated in the meeting that the humanitarian community was committed to delivering "impartial and independent humanitarian assistance," the statement added. He also called on all parties to ensure the rights and safety of women, both those contributing to aid delivery and civilians. Women's freedoms in Afghanistan were sharply curtailed under the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule. The UN says Afghanistan is mired in a humanitarian crisis affecting 18 million people, or half the population. Even before the Taliban's lightning offensive that ousted the Western-backed government on August 15, Afghanistan was already heavily aid-dependent -- with 40 percent of the country's GDP drawn from foreign funding. But the future of aid missions in the country under the Taliban has been a source of concern for the UN and aid groups, despite Taliban pledges of a softer brand of rule than during their first stint in power. Several relief organizations have previously confirmed to AFP they were in talks with the Taliban to continue their operations, or have already received security guarantees for existing programs. The UN said this week humanitarian flights had resumed to several Afghan provinces. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged "the Taliban and all other parties to exercise utmost restraint to protect lives and to ensure that humanitarian needs can be met" in a report to the Security Council this weekend. The report was compiled as the mandate of the UN political mission in Afghanistan is scheduled to expire on September 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-pledge-safety-for-humanitarian-workers-un/articleshow/85963738.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Authorities gear up to avert crisis at Somasila project gates in Nellore||AMARAVATI: The irrigation authorities at Somasila project in Nellore district are on their toes as flood level is increasing in the reservoir. The authorities had a tough time last year in lifting crest gates during floods. Although they averted a crisis at the eleventh hour by managing to lift the gates, the recent incident of a crest gate washing away at Pulichintala project due to heavy floods is worrying the administration. Irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav recently reviewed the situation and directed the officials to avoid slip-ups. The water level at Somasila project has already touched 68 tmc ft against the full reservoir level (FRL) of 72 tmc ft. Heavy rains in upstream areas are leading to increase in water level at the project. However, the officials are anticipating that the water reserves would reach FRL in another three or four days. Although the project authorities have managed to overcome several issues since the tough time faced during the last flood, the remote control system to operate the crest gates is yet to be fully repaired. This would force the officials to operate the gates in manual mode and any technical glitch in the eleventh hour might repeat the Pulichintala kind of mishap during the floods. The authorities lifted the gates at Somasila on September 16 last year to let out water. However, they faced trouble when they tried to lift the gates a fortnight later when the power supply was snapped due to heavy floods in the region. The diesel generator which was kept on stand-by could not pump energy required to lift the gates. The officials had to down the gates before lifting them again with difficulty. The gantry crane available at the project was yet to be tested for its operational efficacy in spite of knowing it was the most needed machine to fix the stop gates during the emergency. “We have kept everything ready to operate the gates. We will go for manual operation of the gates,” said K Dhanunjay, executive engineer||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/authorities-gear-up-to-avertcrisis-at-somasila-project-gates/articleshow/85958405.cms||Samdani MN

According to police, Rai, who works in a factory in Karanj village near Mandvi, is a native of Khamhori village in Shivan district of Bihar. The accused is a married man and father of two children. “On August 24, a woman was found brutally murdered near railway tracks in Nandurbar district.

Police in Nandurbar alerted Surat police after they found out that the accused and victim were both from Surat. “After we detained Rai, he confessed to the crime and told the police that he had murdered Seeta Bhagat (23), a resident of Bihar, with whom he was having an affair for the past two years. He brought Seeta from Bihar to Surat 10 days ago and then came to know that Seeta had been in love with another man earlier against whom she had lodged a complaint of rape. She allegedly threatened Rai that if he will not marry her, she would lodge a complaint of rape against him too. So fearing rape complaint, he decided to eliminate her,” police said. Rai took Seeta by train to Nandurbar and duo deboarded one stop before Nandurbar. He then took her to a remote location near the railway track where he brutally murdered her with a blade.

Felicitating 20 schoolteachers selected from different parts of the state at the education department’s conference hall here on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, the minister said the process of appointment of teachers in a transparent manner is already on and qualified and competent teachers are being appointed by authorised bodies against sanctioned posts. Chaudhary said there would be no dearth of teachers anywhere in the state now. “Teachers will have to give their 100% to the students.

Children of the state have suffered a lot owing to the pandemic and now it is the responsibility of the teachers to compensate for the academic loss by making some extra efforts,” he added. Paying his tribute to former President S Radhakrishnan whose birthday is celebrated as Teachers’ Day, the minister said teachers should be role models for their students. “Selected schoolteachers are awarded every year on Teachers’ Day with a view to motivating and encouraging others for giving their best to the future generation of the society. This creates a better academic environment by infusing positive energy in the teaching community,” he said. The minister presented a cash award of Rs 15,000 and a citation to all the teachers felicitated on the occasion. Two of the felicitated teachers – Chandana Dutt of Govt Middle School, Ranti (Madhubani) and Haridas Sharma of R K Middle School, Dahrak (Kaimur) – also received ‘Rashtriya Shikshak Puraskar’ awarded by the Union ministry of education on Sunday.

In his autobiography, he mentions “its (the site’s) vicinity to the Sabarmati Central Jail was for me a special attraction. As going to jail is understood to be normal for many Satyagrahis, I liked this location. And I knew that sites selected for jails have generally clean surroundings”. Indeed, the jail witnessed Mahatma’s first imprisonment in India in 1922 when he was lodged from March 11 to 20 on charges of sedition. He came back to Sabarmati Central Jail later for only a day on August 1, 1933 before he was sent to Yerawada jail in Pune.

Prison inmates, mostly convicts, also record audio books at a studio here for persons with visual impairment.Today, the Gandhi Yard at Ahmedabad Central Jail stands witness to the landmark. Rohan Anand, superintendent of the prison, said that a lamp and incense sticks are burnt in the morning and evening daily amid bhajans by the inmates. “The inmates also keep the yard clean which also houses a small museum of sorts – including copies of his prison order, his correspondence and a few pictures/ illustrations,” he said.

According to records, he celebrated his 53rd birthday here. In later years, luminaries ranging from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to Kakasaheb Kalelkar and from Mahadev Desai to Ravishankar Maharaj were lodged here,” he said.

He came back to Sabarmati Central Jail later for only a day on August 1, 1933 before he was sent to Yerawada jail in Pune.

With the government appointing merchant bankers for what is likely to be the largest government divestment and largest IPO, there is speculation on LIC’s valuation. Many have used the private sector listed companies or SBI Life as a proxy for embedded value (EV) and EV multiple at which LIC shares could be offered. According to Sathe, the corporation’s valuation would be influenced by the extent of contribution from single premium policies to its assets under management (AUM) that would determine valuation. According to numbers released by LIC, its asset base has crossed Rs 38 lakh crore which is more than 15 times the AUM of the top private life companies like HDFC Life or ICICI Prudential. “Taking into consideration the AUM, if we think its embedded value will be 15-20 times of private listed companies it will be wrong because the calculation of embedded value is based on the actuarial calculation, which takes into account present value of future benefits,” said Sathe while speaking at the Indian Insurance Institute Kolkata recently. “Since single premium policies have less EV (present value of future benefits) and it reduces profitability, private insurers are reluctant to do single premium policies,” he said. Besides being with the insurance regulator, Sathe has been executive director at LIC earlier. The distribution of surplus in the life fund among policyholders and shareholders is different for LIC compared to private players. While private companies are allowed to distribute 10% of their surplus to shareholders, LIC has been paying out only 5% to the government with the rest given to shareholders. “IRDAI regulations state that consequent to listing 10% of surplus can be given to shareholders. “But it is unlikely that LIC will suddenly bring down the surplus distribution to 90%,” said Sathe. He suggested that this could be brought down gradually as a prudent measure. Sathe said that to clear the way for an IPO the government has increased the paid-up capital in LIC from Rs 100 crore to Rs 25,000 crore and has allowed the board to be reconstituted where 50% of the directors will be independent with expertise in specific areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/pvt-cos-cant-be-used-as-benchmark-to-value-lic/articleshow/85959772.cms||---

The teachers were honoured by PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary on the occasion of Teachers’ Day at Wheeler Senate House of the university. Former PU VC Rash Bihari Prasad Singh was the chief guest. Teachers who were felicitated included former vice-chancellors Jagannath Thakur, Shambhu Nath Guha, Asheshwar Yadav and Sarfe Alam. Altogether 48 teachers received their mementos and citations in person. PU vice-chancellor Chaudhary said a university is known by its teachers and their academic activities, including research. “If the present generation of university teachers take active interest in research and get their work published in national and international journals of repute, there is no reason PU would not be awarded A+ grade by NAAC,” he added. Chief guest Singh also called upon the teachers to work whole-heartedly for ensuring all-round development of the university and restoring its old glory. He suggested the students to take inspiration from the life of President S Radhakrishnan and try to devote their time and energy in academic pursuits. PU pro-VC Ajay Kumar Singh welcomed the guests. A large number of university officials, heads of departments, principals of colleges and teachers attended the function and paid their floral tributes to the portrait of Radhaksihnan. PU political science department head Shefali Roy conducted the programme. PU registrar Kamesh Kumar proposed a vote of thanks. Meanwhile, addressing the teachers and students of Central University of South Bihar at a function held at the university auditorium on Sunday, vice-chancellor K N Singh said the primary duty of a teacher is to satisfy the academic thirst of students and help them achieve their goal in life. “Teachers must disseminate knowledge without any discrimination to students,” he said. Teachers’ Day was also celebrated with enthusiasm at different schools and colleges of the city. Students felicitated their teachers and sought their blessing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/149-retired-teachers-of-patna-university-honoured/articleshow/85955946.cms||B K Mishra

Education loan institutions are seeing a jump in outbound student enquiries. But banks are not seeing any such spike in their education loan book. According to HDFC Credila MD & CEO Arijit Sanyal, there is a 209% growth in overseas education loan applications in Q1FY22 over the first quarter of the previous year. “The growth is across geographies — the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries,” he said. Last month, the US embassy said that over 55,000 Indian students and exchange visitors are travelling to study in the US this year and it is “an all-time record”. In the UK, a record number of 3,200 students from India have been accepted into university and higher education courses through the country’s centralised application system in 2021, an increase of 19% over the previous year. A fall in lending rates has helped. Rates are down by 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) during FY21, and now start at 9.5% for applications to premier schools overseas. A senior SBI executive described the growth as emergence of pent-up demand. Also, the ticket size for an average overseas education loan has increased to Rs 35 lakh in FY21 as compared to Rs 30 lakh in previous year. Mayank Batheja, co-founder of fintech company Credenc, which has a book size of Rs 150 crore, said, “Demand has more than doubled in recent months. We see more traction from students who want to pursue higher education in the UK, Ireland, the EU and Singapore, as compared to the US. We also see a growing interest in Russia and the Czech Republic for the first time.” However, Germany, Australia and New Zealand have not officially communicated visa and travel guidelines for overseas students. Batheja said, “We are not very clear on how Germany will accept overseas students currently.” International education loan provider Prodigy Finance, which has a $1.5-billion education loan book, sees India as its fastest-growing market with a 60% increase in loans as of August this year. China, Brazil, Pakistan, Mexico and Peru are its other key markets. “There is a 10-15% increase in the average ticket size of loans from Rs 30 lakh, driven by a marginal increase in the tuition fee,” said Mayank Sharma, India head for Prodigy Finance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/surge-in-queries-for-overseas-study-loans/articleshow/85959859.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Rakesh Prasad, the guardian of the family said on Sunday that Anshu Kumar (11), son of Thag Prasad, died on August 26 while Ravindra Prasad (32) , son of Parshuram Prasad, and Ravindra’s son Priyanshu (10) passed away on September 1. Rakesh’s daughter and son, Munni Kumari (14) and Satyam (4), also died on September 3. The victims first complained of pain in stomach followed by froth in their mouth, before death. The district health officials are still clueless while the villagers are up in arms against the district administration. They blocked the Motihari-Madhubani Ghat road on Saturday. The doctors, who were part of the medical board to conduct autopsy, said there was mysterious reason behind all the deaths. The reason behind their deaths could be ascertained only from the forensic science lab report after sending the viscera for test as no cause was detected in the autopsy, they said. Motihari Sadar PHC in-charge medical officer Shrawan Paswan and district Indian Medical Association chief (IMA) member Dr Ashutosh Sharan said on Sunday that snakebite or some poisonous insect bite could be the reason as the victims complained of stomachache, respiratory failure and froth oozing out of their mouths. Parshuram said the local doctors initially treated them for snakebite, but could not save them. Locals, however, did not rule out black magic as four others in the family have also died this year itself under mysterious circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/death-of-5-in-a-family-within-10-days-shrouded-in-mystery/articleshow/85958752.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

This is being done to reach out to all residents living in highrise complexes in New Town to make loudspeaker announcements on different public schemes and services like Covid vaccination, Duare Sarkar and dengue prevention awareness as to when and where these schemes and services are being provided. NKDA officials said they have been making mike announcements on the roads but they were getting feedback that the announcements were not reaching many residents who live inside the large gated communities and highrise complexes. “To reach out to all residents living in highrise complexes, we are using special high tech drone technology. High volume speakers have been installed in the drones and a day-wise schedule has been chalked up as to on which day in which locality the drone will be operated to make the announcements,” an NKDA official said. Officials said they were making the announcements through drones in residential areas and market places mainly on four issues right now - Duare Sarkar, Lakshmir Bhandar, Covid vaccination and generating awareness on following Covid safety protocols and dengue prevention measures. The announcements are both in Bengali and Hindi. Other than making loudspeaker announcements on public awareness, the authorities said the drones could be used for spraying larvacide on the Bagjola and its periphery canals to prevent mosquitos, to keep a watch on roof tops to check if there was any stagnant water accumulation, keeping an eye on bio-mass and waste burning and other issues. The authorities have already set up a drone port in one of its utility buildings in New Town Action Area II with a drone pad above the tank on the fourth floor roof. The set-up has servers, ultra-high speed computers with dual screens and a host of other software and drone accessories. NKDA has already procured three drones and there is a control room to keep monitoring the drones while they are operated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-tech-drones-to-reach-out-to-new-town-residents/articleshow/85959231.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The woman lodged a complaint against one Md Kalim, on Saturday, accusing him of sexually assaulting her for over two months after holding her captive from Bhimpur police station area on June 30. The woman, in her complaint, said she was forced to convert her religion during illegal confinement, but somehow came to know about the place she was kept and informed the family members with the help of a neighbour. The woman’s relatives reached the Forbesganj railway station on Saturday with a group of activists and rescued her when Kalim was trying to shift her to another location. The woman, a mother of two, was allegedly kidnapped by Kalim and his accomplices in a car when she had gone to relieve herself in a nearby field around 7pm on June 30. According to the police complaint, the accused stuffed a piece of cloth in the woman’s mouth and also covered her eyes. “When I opened my eyes, I found myself in a solitary room,” she told the police. SHO of Bhimpur police station Subodh Kumar said the accused, who was taken into custody on Saturday, was subsequently produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. “The woman’s medical report is awaited,” he added. Meanwhile, the Chhatapur unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has demanded stern action against the culprits.

However, the Robusta variety of coffee has not been affected. Bose Mandanna, an experienced coffee grower and former vice-chairman of the Coffee Board in Sunticoppa, said that in different locations in the district, the quantity and timing of rain varied. Nakooru village near Sunticoppa received 40 inches of rain, which is less than the average of 50 inches, whereas Sunticoppa received 70 inches of rain, which is more than the average of 60 inches. The crops in Sunticoppa zone were in a better condition than the crops in Nakuru village. The Arabica coffee growing locations in the district were affected by the hot climate towards the end of June, and in July, though it rained in August. “Though we received rain before June the gap in rain, between the end of June and July, and erratic rain in different places, has created problems for growers. The rain in August is not beneficial, because it causes the coffee yield to drop. However, the robusta coffee crops are doing well this year,” Mandanna said. The average rain this year so far in Kodagu is 84 inches, which is 4 inches more than last year’s record. However, the rain varied in different places, between 40 inches to 200 inches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/erratic-rain-affects-arabica-coffee-pepper-crops-in-kodagu/articleshow/85957488.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Rahul Kumar (30) and Pradip Kumar (28), both residents of Kishunpur. The injured, Ajit Kumar (26), has been admitted to a private nursing home in the state capital. Agitated over the killings, the villagers blocked the Patna-Ara road and disrupted vehicular traffic. The protestors allowed the police to lift the bodies for postmortem only after Patna City SP (West) Ashok Mishra visited the spot at around 11am on Sunday and pacified the mob. Mishra said two suspects, including a woman, have been detained for interrogation. Raids were on to arrest the shooters involved in the crime. A posse of armed forces has been deployed at the village as a precautionary measure, he added. The incident took place at around 1am when the three were sleeping in a makeshift room on a plot of land purchased by Rahul from a co-resident Pramod Mahto recently. The assailants reached there and fired indiscriminately causing grievous injuries to the trio. While Rahul and Pradip died on the spot, Ajit received bullet injury in his head. The assailants escaped after committing the crime. An investigating officer said Rahul had purchased the land from Pramod Mahto a few years ago. Later, the wife of Pramod's brother, Manoj Mahto, demanded her share in the land, leading to a dispute with Rahul. Some locals blamed Sonu Kumar, stated to be the nephew of an MLA, for the crime as he (Sonu) had intervened on behalf of Manoj’s wife. Maner MLA Bhai Virendra had also tried to settle the dispute, but in vain. The police said the incident was meticulously planned. The CCTV camera of a nearby school was also damaged before the incident. Ramesh Singh, father of Rahul, said his son had started fencing the land, which was damaged by the rival group. “After that he decided to stay there at night, which proved fatal for him,” he added. Last month, six people were killed and three others were injured in a land dispute under Chhabilapur police station area in Nalanda district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-shot-over-land-dispute-near-bihta/articleshow/85958642.cms||Ramashankar

Then mask up and maintain safe distance in crowded areas as you will be under the watch from up above. In a bid to ensure that Covid-19 guidelines are followed strictly, the city police have decided to use drones during the Ganesh festivities.  While the cops have been using drones on the day of Ganesh immersions for the last few years, this is the first time that they will be operated for all the 10 days of the festival. “We have given permission to a limited number of Ganesh pandals and asked the organizers to follow Covid norms. But the police need to be on alert too. This year, we have decided to deploy drones, especially in the Walled City,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner.  “During the festival, people will be on the roads and it is not possible to keep an eye on every nook and corner in some areas. The drones will help us monitor the main roads as well as interior lanes. If we spot large crowds gathering at some spot, our team will immediately reach there and urge people to follow Covid norms,” Singh told TOI. Police have been given a high-resolution drone that can be put on auto mode too. This drone has a high-vision camera that can zoom in on faces and hover around for a long time. If a route is fed in its system, this drone moves around on its own and gives live feed of the happenings around. The police said that it also hires several other drones from the local firms. On the day of Ganesh immersion, many drones will be deployed in the old city, the police said.  “We have also formed several teams that will monitor the areas where Ganesh pandals have been installed. People should wear face masks when out in public places and follow Covid protocols,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/drones-to-monitor-ganesh-pandals/articleshow/85957861.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||Visiting Tagore’s VB, working with AR Rahman on wish list: Yohani||Kolkata: When her manager called Yohani up to say that Amitabh Bachchan had shared her song, ‘Manike Mage Hithe’, the singer couldn’t believe it. “I had thought he was pulling a prank on me and I went back to sleep. The next morning, I had many calls and messages from so many people congratulating me. It still feels unreal. I’m humbled by the recognition,” she said in an interview with TOI. A fan of Bachchan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh, Tiger Shroff, Deepika Padukone and Jacqueline Fernandez, Yohani also listens to a lot of music from India. Recently, she has watched the Indian covers of her song, including Anirban Sur’s Bangla folk mash-up. “It feels very new to me. I haven’t had an experience like this before. I am happy to see the cover versions,” she said. Thanking all her Indian admirers, she said, “I can’t wait to perform live for you. I want to make friends and do collaborations with many of you. I also look forward to learning more about the culture and possibly speaking your language too. I love you all.” It is difficult for her to explain how the song broke the language divide to reach so many so fast. “I never think of a strategy or format when doing a song. I purely do it because I like it. When I first heard this song, I liked it,” she said. Yohani said the song’s composer Chamath Sangeeth was a “long-time” friend and they have worked on multiple projects together. During lockdown, Yohani had made a TikTok version of this song. “Chamath called me and said why don’t we do your version of this? I went to the studio and he had invited the video crew too. It was a fun project. We never imagined this would reach this far. Special thanks to Satheeshan, who sings the rap in this version and had also sung the original, lyricist Dulan ARX, who did the original rap, and Pettah Effect and Theewra Teams, who have been behind me from the beginning,” she said. However, her road to success has been challenging. Her father is a retired major general of Sri Lanka. According to her, the early days of growing up were “tough”. “We moved a lot because of the civil war that prevailed in the country. Even though the life was not luxurious, it was privileged,” she said. Both her sister and she had freedom to do whatever they wanted as kids. “My parents pushed us to do new things. They don’t have any music background, but we were drawn to music from a young age. I first got piano lessons and then learned the guitar via youtube. I did a song about my childhood as a tribute to my father titled ‘Rawwath Dasin’. It encompasses my experience as an army kid,” she said. Yohani also plays the ukulele, trumpet and French horn. She holds a bachelor’s degree in logistics and supply chain management and has a first-class master’s degree in professional accounting from Australia. “I didn’t realize how important my passion for music was while I was studying. But once I completed my masters in Australia, I decided to switch from pursuing a corporate life to doing something I love,” Yohani said. Currently, she is recording her upcoming album which has 12 Sri Lankan numbers. There are plans of including a Hindi number too. “I can’t wait to show it to all the new fans. I never did music looking for fame. Even in my debut song, I say ‘No amount of fame will change who I am’. I don’t want it to. I also have a great team behind me who are helping me with everything,” she added. She is hoping to come to India soon. “Our national anthem was written by Ananda Samarakoon. He had come to Visva-Bharati. I have studied Rabindranath Tagore’s work in school but not extensively. I love travelling. So, I’d visit as soon as I get a chance,” she said, adding, “I love doing new things. If I ever get to work with A R Rahman, it would be a dream come true. I’m a big fan of all of his works.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/visiting-tagores-vb-working-with-ar-rahman-on-wish-list-yohani/articleshow/85959878.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Watch-&-report task for New Town walkers||KOLKATA: A section of New Town morning walkers on Sunday was inducted as volunteers and tasked with keeping a watch on the township’s stretches in small groups during the day and call coordinating officers for action the moment they notice something suspicious. Bidhannagar police rolled out the dos and don’ts to the Resistance Group members in New Town who volunteered to help cops in crime prevention and reporting. Though cops thanked them for the initiative, they repeatedly cautioned the volunteers not to intervene during any untoward incident and limit their duty to surveillance and reporting of the crime. “Detection and investigation of crime is our job. We are asking the volunteers to only continue their morning walk sessions every day but in the areas we ask them to and walk in groups. Whenever they see something suspicious, they need to take a photograph of the incident and share the location with the cops on duty. They need not intervene by themselves at any cost,” said New Town DCP Bishop Sarkar at the meeting held near Biswa Bangla gate in presence of 200-odd residents and volunteers at 7am. According to the plan, the volunteers will be divided into three large sections for three different action areas in New Town. Volunteers in each section will be further divided into smaller groups of five or six persons who will walk, exercise or cycle together during the morning vigil. “Volunteers should always move in groups. Moving alone can make them soft targets. The idea is to increase presence and deter criminals from committing offence,” said Sarkar. New Town Kolkata Development Authority chairperson Debasis Sen, who attended the meeting, spoke of the unique problems with New Town that need special solutions. “New Town is a new township with new problems which require new solutions. All of us need to come together to make this a safer place to live in,” said Sen. He added that NKDA will install more CCTV cameras and ensure better illumination of the streets. He had also brought drones and made a presentation about how they can be used to make announcements in case of emergencies. Cops said large uninhabited portions of New Town — many of them still under construction — attract a number of outsiders, which poses a threat to the security at times. The multiple escape routes from New Town also makes the township an easy target for criminals. “The pandemic has made the situation worse with many people resorting to crime to make ends meet. There have been at least two instances where the arrested snatchers have turned out to be carpool drivers operating in Sector V who are now out of jobs,” said Sarkar, who also launched a WhatsApp number — 7478746864 — where residents can text the DCP with photos, locations and brief mention of the problems that need police intervention. Residents and volunteers attending the meeting were enthusiastic about their new responsibilities. “A journey of a thousand miles started today. The Resistance Group was formally launched and all our volunteers are excited to be part of the same and will do our level best to safeguard society along with the cops,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News, the residents’ body that had organized the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/watch-report-task-for-new-town-walkers/articleshow/85959822.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The private bank currently holds just below 52% in the non-life company. The approval to reduce promoter stake was conveyed to the bank, while approving the scheme of demerger of the general insurance business of Bharti Axa, which was acquired by ICICI Lombard last year through a scheme of arrangement. The scheme will result in the merger of Bharati Axa General Insurance with ICICI Lombard. Last year, ICICI Lombard had signed a deal to purchase Bharti Axa, as part of which Bharti Axa shareholders will receive two shares of ICICI Lombard for every 115 shares held by them. Last month, a senior finance ministry official said that the Indian insurance industry is moving from being a promoter-led to a market-led one with the capital markets becoming a dominant source of capital for the companies. The RBI too has been asking lenders to bring down their stake in insurance companies below 50%. In May 2021, HDFC sold overe 44 lakh shares in HDFC Ergo to bring down its stake below 50% and comply with RBI norms. Approving the reduction in stake, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) said that the private insurer must ensure that its solvency margin ratio should remain above control level at all times. Also ICICI Bank is required to infuse capital to meet business growth or solvency in proportion to shareholding after merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/icici-bank-gets-irdai-nod-to-cut-stake-in-non-life-arm-to-30/articleshow/85959729.cms||---
---||Kolkata||South Kolkata club takes to 22 yards to strengthen ties with Afghan traders in city||KOLKATA: Twelve Afghan youths met their opponents across 22 yards at Dhakuria on Sunday morning. The hosts were amateur cricketers of Dhakuria Tarun Dal, a club that is into social welfare activities. The idea was to start a bond over a match and sow seeds of hope for a better tomorrow. The game ended with winning hosts tying rakhis on the wrists of their guests. The Afghan team comprised traders who meet at Maidan every weekend to play cricket. Some members of the club, who are regulars at Maidan, had been noticing them, so, when trouble started in Afghanistan, the idea of a cricket match struck them as a way to celebrate Indo-Afghan friendship. “Most have left their families behind and are worried. We wanted to stand by them. Let political decisions sort themselves out. We, as common people, should stand by these innocent people from the strife-torn land,” said club spokesperson Srikumar Ghosh. On Sunday, the flags of the two countries were hoisted and national anthems were sung before the match started. Afghanistan was led by Rashid Khan while the local side was captained by Rahul Nath. Afghanistan lost all wickets in the eighth over and managed to score 69, while the hosts met the target in six overs and four balls with a loss of just one wicket. Batsman Amir Khan was the highest scorer with 33 runs while Rahul Nath scored 22, the highest contribution on the Indian side. “However, we broke tradition and declared Amir Khan the man of the match, though the Afghan side lost. The idea was to forge a union and competition took a back seat,” Ghosh said. The club had tied up with All India Pakhtoon Jigra-e-Hind, led by Yasmin Nigar Khan, the great grand-daughter of Frontier Gandhi, to get the Afghans to agree to play the match. “They are worried about the safety of their families and were in no mood to lighten up. However, they finally agreed. The match and the love the local people showed the team have overwhelmed them,” Yasmin said. “For generations, Kolkata has been our second home. We are grateful to the club for this respite. We hope this will send out the right message,” said Rashid Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/south-kolkata-club-takes-to-22-yards-to-strengthen-ties-with-afghan-traders-in-city/articleshow/85959905.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The new recruitment process is aligned with its vision for the permanent campus, to move towards specialisations in management programmes, and to offer sector-specific training programmes. IIM-V director, Prof Chandrasekhar, said the institute currently has 32 faculty on rolls with a best student-faculty ratio among the seven new-age IIMs. “The institute is getting several enquiries for the training programmes from reputed public sector banks, PSUs and other organisations. To meet the demand, the institute has started the faculty recruitment process in specialisations in management areas like applied econometrics, micro-economics, fintech, product and brand management, investment banking, inventory management, etc. Considering the agrarian economy of Andhra Pradesh, agriculture and water resources will also be a focus area in recruitment,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. Meanwhile, the permanent campus of the business school is fast shaping up in Gambheeram and is expected to be ready by the next academic year. Prof Chandrasekhar said the hostels at the permanent campus can accommodate 300 students per batch. “This will give a scope for the institute to increase its annual intake. New management disciplines are evolving with the changing business environment and technology-enabled innovations. IIM-V also wants to diversify its offerings—both in terms of academic programmes and training programmes,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. The IIM-V director added that the institute may hire about eight to 10 new faculty in emerging areas in this recruitment. “IIM-V also wants to harness expertise in areas like health and nutrition, considering the recent experiences with the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-initiates-fresh-faculty-recruitment/articleshow/85956951.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The associations alleged that the state government is trying to create obstructions only for Hindu festivals. The state government has prohibited Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in public places following warnings from the health department about a possible outbreak of the third wave of Covid-19. The Hindu Yuva Shakti (HYS) has appealed to the government to revise its decision and permit celebrations with restrictions. “YSR’s death anniversary was celebrated with huge gatherings, government schemes are launched with huge crowds, Muharram is celebrated in public. No restrictions were imposed for the above events and festivals. Why does this government only prohibit Ganesh Chaturthi even though the Covid-19 situation is under control across the state. The government should impose restrictions and permit pandals with nominal crowds,” said Chikkala Rajanikanth, state president of HYS. BJP state president Somu Verraju has demanded the government permit Ganesh pandals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-urged-to-withdraw-curbs-on-ganesh-festival/articleshow/85957060.cms||Venu Lanka

Mankar had befriended a doctor from Delhi by creating fake social media profile of a girl Anayasingh Oberai of being an entrepreneur. During the frequent interactions on social media, Anayasingh offered to accompany the doctor to foreign countries. The investigation officer and Yavatmal SDPO Madhuri Baviskar told TOI that Mankar has studied up to Std XII and was living in a rented room in Arunodaya Society after his father’s demise. “The police are trying to find out whether anyone else was invloved in the crime,” said Baviskar.

---||Mumbai||With surge, Mumbai back in Maharashtra’s top 5 on active Covid cases||MUMBAI: With a surge in Covid-19 detections in the last few days, the city is back among the top five districts in the state on the parameter of active cases. Covid cases in Mumbai had stabilised between 200 and 300 in the first three weeks of August, making the city slip to the seventh rank. Now, the weekly positivity rate of the state too has reported a rise: 2.71% as of the week ending on September 4 against 2.58% during the last week of August. “There has been a slight increase in active cases in the state in the last 10 days,” said additional chief secretary of the health department, Dr Pradeep Vyas, in a presentation at Majha Doctor — a virtual medical conference on Covid-19 management in the state. Data presented in the meeting shows that the top five districts account for nearly 72% of the state’s total active cases. Pune accounts for nearly 30% of the load, followed by Thane (14%), Satara (12%), Ahmednagar (10%), and Mumbai (8%). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who addressed the conference, once again appealed to the public as well as political parties to avoid crowding or any activity that puts lives at risk. “We have augmented the health infrastructure but there is a limitation to oxygen production and its availability,” said Thackeray. “Even today, we are using 150 metric tons daily for non-Covid patients and 200 metric tons for Covid patients,” he said. He criticised the opposition which has been holding agitations seeking a reopening of places of worship. “There are a few people who want us to reopen everything… temples. But, we don't want to be in a situation where everything has to be shut down once again. Let us keep in mind that we don’t put the lives of the public in our politics,” the CM said. Eight districts in the state have reported a higher weekly positivity rate than the state's average. These are Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Osmanabad, and Nashik. “These are districts of concern. Also, the Ganpati festival is celebrated in a big way in these districts and so we need to be on our guard,” said Vyas. He said there was a drop in testing in some districts. “Testing needs to be increased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-surge-mumbai-back-in-states-top-5-on-active-cases/articleshow/85962939.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Bad weather, landslides spell doom for hotels||NAINITAL: Owners of several hotels, homestays and trekking agencies in Uttarakhand, who were already reeling under heavy economic losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, say that bad weather conditions, frequent landslides and panic among people due to such occurrences over the last few weeks, have dealt a body blow to the tourism sector in Uttarakhand, leading to many tourism ventures being on the verge of closure. Speaking to TOI, Pramod Kumar, a hotel owner in Mukteshwar near Nainital, said that tourist numbers in hill stations were “very good till the first week of August but since then, numerous landslides in and around Nainital have scared away people.” “We have only seen cancellations since the past few weeks. The situation was expected to improve this week but now, schools in Delhi-NCR have opened up and not many families are willing to travel,” Kumar said. Munesh Bhatt, owner of a homestay in Joshimath in the Garhwal hills, who organises treks to the Valley of Flowers and other spots, alleged that for several weeks now, he has not received a single query from tourists. “Monsoons are anyway lean season for us but people do come to visit the Valley of Flowers in August since it is the blooming period for most of the flowers. However, visuals of landslides on Char Dham Yatra routes have scared tourists and even we tell them not to travel if there is forecast of rain,” he added. Similar concerns were echoed by those in the tourism industry in places like Munsyari, Uttarkashi, Kausani, Khirsu and Lansdowne. In Musnsyari’s Sarmoli village, Beena Devi, who runs a homestay, said that after the Covid months of April to July, they were finally hoping to get some tourists but the road to Munsyari collapsed a few days ago and the area was cut off. “No one wants to travel in these conditions. The road is prone to landslides and tourists are scared,” she said. Amongst the gloom though, a glimmer of hope lingers. “We are hoping that bookings will pick up in September and are praying that Covid cases do not escalate. Many of us have invested lakhs of rupees in our ventures and if there are any more bottlenecks, we will have no other option but to close down,” said Naveen Rana, a hotelier from Lansdowne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-covid-bad-weather-landslides-spell-doom-for-hotels-homestays-in-hills/articleshow/85956916.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||Natpac survey to start next week||Kochi: A survey as part of the feasibility study about extending the service of mofussil buses from Vypeen side to Kochi city, will start next week by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac). The survey is aimed at collecting the opinion of passengers and motorists from the island, their origin and destination, bus operators in Vypeen and the city, and the police. It will also check whether the mofussil buses from the island side can be parked in some of the existing bus stands in the city. The survey will look into the most common destination of islanders to know where to extend the services “We will conduct an OD (origin and destination) survey among passengers from Vypeen side. Two-wheeler and car passengers will also be included in the survey as they constitute majority of the vehicle traffic on Goshree bridges. They do not prefer buses as they have to get down at High Court Junction and board another bus to reach destination. If the buses ply up to Metro station, they would have utilized Metro services,” said S Shaheem, principal scientist conducting the study. If the buses are plying on long distance on the Vypeen route, the services of these will be extended to Vyttila. Otherwise, it will be till Kaloor. While some private operators from Vypeen voiced reservations, others are in favour of extending the service. The study team will have to look into whether the extension of service will create any traffic congestion as claimed by the operators of city buses and police. The major problem hindering the extension of service to the city is that two roads — Shanmugham Road and Banerjee Road — are currently nationalized routes, where service of mofussil buses are not allowed and there are limitations on number of city services too. Mofussil bus services also cannot convert into city service. Natpac will look into the legal aspect of all the challenges arising. Natpac is also collecting data on the number of mofussil buses operating to High Court Junction via Vypeen from North Paravoor and other areas. The extension of service of mofussil buses to the city is a long-standing demand of islanders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/natpac-survey-to-start-next-week/articleshow/85959211.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie: Kempty Falls reopened day after heavy rains force evacuation of tourists, shopkeepers||MUSSOORIE: Heavy rains on Saturday caused an increase in the flow of water at Kempty Falls, prompting police to evacuate nearly 200 tourists and 20 shopkeepers from near the waterfall. The waterfall, a popular tourist destination, reopened on Sunday after remaining off-limits for visitors on Saturday. Mussoorie and adjoining areas were lashed by very heavy rains on Saturday morning, resulting in the sudden increase in the flow of water at the waterfall, which sees heavy visitor footfall. "The flow of water increased suddenly in the afternoon on Saturday. Fearing for the safety of tourists and shopkeepers, nearly 50 tourists, who were near the waterfall and around 20 shopkeepers of the area were relocated while about 150 tourists waiting nearby were also shifted,” said Naveen Jural, station officer of Kempty. The further entry of tourists was prohibited on Saturday and police personnel were deployed in the area, Jural said, adding that on Sunday, the waterfall was opened for tourists since the water level had gone down. To recall, after heavy rains on July 12, the entry of tourists at the waterfall was prohibited for several days while on August 29, a tourist from UP had slipped and drowned in the waterfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kempty-falls-reopened-day-after-heavy-rains-force-evacuation-of-tourists-shopkeepers/articleshow/85956956.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan guard rails||Dwaipayan.Ghosh Kolkata: Lalbazar has ruled out removing guard rails across the city, whether in the morning or at night, calling it a necessary tool and ruling out complaints that these were a hindrance for motorists and bikers, especially at night, when most of them do not even have blinkers that makes it visible from a distance. In reply to an online query on the actual usage of guard rails, Lalbazar stated that "placement of guard rails is a professional decision taken case to case by each traffic guard factoring in demands and requirements of both pedestrians and motorists. Inputs are appreciated and worked on without having a prejudiced notion about the utility of any such placement, the cops claimed." The reply was shared on the Kolkata traffic Police Twitter page. The reply was in response to a tweet on this page by motorist Sujoy Deb Burman who questioned the "unplanned and illogical placement of guardrails along major arterial thoroughfares of the city." Lalbazar said that on roads - where there are narrow link roads opening on to bigger ones like APC Road, AJC Bose road, SP Mukherjee road or the Kasba Connector, these guard rails help to control speed right before the crossing at night. Guardrails that are placed for night checks are usually removed by the morning. Senior police officers at Lalbazar said that at some places, especially near busy intersections, they were not removed in the morning because they also served the purpose of streamlining vehicle movement. "We had some issues about removing them by morning. The civic volunteers and home guards have been assigned beats to complete the work as quickly as possible," claimed an officer at Lalbazar. Lalbazar has also instructed all guards to ensure that all guard rails that are used on the main roads of the city have compulsory reflectors on them. Sources said that all officers on rounds during night patrolling have been asked to check on the same and submit compliance reports. Police said that it will be the prerogative of the 25 guards to replace the yellow tape on the guard rails if they are worn out or are not visible from a distance. "The idea is to finally replace them with solar blinkers. 95 percent of guardrails on main roads have retro-fitted reflectors. those on the Bypass and its connectors - and the Basanti highway where visibility is an issue - are already getting solar blinkers," said an officer. However, most motorists cite the example of a biker who knocked down a pedestrian and then fell off the vehicle after failing to negotiate through the space between a guardrail and a bus on the Prince Anwar Shah Road-EM Bypass connector last July to point to the futility of the exercise. They also cite another example recently on AJC Bose Road where a bike rider Simanta Ghosh had to spend several days at hospital to question the very need of the guard rail. "It is a sheer nuisance on roads. If you use guard rails, have flashers, proper reflectors. And it does not slow down bikers or those who want to speed, they take the extreme left or right lane and speed right through crossings. It is always safer to drive in the middle lane because if someone suddenly enters from left or right, you have reaction time whereas when one is on the extreme lane, that one is forced to due to the placement of guardrails in the middle at night, there is zero reaction time when someone from a lane on a bike or cycle or even a car flouts a signal and comes right in front,' complained one of them adding the guard rail cannot replace a signal. "What is a signal for if one needs a guardrail?" asked another motorist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-guard-rails/articleshow/85959331.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Music, food & fun: Kashi-Chunar cruiseride on Ganga off to a flying start||Varanasi: The chants of Har Har Mahadev (Hail Lord Shiva) reverberated in the air on Sunday as the luxury vessel, Alaknanda cruise, started its maiden ride from Ravidas Ghat in Varanasi to Chunar Fort in Mirzapur, and back. Excited passengers climbed atop the upper decks where they clicked selfies and made videos to make the moment memorable. A live band kept passengers entertained all through the ride. Some of them even got up to dance too. At least 200 passengers took the first ride. The service, initiated by UP tourism department to promote waterways tourism in the state, provides an eight-hour two-way ride on the Ganga from Varanasi to Chunar Fort. The 55 meter-long, twin engine vessel cruise was flagged off by Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal in the presence of Vivek Malaviya, Vikas Malaviya, Jayant Malaviya and Manish Poddar, the directors of Alaknanda Cruiseline, the startup managing the cruise. Congratulating the team, Agarwal said, “This is a novel venture and we are sure that tourists will find the service attractive. A lot of hard work has gone into the initiative and we hope it will give a boost to tourism in the state.” Alaknanda Cruiseline has been running cruise services on the Ganga in Varanasi for the last two years. Vikas Malaviya, one of the directors, said: “We have been getting a good response which encouraged us to manage this tour too. We are grateful to the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath for reposing faith in our capabilities and entrusting us this huge responsibility.” During the ride, the passengers were served vegetarian breakfast, lunch, tea and heavy snacks. After two hours of sailing, the cruise made a brief halt at Shool Tankeshwar Temple, situated 15km from Varanasi. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and folklore suggests that this is the spot where the Ganga entered the holy city (Uttarayani) on the command of Lord Shiva. People believe that the temple is located at the spot where Lord Shiva had put his trishul (trident). In Chunar, divisional commissioner of Mirzapur, Yogeshwar Ram Mishra, also came onboard for some time. Impressed with the vessel and the facilities, he said that he would take the ride soon. Lata Khatri, an octogenarian, who travelled all the way from Delhi to take the maiden ride, said: “I came to know about this cruise from my family and I didn’t want to miss it. I belong to Varanasi and a thing like an air-conditioned cruise in the city is nothing short of a marvel to me.” RP Chaturvedi, a Varanasi-based doctor, said: “I have seen cruise service abroad, and in Goa, but such a facility in Varanasi instils a feeling of pride. I had expected a boat but this vessel is huge and will be a new experience for the people of Varanasi.” “We read about it in the newspapers and had planned to make a booking in July itself when it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Although we had thought it would be a temple hopping ride, we went to just one temple. Overall, it has been a fun ride,” said Rakhi, who was part of a group on the cruise which danced to the songs presented by the music band.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/music-food-fun-kashi-chunar-cruiseride-on-ganga-off-to-a-flying-start/articleshow/85961495.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Spatial planning for 27 gram panchayats with census towns||Thiruvananthapuram: Spatial plans will be formulated soon for census towns included partially or fully within 27 grama panchayats in the district. In total, the chief town planner has submitted the list of 323 grama panchayats across the state within which census towns have been included as urban areas for spatial plan formulation. Master plans, zoning regulations and town planning have till now been done for the city corporation and four urban local bodies in the district. The draft master plan of the city corporation for 2040 is awaiting discussion in the corporation council. As per the recent amendment of the Town and Country Planning Act, census towns within grama panchayats which show urban characteristics have been identified for spatial planning. The act also incorporated the scope for spatial planning. The local self-government department (LSGD) recently issued an order for mapping of census towns which states there is a need to prioritise gram panchayats which can be considered for thematic sectoral plans which have been proposed within the ambit of the ‘rebuild Kerala’ initiative. Spatial plans are being promoted as a strong tool for dealing with climate change, better preparatory mechanisms for disaster management and thereby reducing the impact on people affected by calamities, the order said. Officials said the Town and Country Planning Act gives the provision for preparing plans for gram panchayats, however, it has not been implemented yet. “At present grama panchayats with census towns showing urban nature have been mapped. Spatial plans will be prepared in a phased manner and priority will be fixed based on density of population in each panchayat,” said a senior town planning official associated with the project. According to the government order issued in this regard, the grama panchayats have been identified as census towns since these local bodies are likely to be population hubs on their own and showing characteristics of urban activity. This means that such panchayats have to be considered as urban areas for spatial plan formulation. The government recently authorised the chief town planner to map the census towns to such panchayats which fall wholly or partly within them. The census towns satisfy a threefold urban criteria relating to population, density and main working force engaged in non-agricultural activities. These include a minimum population of 5,000; at least 75 per cent of the male main working population engaged in non- agricultural pursuits and a density of population of at least 400 persons per sq. km. As per the 2011 census, six districts have urban population above 50%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/spatial-planning-for-27-gram-panchayats-with-census-towns/articleshow/85959263.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Random lights signal chaos for traffic||AHMEDABAD: On a busy Monday morning, while you are calibrated to run on the rush hour mode, it appears that the traffic lights are against you. The light at junction after junction flashes red. Your plight, shared by all Amdavadi commuters, is not karma but the result of the lack of calibration of traffic lights. Cycle length is the time in seconds that it takes a signal to complete one full sweep of indications for all sides. DCP traffic Tejas Patel admitted that the calibration of cycle lengths of various junctions in the city are yet to be done and that an analysis is underway. While police are on the job, an insightful study by three researchers studied five junctions on the 2.5km Nehrunagar Crossroads to Vijay Crossroads stretch. That is one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city. The study found that the green-time and the red-time either differed between junctions, or differed within the same junction. The study was carried out by Maryam Kaveshgar, Nishant Patel, and Parishi Naik of the School of Engineering and Applied Science of Ahmedabad University in collaboration with the city traffic police. The study found that if Nehrunagar Crossroads had green-time of 50 seconds and red-time of 159 seconds for each of the four directions, the cycle lengths differed greatly when one reached Sahjanand Crossroads. The green-time at Sahjanand Crossroads hovers between 20-25 seconds and 40 seconds for various directions, while the red-time ranges between 74 seconds and 89-94 seconds. By the time one reaches Vijay Crossroads, the red-time goes as high as 122 seconds while the green-time varies between 15 seconds and 42 seconds. The researchers spent hours measuring traffic flow at the junctions and even applied mathematical models such as the Webster’s algorithm and drew a time-space diagram based on the Kell method. The study found that the speed of vehicles past these junctions can significantly improve if each traffic cycle operates for 45 seconds. The average speed of vehicles increases from a little above 15 kmph to above 25 kmph. If one follows the Indian Road Congress Guidelines of traffic cycle lengths of 80 seconds and 90 seconds, one can see a 5 kmph speed increase in vehicles above the existing 12 kmph. While elaborating on their study, the researchers said that optimizing the traffic cycle length will “improve various traffic parameters such as queue length, travel time, delay, fuel consumption, occupancy rate, and pollution.” The researchers said: “We believe that this study is an important step towards the enhancement and increase in efficiency on busy central roads, which will help improve traffic conditions and therefore reduce economic wastage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/random-lights-signal-chaos-for-traffic/articleshow/85959268.cms||Paul John
---||Dehradun||Gang hacks banks' ATMs, withdraws lakhs||Dehradun: A gang of cybercriminals swindled a public sector bank of lakhs by cheating it twice — by withdrawing cash from its ATMs using cloned debit cards and then claiming a “reversal” of money — with 300 fake “failed” transactions in 10 days at Rishikesh. On February 28 this year, the bank started receiving more “failed transaction” complaints than usual. RBI guidelines state that banks have to re-credit a customer’s account within five days of a failed transaction. So, the complaints were processed fast but the bank started its own investigation. “On the basis of what they found, they filed a complaint and we lodged an FIR … We are now investigating how much money was fraudulently withdrawn this way,” Rishikesh SHO Shishupal Negi told TOI. What is believed to be a group of cybercriminals started out by cloning debit cards they could use to withdraw money. “The ATMs used by the frauds were all made by the same Japanese company. It is possible that they knew how to tamper with these specific machines,” a cop said. The members would then approach the bank’s complaint management system, claiming that the ATM never dispensed cash. They would get the money “back”. But they did leave behind some traces. The bank officials, while investigating, found evidence in the electronic journal. An electronic journal is the ATM’s own record, telling the bank what it did. Banks reconcile these records regularly, because of which they can reverse failed transactions even when there is no complaint. In this case, the bank found irregularities in the log. The fact that over 300 complaints had come in from just one town also made them suspicious. Then, they went over CCTV footage of ATMs to check if money had not been dispensed, as had been claimed by the frauds. After nearly six months of investigation, with digital evidence of the fraud, they filed a complaint, cops said. Bank officials declined to comment on the case. Negi said, “Similar cases are being reported from Ranipokhri, Muni Ki Reti and Laxman Jhula.” Police are trying to identify the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gang-hacks-banks-atms-withdraws-lakhs/articleshow/85956988.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The state reported 4,057 cases and 67 deaths, taking the total case tally to 64.86 lakh and toll to 1,37,774. Mumbai reported 495 cases on Sunday, the highest since July 15 (528) and two deaths. With this, total cases in the city rose to 7.46 lakh and deaths to 15,993. Active cases in the state dropped to 50,095 from over 52,000 on Saturday, while Mumbai's active cases rose to 4,003 from 3,561 a day ago.  Among existing Covid patients, 52% are in home isolation or in Covid care centres as they have little to no symptoms; 48% patients are in hospitals of which 16.7% are on oxygen support and nearly 7% in ICU. State officials as well as members of the state task force have said that testing numbers must be increased. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday that it is in people’s hand to invite a third wave or prevent it. He said that although cases have dropped in the state, we cannot let our guard down. “We cannot let the pandemic become endemic. We have to completely defeat it, "said Thackeray. He claimed that perhaps Maharashtra is the only state which has upgraded its health infrastructure to tackle the pandemic “like no other country has done”. Health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state has the capacity to perform 3 lakh tests a day and more than 2.5 lakh tests have been done on several days. “However, testing has started to drop from the end of August, partly because fewer cases are being detected and hence there are fewer contacts to be tested,” he said. Officials said that with cases rising in districts where the Ganpati festival is celebrated in a big way, it is required that district administrations do not let their guard down. “We have empowered the district administration to undertake local restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-495-mumbai-city-new-covid-cases-rise-to-52-day-high/articleshow/85962960.cms||Bhavika Jain

Rahul Singh, 33, was the centre head of Adroit Synergies Private Limited in Noida. Bhanu Murti, also 33, was a manager there. They, along with seven others, were on a weekend trip to Rishikesh. “The group reached Rishikesh on Sunday morning and checked into a hotel at Tapovan. They were walking towards the main city when the accident occurred near Ram Jhula,” said inspector Kamal Mohan Singh Bhandari, in charge of the Muni Ki Reti police station. “Rahul entered the river to wash his hands. He lost his balance, slipped and fell into the river. As he was washed away, Bhanu jumped in to rescue him. He, too, was swept away by the strong current,” Sunil Kumar, their colleague who was also on the trip with them, told TOI. “Neither knew how to swim.” Rahul was from Bulandshahr and had been living in Noida with his wife and two children. Bhanu was from Delhi. The group members reached the police station and reported the case. A team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) was dispatched with motor rafts to look for the missing people. “The search operation was on till Sunday evening,” an SDRF official said. “The water level of the Ganga has been near the danger mark with strong currents because of the rainy season, making it very dangerous for anyone to venture into the water.” Last month, three students from Mumbai had drowned while bathing in the Ganga at Haridwar — one of them waded deep into the water and slipped, the two others swam towards her to help her and all of them died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/noida-bpo-centre-head-washed-away-by-ganga-manager-dies-trying-to-rescue/articleshow/85957020.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Lucknow||Now, plan 2nd Metro corridor for Lucknow: Union minister Durga Shankar Mishra||LUCKNOW: On the fourth anniversary of the operations of Lucknow Metro, secretary, Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, Durga Shankar Mishra, urged the state government to consider construction of second Metro corridor in the city to improve mobility. “We should focus on multi-modal integration of transportation along with last-mile connectivity to make metro service more comfortable and convenient for people. Ease of living is the only objective of all the plans and policies of the central government,” said Mishra, who is also the chairman of the UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC). “While serving people, our prime focus should be on making Metro the preferred mode of travel. Kanpur Metro will help in decongestion and bring down pollution level which will bring back the glory of the industrial city. To improve mobility in Lucknow, which is evolving rapidly, I have urged the state government to consider construction of the second (east-west) corridor in the city.” The detailed project report of the second corridor was prepared by Rail India Technical and Economic Service Limited (RITES) around 2011 but it never saw the light of the day. The east-west corridor is expected to have 11 stations connecting Vasant Kunj to Charbagh via heavily congested Old Lucknow areas. UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said, “We have urged the central government for a better financial model for the Metro project along with better terms and conditions.” “Lucknow Metro has achieved a new benchmark in punctuality, safety, comfort and passenger service. The DPR of Gorakhpur Metrolite has already been approved by the state government and has been sent to public investment board (PIB) for approval. Many other cities, like Varanasi, will soon benefit from Metro,” he added. By next year, Kanpur Metro priority corridor is expected to start commercial operations, while construction work of Agra Metro is underway. Since the first day (September 5, 2017) of commercial operations on the priority corridor, the Lucknow Metro has ferried 3.35 crore commuters in over 1,200 days of operation covering 62 lakh km distance. The operation on the entire 23km long north-south corridor – Munshipullia to Amausi airport (22 stations) started from March 8, 2019. Development of the entire project cost the exchequer nearly 200 million euros (Rs 6,900 crore) which was taken as loan from EIB (European Investment Bank).

The success of the campaigns led to a first of its kind arrangement in which Meghe Group of Hospitals signed an MoU with a fundraising platform, Ketto.org, to initiate crowdfunding for its needy patients. The four hospitals — Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital and Shalinitai Super Speciality Centre, both at Wardha, and Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre and Nelson Hospital in Nagpur, will now have a kiosk manned by Ketto.org representatives for initiating medical crowdfunding. The group chief executive officer, Dr Sandeep Shrivastava, said that emergency cases won’t be delayed and patients would receive complete treatment even as the crowdfunding campaign goes on. He said that several critical procedures, including organ transplantation or neuro surgeries, are not covered or have limitation under government schemes. “In such a situation, patients struggle to arrange funds and some are forced to move out to government hospitals,” he said. A month-old baby with brain enlargement got the help of Rs5.74 lakh while Rs2.74lakh have so far been raised for a two-month-old baby. “Both the patients were helped by another crowdfunding agency, Milaap, though we don’t have any tie up with them. Now, we will start with Ketto,” said Dr Shrivastava. Dr Shrivastava said that last year informal crowdfunding had helped raise Rs14lakh for a 17-year-old boy. The boy had complete paralysis and his family couldn’t afford the costly treatment. A press release issued by the group said that the company is closely working with hospitals, NGOs and individuals to bring positive change in the community. Currently, Ketto campaigns are raising over Rs300 crore per year for various causes, it read. “With about 80% of the population without any form of health insurance and 63% out-of-pocket medical expenses, most families spend all their savings and borrow money at high interest rates to cover the medical expenses. Medical crowdfunding is an alternative option for those who urgently need money. Crowdfunding platform Ketto has launched more than one million fundraisers for medical campaigns since its inception, raising more than $600 million,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-ink-pact-with-crowdfunding-platform-to-help-needy-patients/articleshow/85961222.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Ruckus at VSSC after nokkukooli demand||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Dramatic scenes were witnessed outside Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre’s (VSSC) gate at South Thumba when a section of trade union members and local residents blocked the movement of trailer transporting massive cargo to the VSSC demanding ‘nokkukooli’, following which the movement of the vehicle was delayed for more than two hours. The consultant of the logistics firm that was transporting the cargo took a stance refusing the demand for nokkukooli. According to police, the trailer was blocked by the members of an unaccredited trade union that functioned at the South Thumba gate of VSSC around 11 am. When the officials refused to pay the nokkukooli more local residents gathered disregarding lockdown restrictions in effect on Sunday. Following this, more police personnel were summoned to the spot to bring the situation under control. Rajeswari S Pillai, the consultant of Express Global Logistics Private Limited, the firm that was transporting the cargo, said no man power or even external machinery was needed to unload the cargo. The cargo consisted of two settling chambers of a trisonic wind tunnel project Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station at the VSSC. One chamber weighed 128 tonnes while the other weighed 28 tonnes which were being transported in a high axle trailer. The chambers could be installed to the wind tunnel by lowering the axle. ''The police and the government officials were of great help,'' Rajeswari S Pillai said. When the situation got worse she contacted the Chief Minister's office. Soon she was contacted by the labour minister's office and the district labour officer visited the spot and held talks with the agitators. After over two hours, the agitators dispersed and allowed the trailer to pass through. The cargo was supposed to enter through the Canal Gate of the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. But, since a small bridge located there was not strong enough to carry the weight of the cargo, the route was changed via the South Thumba gate of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre. The police have registered a case against over 50 people for causing obstruction in public space and rioting. Charges under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance were also invoked against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ruckus-at-vssc-after-nokkukooli-demand/articleshow/85959310.cms||---

However, the composition of the about 200ml green liquid found in his abdomen is till not confirmed and sample of the same has been sent to the central forensic laboratory in Bangalore. The current postmortem report and forensic report did not find any injury to Mirza’s private parts, so the theory of applying epoxy adhesive, and that causing death could not be confirmed. “We have availed the first forensic report of Salman Mirza who died on June 25 in mysterious circumstances. But we haven’t yet been able to ascertain the exact cause of his death,” said a police officer. Several witnesses said that Mirza along with his former fiancee, both of whom were addicted to drugs, had gone to a hotel. There, they applied an epoxy adhesive on his private parts to substitute for a condom. “The two had reportedly gone to the hotel with another woman in an autorickshaw on June 22. We checked CCTV footage and found Mirza and his girlfriend entering the hotel. He was found unconscious the next day,” said a police officer. The officer said that using the adhesive on private parts worsened Mirza’s health condition and he died of complications, including multiple organ failure. Mirza was found unconscious in the shrubs near Amber Tower on June 23. His acquaintance, Firoz Shaikh, found him and brought him home. Mirza’s condition deteriorated and he was taken to Sola Civil Hospital where he died. Mirza’s younger sister Heena claimed that her brother’s former fiancee had conspired and killed him, but cops did not taken any stern action against her even after three months have passed. “My brother broke his engagement with her as he found her talking to some other man when she was about to marry my brother. She took revenge by applying adhesive on his private parts which took his life,” said Heena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/adhesive-case-no-drugs-in-body-mystery-deepens/articleshow/85959303.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The scheme, which was notified on February 24 this year, has received 36 applications, of which three are being rejected, according to a source. The winners — who would be notified soon — have committed Rs 3,455 crore as proposed investments. Of the ‘global’ companies that have applied, seven out of the eight applicants have made the cut and these are Taiwanese Foxconn (proposed investment Rs 208 crore), Rising Stars Hi-Tech (Rs 125 crore), Finnish Nokia Solutions (Rs 125 crore), American makers Flextronics (Rs 102 crore), Jabil Circuit (Rs 176 crore), CommScope (Rs 209 crore), and Sanmina-SCI (Rs 110 crore), sources told TOI. On the domestic side, 26 companies have made the cut, nine large ones, and 17 in the MSME category. The Indian companies include Akashastha Technologies (proposed investment Rs 593 crore), VVDN Technologies (Rs 400 crore), Neolync Tele Communications (Rs 188 crore), Dixon Electro Appliances (180 crore), ITI (Rs 120 crore), Tejas Networks (111 crore), GDN Enterprises (Rs 46 crore) and STL Networks (Rs 49 crore). The application of Sterlite Technologies, filed under the ‘global’ companies category, is being rejected for falling short of the minimum threshold criteria of Rs 10,000-crore revenue. “In the certificate for global revenue, the company has taken the revenue of ‘Vedanta’. It is also mentioned in the certificate by the applicant that the said revenue is not from electronic, IT/ITeS, including software, telecom and networking segment. If Vedanta’s revenue is excluded, the global revenue stands at Rs 5,180 crore, which is lower than the minimum threshold of Rs 10,000 crore for global companies,” a source said. On the domestic side, the application of Tech Mahindra is also being rejected as it is not engaged in manufacturing of telecom equipment, but only in software. “The company has applied for product, namely ‘software development’ in category ‘any other product’, as decided by empowered group of secretaries. The scheme only envisages manufacturing of goods, and ‘software’ is not covered under specified ‘telecom and networking products’ category,” the source said. Kenstel Networks, which has applied under MSME, has certified its revenues at Rs 6.4 crore, which is less than the stipulated Rs 10 crore threshold mandated for the category. The government had floated the scheme to encourage domestic manufacturing in the telecom sector, including core transmission equipment, 4G/5G next-generation Radio Access Network, IoT access devices and enterprise products such as switches and routers.  The government feels that with the transition to 5G and other futuristic technologies, India should have a robust, manufacturing eco-system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/33-companies-set-to-make-cut-for-rs-12k-crore-telecom-incentives/articleshow/85963889.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Wildlife lovers against Cheetah project in Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The exercise taken by the state forest department to introduce cheetah in Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) by neglecting tiger management has invited sharp criticism from wildlife experts, animal lovers and environmentalists. Many accused the over-ambitious forest department of jeopardising the tiger reintroduction programme, which started in 2018 with much fanfare. In the campaign ‘Say No To Cheetah’ initiated by wildlife lovers in the state, it was highlighted that the department overlooked tiger management problems and conducted rapid site assessment for cheetah on November 22 and 23, 2020. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, a local advisory committee member said, “After spending approximately Rs 30 crore of public money to develop infrastructure, tigers were reintroduced at MHTR. Unfortunately, mysterious deaths of tigers and cubs were reported. But, it is not the end of the road. The department should have worked on a recovery plan to relocate tigers.” Due to forest department’s apathy and lack of political will, the lone tigress MT-4 is living a miserable life in an enclosure without a companion. “The four-and-a-half-year-old tigress is living a caged life for past one year. The forest department should have expedited deliberations with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and make efforts to seek permission to bring a male tiger. However, no move was made in this direction,” said a state wildlife board member, who wished not to be named. The technical note, “Assessment of Cheetah Introduction Sites and Proposed Actions, 2021” reads for the area outside the enclosure, MHTR would require investments on a large scale in terms of reducing anthropogenic pressures through village relocation, grazing control of goats and cattle and mitigating infrastructure (roadways and railway).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/wildlife-lovers-against-cheetah-project-in-mukundra/articleshow/85961572.cms||---

The health department has asked all districts to be prepared based on the Nipah management plan it published after the first two outbreaks of the virus in 2018 and 2019. A core committee consisting of 14 doctors have been formed, and a 24x7 control room has been opened in Kozhikode. The core committee will focus on aspects including surveillance, sample testing and result management, linkage of suspected new patients to the index case, contact list management, patient transportation management, material and logistics management, case treatment, expert visit coordination, management of infrastructure, call centre and the media, management and scientific funeral of dead bodies, data analysis, providing psychological support and inter-sectoral coordination. Daily core committee meetings will be held, along with review meetings that will be held twice a day. The round-the-clock call centre with 10 landline connections will be linked with the DISHA system to answer medical queries, logistics and administrative issues regarding Nipah and related health problems. A surveillance team consisting of district surveillance officer and epidemiologists will be in charge of overall coordination of active case finding, diagnosis and reporting of cases. Scrutiny of all encephalitis deaths in the past one month and route map of the cases for establishing any association will also be prepared. The cases will be categorised as suspect, probable and confirmed Nipah cases based on various criteria. Person from an area affected by a Nipah virus disease outbreak who has acute fever with new onset of altered mental status or seizure or acute fever with severe headache or acute fever with cough or shortness of breath will be put as a suspected case. A contact tracing team, including field workers under community medicine department and DMO, will be actively involved in contact tracing. Those who have been in contact with a confirmed or a probable Nipah case through body fluids, or those who have been in close proximity of the confirmed or probable case for more than 12 hours, will be classified as high-risk contacts. Those who have been in contact through touch or by using anything that was touched by the confirmed or probable case of Nipah will be in the low-risk category. Those at high risk but are asymptomatic will be in home quarantine for 21 days with active monitoring by the health team, while those who are symptomatic will be admitted to isolation wards immediately. While it has been assessed that sufficient consumables are in stock at present, KMSCL has been instructed to mobilise necessary consumables as per need. An inter-departmental team involving the animal husbandry department will engage in identifying the source. As per funeral guidelines, the bodies will be buried in the corporation limits itself. The treatment will be as per the treatment protocol and the infected and suspected will be discharged only on the basis of discharge guidelines. The suspect will be put on continued intense supportive care and will be considered for monoclonal antibody (MAB), Remdisivir, Favipiravir or Ribavirin after discussing with the patient. The treatment plan will be formulated by the institutional medical board. During the NiV outbreak in Kozhikode in 2018 the m102.4 monoclonal antibody (MAB), an experimental therapeutic, was imported for treatment of Nipah-infected patients on compassionate grounds. The SOP (standard operating procedures) and protocols were prepared with support from ICMR. But it was not used as the outbreak had ended by that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/health-dept-readies-plan-to-fight-nipah/articleshow/85959405.cms||KP Saikiran

The officials advised people to not just eliminate mosquitoes with the help of sprays but also to ensure that mosquitoes do not breed inside the house or in surrounding areas. “This is a good strategy to keep families and people safe from dengue. Also, since schools have reopened, it is better to tell students to keep away from water stagnation points,” an official said. Though mosquito nets can help prevent malaria, they do not help in the case of dengue mosquitoes as the dengue mosquito bites only during the day. “We provided about 4.75 lakh mosquito nets this year in regions where cases of malaria were detected,” officials said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/check-mosquito-breeding/articleshow/85961550.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Beed district received heavy rain with Madalmohi (180 mm) in Georai taluka and Raymoha (159 mm) and Nintarwani (156 mm) in Shirur-Kasar taluka reporting highest rainfall. The incessant showers temporarily snapped road connectivity in few parts of rural areas. Farms were inundated due to excess rainwater in some parts of Marathwada that have received 700 mm showers since June 1, accounting for 103% of the expected rain during the four months of the rainy season. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, more rain is in the store for Marathwada during the next 48-hours with some places likely to witness heavy to very heavy showers. “In Hingoli district, Nandgaon from Aundha taluka and Chinchordi from Kalamnuri taluka have reported one rain-related deaths each, whereas Jarandi from Soygaon taluka of Aurangabad district, Kolhari from Kinwat taluka of Nanded district, Gaundgaon from Deoni taluka of Latur district and Ruidhoki — falling within tehsil limits of Osmanabad — have reported one casualty each,” Aurangabad deputy divisional commissioner Parag Soman said. Further details of rain-related deaths were not available till late Sunday evening. The district administrations have issued alerts for people living on the banks of Godavari river and its different tributaries among other vulnerable areas in the wake of possibility of more rainfall over a period of next few days. Among revenue circles with heavy rainfall of more than 65 mm, Beed district tops the chart with 33 such areas followed by Jalna (16), Osmanabad (12), Latur (10), Aurangabad (11) and Nanded, Parbhani and Hingoli (one each).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/6-dead-as-heavy-rain-lashes-85-circles-across-mwada/articleshow/85954837.cms||---

A recent advisory issued by the cybercrime cell of the CID (crime) of Gujarat Police urges people to cover the cameras of their devices when they are not being used. “There are many applications which can use your device’s cameras for snooping on you. So you have to be alert and cautious,” said the advisory issued by the CID (crime) on August 28 for common users. Senior police officers said that they have come across many cases in which a person’s private information has been leaked using a device’s cameras. “While installing apps, people often permit access to the phone camera, gallery, and other crucial folders,” said an officer of the cybercrime cell of the CID (crime). “This gives cyber crooks easy entry into your cellphone or laptop. They can then access your camera or any app.” Another officer said that sometimes cyber crooks capture people when they are watching porn. Persons thus targeted are sent videos of themselves watching porn and subjected to blackmail. An officer of Ahmedabad Police said: “There are applications with which cyber criminals get access to people’s cellphones and the victims never know they are being monitored.” Hackers using such tricks keep track of the victims’ activities and the organizations they work for. The cyber criminals can even use the microphones of the devices to surveil their targets. A retired IPS officer of the state said, “A cellphone is a very dangerous thing and I don’t keep it near me when I am discussing a matter that requires privacy.” The officer added: “Once a conversation got leaked though nobody in the room was recording it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/your-cellphone-is-crooks-cctv/articleshow/85959372.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt ensures raw materials for English Indian Clays||Thiruvananthapuram: Industry minister P Rajeeve has directed the mining and geology department to ensure that English Indian Clays Limited (EICL) receives the raw materials required for its smooth functioning. The decision was taken at the high-level meeting convened by the minister here on Friday. The mining and geology department will now look into the necessary legal options for permitting the company to mine the raw materials required for the production. The meeting was convened in the wake of the company’s demand that unless they are allowed to mine the required raw materials, they will have to shut down its operations. The company's operations have been in a downturn for the last couple of years on account of the continuing shortage of raw materials. This eventually led to the closure of the factories at Thonnakkal and Kochu Veli in August 2020. However, the company chose to resume partial operations at Thonnakkal after the government intervention. The minister said the meeting has also decided to ensure the smooth functioning of the company and provide the government’s full support. The company management representatives who took part in the discussion guaranteed new investment proposals if the government could ensure the raw materials required for their production at their units. Meanwhile, the government also decided to convene a meeting with the labour minister to settle the labour issues in the company. The company had claimed that it has suffered a substantial drop in market share and sales in its wake inflicting upon it a huge financial loss. The company also remains apprehensive of its potential for future investments in the state. The investments have been directed to Gujarat where operations have already started. The company had claimed earlier that if things do not improve, the operations at its Thonnakkal factory might also go down along the lines of what was witnessed at its unit at Veli. Clay mined from Thonnakkal has been found wanting both in terms of quality and quantity for sustained operations thanks mainly to the restricted permit for mining activities. The drop in market has had a cascading effect worsening the situation further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-ensures-raw-materials-for-english-indian-clays/articleshow/85959334.cms||---

There are 19 such special camps, with the highest 77,156 shots administered at the booths set up at Eidgah Aishbagh, followed by Naka Gurdwara 48,520, Chhota Imambara 30,020, Sant Nirankari Bhawan 17,183, Sadar Gurdwara 15,745 and Radha Swami Satsang 6,299. The remaining 13 are also administering doses at a high rate. Eidgah Aishbagh was the first religious place to double up as a vaccination centre on May 19. “We took the initiative and got ourselves inoculated first, which helped in diluting hesitancy among people, particularly minorities. Vaccination drive hasn’t stopped here even for a single day since the rollout,” said Eidgah Imam Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali. People are preferring these places because of good amenities and care. Nodal officer of the vaccination centre at Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Naka Hindola, Dr Ankush Shukla, said proper management and special arrangements for women, elderly and people with disabilities have made this centre a favourite among the recipients. “We have made arrangements to vaccinate elderlies and people with disabilities in their vehicles parked outside the gate as they have difficulty in walking till the booth. Tokens are distributed to avoid overcrowding,” he said. “There are proper seating arrangements for others with an observation room. Another reason for the good turnout is that langer is offered by Sewadaars to everyone. Initially, 200-300 beneficiaries were getting the jab daily, but now the number has increased to 1,000 per day,” said Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee president Rajendra Singh Bagga. Adil Faraz Jawad, spokesperson, Majlis e ulama-e-hind, the body managing vaccination at Chhota Imambara, said, “We provide all the basic facilities to people. Inoculation process has been stopped right now because of Muharram, but will resume after Chehlum.” Harpal Singh Jaggi, president, Gurdwara Sadar, “We have a big air-conditioned hall and a parking space where beneficiaries can easily wait for their turn. Besides, volunteers make sure that Covid protocols are followed. Wheelchairs and other basic amenities are also available.” “Our mission is to serve. Such camps are running in all the places where we have a centre,” Aryan Srivastava, caretaker, Sant Nirankari Bhawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/10-of-28-2l-covid-shots-in-city-given-at-religious-places/articleshow/85961547.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

A house index of 16 indicates that dengue mosquito is present in 16 out of every hundred dwellings. This is the highest value for the mosquito house index since 2018, officials said. The health department’s house index survey in areas with a high number of cases has also shown that the mosquito container index at 19 is the highest in the state. “The container index reveals the number of households where mosquito breeding is prevalent. An index of 15 means that larval presence is found in 15 houses for every 100 buildings,” officials explained. Dengue house and container index of more than 10 suggests a sensitive scenario with a higher number of cases. Along with Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Rangareddy and Peddapalli have a house index value higher than 10. Officials said water stagnation in households is a perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. Mosquitoes also breed on overhead tanks and open septic tanks as well as flower pots and discarded liquor bottles. “Dengue mosquitoes thrive on unused plastic objects, tyres and beer bottles which are dumped on rooftops,” an official said. According to Dr Suresh Babu Yakkala, consultant physician at Apollo Hospitals, dengue fever is preventable. “Taking care of the surroundings is very important, especially during the rainy season. In this season, no serious cases have been reported, but incidence of fever is high,” he said. Dr Suresh said that in some cases only platelets were required. “In general, if the platelet count is below 10,000, we will recommend platelet infusion. In extraordinary circumstances, platelet infusion is required even if the count is above 10,000,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dengue-mosquito-index-high-in-hyd/articleshow/85961543.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||30% vehicles, 15 years old or more, unregistered in Pune||PUNE: More than 30% vehicles 15 years old or above are unregistered in Pune, regional transport officials said. Records maintained by the Pune RTO reveal that around 68,100 non-transport vehicles in Pune are more than 20 years old and another 16,200 transport vehicles are close to touching 20 years. “There are many non-transport or private vehicles which are more than 20 years old in Pune. Our calculations show that around 30% vehicles (both private and commercial) are still to be re-registered. The reasons could be many, including the fact that many of these vehicles might have been sold as scrap or discarded. Every day, around 100 vehicles come to the RTO office for re-registration. With the scrappage policy announced now, the owners of vehicles opting to go for scrapping rather than re-registration are in for sops and benefits,” an RTO official told TOI. The Centre recently announced the new scrappage policy, which will come into effect from April of 2023 for commercial vehicles and from June 2024 for private vehicles. “We haven’t received any direction from the transport department till now. Presently, we don’t have much idea as to how the system will work and whether the government will officially appoint a vendor for scrapping. However, the fact that commercial vehicle owners might now hold on to their old vehicles rather than immediately discard them is a possibility,” the official pointed out. In March, the state transport department had said that there were around 16 lakh vehicles, which could be scrapped. The state transport department had asked the Pune RTO office recently to look out for around 11 lakh vehicles, which might be running without any registration after 15 years of age. This came to light after vehicle registration numbers in Pune, which was around 41lakh, mismatched with the figure of around 30lakh on the Parivahan portal of the ministry of roads and transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/30-vehicles-15-years-old-or-more-unregistered-in-pune/articleshow/85959386.cms||Joy Sengupta

Several farmers on their way to the GIC ground - the venue of the 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' - were asked to take a different route. "The administration may have felt that extra police personnel should be deployed for security, so they have done it," Malik said of the security arrangement outside the house. When contacted, SSP Abhishek Yadav, said, "Umesh Malik's house is next to the GIC ground. So, we had deployed a police team in front of his house in the backdrop of the recent incident."

Banas dairy, the largest milk union of Gujarat, will be spending nearly Rs 500 crore for setting up the milk processing plant that can process five lakh litres (LLPD) milk every day.  “Our board members visited the site at Varanasi on Sunday, saw the place and discussed the boundaries among other technicalities,” said dairy’s in-charge managing director Sangram Chaudhary.  “The 51 bigha land parcel belonged to UP State Industrial Development Authority which has been handed over to us. It is located at Karkhiyaon, 18 km away from Varanasi. We have already started work like levelling the land and are expecting the plant to come up in the next 18-20 months,” he said. Initially, the plant is proposed to process 5 LLPD with provision of future expansion. Earlier in the day, dairy’s chairman Shankar Chaudhary thanked PM for his support in acquiring land for the project. “Farmers of UP as well as Banaskantha will immensely benefit from this dairy plant,” he said.

---||Jaipur||BJP lost farmer support in phase-2 of Rajasthan rural elections||JAIPUR: The panchayat poll results of six districts is set to change the equation of several BJP leaders. The party seems to have lost the confidence of farmers, who had given a thumbs up to farm bills during the first phase of the rural polls held in 21 districts in December 2020. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot was quick to snatch the narrative claiming that the victory was a result of farmers opposed to the three farm laws. The loss in Jaipur and Jodhpur affect the positioning of the two tallest leaders — BJP state president Satish Poonia and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Poonia, who held roadshows and door-to-door campaigning in his assembly segment Amber, got less than half (24) of what Congress secured (51). BJP lost in Jodhpur under Shekhawat bagging 21 wards while Congress got 37 to snatch the board from the BJP. The party leaders defended the results blaming the government for misusing the government machinery. Reiterating the party’s stand, Poonia said, “The Congress doesn’t need to be happy over the results and overall mandate has gone against them. BJP along with the Independents secured more seats than the ruling party.” Former CM Vasundhara Raje congratulated the party workers and said: “BJP needs to work harder and we will do it together.” Congress retained its board in Sawai Madhopur and Dausa while BJP has clear numbers in Sirohi. In Bharatpur, it emerged as the single largest party. The independents play a decisive role in the formation of the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-lost-farmer-support-in-phase-2-of-rural-elections/articleshow/85961606.cms||---

Among the stretches that were worst affected were internal roads, especially those in colonies which were not yet taken care of when the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) was preparing to meet monsoon contingencies. Roads in Anjaneya Nagar at Moosapet, Krishna Nagar in Yousufguda, P&T Colony and Reddy Brothers lane in Saroornagar, Malakpet, Dilsukhnagar and Safilguda seem to have gone from bad to worse. “The rains coupled with construction activity have made this entire stretch so bad that we cannot take a walk without the vehicles driving through the potholes splashing water on us. There is also sewage that flows into the colony due to lack of silting works in manholes and drains in the area,” said R Sharath, a resident of Aanjaneya Nagar colony in Moosapet. While the GHMC workers have temporarily stopped the sewage from overflowing into the colony, the uneven and pothole-ridden roads continue to haunt the residents. Potholes of various sizes can be observed at vital by-lanes, including the ones at Nampally, First Lancer, Yakutpura, Shaikpet, Langer Houz and many other parts of Old City. Prominent among the damaged roads were also the Old Malakpet road, the entire stretch from Kondapur to Hi-Tec City and some vital by-lanes of Madhapur and Gachibowli. While a GHMC official said that the monsoon emergency teams are constantly working to identify damaged roads and repair them, mayor G Vijayalakshmi who was addressing the issue of roads damaged by rain recently said, “Stretches that have been damaged due to rains will be repaired once dry weather prevails... Restoration work during rains is not possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rains-lay-bare-potholes-city-roads-go-from-bad-to-worse-yet-again/articleshow/85961592.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Residents and tourists in Mussoorie eagerly wait for the fag end of the rainy season, when these flowers, typically grown in gardens, bloom in the wild. However, with growing urbanisation and the hills getting warmer, these flowers are disappearing. The dahlias came to the Queen of Hills along with the British. In fact, the flowers can be found in other towns in Uttarakhand as well, which used to be British settlements like Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora. “Dahlias are native to Europe and were brought to these parts by the British, who planted them in their gardens as ornamental species, but one can say that they ‘escaped’ and over the years, adapted to the wild,” said divisional forest officer, Mussoorie, Kahkashan Naseem. She added that increased construction on the natural vegetation had affected the growth of wild dahlias. “The number of dahlias is dwindling due to habitat destruction owing to increasing urbanisation and also due to rising temperatures,” she added. Today, blooming wild dahlias are found mostly in the town’s outskirts in areas which have been spared of relentless construction. The flowers are particularly abundant on the slopes of Gun Hill, on the hill near Mussoorie Girls School and parts of Landour Cantonment at this time of the year. They are also found in lesser numbers on some parts of the Mall road, on Camel’s Back road, on the slopes near Hampton Court School, on Circular road and near Guru Nanak Fifth Centenary school. Some flowers can also be found scattered along the Tehri Bypass road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wild-dahlias-which-bloom-at-fag-end-of-monsoon-slowly-fading-from-mussoorie/articleshow/85957133.cms||Anmol Jain

The National Centre for Seismology informed, through its Twitter handle, about the earthquake of 3.9 intensity on the Richter scale around 19-km away from Kolhapur. The depth of the epicentre recorded was around 38-km. As a result, the tremors were not felt. As per disaster management officials, the epicentre might be near Kale village. No damage to private or public property was reported. Prasad Sankpal, Kolhapur district disaster management officer, said, “As per the longitude and latitude shared by BhooKamp app of the National Centre for Seismology, the epicentre is near Kale village. The locals claimed they did not feel any tremors. The low intensity earthquake was recorded at 11.49 pm on Saturday. The quakes above intensity of 3.0 on the Richter scale are usually recorded by the app whereas those less than 3 are not.” Sankpal said though the National Centre for Seismology recorded the tremors, the earthquake measuring system set up at Warna dam too recorded the same intensity tremors. The earthquake measuring system set up at Koyna dam in Satara district recorded tremors of 2.5 intensity on the Richter scale which is considered weak. The epicentre recorded was in neighbouring Ratnagiri district in Khovi village. The epicentre depth was 12 km.

The drive will continue in all 200 assembly segments on Monday and Tuesday with an aim to project Pilot as the most popular Congress leader. This is not for the first time that supporters of Pilot have gone out of the way to celebrate their leader’s birthday. Last year, in a statewide blood donation drive, over 45,000 units were collected in 400 camps on his birthday. The event marked a strong political message of his hold in the state even after he was removed from the post of and deputy CM. The drive is coinciding with the massive victory of Congress candidates in the gram panchayat polls in areas known to be dominated by Pilot supporters. In every constituency, the minimum number of plantations would be 5,000 to achieve the target of 10 lakh in the next two days. MLA Ladnun Mukesh Bhakar, considered close to Pilot, has committed 5,100 plants with 101 each in all gram panchayat (GP) under his constituency. “I have purchased saplings from nurseries locally in a bid to give a boost to farmers. Other than GPs, I will plant saplings across the roads in my constituency,” said Bhakar. Another staunch supporter of Pilot, MLA Dausa Murari Lal Meena, has appointed two volunteers each at 50 GPs for the drive. “My target is to plant 10,000 saplings in schools, hospitals, government buildings and on either side of roads. Every plant will be documented and efforts will be made to ensure that every sapling grows into a tree,” said Meena. Leaders associated with the drive said they were getting massive support from the party workers and locals everywhere. “The message has spread like wildfire across the state. The party workers and locals have been providing saplings, water tankers and tools to coordinators of the drive. Many have committed to carrying on the drive by themselves displaying support to the cause of the environment,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-supporters-to-plant-10l-saplings/articleshow/85961664.cms||---

The index case was an animal lover and from the index case it had spread, said Dr Anoop Kumar, who detected the first Nipah case in 2018 in Kozhikode. Since it has Covid-like symptoms, we have to be very careful now, especially when the fatality rate is very high, he said. “Finding the source of Nipah is important. There are three chances for spreading — direct bat to human, human to human or from bat to animals then to human. In the first episode of Nipah, it was direct bat to human. The index case was an animal lover and it was found that he had come into direct contact with the infected bats,” said Dr Anoop Kumar A S, critical care expert at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode. In the present case, this kid was taken to three hospitals and he was admitted to the general ICU. Hence, there are chances that healthcare workers and the other ICU patients might have come into direct contact. Hence the key is to isolate all these people who have come into direct contact. Since the fatality rate is high, it is more important to isolate these people and to have constant monitoring, he said. “It is a droplet infection and hence it can be spread through pigs, cats and dogs. Hence, people coming in contact with such animals where bat population is high are under tremendous risk. Nipah has a similar symptom that of Covid. Hence, those who tested Covid-negative but if symptoms still persist, then they will have to immediately get tested for Nipah too,” said Dr Anoop. It would not spread like a pandemic and will be confined to a specific area from where the index case has been reported. Isolation of direct contacts and maintaining social distancing are the only way to prevent the spread, he added. On May 17, 2018, a 28-year-old was admitted to the hospital and the patient had developed myocarditis and severe circulatory failure. Dr Anoop and his team decided to send the samples to Manipal Institute of Virology for diagnosis. But the patient died on May 18 and the result was positive for Nipah. During that outbreak, 19 people were infected, of which 17 succumbed to Nipah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/be-alert-as-nipah-has-covid-like-symptoms/articleshow/85959510.cms||---

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Congress has slight edge over BJP’s performance in 2015||JAIPUR: A analysis of the recently concluded panchayat samiti polls in the six districts in comparison with the results of the same districts in 2015 shows that the ruling Congress (670) has a clear edge over BJP (551) with a staggering difference of 119 seats in the number of panchayat samiti member posts won by both the parties.  In 2015, the BJP bagged 584 seats – then in government - against Congress’ 542, a difference of 42. Hanuman Beniwal-led Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) was at a distant third with 40 seats. Among others, BSP won 11 and Independents bagged 290 wards. The results in two wards couldn’t be declared as polling was not held. In 2015, out of 1,328 panchayat samiti seats, the Independents had won 196. The increase in the number of seats this time can be attributed to delimitation and creation of new panchayat samitis in all districts, including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa and Sirohi, where elections were held. The difference in the number of panchayat samiti member seats in 2021 (1564) over last time’s 1328 (2015) is 236.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/cong-has-slight-edge-over-bjps-performance-in-2015/articleshow/85964975.cms||---

He also threw a challenge at Eatala Rajender of BJP to inform the people of Huzurabad and Telangana whether he would prevail upon the Prime Minister and BJP government at the Centre to withdraw the three contentious agriculture laws brought in by the Union goverment. On the other hand, Eatala called upon the people of Huzurabad not to trust the promises being made by Harish Rao on construction of 2-BHKs, mahila bhavans and budgetary sanction for various other projects. “None of the ministers in KCR’s cabinet have the power to release money for any scheme or project. It is only KCR who decides,” he said. Eatala also sought to warn Harish against implementing what he termed orders from KCR to threaten first and second-rung leaders in the constituency to desert him (Eatala). “Beware, we have the capacity to chase you away from the constituency,” Eatala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/harish-vows-scheme-for-reddys-eatala-dubs-them-empty-promises/articleshow/85961674.cms||---

Be it a coffee shop or hostel gate or a brief walk through the campus – teachers used to make use of every opportunity to answer students’ query on complicated medical topics. Speaking on “Guru-Shishya Parampara - A Georgian Perspective” at the function on the campus to mark Teachers’ Day, head onco-surgery department, Prof Arun Chaturvedi said, "There was relentless teaching. The day was spent in classroom teaching, but even after that if any teacher would walk into the café in the evening, she/he would sit with us and start answering our queries. Even in the night, if by chance, a teacher would come across us at hostel gates, he would start explaining medical topics.” KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri said that Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on whose memory the day is celebrated said that teaching is not a profession but a purpose. Lucknow University V-C Prof Alok Rai, who was chief guest on the occasion, said a teacher’s responsibility was not just to impart education but also make students morally strong. Best teachers felicitated Based on online voting by 400 students of MBBS and BDS, five serving teachers were felicitated with “best teacher award”. The teachers are – from medical science Dr Sarvesh Singh (pharmacology) and Dr Garima Sehgal (anatomy); from Dental science Dr Neeraj Mishra (prosthodontics) and Dr Fahad Mansoor (oral pathology) and from paramedical faculty Anugrah Charan. Besides, KGMU V-C Lt Gen Dr Bipin Puri honoured two retired teachers - Prof Rakesh Kumar Chak and Prof Urmila Singh – with best faculty award on the recommendation of Alumni Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-teachers-day-georgians-discuss-rendezvous-with-their-gurus/articleshow/85961670.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||BJP & TRS secret allies, took federalism to new low: Cong||Hyderabad: Congress on Sunday demanded a white paper on the central government’s response to the representations made by Telangana in the last seven years. Ex-minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir on Sunday demanded that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre release a white paper on the funds and grants released to various states in the country since 2014, which he said would expose the injustices done to Telangana. He claimed that BJP and TRS took the spirit of federalism to a new low with their governments adopting informal approach to several public issues. “Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and submitted a bunch of 16 representations. It was nothing but a formality as none of them had any pre-briefing on issues to be discussed in the meeting. KCR had submitted similar representations during his earlier visits to New Delhi. The petitions submitted by CM KCR now will meet the same fate as the previous ones and all will remain unresolved,” he said. The Congress leader demanded that KCR release a white paper on representations made to the Centre in the last seven years and the response from the Modi government to those submissions. He said that both BJP and TRS were secret allies and they survive on the plank of ‘Gali mein kushti, Delhi mein dosti’. He sought to advise BJP state president Bandi Sanjay to wind up his padayatra as his party’s friendship with KCR has been exposed. “While Bandi Sanjay was threatening to send KCR family to jail, KCR and PM Modi were doing ‘chai pe charcha’ in Delhi. It is time that both parties stop misleading people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-trs-secret-allies-took-federalism-to-new-low-cong/articleshow/85961689.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jawaharnagar police on Saturday booked two people, including a minor for allegedly transferring LPG from domestic cylinders into commercial cylinders. Police have also seized over 80 cylinders among other machinery worth Rs 3.63 lakh. Shaikh Mukhtar Shaikh Osman (48), a resident of Peerbazaar, and one minor have been booked in connection with the incident, said an official release. An offence under enabling provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, and Section 286 (Negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) ofthe Indian Penal Code have been invoked against the accused. While the price of subsidized domestic LPG cylinder is around Rs 492, the commercial cylinders costs nearly Rs 1,545 each. Police said the accused were engaged in the business of stealing LPG from domestic cylinders and refilling the commercial ones for easy money. Earlier, in August, Satara police had registered an offence in connection with alleged stealing of LPG from refill cylinders. Followed by the incident, consumer rights activists have appealed to the citizens to carry out weight check and leak tests while accepting LPG refill. As per public advisory issued by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the gross weight of LPG and empty cylinder together should be 29.5 kg — 14.2 kg gas and 15.3 kg of the cylinder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minor-among-two-booked-for-stealing-lpg-from-cylinders/articleshow/85954993.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Can’t keep kids at home always, abiding by SoPs only solution’||MUMBAI: Even as uncertainty continues over reopening of schools in the state, the paediatric task force on Sunday presented a list of standard operating procedures (SoP) to be followed if physical schools are to resume. In a virtual presentation organised by the state Covid task force and the state government, Dr Suhas Prabhu, chairperson of the paediatric task force, said that apart from the already recommended protocols of staggered school hours, school days, lunch time and distancing, all contact sports should be avoided. Also, children from containment zones should not be sent to school. “The new procedures have been drawn up to assure parents who may worry that their child will contract the infection at school and, in turn, infect the entire family,” said Dr Prabhu, while speaking at the ‘Majha Doctor’ virtual seminar. He said that with reopening of playgrounds and schools, it is likely that infection in the under-18 age group will spiral due to increased exposure and lack of vaccination in this category. “But that does not mean we can keep them at home all time. This will lead to other psychological issues among them. The only way to keep them safe is to mask up, keep social distancing and sanitisation,” said Dr Prabhu. He said teachers should be advised to care for the psychological health of students and in the first few days of the schools reopening, focus should not be only on academics. “Teachers must be aware of the different backgrounds the students are coming from. Some may have lost a family member to Covid, parents of some may have been jobless. Dealing with the children in a sensitive manner will be required,” he said. The task force has also suggested setting up health clinics run by a trained school staff or volunteer with basic amenities like thermometre, oximetre and medicines; and in case a student is reported sick, the child should be referred to the nearest dedicated centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cant-keep-kids-at-home-always-abiding-by-sops-only-solution/articleshow/85962973.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Lucknow||Become a Covid warrior by taking jab||with Protect UP logo Drop cap Slug: By Invitation The Union ministry of health and family welfare recommends that a person who has recovered from Covid-19 should take the first jab after three months from the date of clinical recovery. And if a person contracts Covid after the first dose of the vaccine, then the second dose should be delayed by three months from the date of clinical recovery. Pregnant and lactating women, who were initially not included in the vaccination drive, have now been given a go ahead to take the vaccine, based on the recommendations of NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization) as the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant women outweighs its potential risk. The gap between the two doses of Covishield has been increased to 12 to 16 weeks while that for Covaxin remains the same at 4 to 6 weeks. When coronavirus enters a human body, the immune system recognises it and starts making antibodies against it to curtail its proliferation and spread. As this is a slow process and can take up to 5-7 days, by then a great degree of damage is already done. In the form of a vaccine, a part of the inactivated virus is injected, which by itself does cause any clinical infection but makes antibodies against it, so that when the actual infection occurs the already existing antibodies can ward off its spread. Enough evidence is now available to confirm that vaccines are safe and effective and any side-effect, if it occurs, is rare. The Central government plans to vaccinate all 137 crore eligible citizens free of cost in the world’s largest vaccination drive. And even now if you decide not to take the vaccine you should know that when the Covid enters your body, it not only infects you, but there is high probability that it may infect others through you and while doing so the virus may mutate and may cause further havoc. Hence if you refuse to take the jab you are not only harming yourself but also posing a significant threat to the health of the society as a whole. In the UK and the US, where the vaccination coverage is more than 60%, hospitalisation for the number of people infected during the second wave is very low. Thus further emphasizing the fact that even after vaccination if you suffer from a breakthrough infection your chances of contracting a severe disease, getting hospitalised and dying are almost negligible. It is also important to note that even after taking both the jabs, you can still contract the virus without showing any symptoms of the disease and can still infect others. So observing Covid appropriate behaviour in the form of maintaining adequate social distance, frequent sanitisation of hands and wearing the mask is of utmost importance. Today, we are lucky to be in a country where the vaccination is being provided free of cost and more than 67 crore doses of the vaccines have already been administered and thousands are being vaccinated daily. In August alone, India vaccinated more than 180 million doses. Hence, it is your time to be a Covid Warrior by getting vaccinated and strengthening the country’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The RLD chief, who was busy trying to arrange a chopper till the last moment and could not attend the event, later tweeted, "What is the danger to the government with respect to farmers?" “I wanted to pay respect and welcome farmers by showering flowers on them from a helicopter. The DM, ADG, city magistrate, principal secretary and CM were informed, but the permission was not granted,” he claimed in his tweet. And then added, “People have given me a lot of love and respect. The government puts nails on the roads, but cannot allow us to shower flowers on farmers. Till they remain, I will not accept a garland.” RLD workers were, however, present in large numbers at the venue. Some of them stood on top of cars and used spray machines to shower petals. The former MP, in a video statement recorded at Delhi airport, further said, “Farmers are protesting on the roads for months. Hundreds of them lost their lives.

Business owners are keeping their fingers crossed as they hop for a steady recovery of business. Vikas Ladhe, centre head, SGS Mall that compared to footfalls in August, there was a 100% increase in customers during the first week of September. “But when we think of pre-covid numbers, sales are 40% of what they used to be. Though we have to face the brunt of the pandemic, we can hope for sales to grow steadily over the upcoming festive season to encourage recovery of business,” said Ladhe. Malls in other parts of the city also reported a growth in footfall from the last weekend. The management personnel of a mall in Pimpri Chinchwad said footfalls are increasing as more and more people are getting their second dose of the vaccine. “We will not be able to see footfalls anywhere near the numbers of 2019 unless the vaccination rider is disregarded but then again, we can only hope to get back to full scale operations when there is no longer the threat of another wave. Only vaccination can help control things,” he said. The bustle is back in shopping hubs such as Laxmi Road, Camp and FC Road as well. Cawas Pundole, president, Camp Merchants Association, said, “Sales have improved significantly as the situation seems to come back to normal now. But we hope for a better boost after Navratri.” A garment shopkeeper from FC Road said that youngsters are his target customer and since many of them still have to get fully vaccinated, they are shopping outside malls. “Sales of clothing and footwear have also increased as people have started going out more and are getting ready for the festive season,” he said. A saree shop owner on Laxmi Road said business rose by 50% in the first week of September and many shops are hoping it to increases further as the festive season gets under way. Customers, too, are eager to go shopping while ensuring that they adhere to safety protocols. “Throughout the pandemic we have been stuck at home and mostly shopping online. Now, we prefer to go out. The whole experience of going out to shop with your family is part of the festivities for us,” said Sulochana Das, a resident of Yerawada. Rujuta Adekar, from Rasta Peth, said, “Though my husband and I are fully vaccinated, we cannot take our children to the malls.

Sources said that CM was keen on meeting Shekhawat to press for state’s rights in water row with AP and demand setting up of a river water tribunal at the earliest Earlier, CM could not meet President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday as the latter left for a three-day visit to Goa for a Navy event. KCR’s meeting was intended to explain to the President the ‘Dalit Bandhu’ scheme introduced by the state. “KCR is of the firm opinion that the water sharing ratio between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh should be 50:50. Also, he would seek delisting of some irrigation projects of Telangana from Centre’s gazette notification. The CM wants to explain the factual situation on genuine share of water for Telangana from Godavari and Krishna, large quantities of which was presently being diverted by AP outside the basin in violation of rules,” said a TRS leader. The TRS leaders did not rule out the possibility of KCR returning to Hyderabad if the appointment with Shekhawat is not finalised on Monday. “The CM’s trip has already been highly successful as he has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, and submitted various representations in the interests of Telangana,” said a leader. KCR had gone to New Delhi on a three-day visit to lay the foundation stone for TRS party office.

Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF) Rahul Patil last week inspected the road after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) submitted a proposal. Patil told TOI, “We received a proposal from the PMC road department on August 27 requesting the forest department to handover a part of the open plot of reserved forest for widening the right side of the road which is just 9.5m wide to 24m, and to reduce the slope.” They have inspected the road to ascertain if the forest land should be handed over to the PMC. “Traffic flow can be eased if the road infrastructure is improved. We will forward the PMC’s proposal to the state government for sanction, but the land will remain with the forest department,” he added. The forest department does not have the technical and engineering expertise like other government departments to deal with the slope’s levelling. The PMC will have to take it up if the proposal is sanctioned by the state government. The road stretch links the chowk at Hotel Jyoti with Mohammadwadi and is used by water tankers, heavy and construction vehicles going to the high rise building sites towards Mohammadwadi and Undri. Often, these vehicles suffer from breakdowns while driving uphill and end up blocking the road. Water spillage adds to the poor road condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-proposal-to-widen-reduce-nibm-road-slope-begins-with-forest-dept-visit/articleshow/85959549.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Speaking at the felicitation ceremony of teachers of the secondary education department, Sharma said, “An online portal is being prepared to dispose of service related complaints at district, division and state levels.” Sharma felicitated two national awardees – Manish Kumar from Junior High School Shivganj Sahar in Auraiya district and Tripti Mahaur from Government Girls’ Inter College from Chamuriya village in Sadar block in Rampur district and 17 best secondary education teachers from across the state. “I am delighted to be honoured both at the national and the state level for my efforts in making social science interactive among students,” said Tripti, who virtually attended the National Teachers Award on Sunday organised by the Centre with the President as its chief guest. An inspirational social science educator, Tripti has been awarded for her work on creating awareness on environmental issues, creating social science labs for children, and inspiring social science educators. For Manish, the awards are the results of years of his hard work and labour. “I feel really proud to be honoured. Throughout the ceremony, I was all smiles. I felt like a celebrity with the media recording my achievements and people congratulating me,” Manish said. Manish has been honoured for teaching science through practical and using waste material for experiment in the makeshift lab.

Gafoor said that the authorities checked the area to find the source of infection. “It is true that there was a Rambutan tree near the house. But we are not sure whether this is the source. Families here say that bats are commonly seen in the area,” said Gafoor. Health minister Veena George, meanwhile, said that there is no need to panic. “Every minute detail is being analysed and there is no need to worry or panic. However, there should be a high level of alertness. If you have any information to be shared, the helpline numbers can be used for that. For instance, the family of the child had a goat. The goat had some disease a couple of months ago. This came up in one of the meetings. We examined it and all such details are being clearly followed,” said George.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab GST collection up in August at Rs 1,188 crore||CHANDIGARH: Punjab recorded Rs 1,188 crore as Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue collection in August, a growth of over 20% on the corresponding period last year. This can be seen as an indicator of the economic recovery after the second wave of Covid-19. As per the Punjab taxation commissionerate, the sectoral analysis of the GST receipts of the state suggest a healthy recovery in sectors such as iron and steel, electronic goods, fertilisers, telecom and banking. The officials claimed that besides the base effect of the abnormal previous year, last month’s growth is attributed to the strong anti-evasion activity of the department involving rigorous monitoring of bogus billing and unscrupulous trade practices as well as deployment of advanced data analytics for holistic and effective tax administration. The officials expect the robust GST growth witnessed so far to continue in the coming months as well. In addition to the regular IGST settlement, Punjab has received an ad hoc settlement of Rs 448 crore in August for the first quarter of the financial year 2021-22. As a result, the GST revenue up to the month of August has witnessed a high growth of nearly 80% as compared to the corresponding period last year. The tax collection from the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Central Sales Tax (CST) during the month of August is Rs 648 crore and nearly Rs 27 crore, respectively. As compared to the same period last year, VAT and CST revenue collection have displayed an impressive growth of 24% and 40%, respectively, this year thereby pointing to the upward curve of the economic recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-gst-collection-up-in-aug-at-rs-1188cr/articleshow/85961756.cms||---

---||Pune||Virtual gallery finds many takers, gives Indian artists global platform||Pune: By a stroke of luck, Niranjan Ingale’s plans for setting up ArtPRESENT, a global, virtual gallery and marketplace for artists, coincided with the onset of the global pandemic early last year as he was planning to increase representation of Indian artists in global art exhibitions. “When I lived in the US for a couple of years and spoke to art curators and promoters, I barely found work of any Indian contemporary artists. All the Indian art I found was by masters, such as MF Husain,” said Ingale. A view of the “exhibition” on the ArtPRESENT platform, on phone or on computer screen, almost feels like the real thing, with contemporary Indian art being exhibited in a neutral-coloured gallery, accompanied by classical Indian music in the background. Using data analytics and augmented reality, ArtPRESENT sources, values, and exhibits the works of painters and sculptors on its platform, both to introduce the artist to the global art market, and to sell the artworks, with pricing determined by various factors. The exhibition model even allows buyers to figure out the suitability of paintings to their homes, using projection. Recently, ArtPRESENT teamed up with the Pune-based art gallery Art2Day to reach out to artists and help them subscribe to the platform. Altogether 16 artists from in and around Pune have registered on the platform, which creates a portfolio of artists, and connects them to key players in the art market across the world, such as curators, art collectors, and others, for wider visibility and sales. The sign-ups have yielded results. The works of two artists Madhuri Bhaduri and M Narayan, from the Art2Day tie-up, have been selected for exhibition at the Hamptons Fine Art Fair in New York to be held in September. “Our plan now is to reach out to other artists in cities beyond Pune, so as to get more of them on board and increase Indian representation in the global art market,” Ingale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/virtual-gallery-finds-many-takers-gives-indian-artists-global-platform/articleshow/85959574.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Lucknow||Oppn pumped bullets into our culture & nationalism: UP BJP chief in Ayodhya||Lucknow: Unleashing a frontal attack on the Opposition, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh accused it of “pumping bullets into Indian culture and nationalism”, while speaking at a ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ organised in Ayodhya. Singh referred to an incident in 1966, during the tenure of then PM Indira Gandhi, when police opened fire on seers who were demanding a law criminalising cow slaughter outside Parliament. “Even the previous SP government fired at Ram Bhakts. These bullets were fired on the culture of India and the ideology of nationalism,” he said. Singh maintained the entire country had faith in Lord Ram. “Ram is in every particle. But the Congress government formed after independence denied the existence of Ram. The previous Congress-led UPA government did not believe in Ram Setu. The Shankaracharya was arrested after independence. The term Hindu terrorism was coined. They would feel ashamed of calling themselves Hindu and going to temples. All this happened for the sake of vote-bank politics,” he said. The state BJP president further said, it was because of the politics of minority appeasement that no SP leader went to pay homage to former UP CM late Kalyan Singh, who died after a prolonged illness on August 21. He said, when Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee was going to Kashmir, people stopped him. “On reaching Kashmir, he was arrested and later martyred. After this the responsibility fell on Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, who too was murdered,” he recalled. The UP BJP president said, UP has been freed of crime and corruption. “Now if someone tries to usurp a poor man’s hut, a bulldozer runs over his house. Even goons living in prison are scared. There are no communal riots in UP anymore,” he said, praising the Yogi Adityanath government. Singh said, the BJP government maintains equality between Hindus and Muslims. “Various government schemes are meant for both communities. Let us together develop this country and talk about harmony, not riots,” he said. He said, in previous Congress governments, only 15% funds trickled down to beneficiaries. “Now, 100% reaches accounts of poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-pumped-bullets-into-our-culture-nationalism-up-bjp-chief-in-ayodhya/articleshow/85961730.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Hearing loss, conjunctivitis among new signs of Covid||MUMBAI: Reduced hearing, dry mouth, throbbing headache and conjunctivitis are some of the newer symptoms seen in Covid-19 patients. Members of the state Covid task force urged physicians to suspect Covid even in cases where the hallmark signs of cough, sore throat, shortness of breath are absent. Listing some of the evolving symptoms, Dr Rahul Pandit, a task force member, said difficulty in hearing, conjunctivitis, extreme weakness, dry mouth and reduced saliva secretion, long-lasting headache and skin rashes may be signs of Covid too. “Although the disease has been around for 17 months, newer symptoms are still evolving and we need to watch them,” he said in an online conference chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday. Globally, there are few documented cases of sensorineural hearing loss associated with Covid-19. An inflammation of the auditory nerve or a clot caused by the viral infection could affect hearing just like it affects the sense of smell, said Dr Samir Bhargava, head of ENT at RN Cooper. “We haven’t seen any exponential jump in case of sudden hearing loss, though we are alert as viral infections are known to cause that,” he said, adding that such patients need steroid treatment. Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the task force, said that during the second wave driven by the Delta variant, many had only gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Fever can be present in varying forms, he said. Some do not get any fever, some get it in bursts, some in intervals of two to three days, while in many it fully subsides, only to return with severity. The taskforce members emphasised that early testing is of utmost importance. Dr Oak said family physicians have a crucial role in advising a Covid test, preferably an RT-PCR. “If the test is done immediately, the person can be administered antivirals or monoclonal antibodies that are effective when administered early,” he said. At the event, Dr Shashank Joshi, an endocrinologist and member of the task force, said people who test positive must watch six vital parameters — temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and blood sugar levels. Dr Pandit said blood sugar is a parameter that can prevent many complications, including the risk of mucormycosis. The experts stressed that full recovery takes at least three weeks. Cardiologist Dr Ajit Desai said that post-Covid up to 40% patients may grapple with neuropsychiatric impairments, including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, post-traumatic stress disorder, while up to 5% may have thromboembolic events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hearing-loss-conjunctivitis-among-new-signs-of-covid/articleshow/85962979.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The company’s move comes against the backdrop of Tanishq, which is primarily a jewellery brand, foraying into the ethnic wear space. Aditya Birla’s ABFRL, too, has shown a strong interest in the segment by snapping up significant stakes in domestic designer wear labels such as Sabyasachi and Tarun Tahiliani. Despite a proliferation of global apparel brands, ethnic wear continues to be the dominant segment in India, leading to several domestic and foreign brands specialising in western wear to launch desi clothing collections. Apart from selling private labels in sarees and ethnic wear, Avantra will partner with regional weaver clusters and several third-party brands, including Nalli Silks and Pothys. “Jewellery, accessories and tailoring services will also be part of the offerings,” said a source. “The first store is set to come up in Bengaluru, followed by others in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.” Women’s ethnic wear market is set to grow 10% annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-retail-set-to-launch-saree-ethnic-wear-stores/articleshow/85964029.cms||John Sarkar

The latest death of a 60-year-old woman is also suspected to have been killed in a leopard attack in Vadgaon Patole village in Khed tehsil. Forest officials said that leopard population has increased in the last two decades. “The first leopard census is underway in our limits,” said Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar, which has eight range forest offices in Junnar, Ambegaon, Shirur and Khed tehsils. “These deaths have mostly taken place on farms and near people’s homes. So, we will have to take measures at these places to prevent attacks,” Gowda told TOI on Friday. “We have told villagers to construct compound walls, set up proper cattle sheds and avoid visiting farms at night. Also, we have requested the MSEDCL to supply electricity to motor pumps during the day so that farmers do not have to water the crops at night,” he added. Altogether 9,455 domestic animals have been killed by leopards during this period. Also, stray dogs and chickens have fallen prey to big cats, said forest officials. “We have given compensation of Rs1.44crore ,” said Gowda. To reduce attacks by female leopards, the division has been reuniting the mother with her cubs. “Since January, we have reunited 16 cubs with their mothers,” said a range forest officer. Wildlife experts said ‘hyperlocal’ reach is necessary to mitigate the conflict and create awareness.Vidya Atherya, an ecologist, who has worked extensively in Junnar and carried out a study on human-leopard conflict, said, “ Leopard attacks have reduced compared to the period between 2000 and 2005 . The efforts by the forest department have helped. However, leopards are around and will remain so. We need a strategy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/33-killed-in-leopard-attacks-in-2-decades/articleshow/85959621.cms||Sandip Dighe

The CM invited Shetti and two other representatives to attend the meeting at Varsha bungalow, the official residence of the CM in Mumbai, at 3 pm on Monday. The invitation came after thousands of farmers marching with Shetti reached Narsinhawadi, the confluence point of the Panchaganga and Krishna rivers. It is also one of the severely flood-affected towns in Kolhapur district. After floods, Thackeray had also started his tour of the affected areas from Narsinhawadi. Shetti said: “Our main demands are: compensation as per the policy adopted by the government after the 2019 floods; loan waiver for the flood-hit farmers as they have no crops left to sell and repay the loans; and a permanent solution to the floods in the Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The CM has requested us to attend the discussion and we are ready to do that.” Some Shetti supporters jump into water, rescued After the farmers’ march reached Narsinhawadi on Sunday, a few of Shetti’s supporters jumped into the river. However, they were brought out of the water by rescuers. Anticipating a law and order situation, the Kolhapur police had deployed more than 500 personnel in the town and along the ghat areas. As many as seven rescue boats were positioned in the river to prevent Shetti and his supporters from taking ‘Jal Samadhi’. However, after the local administration met Shetti with the invitation from Thackeray, the farmers gathered at the Narsinhawadi bus stop. The Panchaganga Parikrama had started on September 1 from Prayag Chikali, where several rivers meet and form the Panchaganga. Prayag Chikali is the first village to get affected by the floods every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cm-invites-shetti-home-to-discuss-flood-hit-farmers-demands-today/articleshow/85955127.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to link new Farmer Producer Organisations to govt departments||LUCKNOW: Even as farmers, protesting against the new farm laws, held a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, the ruling BJP has hammered out a plan to expedite formation of new Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and getting them linked to various government departments under convergence mode. The step is being seen as an attempt to help the FPOs get direct benefits from the various government schemes. While UP at present has a little over 600 FPOs, the state government plans to set up another 200 more in the forthcoming months, top sources in the state government said. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said that scores of FPOs have already been engaged in various agro-marketing and other farm-related activities. “The department seeks to lend a further boost to the sector that would help the farming community as a whole,” he told TOI on Sunday. According to agriculture department officials, as many as 107 FPOs have been engaged in organic farming in 28 villages which have been taken up under the Namami Gange programme. Likewise, 300 FPOs have been working as farm machinery banks, 60 are engaged in seed processing and many have been roped into the conservation of cattle. Chaturvedi said that an FPO in Agra has, in fact, started its own mandi, for procuring farm produce directly from the farmers. The move to step up setting up of more FPOs is seen as an attempt to boost farmers’ income and rev up the agriculture sector amid the ongoing standoff between the farmers and the Centre. It was only in September last year when the UP government formulated the state FPO policy. Later, the agriculture department directed all the district authorities to set up FPOs in developmental blocks which do not have one. “A majority of FPOs have been lying defunct despite their formation a few years ago. We have only revived them and lent them the requisite support,” Chaturvedi said. The UP government's accentuation on the FPOs comes even as the ruling BJP attempts to assuage the resenting farmers who have also been seeking government attention towards sugarcane state advisory price (SAP) for sugar cane which has remained unchanged for the past three years. As a matter of fact, CM Yogi Adityanath has announced that the state government would effect a hike in SAP, a move that becomes imperative in the election year, sources said that the state government may seek to tread cautiously in a bid to avoid burdening of the sugar mills which are already facing a financial contraction in the wake of Corona pandemic. ------- BOX Need to understand farmers' pain: Varun While the Centre has been vehemently against revoking the new farm laws, BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi on Sunday lent covert support to farmers who had called a mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar. Lodging an appeal to understand the pain of farmers, Varun tweeted: “Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground." Varun has also tweeted a video, which seems to be of Kisan mahapanchayat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-link-new-fpos-to-govt-departments/articleshow/85961789.cms||Pankaj Shah

The Congress now has 9 zila parishads, having won five during panchayat polls in December last year. BJP had won 13 zila parishads and independents three at that time. While Congress had a clear majority in Dausa, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Sawai Madhopur zila parishads, the opposition BJP led in Sirohi zila parishad. However, in Bharatpur, no party had a clear majority with BJP winning 17 seats, Congress bagging 14, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) winning two and independents winning four seats. Though some Gehlot supporters believe that winning Jaipur and Jodhpur is a referendum on CM’s handling of Covid and his focus on pro-poor welfare programmes - amid the tussle between him and Sachin Pilot, and his dexterity in dilly-dallying the much-awaited expansion of his council of ministers, which is proving to be an irritant for the party high command - others believe it is too early to say so. “These are local body elections. They are fought on local issues and have local implications. Both parties try to portray these numbers as their own victory. The referendum on the Congress, in the larger context, will be seen in 2023,” said Jaipur-based political analyst Avinash Kalla. “If we look at history of elections, the party that is in power has the upper hand in local body polls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rural-poll-results-give-boost-to-cong-ahead-of-2023-test/articleshow/85961775.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

NMC has received a good response to the expression of interests (EoI) it had recently invited the private agencies to develop, finance, operate and maintain the Dadasaheb Phalke Memorial . A total of six private agencies have responded and submitted their concept to the NMC. Of them, two agencies have been shortlisted, who recently presented to municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav about the concept for the renovation. One of the two Mumbai-based agencies have made a plan to set up a partial film city at the memorial to boost film and serial shootings and provide employment to the locals. The agency has plans to start drama classes for local artists. Apart from this, the agency has also mooted an idea of organising an event, inviting celebrities for the event that will generate revenue, said NMC officials. Recreation centres will also be established there. Jadhav has asked the Mumbai-based agency to chalk out the exact plans about the use of every space of the memorial and how they are going to execute the project, and give a presentation in the next two-three weeks. When contacted, Jadhav said, “The condition of the memorial has deteriorated in the last few years and we are spending around Rs 2 crore for its maintenance. We want to renovate the memorial through a private agency on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. The memorial will be renovated without destroying the present structure there. The revenue generated through the project will be shared by both private agencies and the NMC.”  Constructed in 2001, the memorial dedicated to Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of the Indian cinema, has been in shambles for many years Initially, there was a good number of footfall of visitors at the memorial, but people have turned their back to the site for the past many years due to negligence by the NMC. Now, NMC has decided to renovate the memorial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-renovate-phalke-memorial/articleshow/85955126.cms||Tushar Pawar

Of these, 42 were from Ludhiana, 34 patients were of other districts of Punjab and nine were from other states and union territories. Most of the district cases were from urban areas (34), three from Sahnewal, one each from Sidhwan Bet, Sudhar, Koom Kalan, Hathur and Jagraon.On September 1, there were 69 cases.The data of health department shows that between August 26 and 31, as many as 14 cases were reported and between August 17 and 25, there were 18 cases. From July 30 to August 16, as many as 11 dengue cases were registered.The health department officials said the cases are expected to rise.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said, “We are taking steps to check breeding of mosquitoes that cause dengue. The recent rains gave favourable conditions, temperature and humidity to mosquitoes to breed.” A health department officer said, “The municipal corporation must conduct fogging in the city frequently to contain cases.” “In September, October and November, dengue cases may rise. There are ways to check it. The mosquito causing the disease flies at lower height and goes out in morning and comes inside houses in evening as it is attracted by light. So, one can open doors and windows in the morning so that the mosquitoes go out and close these spaces in the evening so that they don’t return. Also, it is important to ensure that water doesn’t get accumulated in containers, especially in coolers, tyres, among others. The authorities, too, should ensure fogging is conducted across the district,” said Dr Daljeet Singh, former principal of DMCH. On September 4 evening, the number of suspected cases reported from Ludhiana was 728, of which 680 were from the district.The 34 cases reported from urban areas were from Model Town, Ferozepur Road, Ashapuri, Civil Lines, Rani Jhansi Road, Kailash Chowk, Chander Nagar, Bhamia Road, Janta Nagar, Kundanpuri, Sua Road, Dhandari Railway Station, Basant City, Jahangir Road, Sant Nagar, Rajguru Nagar , BRS Nagar, Gurdev Nagar and Basti Jodhewal.The 34 cases from other districts were from Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Moga, Jalandhar, SBS Nagar, Mansa, Faridkot, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot and Patiala districts.

On Saturday, a youth from Kochi died in Kundara Chola waterfall. In December, a youth from Ottapalam died and another was seriously injured at Seetharkundu viewpoint. In January, two tourists from Tamil Nadu drowned in the Karapara river near Vannathi bridge. Once tourists cross Pothundy forest checkpost, in the 20km route to Kaikatti junction, there is no monitoring of their movements. Some tourists venture into the numerous waterfalls formed due to heavy rains. The forest department has put up sign boards in dangerous zones, but most tourists ignore it. The tourists also chase wild animals along the road, provoking the animals to attack them. Since Nelliyampathy is a forest area, the forest department does not allow the tourism department or the district tourism promotion council (DTPC) to make arrangements for safety and regulation.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nelliyampathy-lacks-tourist-safety-checks/articleshow/85959683.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Shortage of platelets in blood banks as dengue cases increase||KOLHAPUR: Rise in dengue cases along with increase in vaccination of those belonging to the 18 to 44 years age group has led to shortage of platelets in the Kolhapur-based blood banks. The administration has now appealed to the youths to turn up for blood donation before getting vaccinated as after getting either of the jabs, the beneficiary cannot donate blood for two weeks. Authorities also claimed that erratic weather conditions have led to rise in viral diseases mainly dengue. Prakash Ghunghurkar, president of Kolhapur Blood Banks Association, said, “Every day large number of enquiries are being placed with blood banks by relatives of the patients as well as hospitals for platelets. Before vaccination for 18 to 44 years age group started we had appealed to the youths to turn up in large number, which they did not. The platelets extracted from the blood have a shelf life of just 5 days and therefore it is necessary for banks to replenish the stock.” The blood banks have now appealed the authorities to step in as early as possible and conduct blood donation camps. The platelets are extracted directly from the body of the donor by high-end technology which is costly and also by centrifugation from the blood donated by the donor which is cheaper. The relatives also demand platelets of the donors with same blood group as that of the patient despite the fact that the blood group doesn’t matter for platelet therapy. The platelet therapy is effective in early days of dengue infection and therefore testing after early signs is key to quick recovery. Amol Mane, medical officer of KMC, said, “We have started a drive to destroy the breeding grounds of dengue spreading mosquitoes. We have started door-to-door survey to find dengue suspects. They are being tested for early detection. We have intensified fogging in the areas where cases are reported in large numbers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-shortage-of-platelets-as-dengue-cases-increase/articleshow/85955175.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Airport-New Garia Metro crosses a hurdle near Baghajatin bridge||Kolkata: One of the two yawning gaps along the viaduct corridor at the New Garia-Ruby stretch of the New Garia-Airport Metro alignment was bridged on Saturday and Sunday. The gap between two piers (P-14 and P-15) near the Baghajatin bridge could not be bridged for a long time, thus stalling the project, and it could be done after the relocation of occupants with the help of the local authorities. Officials of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Railway PSU — the executing agency for most of the Metro projects in the city — heaved a sigh of relief with the bridging of the crucial gap, which prevented the viaduct from having a continuous run along this 5km stretch with five stations of the 32km long New Garia-Airport alignment. It is set to change the travel patterns of people from the southern fringes of the city to Sector V and New Town and the airport. With the bridging of this gap, only one more gap remains — a 160 meter one over the canal at Kalikapur. The work for diversion of the canal to construct the the pier is over. A 50 meter composite steel girder will be laid to accelerate the completion of the viaduct as the stretch is slated to be commissioned by early 2022. The discontinuities between New Garia (Kabi Subhash) and Kalikapur (Kabi Sukanta) between pier 12 and 19 have been delaying the project. Unless there is a continuity in the viaduct, all the major tasks like laying lines, bringing electricity and placing signalling and telecommunication equipment remain pending with inevitable consequence of time and cost-overrun, said another RVNL official. The New Garia-Airport Metro corridor project has gathered momentum with Rahee Infratech bagging the contract to supply and install ballastless tracks along the Nicco Park-Titumir section. RVNL was laying tracks along the Ruby-Kavi Subhas section. In July 2020, Rahee had started the track installation work for the first 6.5km stretch (New Garia to VIP Bazar). The third rail is also being installed along the 5km stretch for the 32km Line 6 that will link New Garia with the airport. Linxon India has started installing the 750 V third rail electrification system between Ruby crossing and Kavi Subhas station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-new-garia-metro-crosses-a-hurdle-near-baghajatin-bridge/articleshow/85959667.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Balasaheb Bajare, the secretary of the Pimpalgaon APMC, said there has been a huge rise in supply. However, the demand has not kept up. As a result, there has been a further drop in the average wholesale price. The situation will continue to remain the same for at least the next few days, he said. Currently, around 3 lakh crates of tomatoes have been coming into the markets across Nashik district every day. Out of the 3 lakh crates, more than 2.25 lakh crates come into the Pimpalgaon APMC alone. Each crate contains around 20 kg of the produce. “There has been good production of tomatoes this year, but the demand in the domestic market is comparatively low. Moreover, the quality is not very good. All these factors have had an impact on the wholesale prices,” Bajare said. The minimum and maximum wholesale prices of tomatoes have been recorded at Rs 2.55 per kg and Rs 7.5 per kg, respectively, while the average wholesale price was Rs 2.5 per kg. The farmers are still dumping the produce to protest against the crash in prices. The Centre has already sent a letter to the state government, asking it to utilise the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for the benefit of the tomato farmers, but the state government is yet to take a call on the matter. According to sources in the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB), it is a policy decision to be taken by the state government. Uttam Avhad, a tomato farmer, said he has incurred heavy losses. “We should get at least Rs 13 per kg to make production and transportation viable. But I had to dump the produce on the market premises as I was getting only Rs 2 per kg a few days ago. I was not even able to pay the transport costs,” he said. Ajit Navale, the general secretary of the All-India Kisan Sabha (AIMS), said “Tomato farmers are going through a bad phase. Both the central and state governments have not taken any cognizance of this and have not made efforts to provide relief to the farmers.” “We had sought the immediate relief of Rs 50,000 per acre for the tomato farmers, but the Centre and the state have ignored our demand. The entire tomato season has been a waste. The Centre should have made efforts to remove the obstacles in the export of tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. But that has not happened,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/wholesale-tomato-price-crashes-to-rs-2-5/kg-at-pimpalgaon-apmc/articleshow/85955163.cms||Tushar Pawar

The Rs 758-crore scam had come to light in September 2010. ED had lodged a case on September 30, 2013, to probe money laundering. It invoked Section 44 (1) (c) of PMLA, which states that if a court that has taken cognisance of the offence is other than the special court, it will commit the case on receipt of an application from ED. ED’s counsel had told the special judge in Alibaug the accused had diverted investors’ funds illegally through bogus, forged and fake loan accounts to acquire immovable properties worth Rs 270 crore, so it should be tried under PMLA. Special public prosecutor Vaibhav Bhole said, “It was jointly decided to try the case in a PMLA court. Hence, no objection was made. The order was thus passed. ED has attached the properties.”The around 40 accused include Shishir Dharkar, then bank chairman, Prem Kumar Sharma, expert director and board of directors. The bank had 18 branches, including three in Mumbai.  It had nearly 2 lakh depositors and 42,000 shareholders. Part of the fraud money was allegedly used to purchase land around Navi Mumbai international airport in Panvel, Pen, Roha and Sudhagad Pali talukas of Raigad district, and Dubal too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pen-co-op-bank-scam-case-committed-to-pmla-court-by-spl-judge-after-ed-plea/articleshow/85962996.cms||Umesh K Parida

The services of the contractual employees, who served patients in the Covid facility during the peaks of both Covid waves, were to be terminated by August 31, after the funds for the same were stopped. But now they have got an extension. “The 255 employees — comprising ward boys, doctors and others — recruited temporarily have got an extension till November-end. This is good news considering the third wave, that is being expected in September,” said Dr Jeetendra Dhaneshwar, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation-run Bytco Hospital. The 1,000-bed Bytco hospital has served more than 10,000 patients during Covid so far and the employees recruited on a contractual basis have treated these patients. “The staff is involved in Covid treatment and vaccination, both of which are very important considering the third wave of Covid as warned by the experts. The retention of the employees will ensure our preparedness to take on the infection from day one if and when the third wave strikes,” Dhaneshwar said. After the National Health Mission (NHM) funds from the central government dried down, NMC faced the issue of payment for these employees. The employees raised this issue with district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who directed the NMC to take up it with the state government and resolve it at the earliest. The NMC has now earmarked funds for the salary of the employees and accordingly they will continue to serve the corporation at least till the end of November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/255-contract-employees-at-bytco-hosp-get-extension/articleshow/85955226.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Trader’s body found 3 days after mishap||JAIPUR: Three days after a car plunged into a nullah in Ambabari, the driver’s body was fished out by civil defence teams on Sunday. Shastri Nagar police identified the deceased as Prashant Panwar (26), a resident of Vishwakarma colony. He ran a successful tour and travel business in the city and was heading home in his newly purchased car on Thursday late night when it plunged into the nullah. There are no railings or barrier walls on either side of the road also known locally as Ambabari Puliya. SHO Dilip Singh said some stray dogs had come before Panwar’s vehicle due to which he veered off the road and fell into the nullah. Panwar tried to escape from the sinking vehicle by breaking its windows. “He leapt out of the vehicle but could not save himself and got stuck in the muck,” added Raj Krishan, a cop who was part of the rescue team. According to police, the incident took place shortly before Thursday midnight. The submerged car was discovered on Friday. Local administration summoned civil defence and disaster relief teams to the spot to undertake the search operation. “For the past three days, we had been hoping that he would be found alive. We thought that he had managed to escape from the vehicle. We were shocked when his body was found,” said Panwar’s friend Sumit Singh. The deceased’s friends and relatives told TOI that Panwar had gone to a friend’s house in Jhotwara to book tickets for his customers. “Barely a few minutes before the accident, he had spoken to his father to inform him that he was on his way home,” said Umesh Sharma, a friend of the deceased. Panwar got engaged in April this year. His wedding was scheduled for December 11. “He was busy in his wedding preparations and handling business,” Singh said. Relatives said they had not informed Panwar’s elderly parents about his death immediately, because the entire family was hopeful that he would be found alive somehow. “He was very hardworking. He had told his father to retire because he was making good money and could take care of the family. He had organised his elder sister’s wedding all by himself,” Sharma said. While relatives and friends praised the rescue operation, they lamented the fact that local administration had turned a blind eye to the sorry state of affairs of the road. “There are no proper street lights, and the entire nullah is infested with water plants, it was an avoidable death. The city administration always waits for a tragedy to occur before they wake up,” said a relative. The deceased’s post-mortem was conducted at the Kanwatia hospital on Sunday. Several relatives, neighbours and friends gathered outside the mortuary. “ Prashant’s family is still in disbelief. We don’t know how they will react to the news,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/traders-body-found-3-days-after-mishap/articleshow/85961844.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mask norm violation in Kolkata markets: 1,842 booked last weekend||KOLKATA: Cops have prosecuted 1,842 people in the city last weekend for not wearing masks properly. About 80% of these special checks have taken place outside the city’s major markets and malls that are now witnessing a steady footfall of shoppers with the festival season barely a month away. The total number of prosecutions, claimed Lalbazar, is one of the highest since May when the second Covid wave hit the city. According to the figures provided by Lalbazar, total 772 people were pulled up for not wearing masks properly on Friday. On Saturday, this number hovered around 759. Till noon on Sunday, 311 people without masks were prosecuted. Last month, cops had taken action against 220-260 people daily for not wearing masks properly. The number is more than three times that this weekend. “We found that even till July, people at least had the masks near their chins. But at the beginning of August, we found it missing completely. We have targeted a few places, where there are regular aberrations. This includes the markets and malls, where we are conducting special drives because of the pre-Puja weekend,” said an officer. A visit to the city’s main markets also shows the prosecutions are unable to instil discipline in people to wear masks. Lalbazar is now banking on another round of intense campaign before the pujas, even as it has asked cops in certain pockets to step up prosecution. They are planning to using the popular Durga Puja video with the tagline — Ebar pujoy mask must, mathai rakhun safety first — from last year. At New Market, cops have discontinued arresting the violators and bringing them to the police station. “There is a big crowd due to the festive season and we will continue with the drive. We are distributing masks and setting up kiosks to spread awareness among people,” said an officer. At Gariahat too, cops said they are relying more on campaigning than prosecutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mask-norm-violation-in-mkts-1842-booked-last-weekend/articleshow/85959693.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Jaipur||‘Haryana firm sought extension of 171 days’||Jaipur: City police investigating the murder of NHAI (National Highway Authority of India) project consultant Rajinder Kumar Chawla (64) said chief accused Karandeep Sheoran’s company had sought an extension of nearly 171 days to complete construction of the initial stages of the 14 FOBs (foot overbridges). The slain consultant, however, had some reservations in allowing EoT (Extention of Time) of 171 days, following which a meeting was scheduled in Jaipur on August 26. Additional DCP (west) Ram Singh said as per rules, a penalty of 10 per cent of the project cost amounting to Rs 35 crore was levied on Sheoran’s company for delay. Even before the meeting, the four accused including Sheoran (29), Naveen Bisla, Vikas Singh (33) and Amit Nehra (26), plotted to eliminate Chawla, cops added. Police said they got whiff of the conspiracy in the hospital itself. According to Singh, a local representative of Chawla’s company had ferried the consultant to SMS Hospital in a cab, which was hired by Sheoran’s company to bring his two engineers to Jaipur for the meeting. Vikas later left Jaipur and went to Chandigarh via Gurgaon. Police said this raised suspicion as to why Vikas was in hurry to leave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/haryana-firm-sought-extension-of-171-days/articleshow/85961877.cms||---

The health officials said during the 30-day period, Nashik district witnessed 15 new cases of mucormycosis while 39 patients recovered from the infection and three people succumbed to it. The number of recovered patients has increased from 613 to 652. According to Dr Prashant Khaire, the resident medical officer (outreach), the number of mucormycosis cases is reducing steadily and hence the active cases that hovered around 300 at one point of time, has now dropped to 28. “This is a satisfactory figure and the major reason behind this is the drop in Covid cases. The patients – mostly with comorbidities – suffering from Covid are likely to catch this infection during or after the treatment. Since the number of critical Covid patients has reduced, the number of patients infected by mucormycosis has also dropped,” the officer said. A total of 498 mucormycosis patients underwent major surgeries. The surgeries include removal of eyes or a nasal portion, after being heavily infected by mucormycosis. The number of patients undergoing treatment within the limits of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has dropped from 36 to 18 while the numbers of patients taking treatment in Nashik rural has dropped from 19 to 10. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has welcomed the drop in cases but asked the people to be very careful. “Citizens should be very careful against any spike in cases and ensure protection against Covid,” he said on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-mucormycosis-case-tally-drops-to-28-in-one-month/articleshow/85955279.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The police have arrested the youth, who took the Ludhiana girl along on the pretext of marriage, and his friend for helping him.Cops said, “The main accused is 17-year-old and his friend, a resident of Ghaziabad, is 22-year-old. We are adding Section 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) to the case. The medical examination of the girl will ascertain if she was sexually assaulted or not.”After the girl went missing, her family lodged a complaint with the police and it was found that a neighbour had abducted her on the pretext of marriage.Investigating officer sub-inspector Jaswinder Singh said, “We had the mobile number of the accused, but he had switched it off. His call details showed he had called up his relative in Uttar Pradesh. A police team reached there on August 31 and the relative told them that the accused had called her, saying he had come to Uttar Pradesh in search of work. The relative asked him to contact her acquaintance in Ghaziabad. The police team then reached Ghaziabad.”“There, we saw him in a CCTV footage withdrawing cash from an ATM kiosk of Indirapuram and using debit card at a filling station in the same locality. The Ghaziabad man was also with him. So, we were sure that the accused was in Indirapuram. After we got the location of the Ghaziabad man, we reached Indirapuram,” he added.Inspector Surinder Chopra said, “When the police reached at the location in Indirapuram, the girl and both the accused were there. There are chances that the girl was sexually assaulted. However, it will be ascertained after her medical examination. Thereafter, more sections might be added to the FIR.”The parents of the girl alleged that the accused had been harassing their daughter for some time. They had warned him, but he continued to chase her. A case was then registered under Section 366-A (procuration of minor girl) against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/13-year-old-missing-girl-traced-to-ghaziabad/articleshow/85957353.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Mumbai||BMC to scrap Rs 2 crore per year contract to agency to handle its social media accounts||MUMBAI: After flak for the cost of Rs 2-crore a year contract for managing its social media accounts, BMC said it will scrap its present social media management contract and appoint a new agency by floating fresh tenders. BMC said it has begun drafting a fresh tender. Despite dwindling revenue, BMC awarded a contract worth Rs 5.9 crore to S2 Infotech to manage its 34 Twitter handles from July 2019 to July 2022, without inviting tenders. MLAs and corporators had slammed BMC for spending around Rs 2 crore on Twitter and alleged that there was no technical analysis to gauge the reach and impact of @mybmc, and the 34 other official BMC handles, many of which are unverified. “The three-year contract was given under section 72 (3) of Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act through the state-run Maharashtra IT Corporation to an empanelled agency. The IT department appointed a consultant to gauge the current scope of work along with public relations department. Based on this and human resource requirements, estimates are being prepared for a one-year contract,” deputy municipal commissioner (disaster management) Prabhat Rahangdale said in a written reply to MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh. “Once a new contractor is appointed the existing contract will be closed before its period ends. BMC has so far paid Rs 2.85 crore to Maha IT Corporation for work from July 2019 to February 2021,” Rahangdale stated. While Mumbai Police, one of the first government agencies to join Twitter to address citizens’ grievances, has only one Twitter account, @MumbaiPolice, BMC set up 34 handles, which increased costs and led to confusion, said Shaikh. Corporators and citizens groups said having so many unverified handles creates confusion and poses a security threat, as many fake handles have been set up. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said BMC must have only one handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-scrap-rs-2-crore-per-year-contract-to-agency-to-handle-its-social-media-accounts/articleshow/85962998.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: SMS doctors replant bone of teen after removing cancer||JAIPUR: In a rare surgery, Sawai Man Singh Hospital’s orthopedicians removed one of the femur bones from a 14-year-old boy, sent it for high-dose radiotherapy since it contained a malignant tumour, and returned it to the operation theatre where doctors re-implanted it after getting rid of the sarcoma from the bone within minutes. “The technique is known as extra corporeal radiotherapy and re-implantation (ECRR). It was a six-hour-long surgery, which started at 8.30am. The surgery was done under Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana,” said Dr DS Meena, unit head and senior professor (orthopedics), SMS Medical College. The bone was removed and sent for radiotherapy because the high dose would have been harmful if it was given to the teen. Ewing’s sarcoma is rare and one case in 10 lakh population is generally reported. “The boy belongs to a poor family and his father works as a labourer.The cost of the treatment for Ewing’s sarcoma must be Rs 3 lakh to Rs 4 lakh in other hospitals but under Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana, he got it for free,” said Dr Rajkumar Harshwal, associate professor (orthopedics), SMS Hospital, who performed the surgery. It is the third such surgery done with ECRR technique in SMS Medical College, the first being done in January 2016. “We had three options, one was replacing the sarcoma bone with a metallic implant. Second was bringing an allograft from bone bank in Mumbai and implant it in place of sarcoma bone. Since allograft is a bone of a human, there are chances of its rejection. The third was to perform ECRR. Since the first two ECRR done in the hospital were successful, we decided to do it,” said Dr Harshwal. ECRR is a complicated technique as it requires coordinated efforts of radiologists, anesthesia specialists and orthopedicians. Doctors found that 60% of the femur bone was involved by Ewing’s sarcoma. The length of the cancerous part of the bone was 20 cm. The doctors harvested the bone and provided chemical treatment to clean it and sent it to radiotherapy department. Dr Sandeep Jain, unit head of radiotherapy department, ensured that the bone was provided with radiotherapy and returned to the operation theatre in 10 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sms-docs-replant-bone-of-teen-after-removing-cancer/articleshow/85961904.cms||---

The main complaint was lodged by a married woman. The accused has been identified as Md Sameer (20), a resident of Ibrahim Road. Police sources said that during questioning, the youth claimed to have sent these messages to only those women who liked his profile. This made him think that he had already “befriended” them and that these women had a “liking” for him. “We have received a written complaint from a woman’s father, a resident of Ekbalpore, that his daughter was sent some obscene messages between 1am and 1.30am. They were purportedly sent to her by the youth, as the complainant alleged. This was immediately objected to by the woman and her husband. The accused thereafter sent filthy voice messages that outraged the modesty of the complainant's daughter. A specific case under IPC 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) was registered at the local police station. The accused was arrested on Saturday and the mobile phone used by him for the crime was also seized,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-held-for-sending-vulgar-messages-on-instagram/articleshow/85959714.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Bhujbal, who is also Nashik district guardian minister, reviewed the Covid situation at his home constituency, Yeola, on Sunday. He asked the officials to ensure all care be taken for early detection of Covid patients He stressed on vaccination during the forthcoming Ganeshotsav and the third wave of Covid, if and when it strikes. “Vaccination is the best tool to take on the infection as it helps in cutting down the mortality rate. The health department should conduct vaccination on ‘camp’ mode during the Ganeshotsav and even if the cases start rising. This will help us in minimising mortality,” he said. The number of active cases has been hovering at around 40 for the past month in Yeola taluka even though the number has declined in other parts of the district. “It is important that the number of cases reduces. But that should be the result of testing, tracing and treating all patients. The hospitals should also ensure to cut down on visitors so that the spread, if any, is brought under control,” said Bhujbal. He has also asked the health and other officials to coordinate and find out the reason for the number of Covid cases not declining. Oxygen generation plant has been set up at Yeola sub-district hospital and liquid medical oxygen (LMO) with 13,000 litre capacity has also been set up. This should be commissioned at the earliest, he said. The minister also asked the police authorities to ensure Ganeshotsav was celebrated peacefully and overcrowding is avoided at all times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-stresses-on-vaccination-in-yeola/articleshow/85955334.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Senior police officials said that one of the key accused Mohammad Umar visited Bharuch several times over the last two years for conducting the meetings. “Bharuch was an epicentre for planning the protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and Shaheenbaug protests. Md Umar and Vadodara resident Salahuddin Sheikh conspired to help the accused in Delhi riots during their meetings in Ankleshwar,” a senior police official said. Investigating officials said that a businessman from the UK had sent Rs 60 crore to Sheikh via Dubai. “This businessman is originally from Nabipur village in Bharuch and hence has a lot of contacts there. So, the meetings to launder hawala money and fund protests were mostly held in Bharuch. The UK-based businessman had organized community meetings there to raise the money,” an investigating official told TOI. “We have got evidence of how a huge portion of the hawala money and even legal donations that Sheikh received were illegally diverted for funding these agitations and financing costs including food expenses of Shaheenbaug protestors,” the official said. The hawala money was sent from Dubai to Mumbai to escape attention of Delhi-based agencies. This money was then routed to Delhi and Gujarat. “Once we get custody of Salahuddin Sheikh and Md Umar, we will get complete details of their contacts in Bharuch. Many more arrests will follow,” the police added. Accused of funding conversion activities across the country, Sheikh had allegedly received nearly Rs 60 crore through hawala and Rs 19 crore by donation for his trust over the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/delhis-anti-caa-protests-conspired-in-bharuch-cops/articleshow/85957908.cms||Tushar Tere

The Nashik Mahanagar Ganeshotsav Mahamandal, led by Sameer Shete, has decided to stick to the norms considering the possibility of the third Covid wave. “We have assured police commissioner Deepak Pandey that we will not take out processions on the days of ‘aagaman’ (arrival) and ‘visarjan’ (immersion). At the same time, we will ensure there is no crowding at the mandals,” said Shete. The mahamandal has asked all its members to stick to government norms including height of idols, numbers of people visiting the mandal at a time, the availability of masks and hand sanitisers at every venue. The Mahamandal have also asked the mandals to ensure that they do not call celebrities for the ‘aarti’ performed every day. “The local civic body elections are due and, therefore, there will be many elements who may be interested in canvassing for themselves or for their leaders. The mandals have been advised against calling the big-shots at of their venues, especially when the presence of such celebrities may lead to crowding,” Shete pointed out. Shete has requested the commissioner of police to arrange for a ‘single window’ system so that there is no harassment of the mandals in seeking the permissions for the celebration. “The mandals have to run from one office to another to get permissions. After the permission from the police, they have to get the NoC from the corporation, then from the fire brigade. After that they seek electrical connections etc. A single window will ensure a hassle-free process,” Shete said. Shete also added that the mandals have been asked to carry out the ‘helmet awareness’ drive in the city so that the people understand the message of personal safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ganesh-mandals-to-follow-govt-norms-during-celebrations/articleshow/85955365.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The chief guest was BCCI secretary Jay Shah and vice-president Rajeev Shukla who felicitated various coaches, players, administrators and all those who contribute in running the game in the hill state. While addressing the gathering, Shah said that soon they will make CAU an 'aatmanirbhar' cricket association. "Our country is doing well in several sports. Whether it is the recent win at the Lords or Olympic contingent winning seven medals for the first time ever. We are taking forward PM Modi's request of using the revenue generated from cricket in other sports as well. Therefore, we have built facilities for other sports at the Ahmedabad cricket stadium." Shah added, "Uttarakhand finally got it's own cricket association after a 19-year wait, and I purposely took the responsibility of becoming the in-charge of overseeing the running of cricket in Uttarakhand. Currently, Uttarakhand doesn't have it's own stadium, but soon it will get one along with some assistance from CAU secretary Mahim Verma. With it's own stadium and other assets as well, CAU will become aatmanirbhar." Meanwhile, Shukla said, "No association, I am aware of, conducts 55,000 matches every year. Our BCCI secretary Jay Shah is doing a lot for the state association. He has done a lot for Gujarat Cricket like Home Minister Amit Shah and PM Modi have done before Jay Shah took charge." Several players, coaches and office-bearers were felicitated. Coach of Ekta Bisht and Shweta Verma, Liyaqat Ali was given the award. Also, PC Verma was given the lifetime award for making immense contributions for uplifting the sport in Uttarakhand. Players from both state men's and women's teams, who had performed well last season were felicitated, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cau-holds-annual-awards-for-state-cricketers/articleshow/85957411.cms||Mohammad Anab

We will ask the offenders to go through a lecture organised by the counselors on safety measures before they get their two-wheelers back,” said Sitaram Gaikwad, the assistant commissioner of police (traffic). Starting September 9, flying squads of the city police will ensure that all helmetless riders are stopped at the nakabandis and their vehicles are seized. There will be more than 15 nakabandis in the city. The motorists would then be taken to Nashik First training centre, where experts will guide them on road safety in a two-hour session. “Only after producing the certificate of two-hour counselling will the riders get back the vehicles,” Gaikwad said. On August 15, the Nashik city police launched a special No Helmet No Petrol drive. After the first few days, people started coming to the fuel pumps with helmets. However, the cops have observed that while more than 90% of the motorists coming to fuel pumps wore helmets, only 50% on the roads had the safety headgear. “People often fill more fuel in the tank to reduce visits to the petrol pumps to avoid carrying a helmet every day,” said Sanjay Patil, a traffic cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-2-hr-counselling-for-helmetless-riders-in-city/articleshow/85955377.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Days after CM Uddhav Thackeray extended support to assistant municipal commissioner Kalpita Pimpale, Mhaske informed that a proposal was being readied and will be presented before the Thane House soon for recommending a fast track trial in the case. “We want to ensure the accused is punished and also that it sets a deterrent for others,” said Mhaske. The Thane police probing the case said the accused was produced before the court on Saturday and was remanded in judicial custody. “The accused is a migrant settled in city for the last few years and has no criminal history,” said a senior police official. Meanwhile, following suspension of the clerk at the Naupada-Kopri ward for his nexus with few hawkers, the administration is likely to probe deeper within its departments to weed out any moles. It may be noted the administration has faced flak in the past after activists have alleged an unholy nexus between few officials and hawkers as vendors would often vanish ahead of drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-thane-hawker-assault-trial-may-be-fast-tracked/articleshow/85963015.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: ‘Kidnap’ case unearths gold smuggling racket||VIJAYAWADA: In an interesting turn of events, a woman who claimed to be a kidnap victim turned out to be the brains behind a gold smuggling and cheating racket here. PS Nagamani cheated people, mostly employees of railways, to the tune of Rs 7 crore. According to sources in police department, the number of victims is likely to increase. Meanwhile, most of the victims are not coming forward and lodge complaint as they dealt with unaccounted money. Nagamani lodged a complaint against two railway ticket inspectors alleging that they kidnapped her about four days ago. Acting on her complaint, police launched an investigation. But the plot was exposed when the ticket inspectors were questioned by the police. According to sources, Nagamani is in a relationship with one Venkateswara Rao working as chief ticket inspector (CTI) in Vijayawada railway division. She lured people, mostly employees of railways, offering them Rs 5 lakh worth gold for just Rs 4 lakh. She assured them of returning Rs 5 lakh if she could not deliver gold a month after the payment. Nagamani gained the trust of the victims by claiming that she has connections in Saudi Arabia and routes gold from there via Singapore. She even delivered gold to some of them but from the past four months, she neither gave gold nor returned money. Recently, two of the railway employees who gave money to Nagamani demanded their money back. There was a heated exchange of words between them. Later, Nagamani lodged a complaint against the employees alleging that they kidnapped her in a bid to escape from paying the money. However, the police investigation revealed the entire story behind the complaint. As the news broke, more victims started to approach police alleging she has also cheated them after promising gold. Police are also examining the role of Venkateswara Rao and one A Raghavendra Rao both employees of railways in the scam. According to sources, Rao visited Qatar in 2018 along with the Indian sports team as part of Asian Games. He allegedly established some contacts for gold smuggling and started working with Nagamani and Venkateswara Rao. The trio have been running the racket since 2018 and have done several transactions, said sources. M Venkateswarlu, Vijayawada south ACP, said they are still investigating the case to find out all the victims and the amount involved in the scam. Nagamani’s Saudi connections are also being probed, he said. No arrest has been made yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/kidnap-case-unearths-gold-smuggling-racket/articleshow/85959775.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||T must help us get back jobs & pay: Pvt teachers||Hyderabad: On Teachers’ Day, private schools’ teachers came out with a fervent plea to the state government to help them financially as many lost and most had to work with no pay or reduced salary in the last over a year. Teachers said that now most school managements expected them to join back with no assurance on pending dues or commitment on full salaries this year. The pandemic even led to at least 43 teachers dying during the last 18 months, with 35 being suicides, the Telangana Private Teachers’s Forum (TPTF) said. Stressing that the state must support them amid this crisis as they worked equally hard as government teachers, TPTF president Shabir Ali said: “While government teachers are being felicitated on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, we are struggling even for basics. There is no recognition or job security for us despite private teachers teaching more than 50% of students in the state.” He said that the state should announce ex gratia for the families of private teachers who lost their lives during the pandemic. “All these deaths are because of the financial crisis,” said Ali, adding that many teachers had to take up odd jobs for survival as most managements did not even bother to check on them. Of the total 52.85 lakh students in Telangana, over 31.91 lakh students are in private schools. In all, there are over 10,000 private schools in which more than 3 lakh teachers were employed until schools shut down last year. According to TPTF, hardly 50,000 teachers have rejoined as managements were unwilling to give any assurance on salaries. The teachers have now demanded that the state should ensure that they were paid their pending salaries and management be directed to rehire those who were sacked amid the pandemic. “The managements are not even talking about our pending salaries. They are expecting us to forgo everything and join back,” said Bhaskar R, a private teacher, adding that they should be given assurance that they would be paid full salaries this academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-must-help-us-get-back-jobs-pay-pvt-teachers/articleshow/85963000.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Managements said that apart from aiding students who are not ready to attend physical classes, sharing the live stream will increase transparency and also keeps a tab on corporal punishment. “Most of the schools have opted for the hybrid model so that they can cater to students studying in online and offline mode at the same time,” said B Shiva, a mathematics teacher working in a well-known group of schools in the city. He said that this mode will also help in completing the syllabus as they need not alternate between online and offline classes. Teachers said that staff scarcity is one of the reasons why managements are opting for the hybrid model. While few said that students, especially those attending classes remotely, are finding it hard to follow the concepts in the hybrid model, others pointed out that hybrid classes are better than digital classes. “When a student is unable to physically attend class, livestreaming is the best option as they get to learn from the subject teacher and interact with other students and teacher,” said M Ravindar, a government teacher.Private budget school managements, meanwhile, said that they too are going to opt for a hybrid model instead of app-based teaching. “Schools which have resumed physical classes have already shifted to the hybrid model. Remaining schools will make the shift once they start offline classes,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association adding that about 50% of budget schools are yet to reopen schools. Managements said that apart from aiding students who are not ready to attend physical classes, sharing the live stream will increase transparency||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-take-middle-path-stream-classes-live-for-students-at-home/articleshow/85963001.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Meerut||UP kisan mahapanchayat, attended by over a lakh, calls for Bharat bandh on September 27||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Farmers in large numbers converged on the Government Inter College Ground at Muzaffarnagar for the mahapanchayat on Sunday. While the district administration estimated a turnout of 1 lakh, the unions said 10 lakh had arrived in the city over 24 hours for the “historic” meeting. “We have kicked off 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' from this stage. We will not let BJP win the upcoming elections,” said a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer organisations, which organised the mahapanchayat. “The Muzaffarnagar kisan mazdoor mahapanchayat will be remembered as a historic day and will prove to be a turning point in the Indian political landscape.” Farmers unions have called for a “Bharat bandh” on September 27. When TOI visited the grounds, which can hold a lakh, it was packed beyond capacity, with crowds spilling over onto the streets and even on the flyover next to the venue. Women and young farmers had turned up in huge numbers. Muzaffarnagar was a fortress where, SKM said, farmers from 16 states had arrived for the mahapanchayat. “Farmers won’t be polarised by communal politics. Let us chant Allah Hu Akbar and Har Har Mahadev together,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, sharing the stage with BKU national president Naresh Tikait, social activist Medha Patkar, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav and influential farmer leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola. A founding member of BKU, Jola had quit the organisation after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Announcing a farmer association for UP, like SKM, Tikait said it will “defeat the Yogi (Adityanath) government” in 2022. “They sold our rivers, our water. We will not let them sell our land … I will lay down my life if needed but will not leave the protest site until we emerge victorious,” he added. “The struggle for Independence went on for 90 years. I have no idea how long ours will continue.” A host of farmer leaders, each addressing the gathering for a minute or two, spoke from the dais. All of them said the protests would continue until the government promised a “legal guarantee of MSP.” Not even 20% of the promised procurement has been done, they said. While the state government had promised loan waivers for 86 lakh farmers, only 45 lakh had received it, they added. And the number of farmers in UP who got crop insurance dropped from 72 lakh in 2016-17 to 47 lakh in 2019-20, they further said. “We will not give up. The government cancelled two trains in which farmers from Ambala and Delhi were coming to Muzaffarnagar. They stopped our buses on the highway. They installed jammers so there could be no live coverage,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of BKU. The next meeting, the farmer leaders said, will be in Lucknow. “Yogi asked Tikait sahib to come to Lucknow,” a farmer leader said. “We have come up to Muzaffarnagar. We will soon be in Lucknow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/lakhs-of-farmers-from-16-states-gather-for-up-mahapanchayat/articleshow/85957514.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||2,600 children lost both their parents to Covid-19 in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has identified 2,600 child and 219 adult beneficiaries of the Mukhyamantri Vatsalya Yojana, launched to help state residents — below the age of 21 years — who were orphaned during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the preliminary data compiled by the state government, at least 2,600 children (below 18 years of age) have lost both their parents to Covid-19 in the state since the outbreak of the pandemic. Besides, 219 others, in the age group of 18-21 years, were orphaned during the pandemic. The latest data from the state women empowerment and child development department reveals that 1,706 children, who were orphaned during the pandemic, are being provided free education (till Class XII) and are being given a stipend of Rs 3,000 per month under the Mukhyamantri Vatsalya Yojana. “The data from hill districts suggests that fewer children lost their parents in that phase in comparison to the plains. However, our data collection process to identify these children is ongoing because we suspect that more children might need the state government’s support,” said Rekha Arya, women empowerment and child development minister of Uttarakhand. District-wise, the highest cases of children being orphaned during the pandemic surfaced from Dehradun (561), followed by Tehri (348), Pauri (313), Nainital (310), Haridwar (256), Udham Singh Nagar (242), Almora (177), Uttarkashi (164), Champawat (132), Rudraprayag (103), Pithoragarh (93), Bageshwar (73), and Chamoli (57). Based on available data, the state has started giving benefits of the scheme to 309 orphans from Dehradun, 270 from Nainital, 208 from Tehri, 154 from Haridwar, 141 from Udham Singh Nagar, 137 from Uttarkashi, 121 from Pauri, 85 from Champawat, 70 from Almora, 75 from Rudraprayag, 58 from Bageshwar, 50 from Pithoragarh, and 28 from Chamoli. Meanwhile, more applications to avail of the scheme are being scrutinised by respective district administrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2-6k-children-lost-both-their-parents-to-covid-19-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/85957477.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS’ focus shifts after civic polls disappointment||HYDERABAD: Against the backdrop of a resurgent BJP, the ruling TRS has decided to focus on strengthening the party in Greater Hyderabad and regain some of its lost ground in the state capital. After a good performance in 2016-GHMC polls—which saw TRS sweeping 99 out of the total 150 divisions—and emerging victorious in 14 of the 24 constituencies in the city in 2018-Assembly elections, the graph of the ruling party has been on the decline in Greater Hyderabad. The TRS failed to win Secunderabad and Malkajgiri constituencies in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In fact, the TRS has never won the two parliamentary constituencies despite the fact that these two constituencies comprise a major geographical area and voters of Greater Hyderabad. Another major Parliamentary seat of Hyderabad was regained by TRS’ friendly party AIMIM. The only solace for the TRS was that it moved to second place in 2019 parliamentary elections from the fourth place it ended up in 2014-Lok Sabha polls in Secunderabad constituency. In Malkajgiri, the TRS continued to end up second place in both 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections. But what hit the ruling party badly was its below par performance in the elections held to 150 wards of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in 2020. Despite TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself participating in the campaign by addressing a public meeting, the pink party managed to win only 55 of the total 150 divisions in GHMC. A resurgent BJP won 48 seats, a tally which was reduced to 47 later after it lost the Lingojiguda by-poll to the Congress. With TRS supremo and CM KCR having decided to restructure the party from village to the state level, TRS working president and municipal minister KT Rama Rao has shifted his focus on strengthening the party right from the slum and basthi level to the division and Assembly constituency level in Greater Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-focus-shifts-after-civic-polls-disappointment/articleshow/85963012.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC finds 20-year-old US citizen alert, rejects parents’ plea for evaluation||MUMBAI: Bombay high court dismissed a couple’s petition which sought directions for a health expert’s evaluation to “safeguard the interest and mental health” of their child, an over 20-year-old US citizen who came to India to study in 2019 and has been here since. The parents, also permanent US inhabitants but currently in the city, had invoked the high court’s plenary powers and the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 for a writ of habeas corpus to produce ‘S’ (name given by HC to the child to protect identity) as they expressed grave concern after seeing a “sudden” and “disturbing personality change accompanied by irrational anger” last year. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, in their August 25 order, after speaking and interacting with the child of the petitioners (whose names too the HC withheld), said, “We do not find any justifiable material which makes out a strong prima facie case that requires such evaluation.” The parents said the child had come to India from the US to pursue a course at an academy near Mumbai in November 2019. In the second half of last year they became “alarmed” at the communication they received from their child and “threats” of harm to self and others. The parents said they petitioned the HC as their efforts to persuade officers of the state to act “turned futile”. Their petition through Jaykar & Partners also focused on Section 100 of the Mental Healthcare Act which “casts a duty on every officer in-charge of a police station to take under protection any person whom he has reason to believe to be suffering from mental illness”. The judges interacted with ‘S’ for a “fair length” in chamber at the first hearing and suggested mediation between child and parents to bridge their distance. ‘S’ declined consent for a mediation process on August 6 and the parents’ senior counsel D Khambata with Mohan Jaykar said directions for an expert evaluation is warranted, given their concern. Khambata argued that choice of words “betray a deep problem, which ‘S’ appears to be grappling with’’ and cited a certificate by a doctor that suggested presence of a behavioural disorder linked to “depressive features”.The HC gave the matter its “anxious consideration’’ and found ‘S’ to be “mentally alert and fully alive to developments unfolding around’’ with a “strong sense of individuality’’ to live life on own terms. The HC said ‘S’ expressed regret for some alarming communication and “took full responsibility for actions’’ pursued. It said “it seems relentless efforts’’ by the parents to wean away ‘S’ from the course alienated them further. It said Supreme Court requires the court to “see to it that a person’s right to defend himself must be adequately protected” and cannot order a “roving inquiry’’. Having interacted with ‘S’, HC said it was “unable to infer” need for an evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-finds-20-yr-old-us-citizen-alert-rejects-parents-plea-for-evaluation/articleshow/85963027.cms||Swati Deshpande

He questioned the IAS officer as to who ordered the probe into of land-grabbing allegations. “Who gave him the power to order the probe,” he questioned pointing at the Mysuru regional commissioner GC Prakash’s probe into the charges pertaining to the land grabbing in the vicinity of the convention hall. “When the Mysuru regional commissioner has probed the land grabbing charges in Mysuru and submitted the report, who gave the authority to Moudgil to order another probe? What is the use of ordering another probe when the officials from his own department have investigated it and submitted a report,” he asked.“Some babus, especially IAS officers, are under the impression that they are honest and efficient while others are corrupt. We need to fight against such mindset,” he told reporters. He said IAS officials have indulged in revenge politics. Somashekar said Moudgil is yet to complete his task of correcting the land records in the aftermath of farm loan waivers even two years after he was assigned the task. “He is yet to correct the land documents related to 53,000 farmers, but he is keen to order another probe into an issue which has been investigated already,” he stated.

Addressing a public gathering as part of the Praja Sangrama Padayatra, he said, “They (TRS) have taken the pretext of Covid-19 for the postponement of the election.” Taking a dig at the TRS government in the state, he observed that instead of one school for every kilometre, there here is a liquor shop for every kilometre. According to Sanjay, teachers were scared that chief minister KCR might disband the teacher’s unions, hence they voted for TRS in the MLC election. He advised teachers not to be fearful, saying that if they are afraid, they will be unable to fulfil their duty in shaping the country. He said that the replacement of new teacher positions is not in the works and that many schools are cutting their teaching staff. In an appeal to all teachers in the state to support his padayatra, he said that teachers have a history of changing governments and that there is no need to fear anyone anymore since the BJP will stay by them. Meanwhile, at a public meeting in Vikarabad as part of sanjay’s padayatra, former minister and BJP leader Chandrasekhar said that whenever BJP takes power in the state, all the people who are arrogant now that the TRS is in charge will vanish.

---||Ahmedabad||Cow entrepreneurship derailed||Ahmedabad: The hugely successful cow entrepreneurship network which the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog (RKA) built over the past two and a half years appears to be getting derailed as the aayog has been defunct since February this year. Cow entrepreneurs feel it will become increasingly difficult for them to market their products in the absence of a nodal agency like the RKA to connect them with prospective buyers. Acting as a facilitator, the RKA got cow entrepreneurs across the country to take up the task of making several items from cow products like cow dung and cow urine. Last festive season, the RKA set a target of making over 10,000 Ganesha idols and helped cow entrepreneurs sell much more than the target. Similarly it set a target of making 11 crore ‘diyas’ (Diwali lamps) last year, and they were made and sold in the festive season. A source who has been connected with cow entrepreneurship programmes said that while cow entrepreneurs have now begun networking on their own to market their items, then absence of a nodal agency like RKA will make it increasingly difficult for them to market their products. However, sources said that “unscientific claims” made by the RKA have been responsible for the predicament of cow entrepreneurs. “The announcement of conduction of Gau Vigyan Prachar-Prasar Examination by RKA was a flashpoint as claims made in its study material were construed to be unscientific in nature,” said a source. The examination – meant to be held in four categories from primary school level to post graduate level – which was scheduled to be held on February 25 this year, was postponed and no fresh dates have been announced. The term of Vallabh Kathiria as chairman of RKA ended on February 20 and no new chairman has been named since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cow-entrepreneurship-derailed/articleshow/85959892.cms||---

The MLA, Ajit Yadav, on the occasion of 'Sampoorna Samadhan Divas' in Gunnaur on Saturday claimed, “The lekhpals are corrupt. They take bribes from people who visit them, and ask people to get liquor for them before doing their work. The district administration must intervene in the matter. Several people are turning up with their complaints on every 'samadhan divas' as these matters are never taken up.” “Taking legal action against even one such person would send a strong message among others. If complaints are received against me, take legal action against me as well,” Yadav added, pointing out that he would take up the matter with "higher authorities" if the issue is not addressed at a local level. Several people thronged the 'Sampoorna Samadhan Divas' event held under Gunnaur police station limits to address public grievances. The event was attended by district magistrate Sanjeev Ranjan, superintendent of police, Sambhal, Chakresh Mishra, and other officials.

If approved by the government, this rule is likely to come into effect at the end of this month, according to health department sources. “The proposal will be first implemented in Hyderabad as 90% of city population has received their first dosage,” an official said. Telangana has been given 1.1 crore doses by the Centre for September and October. Apart from Hyderabad and neighbouring districts, in most districts the first dose has not even touched 80%. The health department is now trying to ensure that at least 80% of the population in each district receives their first vaccination before Dasara. “Many people are hesitant to take the vaccine in districts. Therefore, the rule is being proposed to be implemented only in Hyderabad for now. Once the rule is in place in the city, others will come to take the jab,” an official stated. With schools being opened in the state since September 1, chief secretary Somesh Kumar has directed staff to go all out to speed up the vaccination drive. Earlier, the GHMC launched a house-to-house contact effort in the last week of August in approximately 4,856 colonies. In Hyderabad district, 28.9 lakh have received their first dose out of 39.9 lakh. In GHMC areas of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal, a total of 24.2 lakh have received both doses, while while 64.5 lakh are yet to take the second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-1st-dose-may-soon-be-must-to-enter-public-places-in-hyd/articleshow/85963028.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Congress attacks Rs 15 crore tender for penguin pen||MUMBAI: A major controversy has broken out over the high cost of maintenance of the penguin enclosure at Byculla zoo. The Congress has objected to fresh maintenance tenders for the enclosure, alleging that costs have been inflated. BMC has floated a tender of around Rs 15 crore for the upkeep of the seven penguins housed in the enclosure for three years, amounting to an annual bill of around Rs 5 crore. “The existing contract will end soon. The ongoing contract was also for three years and was started in September 2018. This was a Rs 11.5-crore contract,” the official said. Asked about costs, he said, “The money will be spent on maintenance and air-conditioning of the enclosure, life support and electrical systems. It will also cover veterinary costs and feed.” In July 2916, BMC brought eight Humboldt penguins from Coex Aquarium, Seoul, South Korea. It spent Rs 2.5 crore on the procurement. Zoo authorities came under fire after a one-and-a-half-year-old penguin, Dory, died in October 2016 due to intestinal complications. Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is opposition leader in BMC, said, “This kind of high maintenance cost is not justified. BMC is spending more on this than on hospitals. It must review the cost of penguin maintenance. In five years, BMC should have built in-house maintenance capacities. The enclosure has become a white elephant for the BMC and a golden egg-laying hen for tainted contractors,”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-congress-attacks-rs-15cr-tender-for-penguin-pen/articleshow/85963033.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

These applications represent solar power projects with the aggregate generation capacity of 1,546.45MW. However, 1,400 applicants with the cumulative capacity of 955MW have not applied for the exit option. They will continue to set up solar projects in Gujarat under the state’s policy for the development of small-scale distributed solar projects (SSDSP-2019), said sources aware of the developments. In early August, GUVNL had announced a onetime exit option for small-scale distributed power developers to walk out of power purchase agreements (PPAs) they had signed with the state-run company. The agreements were for solar projects to be established under the SSDSP policy. GUVNL had extended the last date for the submission of written request and prescribed undertaking to September 5, 2021. With this, about 65% of the total number of applicants have decided to exit PPAs and 62% of the total capacity has been offered for surrender. The exit option was provided to the developers after many of them complained of project unviability following the state government clarification that the projects under the SSDSP policy will not be eligible for any subsidy. The four discoms affiliated to GUVNL had signed PPAs at a tariff of Rs 2.83 per unit for 4,005 small-scale solar power projects with cumulative power generation capacity of 2,501MW under this policy. Initially, the projects were estimated to bring an investment over Rs 10,000 crore in green energy and allied sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/small-solar-projects-2605-applications-for-one-time-exit/articleshow/85962061.cms||Kalpesh Damor

He said that the chief minister believes that poverty should not come in the way of children getting good education. He said the state government has initiated revolutionary programmes in the education sector to make the children from the downtrodden sections to compete with the affluent sections in society. He appealed to teachers to take lead in shaping young brains as assets of the nation by making use of latest infrastructure being readied by the government. Addressing a virtual conference held on the occasion of Teachers’ Day on Sunday, Sajjala said students were spending more time with the teachers rather than at home particularly after the arrival of latest technologies. He said that top class teachers were accessible to students in remote locations. “Teachers have always had a bigger role to play in shaping the careers of students and their responsibilities have only increased in the recent past,” said Sajjala. He said that the government is spending close to Rs 16,000 crore on Nadu-Nedu to renovate all public schools in the state. Education minister Dr Adimulapu Suresh said that the government is taking measures for upgrading skills of teachers by providing them quality training with experts.

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: After dengue, diarrhoea emerges as new threat to kids in Firozabad||AGRA: After confirmation of a dengue outbreak in Firozabad district by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and a few cases of other vector-borne diseases, diarrhoea has emerged as a new threat to children, according to health department sources. More than 40% of the estimated 150 patients reporting at the government centres are children suffering from diarrhoea, they said. This is posing a fresh challenge to hospitals with beds already full with patients suffering from high fever, body ache and low platelets. On Sunday afternoon, the Firozabad Medical College was fully occupied with more than 500 patients suffering from dengue-like symptoms admitted there. Out of these two-third were children. Patients were adjusted in corridors and even the storeroom of the hospital. The toll in the district rose to 79 on Sunday with four more deaths reported in the last 24 hours. In fact, in the past three weeks, at least three people died of dengue-like fever on an average every day in Firozabad district and most of them were children. The situation in Firozabad is so grim that patients in critical condition are now being referred from Firozabad without any diagnosis and initial treatment, claimed doctors in Agra. Additional director of the health department, Agra division, AK Singh confirmed a spurt in diarrhoea cases at government centres. He advised, “People need to maintain sanitation and hygiene and ensure drinking water is clean. Special care needs to be taken where children are concerned.” In reply to another query, he said, “We are increasing the number of beds. There is no shortage of platelets or required medicines at the government centres. Additional ambulances have been arranged to ferry patients to hospital. Civic body teams are carrying out special cleanliness drives in the affected areas. Helpline numbers have also been issued. All the recent deaths of patients suffering from viral fever are being investigated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-dengue-diarrhoea-emerges-as-new-threat-to-kids-in-firozabad/articleshow/85957532.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad prisons were industrious even before Jail na Bhajiya!||AHMEDABAD: The prison at Sabarmati might be famous today for its ‘jail na bhajiya’ near RTO, but even before that, the city jails were industrious, mention the book, ‘Jail: History and Present’ published recently by the state prisons department. The book mentions that before Sabarmati Central Jail, which became functional in 1894, the city had two prisons in the early 19th century – one in Azam Khan Sarai besides Bhadra fort, and another in the area identified as ‘Dhuliakot.’ ‘The convicts were employed to make carpets, carpentry and weaving, whereas the city’s parks and gardens were maintained by the undertrial prisoners... The new norms of the prison – as part of a major reform in 1854 – mandated training the convicts in at least one trade. According to records, the skills training worked well for both the inmates and the jail. The sales even managed the expenses of the prison department due to its quality goods,’ mentions the book. Today the prisons department of Gujarat produces goods worth Rs 8 crore annually as products made behind the bars include furniture, cloth, phenyl, sanitary napkins, bakery products, Ganesha idols and so on. Anecdotes Snippets from Behind the Bars: Excerpts from the prison department bookSardar’s only ‘literary work’ at Sabarmati JailSardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s correspondence and speeches are part of India’s freedom movement and post-Independence era. But his own writings are very few. One of such rare publications is the diary that he maintained during his imprisonment at Sabarmati Central Jail ahead of the historic Dandi March in 1930. The work is now a book: ‘Sardar ni Jail diary.’ Sabarmati Jail seen through literary luminariesThe Sabarmati Central Jail also provided the backdrop of two well-known non-fictions of Gujarati language. While Kakasaheb Kalelkar wrote prose about his time at the jail in 1923 in ‘Otrati Diwalo,’ Jhaverchand Meghani – whose 125th birth anniversary is celebrated this year – gave voice to the window of the prison to report all it witnessed in ‘Jail office ni bari’ written in 1930. Both were however on different ends of the spectrum from description of trees and birds in the former, to pleas of inmates in the latter. Several other writers such as Swami Anand, Dayalji Desai, Pranshankar Bhatt, Indulal Yagnik, etc. had also served time in  Sabarmati Jail. Jail superintendent and medical officer get the first dish from prison kitchenIn 1928, Mahatma Gandhi famously rubbished the claims of the government officials about the good quality of the food served in Sabarmati Jail with account of ‘wretched greens and hotchpotch of dry leaves inducing stomach ache’ by the Satyagrahis. Today, the food quality is assessed by the jail superintendent and staff doctor who get the first dish after the meals are prepared. The meal timings are 9am and 4pm. One-third of convicts get education, degreesPrison officials said that the correctional facilities include reforming the inmates and preparing them for life outside the walls of prison. Officials said that out of 3,000-odd convicts across the state, one-third get enrolled and get at least one certificate/ diploma/ degree before they get released. The former prisoners often employ their skills once released to start their own ventures or get jobs. Election behind barsLike the elections of panchayat, the jail inmates also have their own ‘qaidi panchayat.’ Conducted annually in December, the election witnesses canvassing by the candidates, allocation of election symbols and ballot voting. The elected members, identified as ‘Sevak,’ have a one-year period in office where they look after health, sanitation, food quality and coordination with prison staff. Seven hangings in state prison since 1960Since the foundation of the Gujarat state, the prisons have recorded seven death penalties by hanging. The first hanging was in July 1962 in Ahmedabad prison of Kodar Mala, followed by Chunilal Jadavji and Diego Anthony in Rajkot in 1963, Amra Kanji in Vadodara in 1964, and Batuk Raghavji and Rony Jack in Rajkot in 1965. The last death by hanging was recorded in 1989 when Shashikant Mali got the capital punishment in Rajkot prison. Jadavji and Anthony had donated their eyes, whereas Mali had donated his body. Qaidi No. 6,357M K Gandhi was denoted the number 6,357 when he was brought to Sabarmati Central Jail in 1922. The preserved records of prison mention his age as 53 and height as 5’6”. The identity mark was mentioned as a white glazed mark on his left chest and raised brown mole on neck. His profession was shown as ‘cultivator and weaver.’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-prisons-were-industrious-even-before-jail-na-bhajiya/articleshow/85962167.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Now, companies to make potable water from atmosphere||HYDERABAD: Ever wondered whether the water droplets formed on the surface of a cold bottle kept outside the refrigerator for a while can be tapped for drinking? Well! It is exactly what scientists are up to now, with an endeavour to generate water from atmospheric air to make packaged drinking water, top officials of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) said on Sunday. BIS has just granted a licence to a company to produce packaged drinking water with the help of a new technology that uses giant Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs). An AWG uses refrigeration techniques to condense the humidity from moisture-laden air. It draws air from the atmosphere and the air flows into the machine through a filtration system where contaminants up to 10 microns are filtered out, explained KV Rao, head of Hyderabad BIS. “The filtered air then passes over the condenser, where cooling coils are in the path. This provides a temperature differential between the air and the coil surface, resulting in condensation and formation of water in a gigantic water tank,” he explained. The water in the tank then goes to ultra-filtration water purification system to remove solids and odour, if any. Then it is dosed with added minerals, further treated with UV and ozonised to eliminate micro-organisms, explained Praneeth, plant manager of Iconic Technologies, known for its technical expertise. Officials said the technology will also help in reducing the load on groundwater. A total of seven AWGs, each having a capacity of generating 1,000 litres of water per day and having energy consumption of 9 kilowatt per hour (KWH), will be used to begin with. “Output of AWG depends on prevailing atmospheric conditions like Relative Humidity(RH), and temperature. Moreover, extracting moisture from the air won’t affect the natural balance as moisture from air is an everlasting source of water,” Praneeth explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-cos-to-make-potable-water-from-atmosphere/articleshow/85963036.cms||Sunil Mungara

The employees have also requested for a meeting on to resolve the disputes. Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Officers’ Association and the Madgaum Urban Co-operative Bank Employees’ Union have written to Naik urging him to resolve the disputes of the staff. “We request your appointment on Monday at the head office to discuss and sort out all the issues and grievances of the staff members,” said president of the association and the union Prasanna Utagi in a letter to Naik. The bank’s licence was cancelled on July 27 and Naik, a former bureaucrat, was appointed as the liquidator for settling the accounts of the bank and winding up the operations. At a meeting on August 23, the staff members and officers had urged Naik to pay the salaries for July and August before Ganesh Chaturthi. “We hope that the salary for the months of July and August would be released shortly with the updating of the withheld benefits with effect from January 2018,” said Utagi adding that the arrears towards the withheld benefits should be released as the staff members are going through financial and psychological stress. The union has also said that the stance regarding the service benefits taken by the management after the bank’s licence was cancelled was contrary to the provisions of the bipartite memorandum of the settlement signed by the management and the officers’ association and the employees’ Union on July 29, 2010. “The circular has irked all the staff members and there is a great resentment against the managing director due to the same,” Utagi said.

The political parties in the opposition, including NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress, have opposed the proposal claiming that it favours a particular BJP leader, who runs the firm that has bagged the contract. The civic body will spend Rs41 crore on appointing the security guards. The standing committee has approved the proposal. The opposition parties are now trying to get the proposal reviewed and rejected. The ruling BJP has supported the process and allotment of tender. “The corporators of opposition parties have not expressed their dissent in the tenders while it was discussed at the meeting. The due process was carried out for allotment of the tender,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of BJP in PMC. As per PMC data, 666 guards’ posts have been approved in total, while 345 are filled and 321 remain vacant. According to the proposal, security will be provided at water purification plants, swimming pools, hospitals, cultural centres, vehicle department, gardens and crematoriums. The tender to recruit the security personnel was issued in May 2021. The process was completed in July. “We are against the proposal. The approval of tender may cause financial losses to the civic body. So, it should be scrapped,” said NCP corporator Prashant Jagtap. “The tenders have not been issued with good intent. We must oppose it. The bids have been called to favour a company, which is run by BJP MLAs. The terms and conditions for the tender have been set to favour these leaders,” said Arvind Shinde, a Congress corporator. Bala Oswal, a Shiv Sena corporator, added that the tenders seem inflated. “The civic body has to allot the tenders to those, who are offering services at minimum rate. However, the tenders for the security agency have been given at a very high price. So, we have demanded to stop this allotment of work,” he said. Six companies had submitted their proposals and of them four were unable to validate proposals due to technical issues. Some of them had no experience certificate, while some had not renewed their licence for deployment of security guards. Eventually, only two companies were considered for awarding the contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/move-to-hire-agency-to-guard-premises-turns-controversial/articleshow/85960050.cms||---

Later, a video showing the crowd chasing her, began to trend on social media.  The protesters said they were reacting against the journalist and the TV channel she represented for an alleged bias in reporting farm protests. According to the police, the woman journalist was reporting from the Mahaveer Chowk outside the GIC Ground where the mahapanchayat was being held, when a bunch of people started raising slogans against her. Within minutes, a huge crowd gathered on the spot and stopped her from reporting. She was chased by the crowd, following which, she was escorted to a local press office. When the crowd also gathered outside the press office and began to raise slogans, a local police team led by SP (city) Arpit Vijayavargiya moved her to safety with the help of local journalists. Later, the visibly shaken woman journalist said, “I am safe and want to thank the police officer and journalist friends who helped me.” Asked about the incident, the BKU media in-charge, Dharmender Malik, said, “The incident happened outside the mahapanchayat venue. We made special arrangements for the media and have full respect for them. Whoever has misbehaved with the woman reporter cannot be our people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-journo-faces-backlash-as-aggressive-farmers-chase-her-raise-slogans/articleshow/85957675.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Vijayawada||Row over Ganesh Chaturthi pandals unnecessary, says YSRC legislator||Amaravati: The YSRC on Sunday lashed out at the BJP for creating ‘unnecessary’ controversy over the restrictions imposed on Ganesh Chaturthi pandals. It advised the BJP leaders to go through the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry before criticising the state government.  Speaking to the media at the party office, YSRC legislator Malladi Vishnu said the government appealed to the public to celebrate the festival indoors in view of Covid-19. He said the Union home secretary had on August 18 asked all the states to take appropriate measures to prevent mass gatherings during the festival season in view of the pandemic situation. “The state government had suspended the Teachers’ Day celebrations and the YSR Lifetime Awards function in the backdrop of the spread of Covid-19.” Vishnu criticised BJP state chief Somu Veerraju for trying to create a communal rift. “The state government had also imposed curbs during Ramzan, Bakrid and Muharram. The government is acting with the utmost responsibility. BJP leaders are creating unnecessary controversies,” Vishnu claimed.  “People were not allowed even at Independence Day celebrations as part of Covid-19 regulations. Police have been taking measures to prevent mass gatherings at private functions and festivals. It has become a regular practice for BJP leaders to link chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s religious belief with the government decisions,” Vishnu added.  He asked BJP leaders to focus on getting more funds and projects from the Centre and stop divisive politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/row-over-ganesh-chaturthi-pandals-unnecessary-says-ysrc-legislator/articleshow/85960071.cms||Samdani MN

The government has approved a proposal of Rs 6.5 crore to set up the first floating jetty in coastal Karnataka, said Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath. He was speaking at the launch of eight insulated cold storage trucks of the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation (KFDC) here on Monday. The proposed floating jetty will come up near the Old Port where work on the third phase of fisheries harbour is under progress. The state cabinet has approved Rs 22 crore for the completion of the third phase of the fisheries harbour. Meanwhile, a jetty to anchor traditional boats of fishermen will be constructed at Thota Bengre at an estimated cost of Rs 3.5 crore. A proposal to upgrade the Old Port by providing all basic amenities at an estimated cost of nearly Rs 100 crore has been sent to the Central government after it was approved by the state government. Altogether, the government has proposed 16 development projects in the fisheries sector spending nearly Rs 1,100 crore in the coastal districts of the state, the MLA said. In his inaugural address, minister for fisheries, port and inland water transport S Angara said the government has plans to promote inland fishing along with marine fisheries. Cautioning about the harmful effects of excessive fishing on the marine ecology, the minister said fishermen have the responsibility of protecting the fish species as well. He added that the fisheries department will set up cold storage units at various places to ensure supply of fresh fish. He suggested that arecanut farmers, who have suffered loss due to yellow leaf disease in plantations, may consider pisciculture as an ideal alternative. KFDC chairman Nithin Kumar said the insulated cold storage vehicles have been procured at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). The corporation has procured three trucks with four-ton capacity, four with two-ton capacity and another one-ton capacity vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/floating-jetty-for-mangaluru-coast-planned-mla/articleshow/85986902.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED summons deputy RTO in Anil Deshmukh case||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned deputy regional transport officer Bajrang Kharmate for questioning on Monday in a money-laundering case it is investigating against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh.Kharmate works under the state transport ministry headed by senior Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab. The ED had summoned Parab too in the case to record his statement, but he sought two weeks’ exemption. During the money-laundering case investigation against Deshmukh, the ED recorded statements of a few accused and witnesses who told them that Kharmate had collected money from government officials, including police officers, for helping them secure plum postings. The ED wants to examine if Kharmate has any financial connection with Deshmukh or Parab. Last week, the ED had raided Kharmate’s premises in Pune and found that he had allegedly amassed ill-gotten wealth by managing postings in government departments. The agency also found that Kharmate, along with a relative, ran three franchisees of a multinational electronics appliances company, two franchisees of a branded jewellery company in Pune, and owned the premises where these establishments were housed. The ED also found that he owned a commercial premise in Pune which he rented out to a public sector bank apart from substantial land parcels at his village. Officials suspect that he is the owner of two high-end vehicles which were shown in his brother’s name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-summons-deputy-rto-in-deshmukh-case/articleshow/85963058.cms||Vijay V Singh

The TRS government had last released Rs 1,200 crore towards payment of interest on loans obtained by SHGs before the Assembly polls in 2018. Now, with an eye on the vote bank of women, the government announced release of Rs 54 crore to SHGs in Huzurabad Assembly constituency, he said. Uttam alleged that the government has not been paying the interest on the loans taken by the Woman Self Help Groups) scheme (interest-free loans to women SHGs) after K Chandrasekhar Rao took over as the Chief Minister for the second term in December 2018. He charged the TRS government of even stopping payment of ex-gratia to the family members of the deceased. The government has to pay Rs 25,000 in case of natural death and Rs 75,000 for accidental death within 24 hours. “What’s more, the government is exerting pressure on the SHGs to pay the interest from their own pockets to the banks. During the election campaign, KCR had promised to increase the Rs 5 lakh loan component to Rs 10 lakh for the SHGs and that the government would pay the interest on it,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-owes-rs-4-2k-cr-to-shgs-uttam/articleshow/85963052.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Big biddings for Ganesh laddu prasadam set to make a return||Hyderabad: After a gap of one year, the city is gearing to bid on the Ganesh laddu prasadam, which is often a crowd-puller. The city’s reputed sweet houses are eagerly awaiting orders from Ganesh pandal organisers to prepare jumbo sized laddus. Auctioning laddus has been a three-decade-long tradtion in the city. “This year we have decided to auction the Balapur laddu. In fact, last year, for the first time since 1994, the Balapur Ganesh Utsav Samithi did not auction the 21-kg laddu because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, the laddu auction had fetched Rs 17.60 lakh. We hope that this year the prasadam may fetch more,” Kallem Niranjan Reddy, president of Balapur Ganesh Utsav Samithi, told TOI. In 2020, a 100-kg laddu was offered by the Tapeswaram sweet-maker to the jumbo Khairatabad Ganesha idol. But doubt persists over the offering of a Tapeswaram laddu to the Khairatabad Ganesha this year as the sweet-maker—PVVS Mallikarajuna Rao (Malle Babu)— has not taken a decision yet. “We have been preparing the Ganesh laddus in different sizes for more than a decade. This year, preparing a laddu with all ingredients, including dry fruits, has become a costly affair. Last year, the price of the sweet material was Rs 560 per kg. This time, the price has gone up to Rs 700 per kg. We will prepare Ganesh laddus based on orders received from the pandal organisers,” a popular sweet house in Banjara Hills said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/big-biddings-for-ganesh-laddu-prasadam-set-to-make-a-return/articleshow/85963055.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ludhiana||Nine months on, Ludh-Delhi NH is still not fully repaired||Khanna: Nine months after a portion of the main flyover on Ludhiana-Delhi national highway had caved in here, a part of the stretch remains problematic for commuters as it is yet to be fully repaired. A road safety expert said it was the main highway, and keeping national security in mind, it should have been repaired within days. In November last year, part of the stretch from Ludhiana to Delhi had caved in near Amloh Road and the authorities had attributed the collapse to rodents, who fed on the garbage dumped near it. The authorities had diverted the vehicles to service lanes, causing a traffic mess for commuters coming from Amritsar, Jammu, Jalandhar, Ludhiana on way to Delhi. However, even as the road was fixed in January this year, it again needed repairs, which had been undertaken recently. The Times of India found that the road construction agency had dug up the right side (from Ludhiana towards Delhi) for repairs, and it is yet to complete the work. Diversions continue on either side of the road with traffic being turned to a single lane on a small stretch. NHAI officials said the road was dug up on the left side of the four-laned way because of some technical issues after it was repaired following the cave-in. They added that after it was repaired, the road was dug up on the right side too as it was a part of the problematic stretch.NHAI project director didn’t respond to repeated calls, but sources in the authority claimed that the repair would be completed soon. Road safety expert Kamaljit Soi, who is member of National Road Safety Council, said, “They don’t have the resources and the will to carry out repairs. The road, which is part of the national highway network from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and has major defence-related significance as it leads to roads to Pakistan borders, should have been repaired in days. There are traffic jams on the stretch especially in the morning and evening hours.” He also raised questions over the quality of material used at the time of construction. Harsh Kumar Bhalla, a social activist from Khanna, who has raised the issue multiple times, said the repair has missed many deadlines. “It has been around nine months since the repair started and it has missed four or five deadlines. The result is that a part of traffic is put on the service road because of which it is in bad shape. There have been accidents as well because of heavy traffic on the narrow road,” he added.“Instead of a raised road, it should have been on pillars. It would have served two purposes: vehicles could have been parked under it and it wouldn’t have divided Khanna in two parts and hindered traffic movement. I have written to NHAI and the minister of road transport and highways,” Bhalla added.Commuters said the agency should repair the road soon. “We do go to Chandigarh and Delhi through Khanna and the repair work is causing problems during peak hours,” said Amarjit Kaur, a Ludhiana resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/nine-months-on-ludh-delhi-nh-is-still-not-fully-repaired/articleshow/85957703.cms||Shariq Majeed

The NGT’s join inspection committee also observed that Oorakunta Cheruvu has to be restored immediately. Removal of debris dumped adjacent to Oorakunta is under progress. The project authority has agreed to remove debris within two months. A proposal on ‘Assessment of the contamination status and environmental damages of Oorakunta Cheruvu, Yadagiripally, Telangana’ was submitted by NEERI, Hyderabad zonal centre, has sought Rs .22.7 lakh and four-month time period to complete the damage assessment study. NGT South Zone had in December 2017 appointed a joint committee, comprising Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district collector, representatives from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, Telangana State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, roads & buildings departments and minor irrigation department, to inspect the area and submit a factual as well as action report, if there was any violation found. The joint committee had submitted its report on June 30, 2021, along with recommendations for restoration of Oorakunta. Subsequently, NGT issued additional terms of reference, directing the committee to submit a detailed report. NGT had earlier questioned the prior requirement of environmental clearance (EC) for laying six-lane road around Yadagirigutta Temple. “The proposed project neither falls under National Highway nor State Highway; it is major district road governed by local authority. The requirement of environmental clearance for the formation of six-lane ring road is not under the purview of EIA notification,” the committee opined. The project authority has submitted that construction of presidential suite and VVIP cottages in an extent of 13 acres with built up area of about 11,193 square metres on Yadagirigutta-Cheriyal Road was in completion stage. YTDA had granted approval for these constructions. YTDA has submitted a proposal for the construction of township and Yadagirigutta Temple city. “The proposal submitted by YTDA for prior environmental clearance does not include the constructions, which are already taken up by R&B department at Yadagiripally village,” the NGT-appointed committee said. The joint committee had submitted its report on June 30, 2021, along with recommendations for restoration of Oorakunta.

During the wee hours of Sunday, four friends — Md Haneef (25), an electrician from Gangabowli, Md Mustafa (24), an auto driver from Chintalmet, Rasheed (30), a labourer from Jhirra, and their friend Ajju (26), a private employee from Mangalhat — sat on the chabutra in front of Mustafa’s relative house at Church lane in Gufa Nagar, talking to each other. A little later, Haji, a labourer from Mangalhat, and his friend reached there. “About 10 days ago, Haneef and his three friends had an argument with Haji and his friend regarding some issue related to gambling. When Haneef and his friends saw Haji, they picked up an argument with accusing him of being an informer about gambling,” Mangalhat inspector G Ranveer Reddy said. The rival groups initially indulged in a fist fight. Subsequently, Haji and his friend left the place and returned with knives. They stabbed Haneef, Mustafa, Rasheed and Ajju. Haneef was declared dead at OGH, while the other three were out of danger, the inspector said. Special police teams are formed to nab the accused, who went absconding. A case was registered under Section 302 (Murder) IPC. Haneef and his three friends had an argument with Haji and his friend regarding gambling. On Sunday morning, they again had an argument on the same issue, said the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1-dead-3-hurt-in-clash-after-row-over-gambling/articleshow/85962193.cms||---

At a recent council meeting, a proposal by Worldwide Veterinary Services India was discussed to undertake comprehensive sterilisation to “improve the welfare of stray dog population”. The programme is a part of animal birth control scheme under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. The state government has notified a scheme, The Goa Small Animal Rescue Management Scheme, 2014, to take care of stray dogs and to reduce their population by sterilising and vaccinating them against rabies. The council officials said that this proposal was under “serious consideration”. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by MMC with the South Goa Animal Welfare Trust that ran the dog shelter has lapsed. MMC said it is not inclined to renew the MoU as councillors had pointed out a number of complaints from the public against the organisation. Besides bills raised by the trust with MMC are yet to be cleared by the civic body pending verification of the work done, it was informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stray-dog-sterilisation-under-serious-consideration/articleshow/85960174.cms||---
---||Business||Delay in legislation on crypto boosts lobbying||NEW DELHI: The delay in the government finalising the legislation on cryptocurrency has prompted intense lobbying, with agencies worried over the risks emanating from an unregulated segment with extreme price volatility, posing a threat to investors, many of whom do not understand the instrument. Besides, there are concerns over the instrument being used for money laundering and terror funding, an issue that has been flagged by other agencies across the globe, sources told TOI. While the Supreme Court had lifted the ban imposed by the RBI, the government had listed a bill on cryptocurrency to be introduced during the Budget session of Parliament but with the session cut short, the legislation could not make it. During the monsoon session, the government remained silent on the future of the proposed bill with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently saying that it has been sent for clearance by the Union Cabinet before it can be introduced in Parliament. The next session is at least two months away. But crypto exchanges have used the interim period to launch a massive lobbying initiative with several governments and regulatory agencies, raising concerns. The exchanges have argued that a ban on digital currency transactions will result in job losses. While there are fears that a ban will lead to investors getting locked into the instrument, sources indicated that a three-six month window will be provided for investors to exit. Several officials have junked the argument that crypto currencies are an asset class. Besides, there are worries over the legal basis for the presence of some of the exchanges, which remain outside the jurisdiction of either Sebi or the RBI. “There has to be global coordination to combat the challenge posed by cryptocurrencies. They are not a currency as only the sovereign can issue currency. There is a grave danger in allowing these instruments,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/delay-in-legislation-on-crypto-boosts-lobbying/articleshow/85964199.cms||Surojit Gupta

The project, which was taken up at the cost of Rs 675 crore is claimed as the second longest flyover in Telangana, is being delayed inordinately due to the process of land acquisition and it is taking more time than expected, officials said. The prevailing hurdles seems to have added to the woes of motorists and residents living in the surrounding areas. This six-lane corridor which starts at Uppal Junction is aimed at decongesting traffic going towards the Warangal highway and provide a smooth thoroughfare for people of Uppal. The flyover ends at the Central Power Research Institute, Medipally. Once completed, the 6.2 km long flyover in Uppal will become the second longest flyover in the State after the PV Narasimha Rao Expressway, which stretches for over 11.5 km. “It has been over two years since the project commenced. The slow pace of work is leading to traffic jams on the entire stretch. The authorities should act on these issues and see that the project is completed soon,” said Philip Fernandis, a resident of Uppal. Officials of the Roads & Buildings (R&B) Department said that they are still awaiting one hectare of land acquisition near Nalla Cheruvu. “Other than completing this project, we don’t see any other solutions to this problem of bad roads and traffic jams. We want them to expedite the works by speeding up the land acquisition,” said Ganga Raju, a commuter. When contacted, Saroja Rani, chief engineer (projects), GHMC said, “Land acquisition for the Uppal elevated corridor is still in progress.” “The corridor will have 148 pillars and the works were expedited for erecting slabs on pillars through pre-cast method. The State government is doing land acquisition for 1.5 km,” said an official from R&B department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/traffic-jams-due-to-delay-in-land-acquisition-for-uppal-flyover/articleshow/85963060.cms||---

Sisodia made the announcement during the State Teachers’ Award held on Sunday to honour 122 teachers and principals for their contribution in the field of education. “In the last five years, we have sent our teachers and principals to Cambridge, Finland, Singapore and the US. The courses for which our teachers went there had been prepared for us by the universities,” Sisodia said during the function organised by the Delhi government on the occasion of Teachers’ Day at Thyagaraj Stadium. He said that the best universities in the world are known for their own tailored courses and if Delhi government teachers apply for these, they can get selected on merit. “That’s why Delhi government has decided on Teachers’ Day that our teachers will be able to apply for prestigious courses in the field of education in the world’s 100 top ranked universities. And if they get selected, then the government will bear the full cost of their programme,” he announced, adding that the department of education will issue the guidelines within a few days. While the annual State Teachers’ Award is given only in the academic field, this year, many other fields have also been added and the number of awards has increased from 103 to 122, compared with last year. The teachers who were honoured included special educators, music and art teachers, librarians, mentor teachers, sports teachers and vocational teachers. Director of education, Udit Prakash Rai, said that the last two years have seen the toughest phase of the century, but in this difficult period, we have seen our teachers perform their duty with extreme courage. He said teachers not only made sure that education doesn’t stop but also played a big role in fighting against the Covid crisis. “Our education system was badly affected due to the pandemic, because after the closure of schools, no one had any idea how to proceed. But the teachers and principals of our schools showed incredible grit and determination in responding to this situation,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-back-teachers-going-to-100-varsities/articleshow/85960162.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ludhiana||In poll season, govt likely to announce taxation reliefs for bizmen||Ludhiana: With the Punjab assembly elections due in the next few months, all the political parties are trying their best to appease the business community. Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) inducted several leaders, like Madan Lal Bagga and Kulwant Sidhu, who have an influence in the business community. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has been organising meetings with businessmen and their associations. Party president Sukhbir Singh Badal is himself presiding over some of these meetings. The ruling Congress is a step ahead. It is contemplating several relief measures for businessmen, especially traders, and a high-level meeting of senior bureaucrats and other stakeholders will be organised on September 7 at the office of Punjab Traders’ Board in Chandigarh. It is likely that major demands of traders like one-time settlement (OTS) schemes for all VAT-related cases and professional tax will be accepted.Bhupinder Singh Basant, senior vice-president of Punjab Traders’ Board, said, “On September 7, all office-bearers and members of the board along with senior officers of the departments, including excise and taxation, will hold a meeting. The main agenda will be to discuss the demands of the traders, including OTS for VAT cases and introduction of an amnesty scheme for professional tax payments. Besides, other important matters, like abolishing institutional tax introduced by the previous SAD-BJP government and increasing the purview of the existing OTS scheme for VAT assessments, will also come up for hearing.”Basant added, “We are also planning to form advisory committees at state and district levels for matters related to excise and taxation and a mechanism will be formed to convert the working of the taxation department in total paperless mode so that businessmen need not visit the offices for even the smallest task. On September 7, several revolutionary steps will be taken to benefit the traders of Punjab, especially Ludhiana. We request the businessmen to forward their suggestions and demands at the earliest so as we can include these in our agenda for the meeting.” According to Rajkumar Singh, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association, Ludhiana, “All the political parties and leaders are now trying to please the business community because not only votes, they need election fund too from us. But every time the story is the same. They forget us when they come to power. The Congress party ignored us for over four years and now it has woken up and is trying to appease us by announcing reliefs, which should have been offered long ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/in-poll-season-govt-likely-to-announce-taxation-reliefs-for-bizmen/articleshow/85957738.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Other charges’ collected by builder to attract 18% GST||MUMBAI: A recent ruling given to Puranik Builders by the GST-Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) is likely to adversely impact both the builders and buyers as it may escalate costs. The AAR has held that “other charges” collected by a builder under a sale agreement will not be a composite supply and will attract goods and services tax (GST) at 18%. From April 1, 2019, on housing projects that do not fall in the affordable housing category, GST is levied at 5% without input tax credit (ITC). For ongoing projects the builder has the option to pay GST at the old rate of 12% with ITC, which means taxes paid on inputs can be set off. A CA said advance rulings favourable to the tax department are inevitably followed during assessment. If the taxpayer (say, builder) takes a different approach, litigation results. The agreement for sale, drawn by the residential construction company Puranik Builders of Thane, was typical of most builder agreements with two components separately shown. These were charges for the main construction activity and “other charges”. The latter included charges for installation of electric meters, water connections, advance maintenance and club-house maintenance (till the time a society was formed), legal fees and such. These charges were collected from the buyers at the time of entering into the agreement or at the time of giving possession of the flats. While the builder was collecting GST at 18% on such “other charges”, it approached the AAR for a ruling on the applicable rate. It submitted that the services underlying the “other charges” should be treated as a composite supply (bundled with the supply of the main construction activity). Thus, GST rate on the main supply (currently 5% for new projects) should apply. The AAR noted that the consideration is charged separately for different services. It added that it was ironical that while stamp duty was paid on the value of the sale of the flat (excluding the value of “other charges”), which translated into a lower stamp duty; when it came to GST payments, the builder submitted that the other charges were part of the main construction activity. The AAR held that GST at 18% will apply on services underlying the other charges. The builder will have to pay GST on the entire amount received as “other charges” without any rebate. An advocate specialising in indirect taxes said: “No one will buy a flat without an electricity or water connection. Buyers expect common amenities to be maintained by the builder till a society is formed. Thus, treating such charges as non-composite will add to complexities and costs for real estate sector.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-other-charges-collected-by-bldr-to-attract-18-gst/articleshow/85963066.cms||---

Excited passengers climbed atop the upper decks where they clicked selfies and made videos to make the moment memorable. A live band kept passengers entertained all through the ride. Some of them even got up to dance too. At least 200 passengers took the first ride. The service, initiated by UP tourism department to promote waterways tourism in the state, provides an eight-hour two-way ride on the Ganga from Varanasi to Chunar Fort. The 55 meter-long, twin engine vessel cruise was flagged off by Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal in the presence of Vivek Malaviya, Vikas Malaviya, Jayant Malaviya and Manish Poddar, the directors of Alaknanda Cruiseline, the startup managing the cruise. Congratulating the team, Agarwal said, “This is a novel venture and we are sure that tourists will find the service attractive. A lot of hard work has gone into the initiative and we hope it will give a boost to tourism in the state.” Alaknanda Cruiseline has been running cruise services on the Ganga in Varanasi for the last two years. Vikas Malaviya, one of the directors, said: “We have been getting a good response which encouraged us to manage this tour too. We are grateful to the state government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath for reposing faith in our capabilities and entrusting us this huge responsibility.” During the ride, the passengers were served vegetarian breakfast, lunch, tea and heavy snacks. After two hours of sailing, the cruise made a brief halt at Shool Tankeshwar Temple, situated 15km from Varanasi. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and folklore suggests that this is the spot where the Ganga entered the holy city (Uttarayani) on the command of Lord Shiva. People believe that the temple is located at the spot where Lord Shiva had put his trishul (trident). In Chunar, divisional commissioner of Mirzapur, Yogeshwar Ram Mishra, also came onboard for some time. Impressed with the vessel and the facilities, he said that he would take the ride soon. Lata Khatri, an octogenarian, who travelled all the way from Delhi to take the maiden ride, said: “I came to know about this cruise from my family and I didn’t want to miss it. I belong to Varanasi and a thing like an air-conditioned cruise in the city is nothing short of a marvel to me.” RP Chaturvedi, a Varanasi-based doctor, said: “I have seen cruise service abroad, and in Goa, but such a facility in Varanasi instils a feeling of pride. I had expected a boat but this vessel is huge and will be a new experience for the people of Varanasi.” “We read about it in the newspapers and had planned to make a booking in July itself when it was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Although we had thought it would be a temple hopping ride, we went to just one temple. Overall, it has been a fun ride,” said Rakhi, who was part of a group on the cruise which danced to the songs presented by the music band.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/music-food-fun-kashi-chunar-cruise-ride-on-ganga-off-to-a-flying-start/articleshow/85955782.cms||---

In the latest break-in, a mobile phone shop near the busy Susen Circle in Makarpura was targeted from where burglars decamped with mobile phones, accessories and digital video recorder (DVR) of CCTV camera, all worth over Rs 14 lakh. Kiran Patel, who owns the shop for the past 15 years, told the police that he and his brother found the shutter unlocked when they went to their shop on Saturday morning. Patel peeped inside through a window and realized that the shop had been burgled as empty mobile boxes were lying scattered on the floor. When the duo went inside to check CCTV camera footage, they discovered that burglars had taken away the DVR too. Later, on estimation it was learnt that 82 smartphones of different companies worth Rs 13.8 lakh were missing, besides accessories worth Rs 50,000 which included ear pods, battery banks and speaker among others. Patel also said that some more mobile phones and accessories were also missing but he did not have details of them. In last 10 days alone, burglars have targeted six houses in different areas of the city. Cash and valuables worth over Rs 8 lakh were stolen from four of these houses while from two houses, thieves could not find anything. Last month too, six shops located a few hundred meters away from Raopura police station were broken into. However, it turned out to be a lucky day for shop owners as the burglars did not find any cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/burglars-make-hay-amid-strict-night-curfew-rules/articleshow/85957970.cms||---

ED officials visited the Chanchalaguda jail on Sunday after obtaining court orders and recorded the statements of prime accused Parthasarathi. ED would continue grilling him on Monday and Tuesday. ED had asked for seven-day permission, but the court granted three days to record the statement in judicial custody. ED had registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on an FIR issued by Hyderabad police’s Central Crime Station. CCS has registered four cases so far against Karvy for cheating IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank and clients. IndusInd Bank alleged that Karvy had availed credit of Rs 137 crore by pledging securities and personal guarantee of CMD Parthasarathi. The accused suppressed the fact that the pledged securities belong to the clients and was done without their consent, misusing power of attorney. The securities were transferred into the demat account of Karvy and pledged for margin and short-term requirements. The accused became a defaulter by diverting the funds into their own owns and those connected to businesses entities. Similarly, HDFC Bank was allegedly duped to the tune of Rs 350 crore. “We have received a complaint from a client who alleged that his account had a few crore rupees of money but it has been taken to minus 25 crores. This is the fourth case we have registered,” a CCS official said. CCS had earlier obtained custody of Parthasarathi twice and recorded his statements.

Akhilesh visited Utargawa village in Dharmapur block of Jaunpur to condole the demise of SP leader KP Singh Yadav. He also attended a programme of teacher’s felicitation organised by the Samajwadi Shikshak Sabha at Inar Gaon Duhiya in Bhadohi. He exuded confidence that SP would overthrow the BJP government in UP in the forthcoming assembly election as every section of the society is feeling neglected under the present regime. “People have made up their mind to dethrone the BJP government and bring back SP with absolute majority,” Akhilesh said. Akhilesh promised to enhance the electricity facility to the farmers and weavers after the formation of SP government. “The SP government will put back the state on development track, which was derailed by BJP,” he added. Attacking the ruling party, he said the BJP has failed to fulfil its promises in the last 4.5 years. “Everybody including farmers, students, business community and youth are suffering in the BJP rule,” he said “Government assets are being sold out to industrialists... BJP had promised to double the income of farmers, but today their rights are being snatched. The new farming law will deprive the farmers from farming. The BJP government failed to produce even a single unit of electricity, but it increased the power tariff.” Akhilesh alleged that the BJP government completely failed to handle the Covid situation, and many people died in want of oxygen and hospital beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-will-overthrow-bjp-govt-in-2022-akhilesh/articleshow/85955835.cms||---

In the coming days, tax collection will improve,” a senior revenue official said. Although only around 18% of expected revenue has been netted through taxes and user charges till August, the civic body said it is better than the corresponding period last year. For the current financial year the civic body’s property tax demand is Rs 121.6 crore, which includes arrears of Rs 61.6 crore, of which 21% has been collected. The slowdown in tax collection drive due to Covid-19 shows that arrears make up more than 50% of current demand for vacant land tax, professional tax and non-tax revenue. The civic body is expecting around Rs 287 crore in taxes through taxes and user charges. “We are opening our 37 tax collection centres even on Sundays. People can pay their taxes online on tnurbanepay.tn.gov.in. Compared to last year, our tax collection drive is better by 10-12%,” a senior corporation official said. Around 100 users are paying taxes online daily, officials added. As educational institutions and cinema theatres have remained shut, officials said such properties were not insisted to pay outstanding taxes. However, since most commercial activities are now open, the civic body has planned to gradually resume outstanding tax. Collecting non-tax revenue (rent for civic body’s properties in commercial hubs) will be an uphill task for the civic body as commercial establishments may cite slowdown as a reason to delay payment. As the civic body is under severe fund crunch to even carry out annual maintenance of properties such as public parks, the corporation said that they have to intensify the tax collection drive further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-planning-to-step-up-tax-collection/articleshow/85960269.cms||Deepak Karthik

The school education department has been closely monitoring the developments ever since schools reopened for the senior students across the state on September 1, he said in Trichy on Sunday. “We will observe the response after the first eight days of the school opening for class IX to XII. We are also examining the attendance status. Elementary education is vital, and at the same time we are considering the Covid-19 situation too. We will have discussions with officials, and the chief minister will take a decision after September 8,” Anbil Mahesh said. As school students and teachers have tested positive in various districts recently, the minister said that around 800 medical professionals across the state under the RBSK initiative are involved in the surveillance to ensure the safety of both teachers and school children. “Classrooms of the students who tested positive were sanitised and closed, students were moved to alternative rooms,” the minister said. As there were complaints about school teachers on their own cleaning campuses in the absence of adequate sanitation workers, the minister said that arrangements through local bodies and district education office will be made to mobilise workers to maintain the hygiene at schools. Reacting to a question on clearing the grievances in the appointment of school teachers, he said that there are more than 12,000 pending litigation pertaining before the teachers’ recruitment board (TRB) and the school education department. We will resolve the issues one after another, he said. “The announcement on spoken English course was received well among the public, as there is a demand. Good aspects in the national education policy will be adopted,” he said. Reacting to the criticism on the best teacher award being conferred to the same schools repeatedly, the minister clarified that the school education department has identified teachers based on certain parameters and qualifications. The minister at the district collectorate handed over the best teacher awards to 13 teachers in the Trichy district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/decision-on-reopening-schools-for-lower-classes-after-sept-8-minister/articleshow/85960282.cms||---
---||Varanasi||‘PM’s Kashi devpt model beingreplicated in Ayodhya, Mathura’||Varanasi: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that model of Kashi’s development is being replicated in Ayodhya, Mathura, Vindhyachal (Mirzapur) and other religious places in state and announced that over 7.50 lakh earthen lamps will be lit up on the banks of the Saryu as Ayodhya will celebrate Deepotsava on the eve of Diwali. Yogi also taunted the Opposition leaders saying those who used to go to religious places secretly are now competing with each other to grab public attention on their visits. Addressing the intelligentsia at the party’s ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ in Varanasi on Sunday, Yogi said, “Kashi has always been an attraction for people from across the world as it is the ancient centre of Sanatan Dharma and spirituality. Despite this, Mahatma Gandhi made his displeasure known over the poor sanitation in and around the Kashi Vishwanath temple when he visited the shrine in 1916.” “Many leaders ruled the country for decades by taking the name of Mahatma Gandhi and claiming his legacy but never even tried to ensure the development of the city as per its stature and cleanliness at the shrine,” the CM added. “After becoming MP from this holy city, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ensured development of Varanasi and launched Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project while preserving the soul and culture of the city,” said Yogi. Varanasi will emerge on the global platform with a grand and new image after the completion of KV Dham project, he added. “We are replicating PM Modi’s vision and model of Kashi’s development for development work in Vindhyachal, Mathura and Ayodhya,” said Yogi. “Those who opposed development of Somnath temple after Independence ruled the country for decades and left Hindus struggling for Ram temple in Ayodhya. The Modi government not only cleared the way for the temple in Ayodhya but also started its construction in a grand way,” the CM added. In the past many decades, a culture was developed where people having deep faith in the country’s traditions were termed inferior, while those who portrayed a poor image of the country and its heritage were promoted and awarded, said Yogi. “This was why many people used to visit religious places secretly to conduct rituals. But, after PM Modi showcased the Sanatan traditions on a global platform gloriously by promoting Yoga globally and holding Kumbh as the largest spiritual event, now the same personalities are competing with each other for public attention when they visit Hindu religious sites, he added. Talking about the ‘Atmanirbhar’ campaign, the CM said, “When I planned to hold Deepotsava at Ayodhya on Diwali eve for the first time, arranging 51,000 earthen lamps was proving difficult. But, recently when I reviewed preparations for Deepotsava this year, I was told that over 7.50 lakhs of earthen lamps have already been prepared.” Yogi also mentioned how the pottery industry is flourishing with the measures initiated by his government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pms-kashi-devpt-model-beingreplicated-in-ayodhya-mathura/articleshow/85955848.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa University researchers invent cheaper way to create nanorod, may aid clean energy||PANAJI: Two researchers at Goa University’s school of chemical sciences have invented a method to create nano material, which is ten times less expensive than the commercial process presently used to design nanorods. The tungsten trioxide nanorods produced through their methods can now be explored for many applications, including clean energy storage, cancer diagnostics, among others. After a rigorous process, researchers Pranay Morajkar and Akshay Salkar have earned an Indian patent for their ‘method for synthesising tungsten trioxide nanorods’. While tungsten trioxide nanorods are already being explored for their large applicability around the world, the process to produce it remains expensive, requiring developing countries like India to import 5g of it at approximately Rs 5,000, the researchers said. The method uses the inexpensive urea in the process and helps produce 5g of nanorods for less than Rs 500. “For a developing country like India, an active nano material produced at low cost will allow us to explore its scalability and industrial production in an economical way for varied applications in clean energy and environmental sector, instead of importing it,” said Morajkar. He is currently serving as an assistant professor at the school of chemical sciences, and his research focuses on designing nanostructured materials for energy and environmental applications. “High pressure autoclave and expensive template synthesis is commercially used, which makes the process expensive. Our method, instead, uses internal fuel in the process. We have innovatively used cheap protonated urea to give internal energy and nano-structural directionality for the material during the growth phase of the synthesis process,” Morajkar said. Morajkar and Salkar have already worked on applicability of the nanorods in preparing sustainable or alternative clean energy storage systems such as supercapacitors. This could help in minimising or eliminating the use of fossil fuels in the future. The researchers said that applicability of tungsten trioxide nanorods in cancer diagnostics and treatment also needs to be explored. “To detect cancer, you use imaging technology, where the high X-ray absorption coefficient of tungsten can strongly enhance the visibility of tissue structure. Its photocatalytic properties are being explored for use in photodynamic therapies by researchers around the world. Therefore, the photoactive and sensing potential of these nanorods and its composites needs to be further explored for use in the biomedical domain,” said Morajkar. His partner, Salkar, is a young researcher with a masters degree in physical chemistry from GU (pursued through St Xavier’s College, Mapusa) and is currently pursuing his PhD degree with Morajkar at the school of chemical sciences. “Different particles are available in the commercial market, but few are available in the rod shape, and even those which are there, are expensive. Now, we attempt to scale up the process. We need to find a buyer for large scale production and the process to find a buyer will start soon through the Goa University’s intellectual property cell. Our aim is to produce a Goa University’s indigenous product in the market and contribute towards the Make in India mission,” said Morajkar, who received his doctorate in 2012 from the University of Lille in collaboration with the University of Bordeaux, France, and returned to GU in 2014, to serve his motherland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-researchers-invent-cheaper-way-to-create-nanorod-may-aid-clean-energy/articleshow/85960312.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

HR&CE minister P K Sekar Babu had said during the demand for grants in the state assembly on Saturday that Annadhanam (distribution of free food) will be conducted for the whole day at the temple, one of the long-pending demands of devotees. A leading revenue-grosser in the state, the Mariamman temple situated on the Trichy-Chennai NH records an average hundial collection of about Rs 1 crore a month. Recognising the big footfall of devotees, mainly rural population from across the state as well as tourists accessing Chennai-Trichy NH, HR&CE department announced in the assembly that prasadham (holy food) will be given to all devotees. The temple management said it is discussing the appropriate products like savouries for launching the scheme at the earliest. Other infrastructure proposals for the temple include Kungumam (vermilion) production unit, first aid centre and redevelopment of its sub-temples. “Kungumam production unit is planned on 2,000 squarefeet space near the upcoming queue complex. Devotees may be allowed to take a tour,” an official source in HR&CE said. Oduvar training centre is also planned at the temple complex. “All announcements will embellish the temple’s infrastructure and improve footfall, but a solution for pedestrians coming to the temple amid accident threats is missing,” V B Jaganath, a Trichy city resident said. A sum of Rs 250 crore was sanctioned for the development of five temples including Samayapuram. Similarly, announcements such as a pilgrim accommodation centre at a cost of Rs 75 lakh for Vayalur Subramaniaswamy temple on the suburbs of Trichy city and redevelopment of Arulmigu Vekkaliamman temple at Woraiyur were also received well by the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/devotees-hail-govts-development-plans-for-samayapuram-mariamman-temple/articleshow/85960327.cms||---

According to the data, around 23.34 lakh beneficiaries have received their first jab of Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik V, while 6.67 lakh beneficiaries have received their second shot from paid sites. The data added that around 440 paid vaccination sites have been registered across Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune rural, of which 233 were in Pune, 141 in Pimpri Chinchwad, and 65 in rural. The maximum paid vaccination has been recorded in Pune civic limits with 19.73 lakh doses. Of the total Covid shots administered in the district so far across government and private sites since January 16, the paid sites contributed around 37% of the total vaccination. So far, the Pune district has recorded total vaccination of 81 lakh beneficiaries with the first and second shots. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India told TOI, “Despite the vaccine quota of 25% from manufacturers, the private vaccination sites in Pune district have done remarkably well. However, the response for paid vaccination is dropping, with more free vaccination centres available now.” According to Patil, the working class and the corporates are the ones, who have opted for paid vaccination to save on time and energy. H K Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital, Hadapsar, said that though daily respondents have gone down, but there are over 11,000 bookings for the second dose from the corporate. “We had four booths offering Covid vaccination a few months back, but now there is only one but that too is getting a low response,” he said. Jitendra Oswal, deputy director, Bharati Hospital, told TOI that private sites have played a key role in Covid vaccination, but people are more inclined towards free vaccination now. “In the past, we had transferred our doses to the Pune civic body, but still have around 17,000 doses with us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-than-30l-take-paid-vaccine-in-district/articleshow/85960344.cms||Piyush Bhusari

After a 24-hour search, the car was found parked on an interior road near Amrut Nagar slum in Ghatkopar. Two persons have been detained for using a duplicate number plate. Anil Shashtri recently called up the Ghatkopar traffic police division and complained that he had been fined thrice though his car was in Pune. He said he last visited Mumbai in January for treatment. “He expressed his inability to pay the fine due to financial problems...He did not travel to Mumbai for a long time, but had got e-challan messages while his Santro was in Pune. He requested us to take action against the wrong-doers,” said traffic police inspector Nagraj Majage.  Three teams looked for the car in Jagdusha Nagar, Golibar Road, Bhatwadi, Amrut Nagar, Andheri-Goregaon Link Road as it was fined in these areas. One team found the car with Shashtri’s number plate at Amrut Nagar and towed it. Later, Andheri resident Ashraf Memon (33) and Dharavi resident Shahrukh Khan arrived at the traffic police chowky to claim it. “While questioning them, traffic police found that the registration number was different from Shashtri’s car. The engine number and chassis number were also different,” said a source. After paying the Rs 3,800 fine, the duo said they had bought the car from a woman. “We suspect overwriting on the chassis number and the car was given to the men with duplicate number plates.

Four of them sustained injuries and were admitted to a government hospital in Nagapattinam, marine police said. In the first incident, four fishermen had ventured into sea on a fibre boat (IND TN 06 MO 6519) owned by S Selvakumar on Saturday morning. The fishermen told police that around 4 pm when they were fishing about 12 nautical miles southeast of Kodiakkarai, nine fishermen from Sri Lanka arrived on a mechanized boat and confronted them. They got into the Tamil Nadu fishermen’s boat and took away their catch, 500 kg of nets worth lakhs of rupees, 12-volt battery and echo sounder. All four sustained minor injuries during the incident. The fishermen managed to arrive onshore and lodge a complaint with marine police at Nagapattinam. Police identified the four as C Raveendran, 28, S Krishnaraj, 55, C Velmurugan, 35, and R Selvam. In another incident at the same place an hour later, 450 kg of nets and fish catch were taken away allegedly by the same group of Sri Lankan fishermen from a fibre boat (IND TN 06 MO 1753) owned by V Thakshinamoorty of Keechankuppam when he was fishing along with three others. No one was injured during the incident, police said based on a complaint filed by the fishermen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/five-tn-fishermen-assaulted-in-sea-by-lankan-fishermen/articleshow/85960352.cms||---

The state is in the second position after Andhra Pradesh. Despite the lack of internet penetration, the initiative has now completed 1 crore consultations across the nation, of which nearly 20 lakh is from Karnataka. Interestingly, some of the backward districts of North-Karnataka are also leading, indicating the dedicated field work carried out by the district health departments. As OPDs were closed during the lockdowns, more people started to use this service and now continue the same for risk-free consultations. According to the data shared by the Union health and family welfare department, Ballari has recorded the highest engagement registering 1,34,967 consultations which is also higher than Bengaluru urban district. It is ranked 13th place in the country. The NTS comprises of two variants of eSanjeevani namely — doctor to doctor (eSanjeevani AB-HWC) telemedicine platform that is based on a hub and spoke model and patient to doctor telemedicine platform (eSanjeevaniOPD) which provides outpatient services to the citizens in the confines of their. The former was introduced in 2019 and the latter was in April 2020. In the state, according to the ministry, the numbers jumped dramatically during and post lockdown. While Ballari is in 13th position in the country, Chikkamagaluru is in 15th place having recorded 1,26,540 consultations. The patients and doctors are engaging in both audio and video modes.

---||Varanasi||Do not let kids sans digital connect languish, try gurukul way: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||VARANASI: Amidst an anticipated third Covid wave, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday asked the teaching fraternity to devise alternate methods to teach children who don’t have access to modern resources to study from home. This is crucial to keep underprivileged students in the educational loop in the event of a prolonged pandemic, he said. “When we opened schools, the threat of a third wave was cause of concern. Since we still have a big section of society that lacks digital connect, hi-tech phones or tabs, teachers should hammer out a strategy to ensure these children should not be left out, if Covid-19 persists,” said Yogi, while addressing the intelligentsia of Kashi to mark the launch of BJP’s statewide ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ on Teachers’ Day. Recalling his interaction with a child in Gorakhpur, Yogi said, the boy could remember studying in class 4, the last time he attended class before lockdown was clamped in 2020. “Like this child, several bright children have been forced to discontinue studies. While a large section of society has access to digital platforms, there are many who don’t even have a television at home,” he said. Teachers seamlessly used technology to continue online classes during the lockdown, but catering to children without resources is a big challenge, he said. “Now, they should explore possibilities and conceptualize new formats to teach underprivileged children. They could experiment with the ancient gurukul tradition by holding open classes in small groups under trees, panchayat buildings or ghats,” said Yogi, while appealing to the intelligentsia of Kashi to work on this front. Praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Covid-19 management, he said, when mortality rates were soaring in developed countries, PM’s guidance yielded results. He said, though the first Covid wave was not as deadly as the second, it had its challenges of bringing back stranded students from Kota or tackling the influx of 40lakh migrants. “We did not have Covid testing labs, when the first wave hit us. Today, we have the capacity to test 4lakh samples every day and 555 oxygen plants have ended need to outsource oxygen,” said Yogi. Explaining the giant makeover of UP, Yogi said, “Different governments came to power and were ousted since 1947, but they could not ensure development due to their narrow vision. PM Modi’s vision and strategy triggered a positive change.” He said, when his government was formed, everybody had doubts about the state’s law and order due to recurrent riots and rampant corruption. “Youths from UP did not receive good response when they sought jobs in other states. Today, people are praising UP’s law and order and ease of doing business. Huge investments have come to the state even during the pandemic, clocking Rs 66,000 crore. This did not happen overnight. Also, per capita income of UP had plummeted over past seven decades, but in next five years, UP will equal India’s per capita income,” said Yogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-dont-let-school-kids-without-digital-connect-languish-experiment-with-gurukul-system/articleshow/85955865.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Goa||Goa: With blood & bravery, Naval Aviation earns President’s Colour||DABOLIM: Over 67 years after it got its wings, the Naval Aviation will receive the President’s Colour on Monday from President Ram Nath Kovind at INS Hansa—the Mecca of Naval Aviation—an honour that has been earned by the “sweat, bravery, blood and tears” of the men in white. The Navy was the first to receive the President’s Colour, which it did in 1951. Naval Aviation will get the honour in the same year when INS Hansa celebrates its diamond jubilee. “About 122 pilots and aircrew have done the supreme sacrifice during air operations. So, it has been paid for in blood, bravery, sweat, and tears of our founding fathers and it is a matter of huge pride for all of us that it’s happening in Goa, because Goa is intrinsic to Naval Aviation,” Flag Officer Naval Aviation (FONA) Rear Admiral Philipose George Pynumootil told TOI. What makes the presentation of the President’s Colour even more special is that the present chief of the naval staff, Admiral Karambir Singh, and the deputy chief of naval staff, vice admiral Ravneet Singh, are both aviators, Philipose said. The Rear Admiral, who is also the Flag Officer Goa Area, said along with the pilots, the observers, maintainers, air traffic controllers, MET officers, medical staff and divers play a huge role in keeping the aircraft airworthy. From acquiring its first aircraft, the Short Sealand IN 101, on January 13, 1951 to operating potent platforms such as the Boeing P-8I, the Sikorsky MH-60 Seahawk and the General Atomics MQ-9B drones, the Navy’s aviation arm has taken massive strides in protecting India’s maritime and strategic interests, Philipose said. Rear Admiral Philipose George Pynumootil said Indian Navy has seen a phenomenal growth and today it is a formidable forceToday, the Navy has over 250 fixed wing and rotary aircraft in its arsenal operating from 12 air stations across the country, including three on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and three air enclaves. “It’s a phenomenal growth for the Indian Navy,” he said. “Today, the Indian Navy is a formidable force, which contributes to all aspects, whether it is low-intensity maritime operations, anti-piracy operations, a constabulary role or disaster relief due to the vagaries of nature.” The President’s Colour is the highest honour that can be bestowed upon any military unit of India. Historically, armies carried their monarch’s colours into battle and these flags served as a rallying point, well defended in battle. Capturing the enemy’s flag indicated victory and that the adversary had fled. When India gained Independence, the 33 King’s Colours awarded during British rule were laid to rest at the Indian Military Academy and since then the colours have been awarded by the President. Looking to strengthen India’s credentials in maritime security, the Navy knows that interoperability with friendly nations and heightened maritime domain awareness is the key. Going forward, the Navy will emphasise on standardisation of aircraft, weapons and sensors. India is already operating state-of-the-art aircraft like the P8I and MH60R enabling seamless interoperability with the US Navy and several navies that operate the same aircraft. “Our emphasis will be to optimise the number of platforms. It is good to have a smaller number of types of aircraft, as it would facilitate effective training and inventory management. Interoperability also increases,” Philipose said. “For example, the sonobuoys on the MH60Rs are compatible with the P-8I. We are focusing on standardisation as it would result in huge cost saving. Also, our focus is on self-reliance and indigenisation,” he said. Notwithstanding the challenges ahead, the honour of bearing the President’s Colour will serve as a worthy recognition for the service rendered and the motivation to soar to greater heights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-blood-bravery-naval-aviation-earns-prezs-colour/articleshow/85960398.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Kanpur||Noose tightens around pvt hosps as dengue stings Kashi hard||Varanasi: As dengue continues to sting the city, the health department has tightened noose around private hospitals and pathologies to ensure they are operating as per government guidelines and not overcharging from patients. When TOI tried to take stock of the drive being carried out by the department, Varanasi Municipal Corporation and others, chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said, 108 dengue cases have so far been confirmed in the district and the number of hotspots has mounted to 41. These figures are enough to paint a clear picture of the massive surge in dengue cases since July 1. Till August 25, the department had a list of 53 confirmed dengue cases and 34 hotspots. Regarding the increasing pathological tests for dengue and long queues being witnessed at blood banks for platelets, the CMO said as per governments guidelines, NS-1 Antigen kit test report is not sufficient to confirm dengue. Test of samples in sentinel surveillance laboratory is a must for confirmation. In view of these guidelines, only those samples, which are sent to the microbiology department laboratory of Banaras Hindu University for Elisa test and are tested positive, are considered as dengue positive cases, he said. To ensure that the same guidelines are followed by private practitioners, hospitals and pathology labs, he said, a special drive was launched in the district from Saturday. On the initial day, 16 teams of health officials checked 61 hospitals and pathology centres and issued strict instructions to treat patients as per the guidelines prescribed by the government and avoid charging exorbitantly to avoid punitive action. Mega cleanliness drive, including source reduction exercises like clearing water from solid waste, scraps and coolers, fogging, spray of anti-larval and bio-chemicals, has also been ordered, said CMO, who also inspected areas like Pandeypur. If the officials are to be believed major problem is being noticed in the villages, which have been included in VMC limits recently, as they lack proper drainage system. The areas, which remained inundated during flood in Ganga and Varuna, are also a big challenge as waterlogging is still there on vacant plots despite clearing of flood waters. Most of the dengue hotspots have been identified in the same areas. Municipal commissioner Pranay Singh, who is leading the special cleanliness drive, said some areas in Sarnath, Seer Gowardhan, Khujwa, Susuwahi and Chitaipur have been identified as highly sensitive. Nodal officers appointed for each ward have been asked to ensure cleaning of even grass from vacant plots in their areas, he said adding extra attention is also being paid on schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/noose-tightens-around-pvt-hosps-as-dengue-stings-kashi-hard/articleshow/85955902.cms||---

---||Goa||FC Goa have the best team, want to win all trophies this season: Edu Bedia||Panaji: Had it not been for Manuel Lanzarote, Edu Bedia would not have ended up at FC Goa. In 2017, when it was time to draw curtains on the Zico era and start a new one under Sergio Lobera, Bedia was a last-minute addition. It was Lanza, his teammate at Real Zaragoza, who recommended the Spanish midfielder to Goa. The profile seemed too good to be true. Bedia was just 27, had never played below Segunda level in Spain, and having made his La Liga debut when only in his teens, India seemed like an unlikely destination. Goa tried their luck. The rest, they say, is history Bedia is now into his fifth season at Goa and remains the longest-serving foreign player at the club. He’s been consistently good too, leading a young side quite well last season, particularly in the AFC Champions League where his importance to the team was there for all to see. “Last year in the second part of the season, we were the best team in ISL,” Bedia told TOI during an online interaction on Monday. “In the first part, we had a new coach, new players and many of them quite young. Maybe it was little difficult. This year, we know the coach, we know our teammates and there are youngsters who are very good. We have a very strong team.” Goa logged a 15-match unbeaten run in the Indian Super League (ISL) that stretched to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Mumbai City FC on penalties. For all their efforts and record, though, they got nothing in return. “We want to win all the trophies this season. In this moment, we are one of the best teams in India,” said the Goa captain. The first chance for a trophy will be at the Durand Cup, Asia’s oldest football tournament. Goa have fielded their best-possible side with four national team players and four foreigners. No wonder everyone is counting them as favourites. “Our target is to win, not just the Durand Cup but everything. The target is to improve as a team. As captain, my target is to help the young players,” said Bedia, whose team will open their campaign against Army Green at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Tuesday. Even coach Juan Ferrando agrees that Goa will be a better team than the one he took over last season. “It helps to have the foreign players from last season,” said Ferrando, explaining the benefits of retaining the likes of Bedia, Jorge Ortiz, Alberto Noguera and Ivan Gonzalez, all Spaniards. “The choice is perfect. I know the players. They helped me a lot and know my methodology. They are like second teachers for young players.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-have-the-best-team-want-to-win-all-trophies-this-season-edu-bedia/articleshow/85989693.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Simha is at the centre of a raging controversy with opposition leaders accusing him of claiming credit for the expressway.Lakshmana and Manjula slammed for Simha for not agreeing to a debate on the issue, despite the Congress having invited him to a public discussion on the subject. “Simha did not turn up for the debate, instead of which he released a two-page long letter. We are ready for a public debate with Simha anytime. We will continue our fight against him till the MP confesses to having misled the people,” they said.Meanwhile, former public works minister HC Mahadevappa, in a lengthy Facebook post, hit out at Simha, who had questioned the senior Congress leader’s contribution during his stint as a minister. Mahadevappa even uploaded photographs of his being felicitated by former chief minister BS Yediyurappa and other BJP leaders in acknowledgement of his contribution to Mysuru.Lakshmana and Manjula said that they had thrice extended an invitation to Simha for a public debate on the expressway, which, once completed, will enable completion of a journey between Bengaluru and Mysuru in 90 minutes. “We will hold a demonstration in front of the BJP office next Saturday. We want Simha to accept the truth about the project. This stretch of the state highway was upgraded into a national highway in March 2014 when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister. Oscar Fernandes was the Union minister for road transport, Siddaramaiah was the CM and Mahadevappa the public works minister. Adagooru H Vishwanath and R Dhruvanarayan were the Lok Sabha MPs.

There are a total of 56,189 teachers and non-teaching staff working across schools in the region. Of them, 35,624 have received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine so far while 77% of staff have received the first dose. The percentage of vaccination with the first dose is higher (92%) in government/municipal corporation-run schools. “Creating of separate categories on the centralised CoWin portal will prioritise and facilitate 100% fully immunisation of teachers and non-teaching staff in the next few days,” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region, said. As a separate category for teachers and non-teaching staff has been introduced on the CoWIN portal, it will be easier for teachers to book the slot at government and municipal corporation run vaccination centres to avail the benefit of free immunisation. For walk-in, they (teachers) can show their identity cards to get the shot on priority, he added. The Union government has introduced ‘teacher’ and ‘non-teaching staff’ categories on the portal to accelerate full immunization in this the segment from September 1. Many states are considering reopening schools after Diwali. There are 97 lakh teachers in the country. Besides, the central government has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to the states to vaccinate this group on a priority. Most of the teachers have had already received the first dose of the vaccine and the move to introduce the separate categories is primarily to expedite full vaccination in the segment. “It is crucial for teachers and school support staff to get fully vaccinated as part of the preparation of reopening the schools,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association of Hospital Board of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-35k-teachers-support-staff-in-pmr-fully-inoculated/articleshow/85960421.cms||Umesh Isalkar

While speaking on the occasion, CM said the state was writing a new story of development and getting freed from mafia, mosquito and filth. There was a time when East UP was a hub of mafia and cases of diseases like malaria, encephalitis and dengue were on the rise, but now the situation has changed. “With proper sanitization and adequate measures, encephalitis has been controlled in the state. We need to make sanitization our sanskar (ritual) and if we are aware of cleanliness, we’ll be away from diseases,” CM said. “The sanitization workers are making new records of cleaning. Under the guidance of PM Modi, they are providing healthy environment to people with their hard work. Encephalitis has reached a minimum level with toilets in every home,” CM said while praising the sanitization workers. CM also remembered former president Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan on the occasion of Teacher’s Day and said, “The sanitization drive has begun on the birth anniversary of former president Dr Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan and it will continue till September 12. Teachers show a path to the society and everyone should take the role of a teacher and motivate others for the sanitization drive.” Under the drive, proper cleaning, water drainage work, sanitization and fogging will be carried out to check the diseases. The chief minister appealed to the people not to litter or throw garbage on roads or in drainage channels. The rivers are flowing above the danger mark and due to high level of water and overflow, the regulators were switched off because of which some parts of the city faced the issue of water logging. A joint team of GDA and GMC will find out the permanent solution of the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/up-getting-freed-from-mafia-mosquito-filth-cm/articleshow/85955966.cms||---

The cleanliness drive was organised by Wish 2 Help Trust for three hours from 8 am to 11 am in which 21 people took part. P R Vishwanath, member of the NGO, said that they collected 12 big bags full of wastes of which three bags were filled with liquor bottles and the rest with plastic wrappers and other eatables and water bottles. The hill with Karuppanna Swamy Temple at the foot is frequented by the devotees and also by families and groups of friends. Keelakuyilkudi and its foothills that are also a popular shooting spot is home to a variety of lizards, frogs, toads, owls and bats.Fauna here is affected by the pollution caused by the visitors, Vishwanath said. The organisation said that such menace is affecting other hills, hillocks and urban forests in the district as well. “People leave behind wastes after consuming snacks, food and liquor. The government cannot monitor such hills and hillocks. Sadly, the pollution is not only caused by tourists but also the locals. It is the responsibility of the people visiting these places to ensure that the wastes are disposed before they descend the hill,” Vishwanath added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/waste-cleared-from-keelakuyilkudi-hill/articleshow/85960428.cms||---

The boy has been admitted to Dindigul medical college hospital with serious injuries. The girl’s brother was among those booked for attempt to murder. The 22-year-old girl from Karuthanampatti in Dindigul is a second year MSc student at a college in Kodaikanal. She got acquainted with T Meganathan, 29, of Attur in Salem through Facebook and the two fell in love. She travelled to various places when he is said to have taken intimate pictures and videos with her. According to the girl, Meganathan allegedly began blackmailing her for sex. So she parted ways with him and her parents arranged for her marriage with another man. Police said that a few weeks ago Meganathan had sent the pictures he took with her to the groom-to-be. This resulted in the boy’s family calling off the wedding. Subsequently, the girl lodged a complaint at the Vadamadurai all-woman police station. Police traced him to Chennai and brought him to Dindigul. Police said the girl’s family urged them not to register a case but to let him off with a warning not to disturb her, which they got in writing from him. However, late on Friday night, Meganathan went to her house with his friends and picked up an altercation with the girl’s family. Her brother Gunaseelan, 21, his relative Kalidas, 36, and four others attacked Meganathan with knives and beat him. The man suffered three cut injuries including one on his neck. He was admitted to Dindigul MCH. Based on his complaint, Eriodu police registered a case against his six attackers and arrested Gunaseelan and Kalidas on Saturday. The same evening, the girl lodged a complaint with the Eriodu police claiming that Meganathan tried to attack her and that her relatives were trying to protect her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-attacked-by-lovers-kin-for-stopping-her-wedding/articleshow/85960413.cms||---

The NCC unit has now constructed separate barracks with a capacity to accommodate 350 boys and 250 girls respectively, at its campus. A senior NCC officer said, “In the absence of such barracks, we were forced to opt for makeshift arrangements but the same were causing inconvenience to the cadets. The tents offer limited space and do not have facilities, such as bathrooms, toilets, etc.” “The regimental funds of the NCC have been utilised for constructing the barracks,” the officer added. About 35 camps of durations ranging from 5 to 15 days are conducted in a year at the NCC campus. In total, over a thousand cadets attend these camps. “The new facility has not been used owing to closure of training activities due to Covid-19 restrictions,” the officer stated. “Parents would express their concern over the makeshift living arrangements and lack of facilities during the camps. Now, their concerns have been addressed,” said another NCC officer. The group headquarters has also created a dedicated facility for the Associate NCC Officers (ANOs) on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncc-pune-unit-constructs-separate-barracks-for-cadets-attending-camps/articleshow/85960418.cms||Sandip Dighe

This is the highest monthly vaccination figure recorded by the district health office. Earlier, July held the record for the highest vaccination with 17.81 lakh doses being administered across government and private sites. According to health department officials, the number would have been much higher had the vaccine supply in the first half of August been more consistent. An official from the health department said that the second half of August included the mega vaccination drive and gave a much-needed boost to the district. The drive was held on August 31 and it benefited around 2.58 lakh beneficiaries, largely from the rural areas in Pune district. Sanjay Patil, chairman of IMA’s hospital board of India, said, “The health department and the administration must set a target of 20 lakh vaccinations, per month to cover the entire eligible population in the district at the earliest. The only issue we are struggling with is the consistency of vaccine availability. If we can address vaccine availability, the figures from Pune will be highest in the state.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, had earlier said that the district is likely to get around 20 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin in September. Thereby, coupled with the private vaccination effort, the August figures could easily be surpassed. Meanwhile, as many as 19,176 beneficiaries were vaccinated on Sunday. According to the district immunisation office, new stock of Covishield and Covaxin will be made available on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-18-80l-aug-records-highest-vaccination/articleshow/85960457.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||3 family members of Covid-19 patient test positive; Delta still active, say docs||Nagpur: Reports of three family members of the Narendra Nagar resident, who tested positive for Covid-19 on September 3, came positive on Sunday. Two of the three family members had taken both doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The third member is a 4-year-old girl in the family. On the same lines, three members of a Chandan Nagar-based family tested positive on September 3. Officials said that more than one member of a family testing positive was quite common during the peak of the second wave, when the Delta variant was active in Vidarbha. Doctors said Delta variant is still active in Vidarbha and hence family members of positive patients are getting infected. “Delta is still very much active across Vidarbha region and all over the world. However, we have to see for at least 10 days how their disease progresses,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. Though members from the same family testing positive is a cause of worry, it has a strong positive side too. Genome sequencing is the only way to confirm the variant. But, experts said their experience suggests present cases are Delta cases. Vaccines are working effectively on Delta variants too, observed the doctors. “Vaccinated positive patients have no symptoms. Some members from the same family have tested negative too. This shows vaccines do work. They are effective on Delta variant,” said Dr Shinde. NMC authorities had taken action on war footing as soon as the patient tested positive on September 3. They took more than 120 samples from the neighbourhood. None of them tested positive. Doctors said this could be due to physical distancing practised in the apartment. DOCTORS ASKED TO BE CAREFUL A senior intensive care specialist, who also heads a Covid care facility in a leading private hospital of Nagpur, told TOI that two doctors have tested positive in the last five days in city and they were infected through patients in out-patient departments (OPDs). “I have alerted doctors who work in OPDs to follow Covid protocol after these two incidents. The doctors are already vaccinated and having nothing more than mild symptoms. But, being casual in OPD is still dangerous,” said the doctor. BOX ONE CASE, MANY CONCLUSIONS Vaccine good | Patient who tested +ve on Sept 3 had taken 1 jab 1 jab worked | Though positive, he had only mild symptoms, required no hospitalization or oxygen Seniors saved | Two 65+ members in family tested negative, both had taken both doses Positive but strong | 2 middle-aged members (under 35) in family tested positive, but no symptoms Kids safe | 4-yr-old girl found positive; but no symptoms; recovering now Distancing worked | Neighbours, flat mates followed physical distancing; 120+ of them negative||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-family-members-of-covid-19-patient-test-positive-delta-still-active-say-docs/articleshow/85960487.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Madurai||Two villages in Madurai fully covered by central pension, accident plans||MADURAI: Two hamlets, Chinnamanaikkenpatti and Thumichampatti, in Madurai district have managed to fully enrol their eligible members in three key social security schemes of the central government which entitle them to accident coverage and pension. Various social security schemes including Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Atal pension scheme and Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) are being implemented for the benefit of the rural people. People pay annual premiums ranging from Rs 12 to Rs 300 or more, which will give them accident cover benefits up to Rs 2 lakh. The PMSBY is implemented for those above 70 while PMJJYBY is for the 18 to 50 age group, where they have to pay an annual premium of Rs 330 or more. The Atal pension scheme aims at ensuring a better retirement life for the elderly, especially from the unorganised sector. Many villagers who work as agricultural coolies and construction industries among others come under this category. They invest between 18 to 40 years of age and get a monthly pension ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000 based on their investment. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said that only 5% of the population benefited from these social security schemes while the remaining 95% did not know how to avail of it or were unaware of it. It was in this context that officials of Union Bank of India took the schemes to the doorsteps of the villagers and covered all the eligible people ensuring social security. The two villages of Chinnamanaikkenpatti and Thumichampatti in Andipatti panchayat in Vadipatti panchayat union were fully covered. Thus the people there were secure in terms of their medical expenses and old-age pension. The collector complemented the representatives of the local bodies including the panchayat presidents and bank officials for achieving the task. Chinnamanikkenpatti had 654 people living in 191 houses and Thumichampatti just 191 people in 72 houses. Sources said that the small size of the population had made it possible to achieve this for the entire eligible people with the help of the panchayat representatives. Panchayat president A Meenal Asaithambi had also instilled awareness in her people about the benefits of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/two-villages-fully-covered-by-central-pension-accident-plans/articleshow/85960461.cms||---

Garbage dumping has been a continuing problem around the old palace, and local people say that they were hopeful that the Smart City projects being implemented around the Meenakshi Amman temple that also includes the Mahal area, would bring a solace to the issue. G Venkatesh, a resident of Mahal fifth street, said that the people who had been living in the streets had given up hope of seeing a beautification of the exterior of the Mahal. “When newspapers report the issue, the very next day corporation officials come and remove the bins and spread bleaching powder in the area. But, the bins arrive the very next day and the menace continues,” he said. “Garbage is making the place ugly, and in addition the entire area emanates urine smell. People still urinate on the walls of the major tourist attraction,” C Hari Saravanan from Chennai who visited the Mahal with his family said. Huge dumps of garbage are seen in all the streets around the Mahal, including, Palmal Cross Street, Panthadi 1st street, Mahal 5th street, Mahal fourth street, Mahal Vadampokki street on Sunday evening. Madurai Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said they were trying their best to make people dispose of their garbage properly.

Swimmers and trainers have been the most affected by the pandemic compared to other sportspersons. In Madurai, as many as 45 swimmers regularly attend professional swimming competitions and train under Tamil Nadu State Aquatic Association. So far, around 30 swimmers have returned to training. “We expect the others to also turn up eventually. But there have been no competitive events for two years. Timings of swimmers have dropped and they haven’t been able to get to their previous best. It will take at least a year of regular training for them to get their speed and endurance back,” said association district secretary N Kannan. Swimmers too said they hadn’t been able to work out properly on their fitness. “We have workouts to practise on dry land too to build strength and endurance. At first it was a bit tough, but once gyms reopened, we could work out there. Even then, it is not the same as in water. I have not been able to reach my best timing immediately after coming back. It will take some time to pick up,” said P R Chandru, a second year college student and a national level medallist. “I’ve been swimming for 10 years. It was tough but I tried to continue training outside when swimming pools were closed. Hopefully, we can be prepared for the state-level meet next month,” B Roshini, 13, another national-level swimmer, said..  “Usually, several swimmers of ours get picked up for nationals but this time we are not sure of the performance of swimmers. Also, because of lack of competitions, many talented swimmers have also been unable to qualify to get sports quota in colleges over the past two years,” said Kannan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/swimmers-struggle-to-get-back-timings/articleshow/85960509.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Nagpur||Doctors, kin prod mucor survivors to move on in life||Nagpur: Rahul (33), an employee of a public sector bank, continues to be on leave since May when he tested Covid positive. Rahul lost an eye to black fungus in post-Covid period. Fear of how his colleagues would react to his disfigured face forced Rahul to extend his leave, said a relative. Rishi, working with a public sector undertaking, is still fearful of getting infected again and stays at home. ENT specialist Dr Shweta Lohiya said many survivors are still not able to cope up with normal activities. “The main issue is they are not able to integrate into normal life,” she said. Last week, Kingsway Hospital organized a mucor survivors’ meet after doctors started getting a range of queries from anxious patients and relatives. “Everyone is curious about rehabilitation. But, it will take at least six months. We have given temporary prothesis and obturators. For permanent rehab, we need to be sure they are disease-free or at least off the anti-fungal medicines for next three months,” said Dr Lohiya. During the meet, the doctors brought on stage mucor survivors who had accepted the new life and returned to their daily activities. One of the survivors narrated how he came out of Covid only to be hit by mucor. “He survived death twice,” said a relative. Dr Lohiya added that medical issues were taken care of by team of doctors. “Mid-aged survivors are the ones mostly struggling to get back to normal life. They complain of weakness or fear reinfection. Some have moved on after counselling,” she said. Sanjeev (56) had two operations following which he lost an eye, jaw and teeth. “Right eyeball was removed while some complications still persist near the left eye. We keep motivating him to go out, so that he doesn’t keep brooding over what has happened,” said his son. Maxillofacial surgeon Dr Vipin Dehane said the second wave of Covid triggered a tsunami of mucormycosis. “The black fungus left behind a trail of destruction. Every patient’s life was prioritised without hesitation. We hope, after a year mucor survivors’ meet will turn into mucor rehabilitation meet with prosthesis. Hence, we need time to plan rehabilitation. We want their disability to turn into super-ability,” he said. Dr Dehane said in case of routine dentures and implants, the surgeon has the original jaw to replicate. “In post-mucor cases, we don’t have the key parts. Hence, patient-specific and customized implants are being designed through stereolithographic model — a 3D image of the face mimicking the original. Implants will be fitted on the model first and then in the patient,” he said. Many of these patients would need full mouth prosthesis, he added. Dr Dehane, a consultant at Kingsway Hospital, said the survivors were shown videos from Paralympics to keep them spirited. “We told them to give us time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-kin-prod-mucor-survivors-to-move-on-in-life/articleshow/85960568.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||No probe in a NE riot case since Oct, charge not backed yet: Court||New Delhi: A city court has noted that police have not investigated a case of the northeast Delhi riots any further since October last year in which the accused was booked under a penal section that entails a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said the offence under IPC Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) was not made out at all from the material produced on record by police. However, the court framed charges for the offences of rioting, unlawful assembly and criminal conspiracy against Gulfam in the case related to alleged damage to the infrastructure of a hall on February 25, 2020 by a riotous mob in Dayalpur. “It is also relevant to note that till date the investigating agency has not been able to apprehend/arrest any other accused person in the matter, meaning thereby that no progress/further investigation has so far been made. The investigating agency is still standing on the same square that it did when the accused was enlarged on bail by this court vide order dated October 14, 2020,” said the court. It further noted that the complainant had not stated a single word regarding committing mischief by fire or explosive substance by the riotous mob in his hall. The court said it was beyond comprehension that under what provision(s) had the investigating agency imported the statements of witnesses recorded in another case. “At this stage, even if the said issue is kept off the burner and the statements are considered on their face value, then also no ingredients of Section 436 IPC are getting made out therefrom. There is no eyewitness(es) of the incident in question. Furthermore, there is no CCTV footage/video clip of the incident available on record,” the court said. During the hearing, the counsel for the accused claimed that Gulfam was falsely implicated in the matter and besides his own disclosure statement, there was no other incriminating evidence to connect him with the commission of the crime. Police had stated that the accused was arrested after he gave a disclosure statement in another case in which he was arrested earlier. It was alleged that he was found to be an active member of the riotous mob on the date and time of the incident in the locality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-probe-in-a-ne-riot-case-since-oct-charge-not-backed-yet-court/articleshow/85958164.cms||Usha Das

A decision to this effect was taken by senior city police officers keeping in view that the old parts of the city account for maximum Ganesh mandals and attract people in large numbers during the 10-day festival, which commences from September 10. These police station areas collectively account for 2,000 of Pune’s 3,000 registered mandals, Deputy commissioner of police (Zone-I) Priyanka Narnaware said, “A constable or a police officer will adopt Ganapati mandals in specific areas. It will be their responsibility to check the size of the pandal, how the festival is being celebrated etc. They will ensure that there is no crowding during prayers (aartis) and other rituals. Not more than five persons are allowed inside the pandals or temples”. “The policemen are required to maintain a chart of daily visits to these pandals and they will keep a check if the mandal members are wearing masks or following other Covid guidelines,” Narnaware said. “The Ganapati mandals having temples are required to celebrate the festival on the temple premises only, and mandals, with no temples, can have a small pandal at their designated place,” she said. “The constables or officers who have adopted the mandals will ensure that the members do not carry out installation and immersion procession,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-will-adopt-mandals-for-better-ncov-management/articleshow/85960536.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh teacher uses 10% salary on menstrual hygiene awareness||PRAYAGRAJ: Four years ago, when a close relative died due to lack of proper menstrual hygiene and inadequate sanitation, Vandana Singh wasted no time in launching a battle to spread awareness among rural women on the issue to save lives. She started distributing sanitary pads among women in rural areas and gives away 500 to 1,000 pads once in a week now. Vandana, an English lecturer at Chandra Shekhar Azad Inter College, Puravnara, (Soraon), devotes all her spare time to her mission. She takes along sanitary pads wherever she goes and distributes it among women. Till now, she has distributed over 1.25 lakh sanitary pads and aims to touch the 5 lakh-mark. Now famous as the ‘Pad Woman’ of the city, Vandana, spends about 10% of her salary every month purchasing sanitary pads. “Sanitation and hygiene are very important for women during menstruation and can be a matter of life and death. Lack of proper sanitation during the menstrual cycle can develop severe illness,” said Vandana. “When I started distributing sanitary pads among rural women, people used to crack jokes on me. I continued to inform rural women about menstrual hygiene and gave them sanitary pads for free,” she added. “Women and girls in rural areas are still not aware about don’t know about menstrual hygiene and end up suffering. We need to spread awareness,” said Vandana. “When I started counselling women, some people even passed lewd comments and said ‘Ek aurat hokar aisi batein karti hai’,” recalls Vandana. “But I did not lose courage and continued my work and gradually succeeded in my endeavours,” she added. She also bought five sewing machines for girls and women to impart training to make sanitary pads and become self-reliant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pad-woman-spreading-awarenesson-menstrual-hygiene-to-save-lives/articleshow/85956058.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Underground tank to ease waterlogging woes at ITO||NEW DELHI: The Public Works Department (PWD) is planning to set up an underground tank with a capacity to hold 2.5 lakh litres rainwater in an attempt to solve the waterlogging problem at ITO near the World Health Organization office on Ring Road. This site is one of the 147 critical points for waterlogging in the city. Despite four diesel pumps being deployed there, this stretch remains inundated for hours even after moderate rainfall. Officials said carrying of the excess rainwater runoff remains slow due to a sewage treatment plant (STP) on the outfall of the sewage line leading to the Yamuna. According to the plan, the excess runoff would be collected in the underground tank that would be created on the green belt near the WHO office. This water would then be released in the river. The tendering process of the underground tank is likely to be carried out next month. PWD stated that the sump would be constructed before the 2022 monsoon. In July 2020, heavy rain had led to overflowing of the drain near the WHO office and washed away 10 jhuggies. At that time, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and PWD had blamed the incident on a wall built on the drain. The Ring Road stretch near WHO figures in the list of seven top vulnerable locations, which are directly monitored at the PWD headquarters. PWD, in a report, stated that waterlogging at this site was mainly due to overflow of the Delhi Jal Board sewer near the Indraprastha subway opposite the WHO office. As the area was also low lying, it further compounded the problem. As a short-term solution, regular monitoring was carried out by field units and the PWD control room and four tractor-mounted pumps with a capacity of 25hp and five temporary diesel pumps were deployed there. Out of the 147 vulnerable points identified for waterlogging, the situation remains particularly troublesome at seven locations where PWD has introduced remedial measures like installing CCTV cameras and sensors and redesigning of drains. Another 50 critical points were added in the second phase where corrective measures would be taken. The civic body would also run these points on software made by IIT-Delhi for the new drainage master plan. PWD has spent around Rs 75 lakh on measures like sensors, CCTV cameras, new motors and alternate drain in case of Minto Bridge and around Rs 70 lakh would be spent on Pul Prahladpur underpass. The first phase of the exercise at seven locations is expected to be completed by February 2022 and the second phase by December 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/underground-tank-to-ease-waterlogging-woes-at-ito/articleshow/85958143.cms||Paras Singh

Of these, 11,235 illegal borewells have been sealed while the remaining 8,426 are yet to be sealed.DPCC has imposed an environmental compensation of Rs 70.65 crore on over 18,000 violators. Of the Rs 70.65 crore, only Rs 23.8 lakh has been recovered till August 31 with DPCC claiming that recovery has been slow due to the Covid pandemicAt a meeting by the chief secretary on illegal extraction of groundwater, it was decided that Delhi Jal Board would prepare the list of illegal borewells while the revenue department would supervise the closure action of such illegal borewells. DPCC was assigned the task to impose environmental damage compensation on the violators as per the list provided by DJB.DPCC, in its report, stated: “Due to the continuing pandemic, the process of recovery is very slow and revenue authorities are not able to spare their manpower for taking action. Many units had mentioned their inability or delay in depositing the environmental damage compensation due to the Covid pandemic and low economic activity during the last few months since March 2020. They have also mentioned that the unprecedented health crisis and emergency, coupled with steep downfall in the revenue earning due to the lockdown, has brought down the economic activities to the lowest level.”DPCC added, “In case of remaining units, recovery certificates were issued to the concerned district magistrates/SDMs, to recover the amount as arrears of land revenue from the remaining units which have not deposited environmental damages compensation.”The data by DPCC showed that of the total 19,661 identified illegal borewells, the highest were found in North-West district (8,299), followed by South-West district (6,681). North-West district, meanwhile, has acted against 5,814 illegal borewells but 2,485 are yet to be sealed.Similarly, out of the 6,681 illegal borewells in South-West district, only 1,410 have been sealed till August 31 while 5,271 are still left to be sealed.The Central Ground Water Board, in its 2019 report, had declared North-West and South-West districts to be in the semi-critical category with groundwater withdrawal far exceeding recharging by rain.According to the status report, North-East is the only district where no illegal borewell has been identified.

---||Goa||FC Goa aim high in Durand Cup||Panaji: FC Goa have been very attractive to watch. They are every neutral’s favourites. But for the brand of football they have played, all that they have to show is ISL League Winners Shield and the Super Cup in seven years. Coach Juan Ferrando now has a chance to add another trophy to their cabinet, the Durand Cup, Asia’s oldest football tournament. Goa start their campaign against Army Green at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on Tuesday. Ferrando has made his intentions clear by fielding one of the strongest teams in the 16-team competition. “Last season was a big problem because it was a shorter season. Now we have a good opportunity to work together with all the team. The players want to come to work with us, with the team. This is the intention to work together, to improve the team,” Ferrando told TOI in an online interaction on Monday. Fellow Indian Super League side Jamshedpur FC and I-League outfit Sudeva Delhi FC are clubbed along with Goa. Kerala Blasters have also fielded a strong squad while other ISL teams -- Bengaluru FC and Hyderabad FC -- are giving their reserves a chance. Goa will be led by Spaniard Edu Bedia, now into his fifth season and the club's longest serving foreign player. Jorge Ortiz, Alberto Noguera and Ivan Gonzalez are the other three Spanish players in the team. Goa have also shown faith in their youngsters and have promoted five players -- Hrithik Tiwari, Lalmangaihsanga (Papuia), Brison Fernandes, Christy Davis and Delton Colaco -- from last season’s developmental team. “We are thinking about the developmental players to include in the first team because it is good for us. Goa has a good academy and wants to improve day by day. Edu, Jorge, Ortiz, Alberto are coming with us and they are like second teachers for us,” said Ferrando. New signings include Nongdomba Naorem from Kerala Blasters, Kunal Kundaikar from Sporting Clube de Goa and Manushawn Fernandes from Youth Club of Manora. “It is very good because training by training, day by day the young players know about the position of professional players in the team when we are working together," said Ferrando. Goa, though, will have to adjust to the ground conditions, besides the 3pm kickoff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-aim-high-in-durand-cup/articleshow/85989908.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Van Adhyapak, an innovative scheme, was first initiated in 2016-2017, at Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) but it was not implemented on a full scale. Ravikiran Govekar, CCF & field director, said that uniformed frontline staff, right from forest guards to higher officers, will regularly visit nearby schools and educate students on importance of wildlife, forest, environment and its conservation. “Unlike celebrating certain days on an ad-hoc basis, this is a continuous activity carried out by trained forest staff/teachers. The motto is ‘Van Rakshak-Van Shikshak’ who would be the future ambassadors of conservation,” said Prabhunath Shukla, deputy director, Pench. Proper inputs, at local level, in local language with local examples would help build a generation of conservationist. Apart from forest staff, some green teachers from schools are being trained to make this programme more inclusive, broad-based and sustainable. The formal launch was held at Sillari in the presence of Ravindra Thakare, additional tribal commissioner, Nagpur, and Yogesh Kumbhojkar, ZP CEO, Nagpur. The participants included frontline staff, school teachers, students and other officers. Kumbhojkar said that in the backdrop of climate change and depletion of natural resources, such programmes must be promoted. Thakare termed it a good initiative in which forest department tries to join hands with other stakeholders. “For success of government policies, inter-departmental coordination and joint action are must,” said Thakare. The commissioner appreciated the efforts of forest department to reach the rural students and assured to support this programme in various schools in tribal areas under his jurisdiction. “If the outcome is positive, the scheme will be replicated in other tiger-bearing areas and wildlife areas in the state. Currently, there are about 35 van adhyapaks in Pench, besides 15 in Bor Tiger Reserve and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary,” said Govekar. Several other activities such as nursery development, plantation, field activity-based learning etc will be taken up. On Sunday, selected van adhyapaks were given the certificate of induction. Two van adhyapaks – forest guard Varsha Jagtap and Ajay Chute of Kolitmara ashram school made presentations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/penchs-van-adhyapaks-to-educate-students-on-wildlife/articleshow/85960594.cms||---
---||Delhi||4 men arrested for duping 13 Army officers of crores||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has busted an elaborate fraud wherein Army officers, who were members of Army Group Insurance Fund, were targeted on the pretext of disbursal of their pending insurance bonus in lieu of a “processing fee”.One of the victims, Colonel G M Khan from Army Service Corps, had paid Rs 1.02 crore to the fraudsters till date. According to special commissioner (EOW) Devesh Srivastava, a total of 54 army officials were targeted in similar fashion of which 13 fell prey to the accused.The arrested kingpin, Raj Rajput alias Rupesh, is a former call centre owner. His aides have been identified as Prabhat, Ram Sagar and Ram Naresh. The suspects were nabbed from different parts of Delhi, Faridabad and Kanpur. “The men were produced before the court and taken on remand for questioning. The gang is involved in a number of such cases in Maharashtra, Chennai, Hyderabad and Chandigarh,” Srivastava said.The cops started their investigation after it came to fore that the fraudsters were calling up Army veterans for the release of some monetary benefits from the AGIF (Army Group Insurance Fund). “They made telephone calls to the pensioners/next of kin by promising them large sums of money in the range of Rs 3-4 lakh from AGIF and demanded very small amounts of Rs 30,000-40,000 in advance in the form of processing fees for releasing the funds,” the senior officer explained.After receiving the advance amount, the callers disappeared by switching off their mobile phones. Other Army officers were also targeted by the alleged persons and 12 more officers deposited varying amounts in the bank accounts as per the instructions of these cheats.After an FIR was registered by EOW, more than 50 bank accounts were analysed, apart from verification of all the available addresses of the account holders and the phone numbers used by the offenders.“Probe revealed that the accounts in which the said processing fees was credited had been opened by accused Ram Naresh and Ram Sagar in the names of various firms on rented address. The cheated amount was then withdrawn in cash immediately either through ATMs or cheques. Analysis of bank accounts revealed that one of the accused, Prabhat Kumar, was withdrawing cash through self cheques,” DCP (EOW) K Ramesh said.Over 50 bank accounts had been opened in the names of proprietorship/partnership firms registered on rental addresses assuming banks won’t make enquiries for the frequent deposits in the account of firms. These account numbers were then made available to the victims for depositing the “processing fees” that was demanded.For making the calls to the victims, the accused used mobile numbers taken on fake KYC documents and addresses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-men-arrested-for-duping-13-army-officers-of-crores/articleshow/85958206.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Garbage battle lags as landfills struggle to meet targets||NEW DELHI: Out of the 280 lakh tonnes of legacy waste currently dumped across the capital’s three landfill sites — Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur — only 12% have been processed by July 31, according to a report prepared by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). While the Bhalswa landfill site has managed to meet its deadline of processing 25% waste using bioremediation and trommel machines, the other two landfills are still lagging behind and likely to miss their initial deadlines, data shows. According to the DPCC report, which has been also submitted to the Union jal shakti ministry, 33.1 lakh tonnes of legacy waste were processed at these three landfill sites by July 31 this year. The action plan submitted by the municipal corporations to National Green Tribunal (NGT) has mentioned deadlines for remediation of legacy waste at three sites. The DPCC report shows the deadline for 25% remediation of legacy waste at the Okhla landfill site is October 2021, but just 10.4% waste have been processed by July 31. Of the total 60 lakh tonnes of legacy waste present at the Okhla landfill, 6.3 lakh tonnes have been converted into inert by July 31 by using a total of 18 trommel machines. Similarly, the Ghazipur landfill site has remediated 7.6 lakh tonnes of legacy waste by July, out of total 140 lakh tonnes. It will have to process around 27.4 lakh tonnes by March next year to meet the first deadline. At Bhalswa, around 80 lakh tonnes were dumped as on July 2019, but only around 19.2 lakh tonnes were processed by July. It has almost met its target of 25% remediation and will require to process a total of 40 lakh tonne waste by this October to meet its 50% target. The corporations had earlier informed NGT that 100% of remediation of legacy waste would be done by June 2022 at Bhalswa, by March 2023 at Okhla and by December 2024 at Ghazipur. A total of 62 trommel machines have been engaged at these dumpsites for processing waste. In 2019, NGT had taken cognisance of a TOI report that had highlighted how leachate from the three landfill sites was impacting the groundwater near these sites as well as contaminating the nearby drains that empty into the Yamuna. NGT had ordered the three corporations and Delhi government to create an escrow account and prepare a Rs 250-crore plan to bioremediate all three landfill sites and reduce their height. Highlighting the Indore model where a 15-lakh-metric-tonne landfill site was flattened in three years using trommel machines, NGT had asked all three corporations to use the same technology in Delhi. The corporations, however, have been reaching out to the green body, as well as other authorities, including the lieutenant governor, for more land. The corporations claim shortage for fresh sites is making it difficult to empty the processed inert material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/garbage-battle-lags-as-landfills-struggle-to-meet-targets/articleshow/85958198.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Nagpur||New normal is normal, awareness about post-Covid complications too||Nagpur: The first case of Covid-19 in Vidarbha was detected in March 2020. Almost after 18 months and two devastating waves of the pandemic, the biggest lesson learnt is that we as a society have to live with the virus, accept the new normal and deal effectively with post-Covid complications. Be it the black fungus, lung fibrosis or strokes due to thrombosis – people are aware of most post Covid-complications by now. Common complications like fatigue, hair fall, headache and weakness are known and people are going for treatment. Namdev Jadhav, a retired government servant, said that two months after recovery, he was still suffering from breathlessness. “I visited my family doctor, who suggested angiography. Thanks to this, the clot was detected and treated quite early,” he said. Realising the importance of post-Covid treatment, many hospitals have started dedicated post-Covid units. “After noticing a major surge in complications, we thought a dedicated team of doctors with proper approach should look after such patients. Hence, a post Covid care centre was launched,” said Dr Ashok Arbat of KRIMS hospital. “Many post-Covid patients presenting with common symptoms like headache or breathlessness could be suffering from some major complication like clot. Patients as well as doctors have learned a lesson that post Covid, one has to be more careful,” said pulmonologist Dr Parimal Deshpande. According to him, complications regarding lung capacity have increased significantly after the second wave. Practicing pathologist Dr Apurva Donadkar said that people visit labs on their own and ask for some tests post-Covid. “People ask for IgG antibody tests or complete blood count (CBC), vitamin D tests. However, these tests should be suggested by qualified physician,” she said. During the second wave, many people underwent chest scans more than once. “We had to tell them that frequent scans are dangerous. People have learned their lessons. The demand for HRCT has gone down,” said radiologist Dr Dinesh Kamble. Those who work in community medicine field said that public awareness about vaccine is also high. “Earlier, the response was low in rural areas. Now there are several villages where 100% eligible population is vaccinated. The realization that vaccines will bring back normalcy is the most important lesson,” said Dr Amol Pinge who works in a rural PHC. Still, many are still struggling with the basics. They are still not wearing masks, not following physical distancing and not washing hands more frequently. The most basic lesson is following Covid-appropriate behaviour. It is being unlearned by many, which may pose new danger. Living with Covid - Covid-19 is here to stay, there will be no Zero Covid condition at all - Living with Covid is the only option and we must prepare us for it - Vaccine is the biggest weapon to bring back life to normal - Post-Covid complications are real and many will face them in future - Basic Covid-appropriate behaviour will have to continue for a long time||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-normal-is-normal-awareness-about-post-covid-complications-too/articleshow/85960626.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Pune||102 pupils across Maharashtra with 100% marks in SSC enter ITIs||PUNE: As many as 102 students who scored 100% in the secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) examination this year have figured in the final merit list for admissions to industrial training institutes in Maharashtra. The list was announced on Sunday while the allotment of colleges will be announced on September 7 when the cut-off for government and private training institutes would be known. Higher employability, introduction of courses such as robotics, data analytics, artificial intelligence which have high demand in the market have led to the cream of the batch turning towards ITIs. Aspirant Asmita Natu, who secured 91.22 % in SSC is trying for a seat in ITI Aundh. She said, "I am very sure about what I want to pick and choose as a career and hence without wasting my two years doing junior college in contemporary arts, science and commerce courses I have decided to build a career in mechatronics. There is a lot of future there and I feel that the ITI course will build a very strong foundation for me." Admissions in-charge at the state Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET), said Yogesh Patil, “ There are many advantages of the ITI courses and the topmost is that the duration of course is just about one to two years. The possibility of employment after completing the courses is very high so students prefer to join the course.” The DVET has introduced many courses based on changing trends which includes robotics, agriculture and others which is also seen in high demand. Courses in motor mechanic, electrician, tool and dye maker, refrigeration are also popular. The trend is noticeable since the seats for engineering courses have not found many takers. In fact, the All India Council of Technical Education has been receiving several applications from colleges and institutions to shut down their courses due to poor demand. Many government ITIs have been sought-after and the cut-off has been above 90 at the end of the first round of the merit list. The quality of education imparted is also commendable which has been attracting the students, said Patil. ITIs are looking at centres of excellence in emerging areas like automobile, production & manufacturing, non-conventional energy sources, CNC/CAD/CAM and information technology. The DVET encourages ITIs to develop human resources to reduce the mismatch between demand and supply of manpower in engineering, IT, agriculture, paramedical, home science, trade & commerce. The department looks to reduce unemployment among youth by equipping them for suitable industrial and self & wage employment through this training. Among the other initiatives, the department has established ties with industry and institutes, research and development organizations, contacted alumni for apprenticeships. For a dynamic learning environment, the department arranges quality development programmes for principals, teachers, instructors, staff and students, the website said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/102-pupils-across-state-with-100-marks-in-ssc-enter-itis/articleshow/85960682.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||Delhi Police bust fake franchise racket, arrest 4||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Cyber Cell has busted a gang which allegedly duped people through fake websites of well-known brands by offering their franchises. Four people, including a web designer, have been arrested and 17 bank accounts frozen. The mastermind was identified as one Vikas Mistry from Nalanda in Bihar. His aides has been identified as Vinay Vikram Singh from Faridabad, who is the CEO of a digital marketing company based in Gurugram. The other two accused are Santosh Kumar and Vinay Kumar. According to the cops, 126 cyber fraud incidents across 16 states have been found linked to this gang, which operated multiple fake websites of iconic brands, offering dealership and distributorship to aspiring businessmen who dreamt of having their own outlet of a well-known firm. A young businesswoman was searching online for such business opportunities when she landed on one such fake website of Haldiram. She immediately connected on the mobile number given on the website and was guided over the next few days through several steps, including filling up of forms, submission of documents, etc. The woman was also asked to pay for various charges such as application form processing, document verification, security deposit, brand-name usage, hardware advance, site-inspection fee, among others. She ended up paying Rs 11.74 lakh over a period of two months during which she was repeatedly guided by the crooks masquerading as officials of Haldiram. It was only when she was asked to pay another Rs 1.6 lakh on a flimsy ground that she realised that she was being conned by the fraudsters. “She reported the fraud to the cops and the Cyber Cell took up the probe. It was found that a large number of websites was running in the name of M/s Haldiram and offering franchisee against consideration of huge amounts. Based on the technical surveillance, it was also found that a large number of people across the country had become victims of such fake websites,” a senior officer claimed. Cops found that the fraudsters used multiple bank accounts and a large number of bogus SIM cards to cheat the people. After deep surveillance, four suspects involved in the crime were arrested. The accused persons developed such impersonating websites, then got similar-sounding domains registered, and also enlisted and promoted these fake sites through Google Ads for higher ranking and visibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-runs-fakes-of-brand-sites-4-held/articleshow/85958267.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli problem tiger ‘identified’, capture order issued||Nagpur: The chief wildlife warden (CWLW) Sunil Limaye has granted permission to capture the problem tiger of Gadchiroli, which has fatally attacked at least five persons. Experts, however, fear the human-animal conflict may worsen with at least 10 problem leopards captured from Chandrapur being dumped in the tribal district in little over last one year. On September 2, the CWLW issued an order to capture one of the sub-adult male cubs of a tigress with four cubs. On August 31, permission was given to capture a tiger from Halda in Bramhapuri under alleged political pressure. A problem leopard from here was released in Gadchiroli in mid-August without following any protocol. NGOs questioned if the leopard was a problem animal and captured, why a tiger is being caught from the same area? Conservator of forest (CF) Kishore Mankar said that the two-year-old tiger moving in Porla and Wadsa ranges in Gadchiroli is responsible for three human kills in last 10 days. Mankar said they have identified the “culprit animal” from camera trap images. “Two teams along with local people are deployed to track the problem tiger. Two trap cages have been installed in Churchura and Gogaon. We are seeking a rapid rescue team help from Tadoba,” said Mankar. On August 15, Dambaji Dongre from Churchura in Porla range was killed. On August 19, Pundlik Nikure, Bhikarmausi in Chatgaon range was mauled followed by Ramaji Choudhari from Gogaon in Porla on August 25. Mankar said the sub-adult tiger is suspected to have killed two persons earlier too. In the last eight months, seven persons have been killed by big cats in Gadchiroli with the latest one being mauled by a leopard in Yella in Aheri range on September 4. Mankar said the victim, Mutta Tekulwar (55), was killed by a leopard around 7pm when he was going to catch fish. People saw a leopard in the same area and there were also pugmarks at the spot. Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel said that Yella is the endpoint of the Aheri range bordering Chaprala wildlife sanctuary. As reported by TOI on August 26, at least four problem leopards captured from Chandrapur and Bramhapuri divisions have been clandestinely released in Gadchiroli in July-August. “This may further trigger man-animal conflict,” said Patel. As per the evidence with TOI, from June 14, 2019 till August 31, 2021, nine problem leopards were released in Gadchiroli. This included six females and three males. Most of the animals were released in Chaprala wildlife sanctuary having 36 villages in and around. The MoEFCC guidelines say that if at all captured problem leopards are to be released back into the wild, it should be done within their home range. On August 3, a male leopard was trapped in Saoli. In July 13, it had killed a woman while she was sleeping in the front yard of her house. On July 14, the leopard mauled a farmer from Samda while he was working on his farm. Another woman was mauled while she was sleeping in her house in Wagholi Buti on July 20. Vyahad, Samda, Wagholi Buti, Konapur and Kapsi villages were reeling under leopard threat.

---||Nagpur||Orange growers hope for high returns, premature dropping a concern||NAGPUR: The region’s orange growers hope to cover up the losses due to Covid in the forthcoming season that begins in October. But they are worried about large-scale premature dropping of the fruits, which leads to wastage. In premature dropping, the fruits simply fall off the tree before being plucked. It has been happening since years but government research agencies have not been able to provide any solution, say farmers. In October, the Ambiya variety of oranges reach the market. Given the trends in advance contracts, farmers expect anything between Rs25,000 to Rs30,000 a tonne as against the average price of Rs15,000 fetched last year. “This is because the flowering of the ambiya crop, which begins from January-February, was low, indicating a reduction in output as compared to last year. This also firmed up prices for this year and farmers expect to get a better price when oranges reach the market,” said Manoj Jawanjal, a director of Mahaorange, a state government entity engaged in promotion and exploring new markets for the orange crop. The going may not be as good for the Mrug season of orange which begins from February. The flowering indicates that Mrug may not even be 75% of the last year. This may ultimately not leave much in the farmers’ hands even as the market prices are expected to be much high, said sources in orange business. Jawanjal said that dropping of fruits remains a concern while sharing a video of an orchard with fruits strewn all over. “A meeting was held at the Central Citrus Research Institute where the angry farmers said they have been strictly following protocol suggested by experts, but it has not helped in preventing the dropping,” he said. In the video, a farmer is seen saying that orange growers have been grappling with the problem of early dropping since 6-7 years but the research institute has failed to help. Rajesh Chabrani, a fruit trader and a member of agriculture produce marketing committee (APMC), at Kalamana, said that last year the prices were in the range of Rs5,000 to Rs12,000 a tonne. Now, as the crop arrives next month at least Rs20,000 is expected. Even farmers who have cultivated mosambi (sweat lime) are complaining of losses due to dropping. Amit Mahant from Katol said that he fears that almost half of his crop may be lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/orange-growers-hope-for-high-returns-premature-dropping-a-concern/articleshow/85960731.cms||Shishir Arya

With the report saying its prevalence will be marginally higher among women, Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary (Industries & commerce and IT) stressed on early detection, the need to worry about impact of addictions, western diet, sedentary work and work-life imbalance. He was speaking at a book launch on cancer by surgeon Dr Sachin Marda at Yashoda hospitals. “Millions of cancer patients die each year due to lack of preventive measures and wrong lifestyle choices. You are much more ahead if you have the right mindset, a great support system, and an oncology team dedicated to care for you,” said Mahesh Bhagawat, commissioner of police, Rachakonda. Dr. Pavan Gorukanti, director, Yashoda Hospitals group highlighted how with current advances in medical technology, highly complicated and technically demanding cancer surgeries can be done with laparoscopic and robotic surgery. “The plastic and reconstructive surgery can provide excellent cosmetic look ensuring no deformity. With most advanced radiation therapy, the accuracy and precision are better with minimum side effects. The personalised medicine and genetic markers can tailor the treatment as per the requirement,” said Dr Gorukanti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/early-detection-key-to-beating-cancer-experts/articleshow/85962624.cms||---

---||Delhi||Credit cards taken via fake papers used to get loans||New Delhi: A labour contractor was arrested by the south Delhi police for allegedly duping banks through loans taken on credit cards procured on forged documents. The accused has been identified as Mohammed Shakeel Alam (30), a resident of Khanpur. According to deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur, a case was registered on the complaint of American Express bank wherein four credit cards were issued by a suspect on fake identity through online application. The accused spent huge amount on those credit cards in a very short period and gave forged cheques for payment of bills which bounced. A team comprising inspector Rajeev, sub-inspector Ajeet and others from the district cyber cell was formed to investigate the case. After cops started trailing Alam, he absconded and approached courts for anticipatory bail. His bail was rejected and he was arrested. Alam, cops have found, had seven bank accounts — all connected — to rotate the amount in them and improve his CIBIL score and seek more loans. Recently, he purchased MG Hector for Rs 21 lakh, out of which Rs 19.5 lakh he took as loan. He used to collect IDs of individuals through internet and used them to get credit cards issued on fake addresses though online applications. Thakur said Alam took houses on rent in affluent colonies for short period against fake IDs and used the same address for getting the credit cards issued. He used to change address after delivery of the credit card. Alam had spent around Rs 15.3 lakh on the four credit cards of American Express bank in a very short period and gave forged cheques for payment of bills of the cards. Similarly, he got a bank account opened on acquired identity based on fake ID documents of others. Alam used cheques of such accounts for payments of credit cards bills etc. He had firms showing his family members/friends as employees. He used to show good salary payments in their name every month and the same accounts used to be rotated showing fake transactions in the account. The suspect used to get cash against swiping credit cards from petrol pumps to hide the trail of money, probe has revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/credit-cards-taken-via-fake-papers-used-to-get-loans/articleshow/85958313.cms||---

The police have been receiving complaints from the public and elected representatives to open the right turn as motorists crossing the chowk have to travel a longer route via Castellino Road, Khanya Maruti chowk, a small portion of Pune-Solapur Road, Napier Road, Cross Road and Parvati Villa Road to reach Kondhwa. A visit to the chowk outside the Pune Cantonment Board office revealed rampant violation of the right turn by vehicles during non-peak hours. Jumping the signal and high speed driving is frequent after 9pm. Senior inspector Sunil Bhosale from the Wanowrie traffic police told TOI,“The right turn was closed on November 22, 2013 to decongest traffic at Golibar Maidan Chowk. We had conducted an experiment allowing vehicles to take a right turn following complaints from the public in 2018-19. The experiment revealed that handling heavy flow of traffic coming from Shankarsheth Road and Dhobi Ghat had become unmanageable at the chowk. Roads leading to the chowk are narrow and minor accidents are common. A decision to not to allow vehicles to take a right turn was hence taken.” Vinod Mathurawala, former member of the Pune Cantonment Board said the right turn was closed by the traffic police without consulting the elected representatives. “We had proposed to open the turn after removing the median from the chowk to decongest traffic but till date nothing has happened. There is no scope to widen the roads leading to the chowk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-seek-right-turn-to-kondhwa-at-key-junction/articleshow/85960692.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Chandigarh||Speed up rehabilitation of Colony No 4 slum dwellers: Chandigarh adviser||CHANDIGARH: UT adviser Dharam Pal has asked the deputy commissioner’s office and Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to speed up rehabilitation of eligible slum dwellers of Colony No. 4. He has asked officials to rehabilitate them in Maloya under the slum-dwellers rehabilitation scheme and settle their dispute cases. The UT administration has fixed a meeting next week over disputed cases of slum dwellers and to finalise a plan to shift them to Maloya. The CHB had recently written to UT deputy commissioner’s office to provide the remaining list of eligible slum dwellers of Colony no 4 for their rehabilitation. A senior CHB official said they are providing flats as and when they get the list from the DC office. The land is currently occupied by slum-dwellers, who will be rehabilitated by the administration in Maloya under the slum-dwellers’ rehabilitation scheme. While UT administration has already rehabilitated over 2,500 eligible beneficiaries as per the UT estate office survey in 2006, around 500 slum dwellers are to be rehabilitated. UT estate office and CHB have already given flats to 2,482 eligible slum-dwellers in Maloya under the slum-dwellers rehabilitation scheme. The colony has more than 5,000 houses. Eligible allottees will have to pay Rs 800 as licence fee every month for 20 years, after which they will pay the balance to get ownership of the flat. Sources said that the slum dwellers, whose claims were disputed, will be shifted to flats in Maloya, constructed under the Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme of the Centre. Allottees will be required to pay a monthly rent of Rs 3,000, which would be increased biennially by 8%. The total rental period would be a maximum of 25 years. Sources said that if the disputed cases become eligible at a later stage, the UT administration will charge license fee of Rs 800 with retrospective date. Construction of flats in Maloya began in June 2014 at a cost of Rs 250 crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was to hand over flat keys to allottees in May 2019, but the project was not completed at the time. Originally, it was meant to be completed by 2016. CHB is the nodal body for construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the 25,728 flats proposed. Of these, around 12,000 were built in Sector 38 (W), Sector 49, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran-II and Ram Darbar. The administration rehabilitates slum-dwellers after conducting a biometric survey. Colonies resettled in the last 10 years include Colony No 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/speed-up-rehab-of-colony-no-4-slum-dwellers-adviser/articleshow/85958319.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The robbery came to light on Saturday when the NRI woman lodged a complaint naming her 35-year-old maidservant for drugging and robbing her on June 29. The complainant also provided an elaborate list of ornaments robbed from her house. “The woman’s family runs a business in South Africa, where her husband passed away more than a year ago. Following the death of her husband, she moved to Pune and started living in a flat in the same building where her brother lives. Her son is taking care of the family business in South Africa while her daughter is settled in a Latin American country post-marriage,” senior inspector Younus Shaikh of the Yerawada police station told TOI. Police inspector Vijay Chavan, who is investigating the case, explained, “As we started looking into the matter, we realised that the maidservant is already in custody of the Hadapsar police station in connection with a similar crime registered there. We will seek her custody once our inquiry is completed.” Sub-inspector Vishal Patil cited the victim’s complaint and stated, “The elderly woman is suffering from various age-related ailments. Her previous maidservant left work and she had to hire the services of a new maidservant through a woman, who worked with her as a masseuse. The victim’s relatives had asked a few basic questions to the new maidservant before hiring her for the job.” “After allegedly drugging the complainant, the maidservant collected cash and gold ornaments from a cupboard and fled from the house. The next morning, the victim’s brother and his children saw the front entrance to the apartment open and found the victim sleeping. Her brother attempted to wake her up, but she did not respond. The family members then took her to a private hospital on Bund Garden Road,” Patil said. “The woman finally regained her senses on July 1 and realised that her gold bangles, which she was wearing when the incident took place, and a gold ring were missing. On July 2, the woman and her relatives reached her apartment and checked the cupboards. The jewellery was found to be missing,” the sub-inspector said. The police questioned the masseuse, who had introduced the suspect maidservant to the complainant, and noted down the latter’s details. “The victim took some time to report the matter to the police as she struggled to recall what ornaments were missing from the cupboard,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maid-drugs-robs-ailing-elderly-woman/articleshow/85960761.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt opposes ex-intel chief’s plea to quash FIR||MUMBAI: The state government has opposed a quashing petition filed by former state intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla saying that the FIR filed under Official Secrets Act in the ‘phone-tapping report leak’ case does not name her an accused, hence, she cannot challenge it and her petition is not maintainable. Shukla herself had marked the phone-tapping report into alleged conspiracy over police transfers and postings as ‘top secret’, hence an offence is made out under the Act, said the affidavit filed by Mumbai crime branch DCP Rashmi Karandikar before Bombay high court. “Since leak of secret inf-ormation constitutes cogniza-ble offence, the FIR ought not to be quashed,” said the affidavit filed on Saturday. It added that as the probe is to find out who had control over the documents and leaked them, the FIR ought not to be quashed. The bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar will hear the plea next on September 13. Karandikar denied that the state has acted with vendetta, malafides or illegally, as alleged, in transferring Shukla as civil defence director last year. Shukla had submitted the phone-tap report to then DGP Subodh Jaiswal on August 25, 2020. Shukla, through senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani with advocate Gunjan Mangla, had contended that the state had made her a ‘scapegoat’ and had filed an FIR on March 26, 2021, alleging that the report was leaked to unauthorised pe-rsons and invoked serious offences under the Telegraph Act, IT Act and Official Secrets Act. The FIR was filed a day after the then chief secretary’s report stating that she had “admitted to her mistake” and being a woman, no further step was taken. The state denied that no action was taken and cited the report of the CS which said that since no cop transfers took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020 —the surveillance period—no action was needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-opposes-ex-intel-chiefs-plea-to-quash-fir/articleshow/85963147.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Nagpur||Fraudsters pose as army personnel, cheat citizens to the tune of lakhs||Nagpur: By capitalizing on the sentiments of people regarding the sacrifices of army personnel, online fraudsters are making a quick buck. Preliminary inquiries by the city cyber cell have traced the presence of two rackets, one in Rajasthan and another in West Bengal. The fraudsters use Sim cards of states like Assam to operate and target victims across India, especially the middle class who search for cheap commodities through e-commerce portals. This year, the city police registered nine cases in which impostors hoodwinked victims by posing as army personnel looking for potential buyers for their furniture, electronic gadgets or vehicles. One constant reason given to victims was transfer. Police said money to the tune of almost Rs five lakh was siphoned off from the bank accounts of gullible citizens who walked into their trap by sharing their bank details. While eight victims lost money, a lucky one sensed something amiss and alerted the cyber cell. Assistant police inspector Keshav Wagh, who is part of the cyber cell under DCP Vivek Masaal and Addl CP Sunil Phulari, said imposters post fake advertisements on e-commerce portals stating they need to sell some of their belongings due to some unforeseen developments and hence are offering them at affordable rates. “Citizens call up on the numbers advertised on the posts and get hooked by tricksters posing as army personnel calling from cantonment areas or army canteens in dire need to sell their items,” he said. “The tricksters press victims to transfer some amount as an advance to seal the deal. They also insist that payments be made through digital wallets or apps,” he added. Wagh further stated that tricksters send dubious links. “The tricksters request the victims to transfer some amount as courier charges and then go on repeating their demands on some pretext or the other like octroi tax, shipment charges, transfer charges and so on until the victims realize that they have lost a substantial sum of money and rush to the cops for help. Later, the tricksters switch off their phones,” said the officer. It’s learnt that the racketeers mostly use Sim cards whose location cannot be traced in a pin-pointed manner. “These racketeers mostly operate from the outskirts of small towns, villages and moffusil areas where they also enjoy protection from locals as the money helps many families economically. Sometimes, these crooks also have a nexus with the local police who alert them whenever there is an inquiry by cops from other states,” said another senior officer on the condition of anonymity. How the fraud takes place: 1) The tricksters post an advertisement on e-commerce portal to sell something 2) The victims are told by the tricksters that they are army personnel who are posted at different places and they need to sell off their belongings as they have been transferred or some other emergencies. 3) the victims are sent some links or asked to deposit some amount in their digital wallets or money app. 4) the tricksters keep on asking for money on some or the other pretexts until substantial amount is siphoned off 5) the tricksters would later switch off their cellphones||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fraudsters-pose-as-army-personnel-cheat-citizens-to-the-tune-of-lakhs/articleshow/85960768.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Hi, honourable Tamil Nadu assembly, can we do away with 110?||CHENNAI: Any new scheme for the people should ideally be discussed and its benefits analysed before implementing. But in Tamil Nadu, the rules are different. Here the government proposes and no one can question it. Rule 110 of the Tamil Nadu assembly was used sparingly in the past for statements on matters of public importance in emerging situations but was transformed as a propaganda or publicity tool by J Jayalalithaa and then Edappadi K Palaniswami, to make announcements of schemes. And this turned out to be an exercise to create a larger-than-life image of a chief minister who cannot be questioned. Under Rule 110, a chief minister or minister could make a statement or announcement, but the opposition will not have the right to comment on it or give its opinion. So there is no opportunity for the opposition to point out the shortcomings at the introduction stage itself. These schemes should basically be included in the Budget proposals of respective ministries, with the ministers making the announcements and not the chief minister. Jayalalithaa did not make much use of this provision during her first two terms in 1991-96 and 2001-06. However, during her third term it reached absurd levels. From 2011 to 2016, she made 187 announcements in the assembly under Rule 110, involving an expenditure of Rs172,196 crore. This in turn fanned sycophancy, with AIADMK MLAs cheering her on, expecting grandiose announcements. Assembly speaker P Dhanapal said in September 2015 in the assembly that 181 schemes had been announced by chief minister Jayalalithaa in four years from 2011 to 2015, and described it as a "Guinness record". Apart from announcements of schemes regarding Amma canteens, mobile phones, and scooters, Jayalalithaa also used Rule 110 to announce a new building for the Secretariat on the campus of the Queen Mary’s College. Following her cue, Edappadi K Palaniswami made 453 announcements under Rule 110, while in office. This was a sea-change from the governments of the Congress, M Karunanidhi of the DMK and M G Ramachandran of the AIADMK. Rule 110 was mainly used at the time of disasters or to clarify the government stand on an important development. Then too, many of these statements were made by the leader of the House, and not necessarily by the CM. On August 12, 2016, DMK leader Durai Murugan raised questions about the use of Rule 110 by the AIADMK government in the assembly. "Why is the CM making suo motu announcements when the debate and voting on the demands for grants for the departments had been completed in the assembly," Durai Murugan asked. Jayalalithaa replied that this was so because her government was thinking-round-the-clock about new schemes that could benefit the people. "I realised we left out these schemes and so I am announcing them now," she had said. The opposition members walked out citing the reason tht they were not allowed to speak on the schemes. On July 12, 2019, DMK member S Austin complained in the assembly about the manner in which Rule 110 was used by the AIADMK government. Edappadi K Palaniswami, struggling to maintain his hold over the government and the party from 2017, tried to use Rule 110 to build a false narrative of a tall leader. He used Rule 110 for Pongal gift, ban one-time plastic, bus purchase and irrigation projects, many of which were not part of the Budget. In February 2020, DMK legislator T Mano Thangaraj, now a minister, raised the issue of lack of ‘financial clarity’ in Palaniswami’s announcements under Rule 110. However, Palaniswami continued to announce projects besides policy decisions under Rule 110, such as 7.5% reservation for students of government schools and waiver of crop loans to the tune of Rs12,000 crore, etc. The present dispensation of the DMK under M K Stalin, too, has made use of Rule 110 in a limited way. On occasions, the CM has allowed concerned ministers to make statements or announcements. Even so, it would be in the best interests of parliamentary democracy and collective responsibility, that ministers be allowed to announce projects/schemes/decisions relating to their departments. Such an approach would also ensure that the ministers are respected by officials. Stalin needs to make sure that his government invokes the Rule 110 provision only sparingly and make way for debate and discussion in the assembly, and above all, ensure that schemes and announcements should be a part of the budgetary and planning process. This will pave the way for accounting processes, empirical control and fiscal discipline. Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan had said shortly after release of the white paper on the state’s finances, that the announcements of the previous AIADMK government under Rule 110 had led to a chaotic situation where no one was sure of their implementation and the amount spent. Avoiding Rule 110 could be the first step towards better governance, where the collective wisdom of the cabinet and the assembly could prevail rather than the whims and fancies or idiosyncrasies of an individual.

A Public Works Department (PWD) official said the inflow to the dam had gone up to 20,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs) on Sunday morning, from 17,000cusecs on Saturday morning. “While the inflow stood at the same level the entire day, the water level in the dam has increased to 69.39ft from 68.55ft on Saturday.” At present, about 32.18 thousand million cubic feet water is stored in the dam. PWD officials are releasing 5,000cusecs of water from the dam to carry out farming activities in the delta districts and another 650cusecs each water into the dam’s east and west bank canals for irrigation purposes in Salem, Namakkal and Erode districts. The Karnataka government is releasing 9,600cusecs water from the Krishnaraja Sagar dam and another 5,000cusecs water from Kabini dam into the Cauvery pathways, the official said. “The district had received heavy rainfall in the past few days. It is another reason for the inflow to increase.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/inflow-to-mettur-dam-increases/articleshow/85960779.cms||---
---||Delhi||Madras Cafe actor Leena Maria Paul held in Rs 200-crore extortion case||NEW DELHI: Two weeks after she was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate, the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police has arrested actor Leena Maria Paul in connection with the Rs 200-crore case of extortion from a well-known business family. She acted in the 2013 film “Madras Cafe”. Paul’s boyfriend, Sukesh Chandrasekhar, was recently arrested from jail along with seven others, including a bank manager, for their alleged involvement in the extortion case. While Chandrasekhar was booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, his associates, including Paul, have been made the co-accused. On August 10, TOI was the first to report the biggest-ever extortion case uncovered in Delhi in terms of the amount of money and that the ED had started a parallel probe. On August 23, ED had seized 16 high-end cars, a luxurious beachfront bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and 2kg of gold in the money laundering case involving conman Chandrasekhar. The seizures were made after Paul’s questioning. Police suspected that she knew about a chunk of the extorted and laundered money. The ED had registered the money laundering case based on police’s investigation. Chandrasekhar would be taken into custody by ED after police’s remand ends. Two of his associates, Deepak and Pradeep, and two jail officials were also arrested. Earlier, EOW had arrested Komal Poddar, the manager of RBL Bank, Connaught Place branch, and two of his associates, Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula, on charges of allegedly facilitating and laundering money for Chandrasekhar. “The accused were involved in dubious transactions for circulation of funds and arrangement of cash,” EOW had said. Chandrasekhar was using number spoofing through an app called “Crazy Call” to impersonate high-ranking government officials. He would call to strike deals and the victims would see the numbers on their phone screens as desired by him. In one of the last calls to a victim, he had impersonated the law secretary, a source said. In her complaint, the victim said she received a call in June 2020 wherein the caller introduced himself as a secretary in the Union ministry of law. He proposed to help her in securing bail for her husband. This person demanded Rs 200 crore for getting the work done and conveyed the modalities regarding delivery of the money. The money was routed to Hong Kong-based entities, some shell firms, apart from properties allegedly bought by Paul. When the victim realised she had been duped, she contacted police and lodged a complaint.

---||Chandigarh||Delhi-Kalka Shatabdi held up for 10 min in Zirakpur||Mohali: The Delhi-Kalka Shatabdi Express was held up for around 10 minutes on Sunday. The train was stopped by local residents of Harmilap Nagar and Raipur Kalan at railway crossing number 123 just ahead of Chandigarh Railway Station. Residents slept on rail tracks to stop the Shatabdi Express from approaching the Chandigarh Railway Station. They blocked the tracks at around 10:45am. The train however, reached Chandigarh on time as it was already running ahead of time. Residents of Harmilap Nagar and Raipur Kalan blocked the rail tracks to press their five year old demand for an underpass. An emergency meeting was held between railway officials and agitators at the Chandigarh railway station. Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh said, “The Delhi-Kalka Shatabdi was held up near Chandigarh today. There was an agitation by people of Harmilap Nagar for construction of a subway. The subway has been cleared from the side of the railways but is awaiting confirmation from the UT administration to see that no drainage problem is caused when the project is implemented. As blocking of railway tracks and stopping of a train is an offence, the agitators are likely to be booked.” The agitation was led by local Congress leader Partap Singh Rana, who slept on the tracks along with his supporters to stop the Shatabdi Express. On receiving information, Zirakpur station house officer (SHO), inspector Onkar Singh Brar rushed to the spot. Finally, police managed to free the tracks of agitators and asked them to continue with their protest elsewhere. Railway Protection Force SHO, inspector Amarinderjit Singh also reached the spot. The protesters were booked. BOX: Irked by empty promises Residents of Harmilap Nagar and Raipur Kalan said they have been demanding an underpass at railway crossing number 123 from the past five years but despite promises, work has not started till date. They said they started the struggle for an underpass in October 2018 in the wake of frequent traffic jams at the crossing during crossing of trains. They said they were promised that work on the underpass would start soon but when the railways dithered, they staged a protest in September 2020. Again, promises were made to start work but there was nothing to show for it on the ground. Ball in UT’s court Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh said the project has been cleared by the railways but the hindrance was from the side of the UT administration. He said the UT is yet to give its consent and confirmation of ‘No Drainage Problem’ with the commissioning of the project. Railways would start construction once the UT gave NoC, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delhi-kalka-shatabdi-held-up-for-10-min-in-zirakpur/articleshow/85958382.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Genome sequencing process in PGI standardised||CHANDIGARH: The process to start whole genome sequencing in PGI has been standardised and now, the institute is waiting for supply of reagents from the US. During the process of standardisation, it was found that results were comparable and the decision to proceed was taken. The department of virology had been using the test on the paediatric population of PGI for standardisation. “As the machine and its consumables are expensive, procurement will take time. Normal procurement procedures take longer for equipment worth over crores,” said a PGI official. It is possible to analyse the entire genetic material of an organism using the sequence. With the tool, one can understand how the virus has been evolving and mutating. At present, PGI has to send its samples to the NCDC laboratory in New Delhi for genome test. Since the laboratory gets a number of samples from across the country, test reports take around a month or so to arrive. Sequencing helps with surveillance as variants can be detected and regulatory steps can be taken. “We can understand if there is any mutation and variants of concern or interest. Accordingly, planning can be done. However, the sequencing will not start before October, when the third wave is predicted,” said an official in PGI. The PGI has demanded from the outsource agency that the procedure should include library preparation, quality check sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of 60 samples for SARS COV 2 whole genome sequence by next generation sequencing. The sequencing should cover 99% of the whole genome of SARS Cov 2 and be able to detect all known viral variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/genome-sequencing-process-in-pgi-standardised/articleshow/85958419.cms||Shimona Kanwar

At Bada Chauraha between Z Square Mall and DCB Bank, an underground metro station is proposed in the second phase of the metro construction work. When the actual metro station construction work would be carried out at Bada Chauraha, traffic diversion will have to be implemented. To find out how the construction work would be executed when diversion will remain in effect then, a mock-drill was conducted. The mock drill remained successful. Due to holiday, there was less traffic on the roads in the morning shift but in the evening hours there were sufficient number of vehicles in the area, yet no problem was faced in executing the diversion and the traffic movement remained smooth. Keeping in view the mock drill of diversion, a total of 24 marshals (in each shift) were deployed by UP Metro at Bada Chauraha and adjoining roads. Proper barricading was done and signages were put up. After today’s mock drill, modifications will be made in the diversion plan, if required as per the directions of the Traffic Police. Also, suggestions coming on social media handles of Traffic Police and UP Metro till Tuesday (September 7) will also be taken into consideration. Only then, the diversion will be implemented on permanent basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-mock-drill-for-traffic-diversion-conducted/articleshow/85960823.cms||---

He added that the government has already organised free vaccine camps in many government schools, but some labourers in Loha Mandi of his constituency seemed hesitant about getting vaccinated and many were unable to get appointments at their nearest schools due to lack of smart phones or leaves. Delhi government said in a statement that Chadha, who is the area MLA, took cognizance of the issue and talked to the district officer and arranged for this special vaccination drive. “Keeping these problems in mind, New Delhi district administration, under Delhi government, arranged this special van in our area. Vaccination has now reached people’s homes, our workers are running awareness campaigns in the area and appealing to people to come out of their homes and get vaccinated,” he said. People coming to ‘vaccine on wheels’ van are registered on the spot and are vaccinated inside the van, which have waiting and observation areas too. Chadha said that a team of doctors is always present to deal with any complications during the vaccination, the statement said. A special drive is being carried out in the area, as part of which 150 people are administered the vaccine every day without appointment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-launches-vaccination-on-wheels-to-help-labourers/articleshow/85958501.cms||---

We still appeal to farmers not to fall in the trap of the political parties in opposition,” said Maurya while dedicating development projects worth crores at Maa Durga Park in Panki area on Sunday. “Some Opposition leaders are seeing the dreams of Mungerilal for 2022 assembly elections when the fact is that even a tenth of the work done in BJP’s four and a half years rule was not done by the SP government,” he added. Maurya further said, “Congress party has been playing a negative role. Neither do they like the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, nor the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir,” he said. BJP has for long been organizing ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelans’ and now other parties have also started holding similar meets, Maurya added. “Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee made the supreme sacrifice for abrogation of Article 370. Now, people from Kanpur can also go to Jammu and Kashmir and set up their industry or do business there as in any other state,” he said. He announced that a ‘gaddha-mukt sadak’ (pothole-free road) campaign would be launched from September 14 in the state. He also honored five teachers Reena Choubey, Ekta Yadav, Lt. Gopal Singh and Sunder Lal on Teacher’s Day. The Deputy CM dedicated development projects, including 30 roads and two bridges, worth Rs 67.94 crore to the public at Maa Durga Park in Panki and laid the foundation of Rs 120 crore project for 78 roads. On the demand of public representatives, the Armapur bridge would be known as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Setu, he added. “A four-lane road will be constructed from State Highway Mandhana to Kanpur border at a cost of Rs 175 crore. Besides, Rs 60 crore will be approved soon for ROBs at Jaipuria crossing and Dadanagar crossing,” he said. The construction of 800m four-lane bridge at Saraiya crossing will start soon as NABARD has given approval. The construction of a six-lane expressway between Kanpur-Lucknow will make travel to the state capital easy, he said. The Deputy CM also laid the foundation of Nauria Kheda bridge and urged people to wear masks as Covid cases are still being reported in other states and several countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sp-congress-bsp-behindfarmers-agitation-dy-cm/articleshow/85960860.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Coimbatore||Students with pending fees invite private schools’ wrath||Coimbatore: District chief education officer (CEO) N Geetha said she had been receiving complaints from parents about private schools preventing their wards from attending physical classes, as they have failed to settle the pending fees. “I have received seven such complaints in person on the first day of school reopening. My office continues to receive such complaints. We have asked the schools not to disallow the students from attending the classes,” she said. Geetha has also warned of action against the schools if she were to receive written complaints from parents, as the state government had asked the schools not to prevent students from attending the classes. A senior official with the CEO office said while some cases were genuine, there were also deliberate attempts by parents not to pay the fees. Pointing out that a parent, who had enrolled three daughters to a private school, hadn’t paid their fees last year, the officer said while the former was ready to pay the first term fee for the current academic year, he was reluctant to pay the pending fees. “I had lost my job during the pandemic last year. While I have managed to get back to work, it will take time to set my finances right. I can pay the first term fees of this academic year, but I can’t afford to pay the pending fees,” said the parent who approached the CEO office seeking intervention. The official said the school management was not ready to forgo the pending fees of all the three children. “We too find it unfair on our part to ask the schools to make unreasonable fee waivers.” Academicians said the issue was mostly faced by the schools on the outskirts of the city, while the known ones in the city with a higher fee structure were able to collect the fees, as they were preferred by the parents who could afford the fees. Admission to the first category of schools, they said, depended on the quality teachers. “To retain teachers, the schools need to pay them more. Since the fees collected from the students is the main source of their revenue, the schools are insisting on payment of pending fees.” D C Elangovan, general secretary, Federation of Associations of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu, said the high court had a few months ago asked the schools not to insist on fees from parents, who were facing financial issues. “Some parents, who can afford the fee, are also taking advantage of the court order. This has been affecting the revenue of the schools, which are ready to compromise to a certain extent considering the pandemic situation. But they will be in trouble without collecting the fee stipulated by the high court and the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/students-with-pending-fees-invite-private-schools-wrath/articleshow/85960840.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Mentally ill woman goes home after 2 years in jail, shelter, hospital||MUMBAI: The life of a mentally ill woman turned upside down when she was accused of attempting to kidnap a child and was jailed. The pandemic resulted in delays and 20 months since her incarceration, she was released on bail earlier this year. Her house was still sealed though and her mental health condition spiralled downwards at a shelter where she was put up. Last week, as she finally stepped foot into her home after making a full recovery, her time of tribulation may have finally come to an end. Latika (not her real name, 47) has lived alone ever since her parents passed away. Her brother hasn’t been in touch. She survives on rent earned from letting out another property. In October 2019, Latika had been to a chawl in Thakurli, Thane district, where a resident accused her of trying to walk away with his young niece. The resident alleged she had also been making inquiries with other children in the chawl and when confronted, she “admitted to kidnapping kids to push them into begging”. Based on his complaint, Latika was arrested and sent to prison. “The charges applied against her were triable in a sessions court. But the pandemic resulted in the case getting committed to Kalyan sessions court after a rather long time,” said her lawyer Mahesh Pawar. The investigating police officer did not comment. Latika’s bail application stated she had gone to Thakurli to look for a job and had not kidnapped anyone. The plea also said the police had found no evidence to establish that she kidnapped children or pushed them into begging and that the time in jail had left her disturbed. Latika got out on bail in June 2021 but had nowhere to go. Social workers from Prayas, a project of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, moved her to a women's shelter, in the absence of any family support. Within a few days, though, her medication got irregular and she grew violent. “When we tried to move her to Thane Mental Hospital, she started to hit us and got abusive,” said Karuna Sangare, a social worker with Prayas. The social workers sought help from the police to escort her to the hospital where Latika was treated for over a month. When she was due for discharge, none of the shelters were willing to take her in. The social workers then took her to the police station and convinced officers to unlock her house so she could have a roof over her head. When Latika stepped into her house after a gap of two years, she was so relieved that she forgot all about the mess it was in. She has since cleaned up, started cooking her meals and taking her medication on time. “We plan to keep in touch and follow up on future requirements,” said TISS professor and Prayas head Vijay Raghavan, adding he hoped this would be the beginning of a new chapter in her life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mentally-ill-woman-goes-home-after-2-years-in-jail-shelter-hosp/articleshow/85963154.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Delhi||Delhi: Vasant Kunj residents not happy with govt decision to build school in locality||NEW DELHI: Residents of Vasant Kunj Sector A pockets B and C are opposing the move to set up a new Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in their locality. They claim the government school will disturb the residential character of the neighbourhood with more congestion and parking woes. The RWA has written to education minister Manish Sisodia arguing that there is no direct approach road to the site and alternative plots in Kishangarh and Masoodpur villages should be used for this purpose. Vinod Kumar Pant, president of All Residents Welfare Association, said the residential locality was one of the first areas to be developed in Vasant Kunj in the 1980s and the plot where the school would come up was lying vacant for the past 35 years. “Smriti Van, which is adjacent to the plot, came up later. Now, there is no approach road to this site from that direction. The school users will have to travel 1km inside this densely packed residential locality. The school will not be catering to the needs of local residents. We had also stopped the contractor who had come with earthmovers. There is no parking space or resources to cater to a school with 3,500 students,” added Pant. Dr Varun Bharadwaj, RWA joint secretary, said there were around 1,500 flats in pockets B and C, which would be affected adversely. “No infrastructure is there to cater to a full-fledged school. We already have three schools in the pocket whose buses come and go. Ideally, a multilevel parking lot should be developed here. We are concerned about safety, security, congestion and traffic,” he added. The letter added that if a school was allowed to open, all types of people would enter the sector, which could threaten the safety and security of the 6,000-odd residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vk-residents-not-happy-with-govt-decision-to-build-school-in-locality/articleshow/85958526.cms||---

After trials between Mettupalayam and Coonoor, the locomotive will be operated on Coonoor-Ooty stretch soon. With this new addition, the Nilgiris Mountain Railway (NMR) section now boasts of two coal-fired meter gauge engines. The other one is the century-old Swiss X-class loco, which has not been used for more than a decade but is still in running condition. Presently, oil-fired engines are operated on Mettupalayam-Coonoor stretch and diesel engines on Ooty-Coonoor stretch. The railway board had earlier sanctioned Rs9 crore to the Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Trichy for manufacturing the coal-fired locomotive. This X-class steam loco with rack and pinion system is meant exclusively for the NMR track. It is the first of its kind loco to be manufactured at the Trichy workshop, according to a Salem division railway official. Weighing about 50 tonnes, the locomotive has already undergone a trial at the workshop with rack bar arrangements for a length of about 100 metres. “The coal-fired engine will have enough trials on the NMR section between Mettupalayam and Coonoor. It will be operated on Ooty-Coonoor section on a regular basis after the engine satisfies the technical norms and feasibility on NMR track with rack and pinion system,” an official source said. K Natarajan, managing trustee, Heritage Steam Chariot Trust, said the coal-fired engine would attract more tourists, especially foreigners, to the NMR section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/new-coal-fired-loco-for-nmr-arrives-at-mettupalayam-stn/articleshow/85960946.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The principal Ghanshyam Amreliya was found hanging from the ceiling fan at around 12:30pm. In a suicide note found on him, Amreliya blamed the Taluka Primary Education Officer and three others for mental torture, which led to him to take the drastic step. One of the staff members spotted Amreliya hanging and informed police. According to police sources, the higher officials named in the suicide note were allegedly demanding Rs 25 lakh from him for not reporting his ‘liquor drinking’ and saving his job and suspension. The note recovered by police stated: “When I got transferred here from Anidiya village, higher officers demanded Rs 25 lakh. Also, the Pay Centre school principal demanded Rs seven lakh and asked me to meet in person. I met him on the Jamwala school campus. He had told me that he had to give money to the district education officer. He told me not to talk over the phone regarding this issue.” The note further reads: “The principal told me that I attend school in a drunken condition and demanded money. I had given Rs 25 lakh cash to Jayesh Rathod and Goswami. Another teacher from my school extorted Rs four lakh from me and threatened that if I asked for this money back, he would report that I was found drunk on duty. He even threatened to kill me. So, I am ending my life today.” “I am tired of the harassment from higher officers. I no longer want to live,” the teacher reportedly wrote in the note. Later, Amreliya’s daughter told reporters that her father used to get phone calls after which he used to get scared and depressed. "He used to remain aloof for the last fortnight. He had mentioned about the blackmail by officials to the family too. He had also taken a loan from the bank and paid some amount. But I don't know the exact details of the amount," she said. The girl said her father used to have a drink occasionally and the officials named in the suicide note used to blackmail him saying that they would get him suspended and inform the higher education department officials that he came drunk to the school.

She then requested police to drop charges against him claiming she would withdraw the complaint. Investigations have revealed that the two became friends when he ferried the inmates of the study centre to different places. He worked with a de-addiction centre on the outskirts of Mysuru and often visited the study centre.

Speaking after launching the Teacher’s Day celebration organised jointly by district administration, Zilla Panchayat and Department of Public Instruction, he said the offline mode of study is more beneficial and productive as compared to any other mode of study. Recollecting the contributions of several teachers and their sacrifices in shaping the future citizens of the country, he described teaching as the noblest profession. He appreciated the teachers’ role in building a strong robust nation, for its rapid development in the areas of science technology and research applications and highlighted the contributions of former president Sarvpalli Radhakrishna. He also praised the teachers for correcting the ills of the society, social transformation and for bringing social reforms. “As the nation still faces challenges in several spheres, cooperation of teachers is must to overcome these,” he said. He asked the teachers to develop patriotism, and nationalistic fervour among youths as well as entrepreneurial skills among students to achieve their desired goals. Apart from imparting education, imbibing values, teachers must also teach life skills to overcome challenges in their daily life and to tread a righteous path, he said. He asked teachers to find solutions for problems students are facing after the launch of virtual learning during the pandemic. “As one-to-one meetings between teachers and students decreased, students depend upon Google and other technological tools. Teachers must find alternatives for these,” he said. Former ministers AH Vishwanath, GT Devegowda and Tanveer Sait, mayor Sunanda Palanetra and DC Bagadi Gautham were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/teacher-student-relationship-impacted-in-absence-of-regular-interaction-minister/articleshow/85957250.cms||---

Earlier, for the convenience of both the parent and child, institutions went for recorded classes. However, after sometime it was found that children lacked enthusiasm, as recorded classes were monotonous. “Once we shifted to live online classes, we noticed there was tremendous improvement in participation from every student. They showed involvement, as there were more interactions between teachers and students,” said Sister Melissa, principal of Mount Carmel Central School. The school had recorded classes till the fourth standard. Melissa said that when classes resumed after the outbreak of the pandemic, parents were happy with recorded classes. As the days went by, they started complaining. “So this year, we completely switched to live online classes only. For the convenience of students, we have restricted per online class to less than 20 students. There are morning and evening classes scheduled for the convenience of working parents,” said Melissa. Some schools are slowly switching to online live mode from recorded classes. Fr Robert D’Souza, principal, Lourdes Central School, Bejai, said that it was only recorded classes for LKG to class III until the last academic year. “Currently, we have both offline and recorded classes. It is giving children the feeling of a classroom. There is an involvement, since teachers are conducting various activities to keep children engaged throughout the class,” said Fr Robert. Mathew C Ninan, director, Little Rock Indian School, Brahmavar, Udupi, stressed that a close watch is kept on every student, when classes are held online. “There is 80% to 90% of attendance after switching to online classes. We also have recorded classes for those who have connectivity issues.” “My two children, studying in UKG and class VI are enthusiastic about live online classes, but are not fond of recorded ones. How can a child learn mathematics through a recorded class, without the help of a teacher?” said parent Sylvia Anil D’Silva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-focus-better-after-live-online-classes-are-held/articleshow/85956541.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

A group of 12 youngsters, all natives of Digras in Yavatmal, had come to Nagpur to visit different shrines where ‘Urs’ or religious congregations are underway. Police said the youngsters started from Yavatmal at about 11pm on Saturday. After reaching Nagpur, the youngsters visited Taj Bagh to pay obeisance at the dargah where Baba Taj Urs is underway. The youngsters had then reached Kanhan River for a bath. From here, they were supposed to head to another shrine, Amma Ki Dargah, in Old Kamptee taluka. While five of the youths went for a bath, one was waiting on the bank of the river. Their seven friends were resting in the car. Senior inspector Vilas Kale of Kanhan police station said the river is not suitable for swimming because the river bottom has dangerous, hollow depressions, which cannot be gauged from outside. “The youngsters had gone at least 17 feet from the bank, even though none of them knew how to swim. There are warning boards cautioning visitors at this place against swimming, pointing out that swimming could be perilous. Still, the boys went in for a bath,” said Kale. “We found their clothes on the bank, which meant they had planned to have a bath,” he said, adding there have been drowning incidents here in the past too. Eye-witnesses said four friends had gone really deep inside the river while one was near the bank. When the four started drowning, the fifth near the bank entered the water to rescue them, but he too got swept away. Tehsildar Prashant Sangde said due to rain there was strong current in the river, which also hit search operations. Additional SP, Nagpur rural, Rahul Maknikar said police had roped in local divers and swimmers to fish out the remaining bodies. These locals have adequate knowledge of the flow of the river. A case of accidental death was registered at Kanhan police station of Nagpur rural.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/five-yavatmal-youths-drown-in-kanhan-river/articleshow/85961035.cms||Soumitra Bose

The move is aimed at raising funds for patient care and research without being dependent on government aid. “We will have this cell to even help our students who apply for fellowships and training overseas and need recommendation,” said Prof Yogesh Chawla, former director, PGI who conceptualised the plan. The institute is in the process of registering alumni at the national and international level. “Our students and faculty are an extended family. For any grant, course training or buying of equipment, we can easily approach this network,” said Prof Chawla. Many doctors have done their specialisation and sub-specialisation from PGI since 1962. “This cell will help in networking and linking of all the former batches. Another area it will serve is to raise endowment funds and award stipends for deserving students on need-cum-merit basis within the institute,” said cell convener Prof R R Sharma. During the Covid pandemic, former students from GMCH 32 helped the hospital get PPEs, medicines and some equipment. “The cell is much awaited. We could also generate funds and get help from our former students this way,” said a PGI faculty. Doctors feel the cell will boost mentorship and student exchange programmes. “We can organise such knowledge sharing for our students and even get our cases discussed at the international level. With our former students, things can be easily managed,” said Prof Chawla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-to-get-alumni-cell/articleshow/85958697.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Chandigarh||Integrated cargo complex to be operational at Chandigarh Airport: CEO||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: Chandigarh International Airport is all set to get an integrated cargo complex with a perishable cargo centre, which will give a fillip to both perishable and non-perishable exports from the region. The cargo complex will be commissioned by the first week of November this year, said Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHIAL) chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj. At present, he said, airlines operating at Chandigarh International Airport are Air India, Indigo, Vistara and Go Air, which handle cargo on their own. Only domestic facility for common screening is available and other functions are conducted by the Airlines themselves. The total area of the present cargo facility is approximately 575 sqmt (250 Sqmt cargo Building and 325 sqmt cargo offices/other area). The Airport is handling predominantly belly cargo in some sectors only. Bhardwaj said, “To enhance cargo operations from Chandigarh International Airport, CHIAL, sets up new cargo facility which is under construction and civil work is likely expected to be completed by the end September, 2021, which will enhance the capacity of cargo complex, including facility of international cargo with the arrangement of storage of perishable cargo. Total area of new cargo complex is 14,127sqmt. The new cargo complex is likely to be operational from November 2021.” An integrated cargo complex at Chandigarh International Airport is in advance stages of completion, he said. Elated at the announcement, Mohali Industry Association (MIA) President Yogesh Sagar said, “Air cargo unit coming up at Mohali airport will save money and time. At present, we have to send the consignment by road to Delhi airport, where it is lined up for 24 to 48 hours before being loaded into aircraft, which takes four to five days. But here at Mohali airport, this time will be saved and we will get consignment directly at Mohali from other countries. It will promote ease of business.” Setting up of the integrated cargo complex at Chandigarh Airport will also boost international connectivity as cargo planes from other countries will be able land at the airport. Recently, the CEO presented a detailed report about the progress of the complex to the Punjab chief minister. CHIAL CEO also presented a cheque of Rs 3.2 crore to the Punjab government by way of first interim dividend against the state’s 24.5% equity share in the airport project. The announcement of setting up an integrated cargo complex with perishable cargo centre at the airport was made during the interim budget in February 2020 by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/integrated-cargo-complex-to-be-operational-at-chandigarh-airport-ceo/articleshow/85958714.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

In a video posted on social media, Kadam said that “if Taliban’s ideology existed here”, would Akhtar have the freedom to make such statements? “Until he apologises to the members of the Sangh with folded hands, we won’t allow any of his films to be screened in the land of Ma Bharti,” said Kadam, adding that they will file a police complaint against Akhtar. In a recent interview, Akhtar had told a news channel that it is time for supporters of the VHP and the RSS to introspect. “I think people who support organisations like the RSS, VHP or Bajrang Dal need to do some introspection. Of course, Taliban are reprehensible… they are barbarians.

Thanks to the Hikvision high-resolution solar cameras, a black spot which had garbage heaps at Akashbhavana ward in the city is now a clean area, said Shabarinath Rai, zonal commissioner, MCC. “People stopped throwing waste at many such black spots, after the city corporation placed the portable CCTV camera. The wireless and wi-fi-enabled high-resolution cameras with 4mm lens with day and night vision are placed at the black spots, depending on complaints from the public. The portable camera unit mounted on a 15ft GI pole works with a solar panel of 40AH battery, and there is no need for an electricity connection for it. Further, it can be shifted anywhere in the city, based on the requirement. Each camera has memory cards with data storage capacity of 128GB,” Shabarinath said. There is no need for cables to retrieve the footage from the cameras. The router with a SIM in the camera unit sends live footage from the spots, and the command-and-control centre of the MCC can identify violators and take necessary action. Meanwhile, health inspectors also may check footage through their mobile apps, he said, adding that the city corporation has procured six camera units, including the solar system, at a cost of Rs 4.1 lakh, he added. Mayor Premanand Shetty said the new system will help the city corporation to file criminal cases against those who throw waste beside roads and other public places. “From the footage, officials can identify the people throwing waste, and find the registration number of the vehicle that violators use while littering public places too. We will use the cameras in all such black spots, and thereby try to keep public places clean,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mcc-starts-online-surveillance-to-check-littering-of-public-places/articleshow/85956580.cms||---

A Kharghar resident and IIT-Bombay researcher, Tarang Sarin, told TOI: “Along with a group of bird watchers, I had gone to the creek area on Saturday when I chanced upon these two golden jackals sitting a little distance away. I first thought they were dogs; but when I adjusted my camera’s telephoto lens, I was thrilled to see that these were actually the wildlife species, golden jackals, possibly a male and a female.” Sarin, who is part of the active Kharghar Wetlands and Hills group, added: “One of the jackals was eating a fish. After noticing my presence, they became a little nervous and darted inside a forested area, as golden jackals are known to avoid humans. It is a serious concern that we must protect the rich biodiversity of Kharghar, because such wild species like golden jackals, reptiles and various birds are solely dependent on it.” The latest photos of this pair of golden jackals will be sent to the Maharashtra state forest officials. “It is good news that golden jackals have been sighted in Kharghar. A few years ago, jackals were also seen amid mangroves on Palm Beach Road,” said director of NatConnect Foundation, B N Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-2-golden-jackals-spotted-chomping-on-creek-fish/articleshow/85962855.cms||Vijay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai lauded for vaccinating 80% of population with 1st dose||MUMBAI: Top state officials on Sunday applauded Mumbai for vaccinating 80% of its population with at least one vaccine dose against Covid-19. The state is hopeful of administering two crore doses in September that will push the cumulative vaccination coverage in Maharashtra to more than eight crore doses by the month-end. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said that Mumbai has administered over one crore doses till date. “It has the best position in the state,” he said, adding that the private sector has aided in the city’s vaccination coverage by administering over 40 lakh doses. The city has fully vaccinated nearly 30 lakh people and given the first shot to around 44 lakh people. Speaking in a virtual conference, Dr Vyas said that 45% of the state’s adult population have got at least one dose. In the 18-44 age group, 35% have got at least one dose, and in the 45-plus age bracket, 54%. “We have been assured two crore doses in September, and if production increases, we may receive some more,” he added. The state has administered nearly 6.3 crore doses, the second highest in the country after Uttar Pradesh. However, Maharashtra has the highest number of fully vaccinated people—more than 1.7 crore—followed by UP at 1.3 crore. On Saturday, Maharashtra achieved its highest single-day vaccination by administering nearly 12.3 lakh doses. Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Jalgaon four districts have administered over one lakh doses, with Mumbai vaccinating the highest—1.8 lakh doses. The state has given nearly 25 lakh doses in the first three days of September, as per numbers presented by Dr Vyas. Members of the Covid task force emphasised on the importance of complete vaccination to provide utmost protection. “People who get Covid-19 in spite of vaccination largely have mild symptoms,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a task force member. Studies have also found that vaccination reduces the chances of post-Covid ailments. Dr Mehul Mehta, a Nair alumnus and retinal surgeon at Harvard Medical School, said that till the time everyone has taken both doses, there will always be a risk of new waves. “In the US, particularly the western side, cases are largely coming from the unvaccinated population. It is among people who don’t want to take the shots or wear a mask.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lauded-for-vaccinating-80-of-popn-with-1st-dose/articleshow/85962875.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Coimbatore||Dist education office plans staggered exit of students||Coimbatore: To avoid students crowding bus stops and other places after school hours, the Coimbatore district chief education office is planning a staggered closing time for schools located nearby. An announcement is expected in this regard on Monday. At present, the classes start at 9.30am and end at 3.30pm. Students of Class IX-XII are attending physical classes since September 1. Though most of the schools have been managing to maintain social distancing within the campus, students were seen crowding outside the school after school hours. Students crowding bus stops is more prevalent in city corporation limit as many schools are located close by. “For instance, the head post office bus stand, Raja Street and Town Hall bus stops are teeming with students after 3.30pm. Students could be seen standing in groups after school hours defying social distance. This defeats the purpose of social distancing maintained inside the campus,” S Kalpana, a teacher from a corporation school in Town Hall, said. To ensure students don’t mingle with each other in bus stands, the office of CEO has asked schools located nearby to discuss among themselves and plan for a staggered exit of students. “However, the plan doesn’t seem to be working as it would extend the school hours for some schools. Therefore, we have decided staggered class-wise exit of students,” Coimbatore district chief education officer N Geetha said. We can allow students of Class IX to leave early in the afternoon, and other classes can exit with a gap of half an hour each. This would prevent gathering of students outside the campus. “We have also asked school managements to warn students against waiting for long hours outside the school,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-education-office-plans-staggered-exit-of-students/articleshow/85961167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is part of a study to compare a normal forest with the Miyawaki forests, or the urban forests that are gaining in popularity across India. Geographical tagging, also known as geotagging, is the process of adding geographical identification data. This data consists of latitude and longitude coordinates. The coordinates could then be used to identify the geo-tagged tree, and monitor them through satellites. Durga Singh, a Mescom employee, has initiated the development of Miyawaki forests in schools in rural areas. Out of the four projects taken up by him, this year he has completed two projects in Government Higher Primary School Golithattu near Nelyadi and Government School Alanthaya in Puttur. Durga Singh reached out to plant biotechnologist Smitha Hegde, and she along with her team, geotagged 570 trees in six hours. Smitha Hegde told TOI, “We have already geo-tagged two Miyawaki test sites near Kottara and Mangaladevi, and two regular forests developed in crematoriums at Pachanady and Ullal. Since these sites are in the urban area, when Durga Singh approached us, we decided to take up the geotagging along with a normal forest, so that we have a comparison of the urban and rural areas.” “The purpose is to see if Miyawaki forests actually grow faster and suit the Indian condition. Since they are planted so close together, I am interested in understanding their synergy and the tree-to-tree talk, how different species behave when they are together or apart. Maybe, in the future, if someone wants to develop a Miyawaki forest, we can give them data on the species that grow well. We are trying to generate some data, and find out if it truly works and if it works, what is the right combination for it,” she said. Currently, she has data of more than 3,000 trees. “I would like to see a comparison for a period of 10 years,” Smitha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/geotagging-of-miyawaki-forests-undertaken-to-study-impact/articleshow/85956681.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

In 2020-2021 academic year, 1.25 lakh applications were received. This year it has come down to 82,500,” a school education department official said. “After scrutiny, only 78,000 applicants were found eligible,” a school education department official said. Of the 1.25 lakh applicants, 70,300 got admitted under the quota last year. A lot system was used on August 19 to admit students under this quota and children were asked to join the schools on or before August 24. “Though the state government reimburses tuition fees for students admitted under RTE, parents still need to pay for notebooks, uniforms and transport, among others. With loss of livelihood, parents could not pay these fees and prefer government schools,” said S Arumainathan, state president, Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association. “Many parents admitted their wards in private schools for social status. Now, with loss of livelihood, they are content with government schools,” he added. Also, government schoolchildren are offered 14 welfare schemes including free notebooks, schoolbags, footwear and textbooks. K R Nandakumar, general secretary, Joint Action Committee for Private Schools Association, also cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the main reason for the fall in RTE admissions. “The government has also announced reservations for government school students in medical, engineering, law and other professional courses. It is also one of the reasons for the decrease in interest among parents to enrol their wards in private schools,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-cuts-tn-rte-admissions-by-29/articleshow/85934437.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Coimbatore||Expert team chalks out plan to save elephants from train-hits||Coimbatore: A team of experts from the Project Elephant division of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, deputed to look into deaths of wild elephants on rail tracks, visited vulnerable locations on the Palakkad-Madukkarai route on Saturday. The team, led by former chief wildlife warden of Kerala Hari Kumar, Bilal Habib of Wildlife Institute of India, scientist K M Selvan and Prajna Panda of Project Elephant division, carried out inspections with forest department officials from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The inspection was carried out on the basis of a case filed in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a forest department official said. While track A and track B runs between Coimbatore and Palakkad railway station, 1.8km stretch of track A and 2.8km stretch of track B passes through reserve forest in Tamil Nadu. As many as eight elephants had died in five accidents between 2008 and 2021 on the stretch. Of them, one was inside the reserve forest stretch. “Therefore, it is important to examine the entire stretch and gather vital details to formulate a plan and take measures to avoid elephant deaths on the stretch,” the official said. The team travelled in a special inspection train from Palakkad to Madukkarai railway station on track B and returned on track A till Walayar, said assistant conservator of forests M Senthil Kumar. “The team analysed the reasons for train hit, mitigation measures taken by the forest department and railway, and further course of action to be taken to avoid such incidents in future. It will submit a report to NGT,” he said. While several measures have been undertaken by the forest department to avoid such accidents, forest officials had sent a proposal a few months ago, seeking more facilities to avoid them. “We demanded a watchtower, additional five anti-depredation watchers and suggested two underpasses on the route. More signboards and solar lights need to be installed on the stretch,” Senthil added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/expert-team-chalks-out-plan-to-save-elephants-from-train-hits/articleshow/85961234.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ST bus staff driven round the bend with no pay in Covid time||MUMBAI: ST bus conductor Ambadas Goyekar (38) went into depression for not getting his salary for two months. He couldn’t pay his mother’s Covid treatment costs. This month he received a part of his due wages, but not enough. “Can we prevent more suicides in the workforce of nearly 1 lakh employees?” said Goyekar who is from Ahmednagar district. Staffers like him are opposed to the government’s “knee jerk” reaction every time an employee dies by suicide. Last year, there were two suicides of MSRTC staff — a driver in Ratnagiri, the other a conductor at Jalgaon — after which the government announced a financial aid of Rs 1,000 crore to pay pending staff salaries. This time, the suicide of a driver at Dhule once again woke up the government, which announced Rs 500 crore package to pay salaries for July and August. “We want a permanent solution -- something which will ensure that our bank accounts get credited every month. The only way to do this is perhaps a merger of MSRTC with the state government,” he suggested. ST bus driver Suresh Patil (43) says he is burdened with loans. Living in a 1BHK in Karjat with family, the driver whose take-home is Rs 13,000 says the stress at work can be “killing”. He said living conditions of many drivers and conductors are pathetic. Also, 90% of staffers have taken loans as salary payments have been delayed during Covid months. State transport minister Anil Parabsaid the bus corporation requires an average of Rs 300 crore towards salaries of employees.“We have asked the state to pay for staff salaries for some time,” he said, adding that MSRTC is exploring areas to earn revenue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/st-bus-staff-driven-round-the-bend-with-no-pay-in-covid-time/articleshow/85962900.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kochi||Kochi-based college to set up toy making unit||KOCHI: Aiming to blend women empowerment, education of kids and environmental protection in equal measure, a city-based educational institution is all set to start a toy manufacturing unit here. The unit which is being set up as part of the incubation centre of the educational institution will manufacture toys and dolls from waste cloths from the tailoring industry. Paving way for making the plan by the authorities of St Teresa’s College a reality, the Kochi corporation council has given its nod for allotting 300 sqft of space in its guest house at Kacheripady for the project. “It is a welcome gesture which even received the laurels from the Prime Minister. So, we have decided to allot space for the unit,” Mayor M Anil Kumar said. During his Mann Ki Baat speech on March 28, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had praised the attempts of the college authorities to make use of waste from tailoring units to make dolls. The Prime Minister also praised them for making such child-friendly dolls and donating them to anganavadis. It is by drawing inspiration from the acclamation given by the Prime Minister that those at the helm of the incubation centre of St Teresa’s College decided to start a permanent unit where toys would be made using waste cloths from tailoring firms. “Earlier also, we made dolls out of waste cloth from tailoring units and donated such dolls to anganwadis. Our initiative was mentioned by the Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat programme. Now, we plan to start a commercial unit where toys would be made out of waste from tailoring firms,” said Professor Nirmala Padmanabhan, head of incubation centre of St Teresa’s College, Kochi. One of the main objectives of the unit is to provide employment for women. “We would be giving employment to a couple of women at the onset. Later, we expect that we will be able to provide employment for at least 20 women. We want to make it a self-reliant and sustainable unit. The motive of the entire incubation centre of our college will be women empowerment. We would be designing projects with this objective,” Nirmala said. Besides manufacturing various toys for the kids, the unit is planning to make dolls which will help the kids learn. “We will be making dolls to help teachers educate kids on good touch and bad touch. We will distribute it to the anganwadis in the state so that the teachers there can use it as a tool for teaching. The dolls can be used for demonstrating how to button up shirts, tie shoelaces etc. This will help the kids learn such skills at an early age. Moreover, the toys can also be used for teaching various lessons,” she said. The waste from tailoring units will be washed and sanitized first. Then, toys will be made and the technical support for it will be given by the department of fashion designing and the society of Teresians for environmental protection. Some of the renowned fashion institutes across the country also would be supporting the endeavour technically. The college authorities have started a small unit in Munnar a couple of months ago as a pilot project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-allots-space-for-unit-making-toys-from-fabric-waste/articleshow/85958994.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Pradeep could hardly believe it until he confirmed it was indeed from the verified account of the acclaimed Brazilian novelist. Since then 55–year-old Pradeep has been ecstatic. Besides Coelho’s name the autorickshaw also had the name of his most famous novel, “The Alchemist”, written on it in Malayalam. While posting the picture on Twitter, at 4.51am on Sunday, Coelho had written: “Kerala, India (thank you very much for the photo) and it garnered around 13,700 likes, 1,143 retweets and 185 comments, mostly by Keralites, by evening.  While one user has invited the writer to Kerala, another commented: “Keralites love this book. It is recommended by every teacher to their students.” A voracious reader, and at home with world classics, Pradeep, who is from Cherai, says he has always dreamt of traveling to Brazil, to meet his favourite writer, and to Europe as well. “In in his every novel there are lots of things that forces readers to think about life. My favourite work is “The Alchemist”. I have read his other works too, including “Eleven Minutes”, “Pilgrimage” and “Veronica Decides to Die”. I also like to read the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka. My favourite writer in Malayalam is VKN,” says Pradeep. His favorite character is Fermina Daza from “Love in the Time of Cholera,” by Marquez. Photos of VKN, Coelho and Osho are pasted inside the auto. The first novel he read was Indulekha by O Chandu Menon when he was around 20 years old, he says. Pradeep says no other medium including TV can impart knowledge like books, but adds that they are becoming costlier every day and he is struggling to keep up his reading habit. “Everybody used to scold my father saying he spends most of earnings on books. If he gets Rs 500 a day, he would buy books for Rs 400. He always wants to read books. Sometimes, he would continue to read till 2am,” says Pranav, a degree student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/paulo-coelho-tweets-on-kerala-thanks-to-pradeep/articleshow/85959018.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The minister was speaking at a district-level Teachers’ Day celebration at St Cecily’s English Higher Primary School in Udupi on Sunday. “Teachers should grasp the concept of NEP and its objectives, and be part of its implementation for a better tomorrow. It is possible for them to shape students into better citizens, and thereby build a strong nation. The role of teachers in building new India is significant,” he said. “While celebrating the Azaadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, India is facing several issues, of which many existed even before Independence. Apart from those issues, new problems too have emerged. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasised that the foundation for a new India should be laid in schools spread across the country. Teachers are committed to achieving the goals to shape a new India,” the minister said. Udupi MLA K Raghupathi Bhat said the district has earned a good reputation educationally, only because of the quality education that teachers impart here. Udupi DC M Kurma Rao said the role of teachers is important for students to showcase their talents. “Teachers in the district have served tirelessly even during the Covid-19 crisis. They have strived to continue academic activities by following the directions of the district administration during the pandemic,” the DC said. The minister honoured 17 teachers and 43 retired ones, who were selected for the district-level award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/be-part-of-nep-implementation-min-tells-teachers/articleshow/85956694.cms||---
---||Kochi||Schools in Ernakulam chalk out safe reopening plans||KOCHI: With the government considering the reopening of schools, many schools in Ernakulam have started planning for the safety measures to be implemented for the smooth conduct of classes amid the pandemic. Many schools have started making an action plan regarding the Covid protocol enforcement, sanitization and the arrangement of students in the classroom. Teachers said it would be a challenging task to get the schools back to normalcy. Readying the infrastructure is the main task for schools as most of the classrooms have not been used for more than one year. Sanitization teams will be deployed in all schools for ensuring disinfection and hygiene. Electric and electronic equipment are being inspected. As there will be restrictions in the number of students to be seated in a classroom, seating arrangements will have to follow social distancing norms. Conducting classes in full strength will not be possible and most schools are likely to change to hybrid mode of education by relying on both online and offline classes till everything gets back to normalcy. Covid monitoring cells will be constituted to maintain the protocols in all areas and activities in the school. Juby Paul, principal of Toc-H Public School, Vyttila, and general secretary of Kochi Metro Sahodaya, said that various meetings are being held at sahodaya and school levels. All schools Dwant to be ready to conduct classes as soon as the government permits reopening. Though action plans are being drafted, it will be finalized based on the government’s decision and directives. “We expect there will be enough time to get ready for reopening after the government announces its decision. But most schools are making the arrangement in advance. Cleaning the classrooms is the first step. It will take some time to begin the usual operations amid the pandemic. If schools reopen, school buses will have to operate. Most buses have been lying non-operational for more than a year and drivers have started restoring them to running conditions,” he said. Meanwhile, the parents are giving mixed reaction about the plan to reopen the schools. Though most of the students are excited to get back to schools as they are not comfortable with online classes, parents are worried about the safety of their kids. However, many think that learning to live with the pandemic is the only option ahead and schools in Kerala too must reopen like other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dist-schools-chalk-out-safe-reopening-plans/articleshow/85959042.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

With waste dumping in the said land causing public nuisance, a resident moved the high court and the court asked the corporation to take immediate measures to stop waste dumping in the area permanently. After failing to identify the land owner, the corporation is to install CCTV surveillance cameras in the area. The corporation will also remove the waste now piled up in the land. “We have sought the details of the vacant land from village authorities. We used to remove waste from the land. But, anti-social elements would dump the waste there every night,” councillor M G Aristotle said. It is not an isolated incident as many parts of the corporation are witnessing similar incidents. “In most cases, it is very difficult to identify the owners. So, we would first remove the waste at our cost and would charge the amount from the owner later,” mayor M Anilkumar said. “There requires a paradigm shift in the mindset and culture of the people. We would be erecting CCTVs in such places,” Anilkumar said. At the same time, incidents of councillors being attacked for questioning waste dumping are increasing in the city. In the past few days, two women councillors and the husband of another councillor were attacked by those who dump waste. “On Saturday morning, my husband and I were on jogging. Suddenly, we saw an autorickshaw driver littering a waste bundle onto the shoulders of road. We rushed to the spot and questioned. He shouted at us. When my husband was writing down the number of the vehicle, he drove away the autorickshaw in a rush. Hadn’t my husband moved back immediately, the vehicle would have hit him,” said Mini Dileep, the councillor from Ayyappankavu division. “It is learnt that there is a group which collects the garbage from hotels. They would simply dump the waste thus collected in the street,” she said. Similarly, Jagadambika, the councillor from Kunnumpuram division, was attacked for questioning waste dumping on August 19. “Local residents informed me that a woman threw waste on the road. When I reached there, I asked her to take back the waste. Her reply was that she had the right to dump waste. She also said that it not to take back that she dumped the waste,” Jagadambika said. Later, the brother of the woman hit Jagadambika on her head. Lonappan, husband of Suja Lonappan, another councillor, also had similar experience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/waste-dumping-becomes-a-headache-for-kochi-corp/articleshow/85959122.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||World||Officials: Gadhafi's son freed after 7-plus years in detention||CAIRO: Libyan authorities on Sunday released one of Muammar Gadhafi's sons after more than seven years of detention in the capital of Tripoli following his extradition from neighboring Niger, the country's interim leader said. Prime Minister-designate Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said in a tweet early Monday that al-Saadi Gadhafi had been released in compliance with a previous court order. Mohamed Hamouda, a spokesman for the transitional government, said the son walked free from Tripoli's al-Hadaba prison, where many Gadhafi regime officials are being held pending trial, mostly in connection to the crackdown on the 2011 uprising that toppled the longtime ruler and led to his killing. Hamouda did not elaborate on the circumstances of the son's release. Local media reported al-Saadi Gadhafi was released after he was acquitted on charges dating back to the uprising against his father's rule. Following his release, he travelled to Turkey, according to the al-Marsad news website. “We cannot move forward without achieving reconciliation," Dbeibah said in the tweet announcing the release. His government has been given the task of leading the war-wrecked country to elections before the end of this year. At the time of the 2011 revolt, al-Saadi Gadhafi headed a special forces brigade that was involved in the crackdown on protesters and rebels. He was smuggled across the desert to Niger in 2011 just as his father's regime was crumbling. He was extradited in March 2014 after he, as well as colleagues who accompanied him, “failed to respect the conditions of his stay in Niger," the West African nation's government said at the time. The dictator had eight children, most of whom played significant roles in his regime. His son Muatassim was killed at the same time Gadhafi was captured and slain. Two other sons, Seif al-Arab and Khamis, were killed earlier in the uprising. Seif al-Islam, the one-time heir apparent to his father, has been in Libya since his release from detention in 2017. Another son, Hannibal, is reportedly detained in Lebanon. The rest of the children are still at large having sought asylum in neighboring Algeria along with Gaddafi's wife and al-Saadi's mother, Safiya. The mother, a sister and two brothers were granted asylum in Oman in 2012 and moved there from Algeria. During his father's rule, al-Saadi Gadhafi was known for his lavish lifestyle and he treated Libya's soccer league as his personal fiefdom. He played for several Libyan teams — and for an Italian team until he failed a drug test. At various times, he headed Libya's soccer federation and its national team. In one case, security forces opened fire on fans at a 1996 match attended by al-Saadi, killing a number of people in murky circumstances. He is also suspected in the 2005 killing of Bashir al-Riyani, a popular Libyan soccer player who was a vocal critic of Gadhafi's regime. Following his extradition, prosecutors in Libya said he faced charges in connection to abductions and rapes during the 2011 uprising, misuse of his post and the killing of al-Riyani. The elder Gadhafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 years before he was ousted by an uprising in August 2011. He was captured and killed two months later. The oil-rich country plunged into chaos after the uprising and has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments based in Libya's west and the east, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/officials-gadhafis-son-freed-after-7-plus-years-in-detention/articleshow/85964345.cms||---

The Rims management, however, denied that any ragging took place but said a minor scuffle broke out and has been resolved after its intervention. When TOI spoke to a 2017 batch MBBS student, the student confirmed the ragging took place and said, “A few students of the 2019 batch who haven’t even passed their final examination and had appeared for the supplementary examination are involved in it. They reside in hostel number 3 and 4 but they went ahead and created ruckus in hostel number 7 after ragging a few juniors which led to the confrontation.” According to sources in Rims, around half-a-dozen students of the 2019 batch residing in hostel numbers 3 and 4organised a party in one of their hostel rooms on Saturday night after their supplementary examinations were over. They were consuming alcohol and later ragged a few students of the 2020 batch in hostel number 7, which is primarily for seniors, and created a ruckus there well past midnight. When some senior students of the hostel, who were preparing for the NEET (PG) 2021 scheduled for September 11, objected to the ruckus, the inebriated group started misbehaving with them, the sources said. Soon after getting a wind of the incident, the hospital management led by Dean (student welfare) Dr Hirendra Birua rushed to the hostels and spoke to students. “We have spoken to all the students who have been said to be involved in misbehaviour. After hearing them, the matter has been resolved,” he said. Dr Birua rejected the claims that a ragging incident took place and said that students sometimes get into such incidents and everything is in order now. Meanwhile, a delegation of the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA) led by its president Dr Vikas Kumar also visited the hostel campuses and said he has also spoken to the students. He said the association will discuss the issue with the Rims management on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ragging-plaint-at-rims-mgmt-denies-charge-calls-it-a-scuffle/articleshow/85958628.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||More relaxations likely for Durga Puja as Covid-19 curve plummets||Ranchi: The Jharkhand government is likely to reduce the curbs for the Durga Puja this year after the number of Covid-19 cases in the state came down substantially, officials of the state disaster management department said on Sunday. Chief minister Hemant Soren is scheduled to chair a meeting of the state disaster management authority (SDMA) on September 8 in this regard, the officials added. The department’s minister, Banna Gupta, who also holds the health portfolio, said the Covid situation in the state is under control and the government has been relaxing the norms strategically. He, however, said they cannot afford complacency and have been upgrading hospitals and other health infrastructure to face any unforeseen challenges amid fears of a third wave, which has been predicted to affect children. He added, “The chief minister will take a call on September 8 on further unlock after reviewing the situation.” A disaster management department official said, “A proposal for reopening of the schools for lower classes is under consideration. If all goes well, people can expect more relaxation for the Durga Puja and other festivities with certain checks and balances.” The official added, “As far as allowing devotees inside the temples, the government is looking at it after considering the religious sentiments.” Meanwhile, BJP and other right-wing groups have been demanding a full reopening of the temples. Even priests and businessmen dependent on religious tourism for their livelihood have been pressing for it for long. A few days ago, businessmen and priests staged a daylong bandh in Deoghar while a padhyatra was held in Ranchi demanding reopening of the temples. Supporting the demand, state president Rajesh Thakur of Congress, which is a part of the alliance government, said, “So far, lockdown and unlocks done by the state government have been well timed compared to other states as a result, we managed to fight the pandemic in a better way. Now that the cases are fewer, we are certainly hoping for some more relaxations to streamline the education sector, balance religious sentiments and work for the creation of livelihoods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/more-relaxations-likely-for-durga-puja-as-covid-19-curve-plummets/articleshow/85957715.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||JSR organisers demand fewer curbs for Puja||Jamshedpur: The 350-plus Durga Puja organising committees of the Steel City has urged the state government to issue the guidelines for the Pujas at the earliest. With just a month left for the industrial town’s most celebrated festival, the Puja committees have said delay in the announcement of the guidelines would create confusion among the organisers. “Due to delayed announcement of the guidelines during the first wave of the Covid pandemic there was lot of confusion among the Puja committees, particularly relating to idols and pandals as these components need time for preparation. Hence, we appeal to the government to be a bit more sympathetic this year,” said CN Banerjee, president of Kendriya Durga Puja Samiti, (KDPS), which is the apex body of over 350 committees. He said frequent amendments to the guidelines also added to the uncertainties in last year’s celebrations. Therefore, puja committees are expecting guidelines that are prepared with wider inter-departmental consultations to avoid the scope of repeated changes. Significantly, unlike the previous year, puja organisers are vocally insisting on permission for conventional method of performing rituals at the pandal all three days, Mahasaptami, Mahashtami and Mahanavami, respectively. Besides, the organisers are also seeking permission for dhakis, sound system and distribution of bhog in total compliance with social distancing-norms. “Pushpanjali and sindoor khela are integral and essential parts of the Durgatsava celebration, the government should recognise this while preparing draft guidelines,” said Banerjee. North Zone Durga Puja Committee functionary Anjan Sarkar said last year’s instructions relating to the ceiling on the number of the people at the Pujas did not go down well with the committees. “Its practically not possible to perform the rituals with just four or five persons. The government should not limit the number to seven like last year,” he urged. More so, the 2020 instructions to cover the pandals from almost all four sides to minimise crowds is also not acceptable to the Puja committees. “We cannot accept the fact that people will leave without a darshan of the deity,” said a member of a prominent Puja committee, requesting anonymity. A delegation of the KDPS met state health minister Banna Gupta here on Sunday and urged him to issue the guidelines as early as possible. Earlier, on September 3, a KDPS delegation gave representation to chief secretary Sukhdeo Singh in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jsr-organisers-demand-fewer-curbs-for-puja/articleshow/85958312.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said 33-year-old Bryan Riley appeared to be suffering from mental health issues and had been slowly unravelling for weeks, repeatedly telling his girlfriend that he could communicate directly with God. After a gunfight with police and deputies — where dozens "if not hundreds of rounds" were exchanged outside a Lakeland home, Judd said, authorities found an 11-year-old girl shot multiple times, plus three deceased victims. They included a 33-year-old mother still holding her 3-month old baby boy, the infant's grandmother, and a 62-year-old who lived at a neighbouring home. Riley, who served as a sharp shooter in both Iraq and Afghanistan, seemingly targeted the family at random, Judd said during a press conference Sunday. Preliminary evidence shows 40-year-old Justice Gleason just happened to be an unlucky stranger out mowing his lawn Saturday night when Riley drove by, saying God told him to stop because Gleason's daughter was going to commit suicide. A second, unidentified victim, came to confront Riley, telling him that story wasn't true and warned they'd called police if he didn't leave, Judd said. Authorities responded to the scene but never found Riley. About nine hours later, around 4.30 am, Riley returned to the home, laying out glowsticks to create a path leading to the house to draw officers "into an ambush," Judd said. Randomly, a lieutenant far in the distance, heard popping noises and immediately put the agency on active-shooter mode, bringing all state and local law enforcement in the area to the scene. Following the sounds of gunfire, authorities arrived at the home and found Riley's white truck ablaze and an unarmed Riley outside, dressed in camouflage. Riley immediately ran inside, where authorities heard another round of gunfire, "a woman scream and a baby whimper," Judd said. Officers tried to enter the front of the house, but it was barricaded. When they circled to the back, they encountered Riley, who had on full body armour including head and knee coverings and a bulletproof vest. Authorities exchanged heavy gunfire, before Riley retreated back into the home, according to the sheriff. Everything fell silent, Judd said, until a helicopter unit alerted authorities on the ground that Riley was coming out. He had been shot once and was ready to surrender. Meanwhile, officers heard cries for help inside the home, but were unsure whether there were additional shooters and feared the home was booby-trapped. A brave sergeant rushed in and grabbed an 11-year-old girl who had been shot at least seven times. She told deputies there were three dead people inside, Judd said, adding that she was rushed into surgery and was expected to survive. Deputies sent robots into the home to check for explosives and other traps. When it was clear, they found the unidentified mother and baby, Gleason and the family dog all dead from gunshot wounds. The baby's grandmother was also found dead in a home out back. Authorities did not say if or how Gleason was related to the other people in the home. "They begged for their lives and I killed them anyway," Judd said Riley told them during an interrogation, adding Riley was playing mind games during the interviews with detectives. Authorities declined to say how many times the victims had been shot or where they were in the home, but said they were all hiding and huddling in fear. Authorities said Riley's girlfriend of four years, who he also lived with, had been cooperative and was shocked, saying he was never violent but suffered from PTSD and had become increasingly erratic. She said he'd spent the previous week on a mission from God stockpiling supplies for Hurricane Ida victims, including USD 1,000 worth of cigars. "Prior to this morning, this guy was a war hero. He fought for his country in Afghanistan and Iraq," said Judd. "And this morning he's a cold-blooded killer." Riley, who had no criminal history, also told authorities he was on methamphetamines. His vehicle had also been stocked with supplies for a gunfight, authorities said, including bleeding control kits. While being treated at the hospital, Riley jumped up and tried to grab an officer's gun. "They had to fight with him again in the emergency room," Grady said, before he was ultimately tied down and medicated. He is expected to recover and will be transferred to jail to face charges. "The big question that all of us has is, Why?" State Attorney Brian Haas said. "We will not know today or maybe ever."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-gunman-killed-4-including-mom-still-holding-baby/articleshow/85964366.cms||---

It has issued an orange-coloured warning for Monday and Tuesday. “The formation of a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal during next 24 hours is likely to intensify the rainfall activity over both districts of Goa,” scientist, IMD, Panaji, Rahul M said. On Sunday, after the wettest 24-hour spell in September — 132.9mm recorded on July 19 was this season’s wettest — the seasonal total touched 2,735.9mm (107.3 inches). A rainfall of 2,739.5mm (107.3 inches) is normal at this stage and the last two days have reduced the 2% deficit to nil. The normal mark for the four-month season is 2,975.6mm (117.1mm), but an overall deficit or surplus of 19% is considered normal. While the 24-hour rainfall of 39.1mm just a day earlier on Saturday was the wettest during September so far, Old Goa had received the highest of 71.6mm of rainfall on the day. On Sunday, a few centres received moderate rainfall — Pernem 49.8mm, Sakhali 39.4mm, Margao 371.mm, Quepem 36.2mm and other centres on a lesser scale. IMD had forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on September 5, while it is likely to be heavy in few places from Monday to Wednesday. With the monsoon becoming active again, isolated and scattered rainfall may continue for about seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-on-orange-alert-for-next-two-days/articleshow/85959617.cms||---
---||Goa||Canacona floods after heavy spell||Poinguinim: Heavy to very heavy rain from Saturday night till early Sunday morning led to waterlogging in several parts of Canacona taluka rekindling apprehensions of a 2009-like flash flood situation.  In the last 24 hours, till Sunday morning, the taluka had received 185mm of rainfall, the heaviest among all centres. However, there were no damages or casualties reported on Saturday. Some areas were flooded till around 9am, but soon, thereafter, the rain subsided. The most affected was the service road to Galgibaga at Apheval with about 150m of the stretch inundated for nearly 3 hours. Movement along this route was halted till the water receded. The flooding of this stretch brought memories of the 2009 flash floods for locals when the two persons had lost their lives here. The flash floods had, besides claiming the two lives, caused extensive damage to plantations, houses and livestock. The Talpona river crossed its danger mark and those residing close to the banks of the river, who were the most affected during the flash floods, prepared to shift elsewhere as the water began rising around 5am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-floods-after-heavy-spell/articleshow/85959653.cms||---

Six vehicles were damaged, many had a narrow escape. It also brought down many electricity and other cables. The tree fell across the lane which is usually full with vendors sitting under the tree on footpaths selling spices, plastic ware, towels and other such items, especially on Sundays. It took fire personnel two hours to cut the tree and clear the road for traffic Electricity supply was restored in a couple of hours. Councillor Shammi Salkar said, “The municipality plays politics even in welfare work for people. They do not even supply tree cutters for opposition councillors. There are over 13 dangerous trees in the market area and they can come down any time. Fortunately there were no casualties. In the same lane, the Matoli bazar is put up every year.” . The vendors had expected the tree to fall during Cyclone Tauktae and had stopped people from parking below the tree for some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tree-in-vasco-market-falls-six-vehicles-damaged/articleshow/85959688.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Rise in salinity levels hits agricultural activities in Poinguinim||POINGUINIM: Increased flow of water and rise in salinity levels in Galgibaga river’s upstream stretches due to a breach in a sandbar on the sea front has hit agricultural activities with saline waters rendering fields uncultivable in Poinguinim. Cyclone Tauktae broke the sandbar on Galgibaga beach in mid-May, opening a direct access between the river and the Arabian Sea. This led to a greater flow of the sea water into the river and submerged fields along a 3-km stretch of its banks — from Vani bandh to Bhata bandh in Poinguinim. “The fields have now turned into barren lands. We farmers, especially from Koleabandh, who are mainly Velips, had toiled so hard for years, but now this natural calamity has deprived us of our food,” farmer Ram Velip said. More than 30 farmers from Koleabandh are hoping the authorities will step in to restore their agricultural land. The farmers at Koleabandh, Mahalwada, sustained their livelihood by repairing the breaches to bundhs. However, the situation has gone out of their control due to the massive inflow of saline water into the fields. Another farmer Janardhan Velip said that during recent years, they have faced a lot of problems due to natural calamities, such as cyclones. “Even our drinking water wells have been contaminated, thereby forcing us to walk longer distances for water,” he said. Stretches of Canacona areas along the river banks had been surveyed by the water resources department as part of a World Bank project to repair bundhs by constructing gabion structures. “The department should pursue this project as it not only protects the interests of 30 to 40 farmers, but also residents along a 3km stretch,” local Sunil Painginkar said. Zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naik Gaonkar said that he had surveyed the damage. “It is not just fields, coconut plantations have also been affected,” he said. In the future, the yield of coconuts could also decrease gradually, arecanut plantations and pepper creepers may also die due to extra salinity. The drinking water wells will also be affected considerably. However, farmers could grow salt-tolerant crops such as Goa Dhan 1,2,3,4, he said. Recently, a team led by Canacona deputy collector Nilesh Daimodkar, Canacona mamlatdar Vimod Dalal, zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naik Gaonkar, WRD Canacona officials inspected the internal bundhs at Mahalwada. “From May this year, about 800m of shoreline has been subjected to large-scale erosion, besides the sand bar’s destruction,” senior geographer and environmentalist F M Nadaf said. Hundreds of casuarina trees and ipomea vegetation had protected the 1.7-km long Galgibaga beach. But the heavy erosion is uprooting the trees. According to unconfirmed reports, salinity has increased in the Galgibaga river. “This might affect the mangrove vegetation negatively and a further rise in salinity may affect khazan lands,” Nadaf said. Similarly, due to storm surge, spring tide, and cyclonic disturbance, there is a possibility of rise in river level, which may affect the settlements along the river banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rise-in-salinity-levels-hits-agri-activities-in-poinguinim/articleshow/85959720.cms||Albert Fernandes

This led to a major brawl between two neighbours living in Sayajipura on Saturday. Police said that while Ramesh Vasava’s family was taking care of and feeding the stray dog, Mukesh Vasava’s family had a problem with it as the dog always defecated outside their house. In his complainant, Mukesh Vasava alleged that when his son Paresh went to complain to their neighbour Ramesh Vasava about their dog, Ramesh’s son Shailesh started a fight. When Mukesh tried to intervene, Ramesh came out of his house with a wooden stick and beat up Mukesh and Paresh. Mukesh had to be taken to Jamnabai Hospital and was later referred to SSG Hospital as his jaw was fractured. Ramesh too lodged a counter complaint against Mukesh and Paresh alleging that the father-son duo hurled abuses at him and his son Shailesh and even threatened to kill them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jaw-broken-in-neighbours-brawl-over-stray-dog/articleshow/85958095.cms||---

---||Goa||Govt yet to make Mhadei disputes cell functional||Keri: On July 27, the Goa government conveyed its approval for the formation of the Mhadei River Water Disputes Cell. However, with no officer appointed as yet, the cell is yet to become cell functional. During recent state assembly session, water resources minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues had assured the House that an independent Mhadei Water Disputes Cell would be constituted to look after matters concerning the water dispute with Karnataka. On August 3, WRD chief engineer Pramod Badami issued an order stating that “the office of the executive engineer IX along with its sub-division will function under the cell and the said engineer would be called as executive engineer of the Mhadei cell”. “The executive engineer of the Mhadei cell shall coordinate directly with the advocate general of Goa on all matters relating to the Mhadei” read the order. On August 4, Badami, speaking to reporters, had said that the concerned officer would be appointed to the cell within two days. A social activist from Panaji, Mahesh Mahambre told TOI, “One month has passed, but no officer has been appointed on the cell. This indicates the lethargic attitude of the government. We had raised apprehensions three months ago about there being a lobby of officials of Karnataka origin in Goa’s WRD. This could be raising hurdles against the interest of Goa in the Mhadei matter.” Also, presently, as the senior counsel for Goa, P S Narsimha, has been inducted as one of the Supreme Court judges, Goa government is in the process of appointing a new counsel. “So far a decision has not been taken when the SC has scheduled the hearing in the matter of SLP on September 8 and in the matter of contempt petition on September 9,” Mahambre said. WRD chief engineer Badami told TOI, “The file pertaining to the appointment of the executive engineer on the cell is in the final process of government approval. As soon as the approval is given, we will appoint the officer who will independently and efficiently look after the matter. We are making all the possible efforts to protect Goa’s interest in safeguarding the lifeline.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-yet-to-make-mhadei-disputes-cell-functional/articleshow/85959963.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

In an unheard-of crime, a chain snatcher in Padra dared to commit his crime in broad daylight on Saturday by entering the house of woman and robbing her gold necklace worth Rs 1.4 lakh. According to the police, 58-year-old Smita Amin runs a tiffin service, which they believe, the robber must be aware of. On Saturday afternoon, the robber came to her house and identified himself as a mechanic of a nearby garage. He brought raw chicken meat to her house and asked her to cook it for him. Amin, who caters to both vegetarian and non-vegetarian customers, asked the man to wait in her house while she cooks it for him. After the food was prepared, Amin packed it and was handing it over to the man, when he snatched her gold chain and ran out of the house. Amin raised an alarm, but there was no one at her home who could give the man a chase and by the time she reached outside, the robber had already disappeared. Later, Amin lodged a complaint of chain-snatching and trespassing at Padra police station. “As described, the man was not taller than 5 feet and was speaking in Hindi,” said inspector P T Jaiswal of Padra police station, adding that investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/robber-snatches-womans-gold-necklace-from-inside-her-house/articleshow/85958075.cms||---
---||Business||After techlash, China eyes stake in private company||Beijing’s municipal government has proposed an investment in Didi Global that would give state run firms control of the world’s largest ride-hailing company, according to people familiar with the matter. Under the preliminary proposal, Shouqi Group — part of the influential Beijing Tourism Group — and other firms based in the capital would acquire a stake in Didi, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Scenarios under consideration include the consortium taking a so-called “golden share” with veto power and a board seat, they added. Didi said on Saturday that it was working with regulators on a cybersecurity review and reports about a Beijing-led investment are untrue. The company’s US-traded shares spiked 7.5% on Friday morning in New York. The stock has declined 36% this year. It’s unclear how large a stake the city is eyeing and whether its proposal will be approved by senior government officials. Didi is currently controlled by the management team of co-founder Cheng Wei and president Jean Liu. SoftBank and Uber are Didi’s biggest minority shareholders. The Beijing municipal party committee press office didn’t respond to a request for comment, while calls to Shouqi went unanswered. And the Beijing Tourism group didn’t reply to a request for comment. Local governments have traditionally had a big say in the restructuring of companies on their turf, and the envisioned solution dovetails with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s priorities of redistributing wealth and curbing the influence of the internet sector. The city’s proposal could entail taking a sizeable slice of Didi or a nominal stake accompanied by a golden share and board seat, the people said. The latter model would be akin to an earlier investment by the government in ByteDance’s Chinese unit, which gave the state entity veto-rights over important decisions. The takeover proposal comes alongside a swath of penalties Xi’s administration is considering for the country’s ride hailing leader, which debuted in New York in June over the objections of the Cyberspace Administration of China. It’s since been ensnared by probes into data security and the way it treats its millions of drivers. Many of the options Beijing is weighing involve re-asserting state control over a company that’s traditionally operated in a legal grey zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/after-techlash-china-eyes-stake-in-private-company/articleshow/85964515.cms||---

Collector Vimala R and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B attended the meeting. If implemented, Nagpur would be the first city in the state to reimpose restrictions though it has very few cases as compared to Mumbai which is reporting more than 400 cases for the past few days. Making his intentions clear that restrictions would be in place before festival season, Raut said that the shops would be allowed to operate till 4pm while the restaurants timing would be curtailed by two hours till 8pm from current 10 pm. All establishments, except medical and essential shops, would remain shut on Saturday and Sunday. Declaring that Covid-19 third wave has entered the district, the minister, however, said that he would be holding talks with various stakeholders, including hotel management and shopkeepers associations before implementing the restrictions. “Out of 13 patients who have contracted the deadly virus, a majority of them are fully vaccinated and one of them is a child. It shows that there is no guarantee of not contracting the infection even after vaccination. Some four to five Delta Plus patients were also found earlier. We have sent 78 samples for genome sequencing and waiting for the results. But at this stage, we cannot take any risk,” said Raut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-cases-rising-curbs-to-return-in-nagpur-dist-in-a-couple-of-days-raut/articleshow/85978865.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Business||I-T returns exemption forms for 75 years and above notified||NEW DELHI: The income tax department has notified declaration forms to be filed by those aged 75 years and above with banks to get exemption from filing I-T return for FY22. The FY22 Budget had introduced a provision for exempting senior citizens of 75 years and above having pension income and interest from fixed deposit in the same bank from filing income tax returns for the financial year beginning April 1. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has now notified rules and declaration forms which senior citizens would have to file with the specified bank who in turn would deduct tax on pension and interest income and deposit with the government. Such exemption from ITR filing would be available only in case where the interest income is earned in the same bank where pension is deposited. The income tax act requires all individuals having income exceeding the threshold limit to file their income-tax returns. While the threshold for senior citizens (60 years or more) and super senior citizens (80 years or more) is slightly higher, crossing the threshold saddles one to file tax-returns. Non-filing of tax return not only attracts penalties and but one also gets subject to higher rate of TDS. Nangia & Co director Itesh Dodhi said, recognising the compliance burden on senior citizens, this year’s Budget brought in some relief to the senior citizens above the age of 75. “The CBDT has notified forms for declaration by the senior citizens to the banks and notified the reporting requirement by the specified banks. With dedicated counters for senior citizens in all major banks and banks providing doorstep banking to senior citizen, this measure is expected to make life easier for senior citizens,” Dodhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/tax-planning/i-t-returns-exemption-forms-for-75-years-and-above-notified/articleshow/85964542.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Amid rise in snakebite cases, sarpmitras fight superstition and red tape||Nagpur: A man from Ramtek got his five-year-old son discharged against medical advice (DAMA) from the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMCH) where he was rushed to following a snakebite a couple of days ago. The Wildlife Welfare Society, an NGO working for zero bite, said the father was enticed by a local buabaaz (a black magician), who offered instant cure. Without proper medical care, the kid faces the threat of developing complications after a bite by the common krait on August 31. IGGMCH officials said the kid was admitted to the PICU and later shifted to the general ward. “On September 2, his leg started swelling again. When his parents were informed of shifting the kid back to PICU, they created a scene and took DAMA,” they said. On Saturday, the father sent a video of the limping kid to WWS claiming he has recovered. “The treatment at IGGMCH cured the kid, but the father is portraying it as a miracle of the buabaaz. If he had continued treatment, the kid may have completely recovered,” said WWS secretary Nitish Bhandakkar. Since August, the NGO has attended over 12 snakebite cases from the city and periphery areas and multiple episodes of buabaazi. Two out of the 12 cases, including 10-year-old Adarsh Mishra, ended in death. Mishra’s case was highlighted by the media as he was allegedly refused admission by both the medical colleges. The other snakebite victim died due to delay in treatment. While medical colleges said sankebite cases are routine, WWS claims they have gone up. As snakebite is treated as a medico legal case (MLC), over 45 minutes are wasted in formalities, said Bhandakar. The NGO is now fighting for zero snake-bite deaths and eradication of superstition. “People must understand that treatment is done only at a good hospital. At government hospitals, the treatment is very affordable and the patient does not incur an expenditure of more than Rs5000. Buabaazi is rampant is villages,” he said. Regarding zero snakebite deaths, Bhandakar said, “We can’t prevent bites but we can certainly avoid deaths with timely help. We not only rescue the reptile but also help the patient reach the hospital. We also inform doctors about the snake’s identify. At times, doctors call us to identify the snake.” Another hurdle is loss of time. Doctors treating 10 -year-old deceased Adarsh too said that he was brought quite late leading to a severe impact on the neurological functions. “We have been insisting on treatment first, documentation later. As people reach late, the time lost is not known. WWS has written to the government to ensure snake-bite cases are immediately started on anti-venom drugs,” he said.

The earlier approximate 40,000 per day commuters in 200 Aapli Buses plying on 80 routes has now crossed the 80,000 mark with the addition of 90 red buses. “The NMC’s ticket revenue too has increased by almost Rs 1.5 lakh per day,” confirmed a senior official from the civic body’s transport department. According to the data, 290 buses are making over 3,270 trips on various routes. The 290 buses collectively cover a distance of almost 56,000km daily. The NMC is generating daily ticket revenue between Rs 11 lakh and Rs 12 lakh as against Rs 7 lakh to Rs 9.5 lakh per day till mid-August, the official said. Before Covid struck, NMC used to operate 360 buses with over 1.5 lakh passengers using the service, said the official, adding, the daily revenue hovered between Rs 17-Rs 20 lakh. Furthermore, the official said closure of educational institutions due to the pandemic has impacted recovery. However, routes like Sitabuldi to Khaparkheda and Butibori to Hingna are getting a good response with the Khapri depot topping the revenue chart. While the revenue per bus at this depot is around Rs 22 per kilometre, electric buses are clocking the lowest per kilometre in earnings. The six women-only electric buses are yet to make a mark. Earnings per kilometre of these buses is just Rs 7.79 km, states the data. Transport committee chairman Jitendra Kukde said the NMC will soon deploy all the Aapli Buses. More buses will help NMC curb overcrowding on many routes. “Increasing the frequency of buses during busy times will reduce the density,” said Kukde, adding, “NMC should adopt an alternative approach by extending the ticket duration so that commuters can wait for less-crowded vehicles.” Month—Commuters Jan ’20 —53,13,191 Feb ’20—52,68,490 Mar ’20—31,51,817 Sept ’20—1,758 Oct ’20—26,715 Nov ’20—6,20,759 Dec ’20—11,67,331 Jan ’21—15,55,516 Feb ’21—17,30,144 Mar ’21—95,78,688 Apr ’21—4,17,994 May ’21—2,95,991 Jun ’21—9,17,434 Jul ’21—12,94,955 xxxxxxxxxxx||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-aapli-buses-draw-more-commuters/articleshow/85961003.cms||---

Though the state government or the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), which owns the waterbody, have not given permission, NGOs term the plan as a threat to flora and fauna in and around the lake. TOI had on August 11 reported how the operator failed to start development works despite having possession of the garden for 20 months and yet kept the garden closed for morning and evening walkers for a long time. Also, how Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) turned a blind eye to this and did not take action against the operator. On July 3, 2017, the government had leased out the garden, spread in 42.85 acres, to the MTDC and directed the NMC to hand over its possession. The government had not leased out the lake to the MTDC. Director of Garuda Amusements Pravin Jain, in a press release sent to TOI, said, “We plan to start boating and a floating restaurant in the lake.” Another director Narendra Jichkar said, “Boating was allowed in the lake a few years ago. At present, there are no boating facilities in the city. The garden will be redeveloped into a tourism project. Boating and floating restaurant will add to the attraction. We will seek necessary permissions from water resources department.” NL Sawarkar from NGO Jan Samasya Nivaran Manch said any activity in the lake is condemnable. “Everybody is opposed to the garden redevelopment. A large number of people use the garden for fitness and recreation. There is need to facilitate some more amenities apart from improving the existing ones. There is no need for lawns and commercial activities in the garden,” he said. “If the operator succeeds in his plan, the lake will also be affected. The government should cancel the lease to MTDC and hand over the garden to the NMC or NIT,” he said. Activist Joseph George said boating and floating restaurant will be in violation of guidelines related to reserve forest, conservation of wetland and water bodies. “Ambazari lake and garden are known for migratory birds and rich flora. Any commercial activity in the garden and lake will entirely disturb the existing ecosystem. Some people with vested interests are targeting all open spaces, gardens, lakes and green spaces in the city. We are heading towards mass concrete jungle,” he said. An NMC official confirmed no such permission has been given to start boating or floating restaurant in the lake. Jain said entire project will be completed by 2023. “We will give free entry to morning walkers. Plan is to develop new walking track along with cycling track,” he said. Jichkar said all amenities listed by the MTDC will be completed within two years. “We will tap revenue sources for recovery of investment after developing the garden. Our target is to first give a nice tourism place for the people,” he said. West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre had ensured reopening of the garden for morning walkers. On his demand, the NIT had requested the MTDC to hand over the garden to it.

The accident occurred at Perungalathur near Chennai. The victims were identified as Raja Ganesh, 21, of Trichy, Naveen, 21, of Mettur, Ajay, 21, of Trichy, Rahul, 20, of Pudukottai, and Arvind Shankar of Chennai. Except Navin, who was driving the car, the others were engineering graduates of Hindustan University. They had come to the city on Friday to take part in the campus interview scheduled for Monday. On Friday, they went to their college and got their course completion certificates. They were staying at their friend’s room in Kelambakkam and had visited a few places in Chennai on Saturday. They decided to go for a drive towards Perungalathur and return to their room when the accident took place. Truck laden with iron rods was parked at the spot for 2 daysPolice checked the CCTV camera footage from the accident spot and found that around 1.30am, Naveen lost control of the car while trying to overtake a truck. The car hit another vehicle and then rammed a trailer lorry laden with iron rods parked on the roadside. The bodies were recovered by fire and rescue services personnel after an hour-long operation and sent to the Tambaram GH in Chromepet for postmortem. The car was completely mangled and they had to pull out the bodies from underneath the truck. Some motorists said such illegal parking of trucks on roadside was posing a risk to other road users. Officials had failed to act against the truck that had remained parked at the spot for more than two days. The deaths could have been averted if the truck was removed from the spot, they said. Relatives and friends of the victims were inconsolable on seeing the bodies of the victims at the mortuary. The Chrompet traffic investigation police have registered a case of rash driving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-4-engineering-graduates-friend-die-as-car-rams-truck-in-perungalathur/articleshow/85964599.cms||Sindhu Kanan
---||Nagpur||Denying mid-day meal is serious misconduct, says Nagpur bench of Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Making it clear that depriving children of nutritious food supplied by the government is serious misconduct, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has upheld dismissal of an anganwadi worker. “The petitioner has betrayed them by not providing food under mid-day meal (MDM) scheme. This misconduct is very serious. It has the potential of causing long-term adverse impact on the nation’s next generations, which are our future,” said a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor. “The children are fully dependent for their meals on guardians, mentors and seniors. It is for their seniors and masters to conduct themselves in a way that would not betray such innocents even in a slightest manner,” said the judges. Petitioner Sadhana Uke had challenged her termination by the department of women and child welfare on April 20 last year, after putting in over 30 years of service. She was charged with not providing meals to many beneficiary students during her tenure at Sakoli in Bhandara district. Uke was also blamed for depriving many of them from having micronutrients by not distributing vitamin supplements and other food items. While denying other charges, Uke admitted that she did not provide food packets and nutritious meals to some students. “Though no departmental enquiry (DE) was held, she was granted sufficient opportunity. DE is unnecessary as the petitioner has admitted most of the acts of her misconduct. Any need for holding a detailed inquiry would be obviated as the admission is the best proof of the misconduct. We do not think there is any violation of the principle of natural justice in the present case,” said the bench. There is sufficient material available for the exercise of discretion by the authority, the bench said. “Such discretion being based upon the material available on record, we do not think that now it would be possible for us to judicially review the order. In such circumstances, the exercise of discretion by the competent authority in terminating the petitioner’s service cannot be seen to be perverse, arbitrary or contrary to the law,” said the judges before dismissing the plea. WHAT HC SAID * Petitioner betrayed children by depriving them of nourishment under MDM * It may cause long-term adverse impact on next generations * Children are dependent for their meals on guardians, mentors & seniors * Seniors & masters shouldn’t betray faith even in slightest manner * Once misconduct is admitted, need of holding detailed inquiry is obviated||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/denying-mid-day-meal-is-serious-misconduct-hc/articleshow/85961171.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kolkata||Reopening of air link revives hope in central Kolkata business hub||KOLKATA: The resumption of air travel between India and Bangladesh on Sunday has lifted the hopes of businesses in central Kolkata which are now eyeing a turnaround ahead of the Puja. Traders and hoteliers in New Market, Free School Street, Marquis Street, Lindsay Street and Park Street, where trade depends heavily on Bangladeshi customers, breathed a sigh of relief after the first flight from Dhaka, a Biman Bangladesh one, landed at Kolkata airport on Sunday morning for the first time since flight movement between the two countries got suspended during the second wave in April. TimesViewThis, even without our guests from Bangladesh, is one of the most crowded areas of the city. It is great news that commerce will resume in this district; lots of businesses have faced a very difficult time since the outbreak of Covid-19. But care needs to be taken and all protocols need to be followed if we want the busy times to last.“Our business depends entirely on a section of upscale Bangladeshi customers who come over during Eid and Puja to shop from here. Even in the midst of the pandemic, there were a few dedicated customers last year. But this year, business has been down to almost nothing in the last few months. I just hope the resumption of flights bring back some of my loyal foreign customers,” said Sunil Mahato, who owns a garments shop on Marquis Street. A New Market shop owner said Bangaldeshi customers constitute nearly 50% of their sales. “With travel resuming with medical visas, most people would be back with their patients. We hope they will come to shop at New Market, too,” said Vinay Mangalani, owner of Bombay Silk Stores. This was echoed by the owners of Menka, another popular saree shop at New Market. While Bangladeshis account for over 50% sales at New Market, they also boost 70% business in hotels, guest houses and foreign currency exchanges on Sudder Street, Marquis Street, Free School Street, Royd Street and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and 80% of the transport business in the area. “During Pujas in pre-Covid times, we used to tie up with other guest houses to arrange for additional rooms for our patrons. But their absence now has hit us badly,” said Mir Ashraf Ali, manager of Oriental Hotel on Sudder Street. Eateries like Kasturi and Radhuni on Free School Street which also largely depend on Bangladeshi customers have already started decking up their menu with lots of items that are favourites among the visitors.

---||Nagpur||Customs office planned 14 yrs after Mihan-SEZ began||Nagpur: A classic case of putting cart before the horses is the customs processing area (CPA) of Mihan-SEZ. Officially notified as a special economic zone (SEZ) in 2007, it does not have a CPA, which is the official entry point to the zone, even after nearly 14 years. The developer Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) has started building the CPA only 4 to 5 months ago with not even the basic structure ready yet. A CPA is the basic requirement for any SEZ to operate and the first step, said sources. It is the official gateway to the zone with rest of the area supposed to be demarcated by a boundary wall. All goods coming in and going out of the SEZ are checked and assessed in terms of value at this point. The idea behind having a single entry and exit point is to prevent pilferage of goods and to ensure proper accounting. There are chances that a company may show the output from its unit outside and claim it to be made in the SEZ to avail tax benefits. All the goods entering and leaving the SEZ are first scrutinized at the entry point where customs department usually has its offices. Only after thorough assessment at the entry, physical goods are allowed to be taken in or out. Sources in the development commissioner (DC) office say, it goes without saying that a CPA should have been built right in the beginning. The standard specifications of a CPA are easily available. All it needs is cabins for the officials, washrooms, visitors area, canteen, record room, and CCTV control room, said a source. At present, customs officials are placed at the administrative building of MADC. At the time of clearance, the units inform them and the customs staff gets the formalities done accordingly. An MADC official handling the issue said they are waiting for the customs department to provide the design and requirement for a CPA. On getting it, MADC would appoint a consultant for the process. On the delay in constructing the customs examination area (CEA), the MADC official said it was only in 2019 that the company was asked by the customs to build CPA. The matter related to the CPA has been taken up by the development commissioner (DC) also. “The CPA, which should have been set up first, is being built now, after so many years. We have taken up the matter with MADC and the response each time is not very satisfactory,” said Sraman Vasireddy. There is little progress at the site, and the customs officials, who should be having their office at the entrance, are now in the administrative block. The MADC is building a road till the proposed service road that would connect the SEZ with outer ring road from Kothewada side. There is no clarity on which agency would build the service road — whether MADC or the National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI), he said. On the service road, the MADC official said NHAI has been approached with a request. At present, the goods pass through a toll gate which has makeshift facilities. An area of around 1.5km also does not have a boundary wall leading to easy movement of outsiders, pointed out the DC. IN A NUTSHELL All goods coming in and going out of an SEZ are cleared through customs examination area (CEA) CEA has offices of customs and other facilities to scrutinize goods At present, customs officials are placed in MADC’s administrative block Clearance formalities happen on intimation by units MADC says it was asked to build CEA only in 2019 CEA should have come up in the first place: Development commissioner||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/customs-office-planned-14-yrs-after-mihan-sez-began/articleshow/85961309.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Kolkata||Police gesture surprises 4 agitating teachers on Teachers’ Day||Kolkata: Teachers’ Day had a political twist to it when four among the five contractual teachers who drank “pesticide” outside Bikash Bhawan in Salt Lake on August 24 were felicitated with flower bouquets by Kalighat police on Sunday while the fifth, who is still in hospital, had a visitor in Bengal opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari. The four teachers, as part of an ongoing agitation, tried to reach Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee’s home around 1pm on Sunday. Banerjee by then had left for the airport to catch a flight to New Delhi. The teachers’ car was stopped and they were led to the Kalighat police station, where they thought police would file charges against them. To their utter surprise, they were offered seats and then tea, biscuits and a plate of sweets. For over half-an-hour, the duty officer spoke to them and requested them to come with a proper appointment. Around 2pm, the teachers stepped out of the police station, a smile on their faces and bouquets in hand. One of them, Chhabi Chaki, said: “They behaved well with us.” Another teacher, Asima Patra, said: “It surprised us. Maybe today being Teachers’ Day, they chose to behave like this. We would have been happier if the state government reacted on this (issue).” In the evening, Adhikari visited RG Kar Medical College Hospital, where the fifth teacher is in the ICU. Stepping out, Adhikari asked why state education department officials, including the minister, chose not to visit the teacher even on Teachers’ Day. He promised her family to visit again. The five teachers, all members of Shikshak Aikya Mukta Mancha, are protesting their transfer to north Bengal. Last month, outside the Bengal education department’s headquarters at Bikash Bhawan, they had consumed poison in front of police. Two teachers were admitted to RG Kar hospital and three others to NRS Medical College and Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-gesture-surprises-4-agitating-teachers-on-teachers-day/articleshow/85961548.cms||---

It was found under a tree located at the Sodepur Railway siding on Saturday. The CID said the breakthrough came after questioning Manish Singh, a Bihar-based sharpshooter who was brought from Haryana on transit remand. Sleuths said after repeated interrogations, Singh revealed where he had hidden the one-shotter weapon. A CID team went to the spot and recovered it. Agency sources said a string of recent arrests had made a supplementary chargesheet necessary. “While we will send the weapon for forensic analysis, we are readying to file the supplementary chargesheet soon. We have questioned Singh along with the three other sharpshooters and are going to investigate further on some strong leads provided by them,” said a source, adding that Anish Thakur — another sharpshooter arrested in Chennai — had provided important leads too. The two other shooters were nabbed in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cid-finds-shukla-murder-weapon/articleshow/85961835.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

But on Sunday, many under-privileged kids strolled through the riverside and got precious lessons about the river’s rich bio-diversity on the occasion of Teachers’ Day. “What better way to spend Teachers’ Day than with so many curious students asking questions about the environment,” said a retired school teacher and an entomologist, Suvarna Sonavne, who took the children aged between eight and 15 years on a tour of the river on the stretch behind Vadodara central jail. Kids listened with rapt attention as Sonavne explained to them the importance of crocodiles as well as birds and insects for the ecosystem of the river. “If the children understand our ecosystem, they will be able to conserve it in future. Such walks should be organized more often for the school children so that they learn about the importance of every living being around us,” Sonavne said. “Whenever I heard about Vishwamitri, the first thought that came to my mind was that of crocodiles. But on Sunday, I learnt about a variety of living beings including the insects that have actually helped in keeping the river alive. Every little living being is important for our environment,” said Nandini Vankar, a class 9 student. Dev Parmar too echoed Nandini’s words and said it was an experience of a lifetime for him. “We never knew that this river is home to such rich biodiversity and how it is keeping our ecosystem alive. Sonavne ma’am explained about how birds, smallest of insects and butterflies are important for the environment,” he added. Environment teacher Hitarth Pandya, who organized the walk, said, “People usually think that many of the plants and shrubs that grow along the river are of no use. It is important for the kids to know that these plants ensure survival of many insects that in turn are food for birds. The walk was organised to make them understand the importance of our ecosystem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/kids-learn-biodiversity-by-vishwamitri-riverside/articleshow/85958183.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: School demand, discounts boost battered College Street Boipara business||KOLKATA: College Street Boipara — the more-than-a-century-old paradise for book lovers — has turned the tide in its favour, riding on the demand for books in schools, the start of new semesters and announcements of competitive examinations, along with sales and discounts by stores and stalls. Battered by the pandemic, a lockdown, two cyclones and a status quo in academics, leading to suspension of in-person classes and curtailment of syllabus, business in the world’s biggest hub of new and old books had hit an all-time low. But, over the past few weeks, Boipara — housing hundreds of stalls of new and used books, rare academic journals, fiction, maps and everything in between — has managed to turn the page. Business is yet to be as brisk as before the pandemic, but the situation has improved to a large extent. “Schools have started new academic sessions, and two boards have bifurcated the academic year. Several parents have been coming to purchase school and reference books, as examinations will be based on multiple-choice questions. BIZ IMPROVES Colleges have started new semesters and dates of some competitive exams like state eligibility tests have also been announced. All this has improved business by almost 60% to 70%,” said Pratap Das, secretary, Sir Ashutosh Booksellers’ Association. College Street ‘sale’ gets huge responseLast month, several big bookstores on College Street offered sale on books, and the response surprised everyone. Dey’s Publishing sold thousands of books over a period of five days in the middle of August. “It was a sort of a social experiment too. We wanted to do to see if people still buy books. To our surprise, more than 250 to 300 people would be waiting outside even before we opened the place. Due to Covid safety guidelines, we were only allowing 20 people at a time and even that did not deter those waiting outside. We managed to sell thousands of books, but the assurance in return that people will continue to buy physical books was a much greater earning,” said Subhankar Dey of Dey’s Publishing. Pandemic-induced lockdown and Cyclone Amphan dealt a cruel blow to Boipara last year, destroying books worth crores and damaging several stalls. The Presidency Alumni association had helped street-side book traders with financial resources and books after the cyclone last year. “In 2020, the market was shut for over four months, but even after resuming business, there would hardly be any customers. Most of our books were damaged. But help poured in from all quarters, including those staying abroad. Business has improved, with sales up to Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 on a good day,” says Biswajit Malakar, owner of Bengal Book Stall. “Second-hand books are selling very well,” says Purnendu Ghosh, another book-stall owner. “Customers are bargaining hard, but we are grateful that at least they are back to rekindle our hopes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/school-demand-discounts-boost-battered-college-st-boipara-biz/articleshow/85962664.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Suvendu looks likely to skip CID session||Kolkata: With Calcutta High Court likely to hear on Monday Bengal opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari’s petitions to quash the five FIRs against him — including the one over which CID has summoned him — he is unlikely to turn up at Bhawani Bhawan. Adhikari may write to the CID, said an aide. He has been asked to appear in connection with the October 2018 death of his former security guard, Subhankar Chakraborty. The guard was found with gunshot wounds in the Contai police barracks and died before he could be shifted to a Kolkata hospital. Adhikari has not cancelled any of his pre-scheduled programmes, including some in Bankura, on Monday. He did not issue any formal statement on the issue. CID has also issued fresh summons to Sambhu Maity, Adhikari’s driver, and aide Sanjay Skukla, to appear for questioning in the same case on Tuesday. “Adhikari is unlikely to attend the CID questioning, as the agency does not have the locus standi to call him for questioning right now. The matter is sub judice,” the aide said. While not directly referring to the summons, Adhikari said: “I am threatened every day, but I cannot be intimidated. I am a bachelor and do not have any responsibility, apart from my parents.” He had moved the high court in July, urging it to quash all FIRs against him, arguing that they were lodged out of “political vendetta”. The Nandigram MLA had also prayed for transferring the cases from the state agencies to the CBI. The matter is likely to come up for hearing on Monday. Sources close to Adhikari pointed out that he was scheduled to attend some political programmes in Bankura in the afternoon. “In the backdrop of the state lawyers submitting in HC before that the state has no urgency in these cases, there appears to be no ground for the CID to summon him,” the aide claimed. CID has formed a five-member special team — consisting mainly of officers from the anti-homicide section — to question Adhikari. He is likely to face questions on his actions on October 13, 2018 once he came to know that Chakraborty had sustained bullet injuries. The sleuths will be armed with 43 pages of statements that have been prepared based on the statements recorded by Adhikari's former security guards. The CID has decided to videograph his statement, if required. A senior inspector-general of police has been assigned to lead the questioning session, though he may not be a direct part of the questioning. CID sources said a major portion of this questioning would be on claims made by Chakraborty’s wife, Suparna, who claimed that there was a “deliberate” delay in getting an ambulance to transfer her husband to Kolkata even though he was extremely serious. The investigators have recorded the statement of 16 cops. All of them were either present at the barracks (opposite the Shantikunj residence of the Adhikaris) on the day Chakraborty died, or were involved in the probe after his death while on his way to a hospital in Kolkata. Adhikari’s driver has also been summoned for questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-looks-likely-to-skip-cid-session/articleshow/85962237.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee goes to Delhi, dares ED to prove charges against him||KOLKATA: Daring the central agencies to prove that he was involved “even in a 10-paisa transaction”, or at least bring proof of any wrongdoing in the public domain, Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday said he was “ready to hang himself publicly” if they succeeded. Banerjee left for Delhi on Sunday, saying he would go to the ED offices and submit himself to questioning. The agency had issued him a summons to appear at its Delhi office in connection with the illegal coal-mining scam. Sources said Banerjee planned to visit the ED office after 11am on Monday, alone. Banerjee was “ready to face any and every probe”, and said he left it to the “people to decide” whether the summons to him was political retribution. “They could not take us on politically; now they are trying to use central agencies to further their political agenda,” he said. Banerjee, who spoke to the press at the Kolkata airport before leaving for New Delhi, said: “I will go (to the ED’s Delhi offices). They have called me to Delhi in a case which is registered in Kolkata. Why aren’t they bringing anything in the public domain?” “I had said in November whatever I had to say on this issue. Seven months later, I stick to my stand. I had already said in a public meeting that if any central agency can prove anything against me — or even bring anything in the public domain — they do not have to use CBI or ED against me, they can keep the gallows ready, I will hang myself.... They speak of this huge scam. Some say Rs 100-crore scam, some even Rs 1,000-crore scam. I dare them to prove even a transaction of 10 paisa involving me.” Referring to the ED chargesheet implicating state ministers, present and former MLAs and an ex-IPS officer, Banerjee said: “There are some who have been seen receiving bundles of cash in public, shamelessly and without hesitation. Yet, their names do not figure in the (ED) chargesheet. Why? Do the CBI and ED have cataract in their eyes when it comes to these people?” The ED chargesheet doesn’t name the Bengal opposition leader who is also implicated in the Narada case, along with several other MPs.” Banerjee said he would like to invite any “national-level” BJP leader to sit face-to-face with him and publicly debate on what the central agencies had done in the last five years and the fate of the country in the seven-year-rule of the Narendra Modi government. “You (BJP) decide the date, time and venue, and I will go; if I cannot expose them, I will not step into the political arena any more,” he said. ED has issued a summons to Banerjee and his wife, Rujira, in the illegal coal-mining scam. Both have been asked to appear at the ED office in Delhi for questioning. Rujira has written to the ED, asking them to question her in Kolkata saying it was impossible for her to travel to Delhi with two minor children in the midst of a pandemic. Ahead of the Bengal polls, the CBI had questioned Rujira at her Harish Mukherjee Road home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-goes-to-delhi-dares-ed-to-prove-charges-against-him/articleshow/85962168.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Will contest from Bhowanipore, says BJP as it talks to lawyers||Kolkata: Bengal BJP has said it will contest the Bhowanipore bypoll but has also kept the door ajar for possible legal steps. Trinamool Congress has asked BJP to check precedents before questioning the bypoll. Addressing reporters, state BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said: “BJP is ready to contest the polls with full might and we won’t appeal for its cancellation as we are ready to counter TMC. BJP has come to stay in Bengal and not run away.” But later in the evening, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “We are in talks with senior advocates.” “EC’s (Election Commission’s) announcement,” he continued, “came at a time when the State Election Commission holds the view that the situation is not conducive to hold municipality election. Then how did EC grant permission for a bypoll and why just for Bhowanipore?” Ghosh’s statement came hours after Bhattacharya said BJP would not leave the poll battleground under the garb of legal steps. The legal approach cropped up after BJP leaders spoke to a few lawyers. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari even had a word with advocate Mahesh Jethmalani. According to party sources, it is largely believed that most state BJP leaders are averse to taking the legal route, given EC’s “primacy” in holding polls. Trinamool Congress leaders on Sunday indicated there were several examples of bypolls being held within a span of six months and that is “well within the constitutional rights” of a political party. Assembly polls, spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, could not be bracketed with municipal polls. “Citizens get services even if municipal body election is pending. But if an MLA is not elected, then even MLA Development Fund will not be released. BJP is opposing because they are sure of losing the bypoll,” he said. CPM’s Sujan Chakraborty said there was no question of a constitutional crisis, given the current situation. “The order seems to be specially for one particular constituency. Moreover, the chief secretary has said that Mamata Banerjee is the candidate and that is not in his jurisdiction to say. Any political party can challenge the order if they want,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-contest-from-bhowanipore-says-bjp-as-it-talks-to-lawyers/articleshow/85961265.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||It’s official: Mamata is TMC candidate from Bhowanipore||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee would be the Trinamool Congress’s bypoll candidate from Bhowanipore, the party announced on Sunday, a day after the Election Commission announced that the bypoll would be held on September 30. Banerjee needs to win from an assembly segment by six months of having taken oath — which works to November 5 — in order to stay on as chief minister. She had contested from Nandigram and lost to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari by a narrow margin. Banerjee later challenged the Nandigram results; the matter is sub judice in Calcutta High Court. Bhowanipore is Banerjee’s home turf, and is also the assembly segment she had won twice before: in 2011 (when she stormed into power) and in 2016. In the 2021 polls, it was represented by Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who won by more than 28,000 votes over BJP’s Rudranil Ghosh. Chattopadhyay resigned as Bhowanipore MLA on May 21, paving the way for Banerjee. He now needs to get himself elected by November 21 to stay on as agriculture minister. The party also named Jakir Hossain and Amirul Islam for the two other seats — both in Murshidabad — where bypolls have been announced: Jangipur and Samserganj. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) has kicked in at these places. The EC’s announcement for bypolls on Saturday had left clear indications that Banerjee would be the candidate for the September 30 bypolls in Bhowanipore. EC said the decision was “a special request” from the Bengal government that highlighted the “constitutional exigency” of having the election and the risk of a “constitutional crisis and vacuum” if it were not held. Banerjee did not make any comment on Sunday. But while heading to the Salt Lake stadium to inaugurate the Durand Cup, she made a brief stop on DL Khan Road, when she spotted party workers painting wall graffiti in her name. “Be careful,” she said, rolling down her windows, urging them to maintain Covid protocol. As excited party workers milled around her, she spoke briefly with them and left. While Trinamool was first off the blocks in announcing its list, Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacaharya indicated that the party may firm up its list for the three Bengal bypolls after a meeting on Tuesday (September 7). State BJP president Dilip Ghosh indicated they would field a strong candidate against Banerjee. The candidates’ list for Jangipur and Shamshergunj didn’t pack any surprise. Both Hossain — a former state minister — and Islam had won the seats in 2016. Hossain is still recuperating from a life-threatening bomb blast at Nimtita railway station on February 17. The injuries had confined him to a hospital bed for four months. He said he would file his nomination very soon. The Left Front on Sunday said it would contest the bypolls, including Bhowanipore, but would wait for Congress to name their candidate. CPM leader Rabin Deb said: “In 2016 and 2021, the Bhowanipore seat was allotted to the Congress. The nomination must be filed by September 13, so there is time for Congress to decide that. We always want a poll to be held.” Congress, however, did not clarify whether it would like to contest against Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/its-official-mamata-is-tmc-candidate-from-bhowanipore/articleshow/85962097.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Five months before Punjab assembly elections, no party has clear edge||JALANDHAR: With just around five months left for the Punjab assembly elections, the political scene appears muddled. What is complicating the matters is the internal troubles within the parties. Their potential to pose challenge to one another depends more on what happens within in next dozen or so weeks. Will parties be able to retain their traditional strongholds and will there be direct fights, triangular or four-cornered contests in some segments will all depend on several factors like picking right candidates, containing rebellion and ensuring least factionalism. The turf war between CM Amarinder Singh and state Cong chief Navjot Sidhu has continuedAt present, the political fluidity is such that even anti-incumbency factor cannot be gauged as the ruling party’s president is attempting to be rid of it by passing the buck solely to Punjab chief minister; Akali Dal is still facing questions for some its actions during its 10 year rule till 2017; and BJP is locally carrying the baggage of the Union government’s decisions and performance. Arvind KejriwalIndian National CongressAppearing in comfortable position till five months back, less due to its performance but more due to the fractured opposition, the party has suffered serious setbacks in perception battle recently. It is not only grappling with questions of performance, being raised loudly within the organisation too, but also the lack of clarity on flow of power. Trouble was brewing for the past over two years but chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh managed to tackle it and did not allow precipitation of any challenge to him. However, the Punjab and Haryana high court order scrapping probe into sacrilege and police firing cases by an SIT in second week of April blew the lid off and dissatisfaction within the Congress Legislature Party spilled over into public domain. Though Navjot Singh Sidhu has been appointed the Punjab Congress president but trouble for the party is far from over. As turf war continues between the state chief minister and the chief of state unit of party, their energies appear more focussed on winning the internal battle. Amarinder has been displaying manoeuvrability and checking power shift to Sidhu, who, in turn, is displaying tenacity and refusing to play second fiddle. After his four ministers joined Sidhu and his loyalist MLA Pargat Singh in questioning Amarinder’s working, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Congress to defend functioning of its own government. Over a month after taking charge, Sidhu’s organisational abilities are now under public gaze and he has already had faced criticism over his selection of advisers. Aam Aadmi PartyThe party perhaps lost its best chance at power in Punjab in 2017, mostly due to its own follies. Nearly five years ago, it had a few prominent faces but did not declare a CM face. This time, it is hunting for a face but unable to fix on one as of now. The party’s USP of novelty in politics with fresh faces has largely been lost by now. It may have recovered part of lost ground, mainly due to frustration among people over infighting in Congress, but has its own internal crisis. Perception is, no party leader from Punjab is able to speak truth to party supremo Arvind Kejriwal or read his mind. However, Punjab unit president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann’s camp has clearly mounted pressure to declare him the CM candidate of the party. Kejriwal’s party followed BSP supremo Mayawati’s model of strict control over state affairs and took it to next level with micro-management by the central party set up. Any party member making any dissenting voice was shown the door or was simply marginalised. So many of its MLAs have moved out or fallen out of favour, reducing the party’s strength in the assembly and influence outside. Mann has been singing party high command’s tune, right from the time of suspension of two MPs and sacking of Sucha Singh Chhottepur in 2016. He is now counting on being picked by Kejriwal who has declared the party would have chief ministerial candidate going into the polls. What AAP is facing is largely unprecedented in Punjab as part of its own cadres, in place of sticking to the norm and accept any decision of the high command, openly making noises when any gains of the party in perception battle are still unclear. Shiromani Akali Dal – Bahujan Samaj PartyWith the Badals firmly at the helm, SAD is not facing any issues of internal troubles like the Congress and AAP. Some noises are heard at a few places every once in while but party supremo Sukhbir Singh Badal is swift in tackling these. Thus, the biggest challenge is to recover its core base – Sikhs and farmers, which overlap to a great extent. Though the Congress is facing questions about performance now, Akali Dal still carries heavy baggage of ‘poor’ performance during its 10-year rule, especially on Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing issues. Akali Dal still carries heavy baggage of ‘poor’ performance during its 10-year rule, especially on Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing issuesUnlike the incumbents, SAD has no confusion about chain of command as whatever Sukhbir decides is accepted without any questions and even formality of discussions not needed. The party cadres are enthused over alliance with BSP. Their only trouble is answering questions about sacrilege cases, police firing, power purchase agreements (PPAs) and and overall perception of corruption and poor governance. Whenever heat against former DGP Sumedh Saini or other police officials increases, it also leads to questions for Akali Dal on social media. Even as Sukhbir has tried to take lead on rival parties by starting his poll campaign early, he has hit major road block — opposition by farm groups. It is blaming the Congress and AAP for protests it is facing by some groups of farm activists. On the other hand, BSP is facing internal crisis. The discontentment over seat sharing with SAD among party cadres continues to brew even weeks after tie up. So far, BSP Punjab’s rank and file would demand poll alliance but Mayawati would decide otherwise. This time, the alliance has taken shape well in advance but a big section is not happy over the “quality of seats” it got. Bharatiya Janata PartyThe party in power at the Centre is facing both external and internal crisis. It is apparently set to fly solo into the Punjab poll battle after a gap of 30 years. It was in 1992 that BJP contested assembly election in Punjab alone and then the parliamentary election in 1996. Does the state unit have the muscle memory after three decades? After it formed alliance with SAD in 1997, the party enjoyed power in the state for 15 years. Since its major poll victories across India 2014 onwards, there has been clamour for going alone or to play big brother in Punjab. Seems, party leaders have got their wish but not the right conditions as SAD walked out of the alliance “taking the moral high ground”. Now, the external pressure of farmers protest has caused the internal unrest too and there have been unprecedented desertions, with even some known names making unceremonious exit Notwithstanding, the party leaders are putting up a brave face and claiming to form the government in the state. Given the demography of the state though, these claims appear as good as were of BSP in the past, when it contested alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/5-months-before-elections-no-party-has-clear-edge/articleshow/85962926.cms||IP Singh
---||Chennai||Chennai: Steady spell of rain catches people offguard; more likely||CHENNAI: The city is likely to get light to moderate rain in some areas on Monday due to a cyclonic circulation system that has build up in the region. This system triggered short spells of intense rain in a few parts of the city in the afternoon on Sunday. A forecast by met department said that the sky condition on Monday is likely to be generally cloudy. Light to moderate rain is likely to occur in some areas. Maximum and minimum temperature will be around 34 degree Celsius and 26 Celsius respectively. A flooded road in MadipakkamA met department official said that there was a possibility of a low pressure forming in the Bay of Bengal which would lead to more rain in the coming days. “Till that happens, the city will experience light to moderate rain. This is due to the effect of the monsoon season,” he added. The withdrawal of the southwest monsoon is also causing changes in weather conditions, he said. The sudden rain on Sunday after a cloudy afternoon led to water-logging in many parts of the city. The core areas and the southern suburbs received the maximum amount of rain. Anna University received 19 mm, Taramani received 34 mm, Nandanam got 18.5mm, MRC Nagar got 8.5mm and Meenambakkam got 8.5 mm of rain till 7.30pm. Nungambakkam recorded 2mm rain. Areas such as Royapettah, Triplicane, Chepauk, Saidapet, Nandanam, Central, Adyar, T Nagar and neighbourhoods on the OMR and ECR also received copious spells. Since June, the city has received 387 mm of rain as against a normal of 351 mm, an increase of 10 percentage, said a weather blogger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-steady-spell-of-rain-catches-people-offguard-more-likely/articleshow/85964638.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Power & financial woes crippling Jalandhar small scale units: Study||Chandigarh: Small scale industrial units in Jalandhar have been hit hard by power constraints, absence of effective administrative support, lack of basic facilities, financial constraints and lack of approach to the local market, a study conducted by the faculty of Lyallpur Khalsa College Technical Campus has revealed. The study ‘Constraints and Prospects of Small Scale Industries in Punjab’ focused on major constraints faced by small scale industries selected from five sub-sectors — machinery parts, hand tools, spare parts, auto parts and pipe fitting industries — in Jalandhar district. The study said the small scale industry is well recognised for its contribution to employment, innovation and economic dynamism and is considered as an engine of growth, and acts as an indispensable part of a healthy economy. The study by associate professor Inderpal Singh and assistant professors Ubique Bedi, Rupinder Sampla and Tarunjit Singh revealed that Jalandhar has 12% of total number of small scale units registered in Punjab with 13.5% share of employment generated and accounts for 10.4% share of total fixed investment by the small scale industries in Punjab as per the district industrial centre’s record for 2018-19. In a nutshell, the study concluded that the growth and development of the small scale industries can be assured by providing sufficient and appropriate finance, upgrading the technological base by connecting all the district industrial centres (DIC) and small industries development corporation (SIDCO) under separate network and also by providing marketing support to the units. Jalandhar has 20,000 units Punjab has major industrial clusters of small scale industries in Jalandhar, Amritsar and Ludhiana. Jalandhar is the country’s leading producer of sports goods and is well-known for its electric goods, automobile parts, hand tools, steel and iron rolling mills, rubber goods and pipe fitting products. Jalandhar has about 20,000 small scale industries with an estimate of an annual turnover of approximately Rs 45 million, says the study. Shortage of power The results revealed that the small scale industrialists were reluctant to go for modernisation owing to the high cost of installing alternative sources of power due to increased rate of interest on bank loans. Further, high power tariffs and fluctuations in voltage have hindered the growth of the sector. To address this situation, the generating capacity of the existing power station should be maximised and new power projects should be set up. Difficulty in Loans It has also been found that non-availability of loans from banks lead small scale industries to take financial assistance from private moneylenders, which charge high rates of interest. Another major factor is that industrialists feel that the amount which is granted by banks is relatively less than the required amount. Some of the entrepreneurs are of the view that their energy and zeal get wasted in proving their credit worthiness to banks to get sufficient financial support. Firms of age between 11-20 are suffering more financial problems as they are in the developing stage and need more resources and capital. Thus the study recommends that the central government should direct public sector banks to issue loans to the small scale industries for entrepreneurial development with less documentation and formalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-financial-woes-crippling-jalandhar-small-scale-units-study/articleshow/85962935.cms||Sanjeev Verma

He said discussions were underway with district collectors and health authorities and that he will be visiting Kanyakumari, Tenkasi, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar districts to finalise arrangements for the camps. Subramanian also said the state will receive the biggest stock of vaccine yet — 19,22,080 doses — by Sunday. TN had requested additional supply to vaccinate people living in the nine districts along Kerala border. Daily case count in the neighbouring state is between 25,000 to 30,000. Tamil Nadu has so far inoculated 3.31 crore people. The daily vaccine coverage, which was above 5 lakh last week, dropped to 3,64,965 on Sunday. For the fourth consecutive day, the number of fresh infections in Tamil Nadu was on the rise. As many as 1,592 people tested positive in the past 24 hours pushing the state's case tally to 26.22 lakh. Compared to Saturday, the infection count increased marginally in 19 of the 38 TN districts including Chengalpet (127), Tiruvallur (84), Trichy (56) and Madurai (18). Nagapattinam witnessed the steepest rise from 29 to 46 new cases on Sunday. New cases in Chennai continued to remain stable around 160. Of 21,193 tests,167 were positive on Sunday. The district's test positivity rate of 0.8% is below the state's figure of 1%. Coimbatore once again reported the highest number of new cases (224) but there were no deaths in the district. Since the district shares a border with Kerala, health authorities have started to test more people there. Last week, 10,000 samples were screened everyday. It was 11,815 on Sunday. With a high recovery rate of 98%, the number of active cases in TN has dropped to16,282. The case fatality ratio continues to hover around 1.3%. A total 35,018 Covid-19 patients from the state have succumbed to the disease. This included 18 people who died on Sunday. Among them, 15 had comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-plans-to-hold-10000-vaccination-camps-on-september-12/articleshow/85964635.cms||---
---||India||Desiraju’s initiative in developing mental health policy stands out||By Soumya SwaminathanThe first time that I met Keshav Desiraju was when he was Union health secretary and I was the director of the Tuberculosis Research Centre. We were having a discussion on challenges in the TB control programme. What struck me was that he could get to the heart of the problem immediately, that he could identify what the bottlenecks in implementation were and then look for solutions in a constructive manner. The second thing that I noticed was that he was a very inclusive person, in the sense that he didn’t listen only to people in positions of power or behave in a hierarchical way, but also paid heed to civil society groups, activists, NGOs and patients groups. He recognised the importance of all voices in finding a solution, particularly for a disease like tuberculosis where social and behavioural issues are very important. His commitment to equity and social justice shone through. He took many initiatives when he was Union health secretary. One that stands out is the development of the national mental health policy. And again the way he did that was very different. He used people with hands-on experience and NGOs to develop that national mental health policy. So, it was not done top down but rather it was done bottom up. That will be a lasting contribution as mental health is still a neglected problem in India and globally. While the policy still needs full implementation, the development of such a detailed district-level plan was a major national and global landmark. Keshav was also instrumental in the creation of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI). This is the group that does policy making on immunisation, the national expert group that decides on which vaccines should go into the national programme. From being a rather ad hoc affair, the NTAGI was set up in a way that decisions would be transparent and based on data and evidence, with technical sub-committees, which would examine the problem. The committee was co-chaired by the health secretary, secretary, health research and secretary and department of biotechnology, and it had a number of different experts, including some of the critics of the national immunisation programme. This process gave all a chance to be part of the discussions and express their views, and then decisions would be based on consensus. That was a unique and innovative way of handling a sensitive topic where all voices were heard, but decisions were based on science. I believe that Keshav also strengthened the governance of the National Health Mission, which was still in its formative years. Keshav believed in listening to voices from the community and being responsive. I would say he was an ideal policy maker, who not only created visionary policies, but also saw that they were implemented. He was a man of impeccable integrity and took a tough stance on tobacco and other commercial determinants of health. He was also trying to streamline medical education at the time when he was secretary. After he retired, I had been in touch with him and worked closely with him on a number of different initiatives, where he was serving in an advisory role, several of them around mental health. Living in Tamil Nadu, which has several NGOs working on mental health, he was closely involved and helpful, as it was something he was very passionate about. He was also serving in advisory role to some WHO departments, including the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, where he brought a very unique perspective as somebody who had been a policy maker and a decision maker, and who understood the importance of health system research for a policy maker. He was due to finish his term on the board of the Alliance in December. So, that is another area where he is going to be very sorely missed. There is a flagship report called Learning Health Systems, which is going to be launched on Monday. And he had a major role to play in developing this report. He also had an important role to play in developing the next five years’ strategy of the Alliance and that strategy is also being finalised now.

---||India||Vaccine surplus: 500 million doses can be made available for poor countries by Sept end||An analysis of vaccine stock in the US, the UK, EU, Canada and Japan, has found there are 500 million vaccine doses available for redistribution by September-end, whereas 1.2 billion doses will be potentially available by this year-end. The analysis was done by UK-based science information and analytics company Airfinity and endorsed by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Of the 500 million doses available for redistribution as on date, about 360 million are earmarked for donation and around 1 billion of the 1.2 billion doses expected to be available by the end of this year is earmarked for donations. While a complete report on the same will be officially released on September 7 at a global media briefing with IFPMA, Airfinity shared an abridged version of the same with select journalists from across the world, including the TOI. The analysis predicts what these nations need going forward and what is available to be sent elsewhere. It assumes Western countries continue their vaccination programmes for everyone above 12 years old and also proceed with booster shots for everyone. Rasmus Bech Hansen, co-founder and CEO, Airfinity, said: “The world has reached a tipping point when it comes to vaccine availability and production. For large Western countries the challenge is no longer supply, but demand. The global supply chain is successfully increasing production and our detailed forecast shows that high income countries can have confidence that there is plenty of vaccine coming and this should reduce the need for stockpiling.” Explaining the method used for the analysis, the firm said: Available doses for redistribution analysis are calculated using supply forecasts to each country, which are based on production scale-up forecasts. Surplus doses scenarios firstly account for initial vaccination campaigns – sufficient doses to fully vaccinate all eligible people – before then accruing supply for boosters, with the remaining supply being counted as available for redistribution. “The scenarios shows the real-world uptake of vaccines and boosters for all (based on current data) and then compares this against an 80% uptake rate under different vaccination and booster scenarios, to show how many doses could be remaining from the agreed supply of approved vaccines,” it added. On top of vaccine doses which are currently available, there are plenty coming down the line, Airfinity said, adding that global vaccine production has scaled up fast with production hitting a total of 6-billion doses produced to date. As per the analysis, manufacturers are currently producing 1.5 billion doses per month and this is expected to continue growing. Around 11.3 billion doses are required to vaccinate the world’s population and Airfinity forecasts output to reach that by the end of 2021. While more than 1 billion doses have been pledged to be donated by the G7 and EU, less than 15% has been delivered. Analysis shows that more than 1.2 billion doses could be available for donation by the G7 in 2021 alone, while still maintaining domestic booster campaigns for all adults. “How these stocks are distributed, where they go and whether they are re-sold or donated is ultimately a political decision. With these numbers, I believe the world has a better basis for making these critical allocation decisions and avoiding wasted doses,” Hansen added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/500-million-vaccine-shots-surplus-poor-nations-likely-to-benefit/articleshow/85964780.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Chennai||Chennai corporation to reduce length of drain work, cut cost||CHENNAI: The city corporation will use a ‘simulation tool’ to ensure mistakes made in the estimates for the ₹2,470 crore Kosasthalaiyar basin integrated storm water drain network are corrected, reducing at least 100km of work and 10% of the total cost, after a review to be completed in a month. The consultant will study the topography and upload it onto the software to simulate the network and analyse where drains are required and where there are not. It will ensure every drop of water entering the network will drain into one of the 11 disposal points including the Korattur lake, Ambattur lake, Retteri Lake, Puzhal lake, Buckhingham canal and Otteri Nullah and the various surplus channels constructed by the public works department. Along the 784km network, existing brick and mortar drains will be replaced with concrete structures along 170km. Deputy commissioner (works) S Prasanth said the civic body had been studying the network using its engineers but had asked the consultant to study the hydrology and topography of the area. “Some basic concerns were that gradient and invert levels were not studied and slopes were not marked. Some drains were newly constructed recently and we wanted to either remove them or include them in the network, exclude drains in sandy regions where percolation happens naturally and also construct drains in newer locations where the water was in reverse flow. In another 30 days, we will finalise this,” he said. The project has eight major lakes and 75 minor tanks as disposal points and the task is to ensure the entire network will be connected such that there will be no water stagnation at any point and the water is drained into the nearest water body. Even in locations where drains are not required, gutters will be built on road sides. New drains will be included based on the requirement, said an official. The project had been criticized for several irregularities including using old designs, lack of gradient study and escalated costs in preparation of estimates. Contractors have cried foul. “We paid commissions to politicians and officials in 2020 and also to those now in charge, apart from the 1% earnest money deposit. They cannot just cancel or remove projects,” said a contractor who didn’t want to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-reduce-length-of-drain-work-cut-cost/articleshow/85964767.cms||Komal Gautham

Farmers had come from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra, he said. Women and youths too had come carrying national flag, apart from flags of their organisations, SKM said. The tone and tenor remained against BJP and its affiliates. “The farmers have made their presence felt. This mahapanchayat has clearly showcased that their enthusiasm and anger against BJP has not waned with the passage of time, but it has increased seeing the rigidity and egoistic approach of Narendra Modi-led central government,” alleged BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, while speaking on phone from Muzaffarnagar. “Hundreds of langars, medical camps and mobile clinics were enough to tell the commitment of locals. This has shown that this struggle is not of Punjab and Haryana only as BJP and its allies had been claiming from the beginning,” said BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) vicepresident Manjit Singh Dhaner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/uttar-pradesh-kisan-mahapanchayat-boosts-farmers-resolve/articleshow/85964876.cms||Neel Kamal

It was first caught on CCTV camera at the CISF office on Saturday. Its presence was confirmed by tiger researcher LAK Singh on Sunday after he examined the CCTV footage. Till the 1950s, the port town used to be a dense mangrove forest. The forest in Paradip and nearby Bhitarkanika National Park was home of many leopards. “In the 1960s the government denuded large tracts of mangrove forest in Paradip to build a port and as a result leopards vanished from the area. In the meantime, the population of leopards became extinct from Bhitarkanika due to poaching.We are delighted that after more than five decades a leopard was sighted in Paradip,” said Singh. “Earlier, we thought it was a fishing cat. Forest officials have been patrolling the area, but the animal has not been traced yet. It is a shy animal. Maybe it is hiding somewhere in the area,” said Ranjan Mishra, the forest range officer of Kujang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/leopard-sighted-in-paradip-after-more-than-5-decades/articleshow/85952908.cms||Ashis Senapati

Nilakhi’s parents, Pritam and Rani, had joined a jatha along with their three children in January 2020 to visit various temples in India. However, they could not return to Pakistan as soon after the coronavirus lockdown was imposed and the borders sealed. Confined in a foreign land, without any means of livelihood, most of the jatha members moved to Jodhpur to work as daily wage workers. On August 29, the couple, with their children Sagar, Hemraj, Deepa, and three-day-old Nilakhi, had arrived at the Attari land border along with some 84 members of the Pakistani Hindu jatha to return to their homes in Pakistan’s Sindh province. 190-member Pak Hindu jatha returns via AttariThe jatha was allowed to proceed, but the family was denied permission as they failed to produce the newborn’s birth certificate. “We were not sure of our fate since we did not have any documents, like a birth certificate, of Nilakhi. We did not know whether we would be able to go back to our country along with the rest of the jatha members. But it has happened. We arrived as a five-member family in India but are returning home as six members,” said Pritam with folded hands, only too relieved to have finally got the permission to go home. A 190-member jatha of Pakistani Hindus left for Pakistan via Attari on Sunday. Protocol officer at the Attari Integrated Check Post, Arun Pal said the family had gone back to Jodhpur, where Nilakhi was born, to get her necessary documentation. They got her registered on her mother’s passport from Delhi, following which they were allowed to cross the border. The officer said that another Pakistani Hindu couple was denied permission to cross the border as they did not have any documentation of their newborn girl child Bharti. “They will have to go through the same procedure as that of Nilakhi’s to be able to go back to their country,” he said. Recently, a group of around 80 Pakistani Hindus was not allowed to cross the border as they did not have RT-PCR test reports. They got the green signal only after the local administration got their tests done and received negative reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/paper-work-done-10-day-old-leaves-for-home-in-pakistan-with-jatha/articleshow/85964901.cms||Yudhvir Rana

With the state reporting nearly 30,000 Covid-19 cases daily, the state health department has heightened its vigil against any other outbreak. Authorities have identified 188 of the boy's close contacts, of whom 20 have been categorised as high risk. Health minister Veena George said two health workers, from among these contacts, have developed symptoms.One of them is from a private hospital while the other is from Kozhikode medical college hospital. Later in the day, the boy's mother was also isolated after she developed symptoms. A central team -- led by Dr P Raveendran, advisor to the national disaster management authority, and K Reghu, additional director, National Centre for Disease Control --on Sunday visited the house and premises of the child as well as hospitals and clinics he was taken to. It also checked for possible sources of infection and examined a Rambutan tree near the child’s house. The boy breathed his last at a private hospital in the city around 5am. The minister confirmed the death on Sunday morning and said all three samples collected from him -- plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and serum -- were found positive in tests done at National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. 188 contacts traced, next one week crucial: Health ministerThe child was first taken to a private clinic at Eranhimavu with fever on August 29 and subsequently to four other hospitals. As per a route map released by the Kozhikode district administration, he was taken to two private hospitals and Kozhikode medical college hospital two days later. On Wednesday, he was taken to another private hospital in Kozhikode city, where he died. A majority of contact persons identified are health workers while sources said around 100 of them are from the medical college hospital. “We have traced 188 contacts so far. A wider contract tracing will be done soon. The child started showing symptoms on August 27 and considering the incubation period of the virus, the next one week is crucial,” Veena said. The minister said the government had sought a testing mechanism at Kozhikode medical college hospital itself. “The testing is conducted directly by NIV. They have informed us that by Monday evening, a point of care testing, that is TrueNat testing, will be arranged at Kozhikode medical college,” she said, adding that a team from NIV Pune would run this facility. She said a confirmatory test would be done at Pune NIV if any sample is found positive in the point of care testing. “Time is of critical nature and they have informed us that the result of the sample sent would be made available within 12 hours,” she said. Veena said the availability of medicines was also being monitored. “There won’t be any shortage. New monoclonal antibodies have been sought and ICMR has contacted Australia. The antibodies will be made available within seven days,” she said. The body was buried at Kannamparambu Khabaristan in the evening, where health workers clad in PPE kits conducted the burial. A dedicated call centre for Nipah has also been set up and it can be contacted at 0495-2382500 and 0495-2382800. The negative pressure ICU at the medical college hospital will be used to treat Nipah patients. The health department is probing if there was any lapse on the part of the medical college hospital authorities in not sending the boy’s samples for Nipah tests earlier. Hospital authorities maintained that the child’s condition had worsened suddenly and there was a shortage of ventilators at the hospital. The family had also insisted on moving him to a private hospital, they said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, said in Thiruvananthapuram that efforts were on to trace the source of the virus. All hospitals have been directed to report unusual fever and deaths and steps have been taken for quick handover of data, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-govt-gears-up-to-fight-nipah-scare-after-12-year-old-succumbs/articleshow/85964946.cms||---

Satheesan visited the two leaders at their homes and later said that the talks have turned effective and the state leadership will continue to have constant dialogues with the senior leaders to avoid any communication gaps in the future. “Congress first, group second,” was what Chandy told reporters about the outcome of the meeting with Satheesan. Chennithala too welcomed the move by Satheesan to hold talks with him. The issues within the Congress party propped up following the appointment of the DCC presidents. Both Chandy and Chennithala were not happy with the new state leadership for not consulting them before handing over the final list of the DCC presidents to the high command. Following this, there was move from both the leaders who were heading the two groups in the party to turn against the state leadership. Satheesan swiftly made the move to meet the leaders and settle the issues at the earliest. He visited Chandy at his Puthuppally residence in the morning and later Chennithala at his residence in Haripad. In between he visited Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, who has now distanced himself from the group politics and is more close to the state leadership. Speaking to reporters after talks with Satheesan, Chandy said that there were some issues within the Congress party. “I was hurt by some recent situations. However, I agree to the view of the opposition leader that such issues should be solved through dialogues. Congress is a democratic party and the issues within the party have to be solved through talks. The absence of dialogues will only worsen the situation,” Chandy said. He also said that he will cooperate if the KPCC president and opposition leader take initiative for talks. He also said that Chennithala and he had raised some issues and he hopes that those will be solved through talks. Satheesan said that the state leadership of the party had announced a few days ago that they would intervene to settle the issues of the senior leaders of the party by visiting them at their houses and clearing all their misunderstandings and communication gaps. After visiting Chennithala, Satheesan said that if any of the senior leaders have a complaint that they were sidelined or insulted, it will also be solved. “I have the confidence that I can settle the issues within the party. That confidence has increased after my talks with Chandy and Chennithala,” he said. He also said that talks will continue with these senior leaders. “Congress is undergoing the process of reorganization. First phase is over now and second and third phase are left,” he said. He also said that the new state leadership of the party was trying to solve all the weakness of the party and strengthen it and bring back the party and UDF. For that the support of all the senior leaders is required, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-v-d-satheesan-begins-reconciliation-talks/articleshow/85965025.cms||---

The owners of these buildings, which have been constructed on plots meant for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), have been found to have raised extra floors and carried out unauthorised constructions even after procuring occupation certificates (OCs). The enforcement wing of DTCP carried out a survey of the buildings in S, U and V blocks of DLF phase 3 after receiving complaints from residents. District town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said the department was checking the status of buildings on three counts — whether the developers have taken OCs or not, if they have made illegal constructions after getting the certificates and whether the structures are under construction. “We have got details of around 1,000 buildings in the area. After tallying their details with departmental data, we will soon be initiating action against the offenders,” he added. The move followed complaints by residents about the quality of construction and the overall safety of the buildings. During the survey, it was found that the plot owners had used up 100% of their area, constructed 6-7 storeys in violation of the plan and combined two or more plots to build commercial structures like offices, shops and eateries. According to Batth, these buildings have come up over the past 10 to 12 years. The department, he said, is studying the OCs issued to buildings in DLF 3 during this period. “We have written to the developer to share a plot-wise list of the area, details of ownership transfers and the action plan for the suspension of services provided to the property owners who have constructed additional floors,” he added. The licences for residential colonies are granted under the provisions of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975, and Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Rules, 1976.  Under them, around 15% of plots in licenced colonies are reserved for the EWS category. “While approving the zoning plan, it had been categorically mentioned that only one dwelling unit is allowed in this category of plots (EWS). Further, 66% of ground coverage and 2.64 floor-area ratio (FAR) is allowed in keeping with the prevailing policy,” Batth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/1000-buildings-in-dlf-3-blocks-under-dtcp-scanner-for-violating-plans/articleshow/85959193.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

---||Gurgaon||Nurseries, shops, markets and waste: Squatters choke Gurugram’s green belts||GURUGRAM: Plant nurseries, eateries and shops have encroached upon several green belts across the city, including those along Golf Course Road (Extension), Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), the road dividing sectors 9 and 9A, Ardee City and sectors 82, 84 and 92, among others. According to locals, street vendors organise vegetable markets in some green belts on Wednesdays and Sundays. Ardee CityA visit to Golf Course Road (Extension) on Saturday by TOI also revealed that construction and demolition (C&D) waste is being dumped at a green belt near a construction site along the road, while some green belts have been fenced for protection. “Over the years, I have been noticing that green belts along Golf Course Road (Extension) have been encroached upon and are frequently used for dumping C&D waste and other mixed waste. We have brought it to the notice of authorities several times and given photographic evidence as well,” said Ruchika Sethi, a resident. Squatters have also taken over green belts in several new sectors. “In sectors 84 and 92, vendors set up vegetable markets every Wednesday and Sunday in green belts. The Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) should focus on the redevelopment of such areas and the department of town and country planning (DTCP) should also remove hawkers from green belts,” said Praveen Malik, vice-president and spokesperson of United Association of New Gurgaon, a residents’ group. Another new sector resident, Dharamveer Singh, who is also the RWA president of Mapsko Casa Bella in Sector 82, said: “The green belt extending from Ansal Hub in Sector 83 to Mapsko Paradise has been fully encroached. Illegal workshops, tea stalls and small eateries are operating there.” When asked, Subhash Yadav, head of GMDA’s urban environment division, GMDA, said they have removed nurseries, food stalls and other squatters from green belts several times.  “The squatters won’t encroach once the fencing of the green belts is done. We have already started fencing green belts. Our focus in the first phase will be the central verge and then the roadsides,” he said. Yadav also said SPR will be revamped and the redevelopment of green belts will be a part of the project.  “The problem that we are facing with the green belts in new sectors is that the other agencies are still laying pipelines for water, sewerage and other connections. In Sector 67, someone dug up the entire plantation for a power connection,” he added. Some residents said green belts are also being used to dump C&D waste. “Construction waste has been dumped at the green belt near gate number 1 of Ardee City for around a year now. I have seen trucks from the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) dumping the waste and we also filed complaints in February, but the authorities have failed to check it,” claimed Chaitali Mandhotra, a resident of Ardee City. Meanwhile, MCG joint commissioner (headquarters) Hariom Attri said it is quite likely that someone is using MCG’s name on its trucks and dumping waste illegally. “We will get this checked and an action will be taken against those dumping C&D waste illegally. We started an enforcement drive on Saturday and seized 12 trucks that were illegally dumping C&D waste across the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/nurseries-shops-markets-and-waste-squatters-choke-gurgaons-green-belts/articleshow/85959248.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Second dose gap widens, Covid numbers rise||BHOPAL: There is a slow but alarming rise in Covid cases in Madhya Pradesh after a two-month lull when daily counts had dropped to single digits. Active cases have again crossed the 100 mark, and the big concern is that the state is way behind its second-dose vaccine targets. Around 42 lakh people are overdue for their second shot despite the two-day campaign last month in which over 42 lakh people were vaccinated. Only 88 lakh of the target population of 5.5 crore has been fully vaccinated — around 16%. While the administration struggles to get people to take their second doses, Covid numbers are inching upwards. Active cases touched 101 on September 3, crossing 100 for the first time since August 15 when there were 104 cases. In the past 15 days there has been hardly a day when less than 10 new Covid-19 cases were detected. Twice in a fortnight — on August 19 and September 3 — 18 cases each were reported, and there were 22 each on September 4 and 5. Active cases stood at 122 on Sunday, a 20% jump in 48 hours. Race against time to ensure first shot to all by Sept endThe only thing that can stop the third wave – considering how most people have dumped face masks in the bin along with Covid precautions -- is vaccination. The government aims to give the first dose to everyone by September-end, but also emphasizes the importance of getting people fully vaccinated. On August 25, the first day of the two-day mega vax campaign, there were 48 lakh second doses overdue. Between then and September 4, at least 36 lakh second doses have been administered, showing the urgency. Still, that leaves 12 lakh from that lot to be fully vaccinated. Moreover, between June 1 and June 10, more than 30 lakh first doses were administered in the state, and they were all due for their second doses by September 4 (84-day gap). This means, over 42 lakh were due for their second dose as of Sunday. This is an area of concern. According to officials, the government is mulling a special drive to plug the second-dose gap. It will be a tough task since the priority right now seems to be to cover 100% of the eligible population with the first dose. The administration is trying to find out why these many people have skipped their second dose but it’s not the government’s responsibility alone to ensure full vaccination. The widening gap points at laxity among a section of the population -- the second dose should be the priority of the individual too. As on September 4, around 4.84 vaccine doses had been administered in the state, 3.95 crore of them being first doses. Second doses number only 88 lakh – an indication of the uphill battle ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-second-dose-gap-widens-covid-numbers-rise/articleshow/85965100.cms||---

Two review meetings will be held in Gurgaon and Faridabad, in which ACS (health) Rajeev Arora will review the preparedness for a possible third wave of Covid-19. The divisional commissioners and civil surgeons of the respective districts will be present at the meeting. The districts have been asked for status on oxygen plans, availability of NICU and PICU beds, vaccination and supply of essential medicines, drugs and equipment. They will also provide details of status of oxygen demand, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants and liquid oxygen plants in government and private set-ups. Arora had earlier directed all districts to increase their oxygen beds at the earliest and carry out proper assessment and inspection of Covid care centres and dedicated Covid hospitals. He had asked district oxygen audit committees to curb stocking or black-marketing of essential Covid drugs and items. Further, all districts were told to increase sample collection and a combined daily target of 35,000 tests was set. According to health department data, Haryana currently has 170 ventilators, 482 BiPAP machines and 103 HFNCs available for paediatric use. As many as 82 ventilators are available in warehouses for distribution. Arora had laid stress on vaccinations, saying they should be expedited and 50% sessions should be exclusively for second doses. Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav said more second-dose sessions will be planned in the coming week. “Our focus was always second-dose recipients. Now, we will hold at least 60% sessions for them,” he added. He also said that there are 11 PSA plants in government hospitals and 10 PSA plants in private hospitals while another 20 PSA plants are being set up by private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/meeting-on-five-districts-covid-preparations-to-be-held-today/articleshow/85959272.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: 250 acres of Aravali land encroached, finds drone survey||GURUGRAM: A drone survey conducted by the forest department has revealed that violators have encroached on around 250 acres of forest area in the city. Of this, nearly 225 acres fall under the Punjab Land Conservation Act (PLPA), while 25 acres are in the Aravali plantation area. This comes after the department analysed the first draft of the drone survey of the Aravali areas in the city. The survey of 7,019 hectares of forest areas in the city was completed on August 27. The department said the final analysis of the survey will take a few more days. This drone survey began on August 7 in Gurgaon and four teams were deployed with one drone each to carry out the survey. Till now, around 580 show-cause notices have been sent to owners of the illegal structures in the eco-sensitive Aravalis area. The Supreme Court on July 23 ordered the Haryana government not to spare any illegal structures in the Aravalis, including farmhouses, commercial establishments, and religious structures, during the ongoing demolition drive in Khori village. “We are already carrying out demolition in forest areas to free them from encroachment. More notices will be sent after getting a final analysis of the report,” said Rajeev Tajyan, divisional forest officer, Gurgaon. It is estimated that more than 1,000 illegal structures are in Gurgaon’s Aravali areas. These include farmhouses, nurseries, slums and clusters. According to a forest department survey, the illegal structures are concentrated in areas like Gwalpahari, Gairatpur Bas, Sohna, Raisina and Manesar. As many as 38 villages in Gurgaon and 17 villages in Faridabad have specified lands notified under sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA, primarily in the Aravali common lands. More than half of the Aravalis of these two districts are notified under sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA. It is important to note that these are the only Aravali areas with a ‘forest’ tag. The rest of the Aravalis are not recognised as 'forest' by the state government. Meanwhile, the officials of the forest department had carried out a demolition drive in Ghata. Around 10 acres of forest land had been encroached upon by the structures in the area, which falls under sections 4 and 5 of the PLPA, 1900. No non-forest activity is permitted in the area. Last year, a survey was carried out by the forest department to evaluate encroachment in the city’s forest areas. According to the report, there were at least 500 farmhouses built illegally on Aravali land. A detailed list of these structures was submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the Sonya Ghosh vs state of Haryana case last year. The report also had details of the total area occupied by them and their locations. Forest minister Kanwal Pal Gujjar had last year said a total of 60 illegal farmhouses were constructed in the Aravalis — 50 in Faridabad and 10 in Gurgaon — between 2000 and 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/250-acres-of-aravali-land-encroached-finds-drone-survey/articleshow/85959302.cms||Ipsita Pati

Around 44 farmers and casual labourers, united under the banner of Jai Kisan Andolan, had set out to obstruct the cavalcade of the chief minister and show him black flags to register their protest against the three contentious farm laws. As per the plan, protesters had gathered around Nehru Park early in the morning and set out on foot to carry out a 10km march till Mirpur, where Khattar was scheduled to visit. The march, however, was stopped midway and the protesters were taken to the Model Town police station where they were detained until the Khattar’s event at the IGU concluded. “We had planned a 10km march and had decided to wave black flags to register our protest against the three farm laws. We had decided that if we are stopped by police we will court our arrest without any resistance. We were taken into a bus and detained at the police station till 3:30pm,” said Sandeep Yadav, state spokesperson of Jai Kisan Andolan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/44-protesting-against-farm-laws-arrested/articleshow/85961556.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Gurgaon||3 cheat cricketers with promise of team berths, held||GURUGRAM: A brother-sister duo was among three persons arrested for allegedly cheating an aspiring cricketer of Rs 10 lakh by promising him a berth in a state team. The alleged fraud came to light after Anshul Raj, a 21-year-old budding cricketer, lodged a police complaint alleging that he had been cheated by a sports management company in Najafgarh. The accused, police said, had floated a sham company — SDMC Cricket Academy — and promised to place cricketers in state teams against money. The three arrested persons have been identified as Ashutosh Bora and his sister Chitra, who called themselves directors of the company they had floated, and Nitin Kumar. Anshul has told the police that after he got himself enrolled in the academy, he was asked to pay Rs 1 lakh for a berth in the North East team. He made the payment, but nothing came by for months. The directors then allegedly asked Anshul to pay Rs 9 lakh if he wanted to play for the Himachal team. Anshul paid the money in instalments, but the accused made one reason or the other for delaying the contract. After several weeks, Anshul was allegedly handed fake documents of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) and made to believe he had been chosen for Naidu Trophy matches. As he kept waiting for a call from HPCA, Anshul grew suspicious of the academy’s motives. He then approached the Sector 50 police station and lodged a complaint against the trio. While Ashutosh was arrested from Le Meridien hotel in the city, the other two were picked up from their houses. A police team that searched the academy’s office found forged documents and details of 20 more aspiring cricketers from whom the accused are believed to have taken money. The brother-sister duo had been running the academy for several years, the police said. “Ashutosh and Nitin are on police remand while the woman is in judicial custody,” said Rahul Dev, the SHO of Sector 50 police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-cheat-cricketers-with-promise-of-team-berths-held/articleshow/85959329.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: To build confidence, Teachers' Day goes hybrid||GURUGRAM: Private schools in the city decided this year to celebrate Teachers’ Day in hybrid mode — both online and offline — to quell hesitancy among students and parents over reopening of campuses. Offline lessons for students of classes 4 to 12 have resumed in any leading private schools in the city. Over the weekend, a few leading schools honoured the hard work of teachers, especially during the pandemic, by conducting elaborate celebrations both in offline and online mode. While a few institutions like Salwan Public School called students of classes 6 to 12 for the celebrations on Saturday and Sunday, other schools will celebrate on Monday. “Our teachers have been working hard and we didn’t want them to come to school on a Sunday. We called all the students of classes 6 to 12 and there was a decent turnout. Seeing the students and the teachers inside the campus with full enthusiasm was delightful. It induced a sense of hope that we are inching towards normalcy in school life,” said school principal Rashmi Malik. At Amity International School in Sector 46, a weeklong celebration culminated on Sunday. The school had decided to celebrate in online and offline modes to ensure that all the students can participate and the guidelines of the government regarding calling students to the schools can be strictly adhered to. “Students of classes 6 to 12 came to school, while those in primary classes attended virtual celebrations. We strictly followed the protocols and had multiple assembly sessions to spread out the students and ensure physical distancing. The school came alive and it appeared that the apprehensions and anxieties about kids going back to the school are gradually waning,” said the school principal Arti Chopra. Schools said the key reason behind holding the celebrations on campuses was to build confidence among students and parents over visiting schools. Meanwhile, many parents welcomed the move and said it was heartening to see their kids happy attending offline celebrations after over one-and-a-half years. “My son attended the offline celebrations. He was ecstatic. He had so many stories to tell about meeting his friends and doing things for their teachers. As a parent, I’m happy that the schools are taking small steps towards normalcy with due consideration to the Covid situation. As long as our kids are safe and happy, we are pleased,” said Tripti Singh, an administrator of a Facebook forum called Gurgaon Parents for Better Education. Her son studies in Class 6 at Heritage Xperiential Learning School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/to-build-confidence-teachers-day-goes-hybrid/articleshow/85959375.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Chandigarh||Hry ADGP posted to transport dept against Vij advice, DoPT’s caution||Chandigarh: Disregarding the opposition from both bureaucrats as well as state home minister Anil Vij to inter-cadre transfers, the Haryana government on Sunday posted additional director general of police (ADGP) Kala Rama Chandran, a 1994 batch IPS officer, to the transport department as principal secretary and financial commissioner. Oft-shifted IAS officer Ashok Khemka was first to oppose the inter-cadre transfers when he approached the Centre in December last year, after which the department of personnel and training (DoPT) had cautioned Haryana in March this year. Strange as it is to have the IPS and HPS officers sent to non-police departments, Chandran will replace Shatrujit Singh Kapoor, who has been appointed director general of the state vigilance bureau. The chief secretary released her posting orders. Yet again, the government has superseded the comments of chief secretary and the home minister. Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan had asked the government to get clarification from the DoPT, while Vij had made a file noting against moving Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to civic duties. The government argues that inter-cadre postings were a must to lighten the burden of IAS officers of the rank of principal secretary. The matter was pending for more than a week when the government issued the transfer and posting orders for the IAS and IPS officers. To justify the move, a senior functionary in the chief minister’s office (CMO) referred to the 2019 gazetteer notification on this account and the communication made to the Indian government. The officer said: “As on now, we have just 16 principal secretaries, including four chief secretaries and officers attached with the CM, so we are left with just 12, who have to look after four departments each. Work suffers. Besides, the government had okayed inter-cadre transfers long ago and the system is doing well.” This is not the CMO’s first instance of going against advisories from the home minister and the secretariat. It happened with Vij over giving extension to director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava. The issue was about powers related to control of the CID, home, and health departments. It wasn’t Vij alone who opposed the inter-cadre transfers beyond a period without clearance from the DoPT. Chief secretary Vardhan also had advised the same, while a group of IAS officers had even asked their association president, Apoorva Kumar Singh, to reason with the government. Kala Ramachandran was to be among 10 IPS officer ready for transfer and posting when the home department reduced the list to nine last week. Now eight officers, including five IPS, will be shifted inter-cadre in Haryana. Vigilance chief Shatrujeet Singh Kapoor gets replaced by Kala Ramachandran, while the others are Hanif Kureshi, Amitabh Singh Dhillon, Shashank Anand, and Pankaj Nain. The other three are M D Sinha, Neeraj Kumar, and Anant Parkash Pandey of the IFS and Yogender Chaudhary of the IRS. All four are on inter-cadre transfer posts which the IAS officers are supposed to hold. A series of messages passed between the chief secretary’s office and the DOPT on Khemka’s first representation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-adgp-posted-to-transport-dept-against-vij-advice-dopts-caution/articleshow/85961645.cms||Manvir Saini

The 23-year-old Shubham, who suffered severe burns in the incident, alleged that Manisha, a resident of Surya Nagar in Hisar, threw acid on him as he refused to marry her, but the girl’s brother claimed that he had some objectionable photos of his sister in his mobile phone, which she wanted him to delete. Urban Estate police registered a case against Manisha under Section 326-A (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc.) of the IPC. In the complaint to the police, Shubham said he became friends with Manisha, the daughter of his relative and then also met once or twice. After this, Manisha asked him to marry her, but he told her that he cannot get married without the consent of his family. The investigation has been handed over to sub-inspector Sahib Ram.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Advocates cheer as physical hearing resumes||BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Lawyers have generally welcomed the commencement of physical hearing along with virtual hearing in the MP high court. Overwhelming majority among them feel that physical hearing allows them to present the side of their client in a proper manner and the glitches encountered during the virtual hearing of cases are largely taken care of. Senior counsel Naman Nagrath said that virtual hearing of cases had begun due to Covid-19 pandemic and now that the situation is under control, physical hearing has also begun. With both virtual and physical hearings possible, lawyers are feeling relieved. In cases where elaborate arguments are required or there are a lot of documents involved, physical hearing becomes desirable. Presenting facts before the court is not easy in virtual hearing. The Corona situation over the next one month would decide whether full-fledged physical hearing of cases would begin. Advocate Rajesh Chandra said after the physical hearing has begun, cases are coming up for hearing early. During virtual hearing, if you fail to appear for some reason during hearing, the case would be deferred for four weeks. With physical hearing back, you can apprise the court of the situation why you had to skip the hearing and urgency of hearing in case and if the court is convinced, they can take up the case for hearing early. Advocate Sanjay Verma said that physical hearing is the way cases are heard by the courts, it was in an extraordinary situation that virtual hearing was resorted to.But, there were quite a few technical issues like dysfunctional server or internet connectivity not being available which the courts and advocates were facing. After the physical hearing began, the courts have also started hearing old pending cases. Advocate Aditya Sanghi, however, had a different view. He said virtual hearing is one way to ensure cheaper justice to people. An advocate through virtual mode may appear before any high court or the supreme court. The litigants, too, have to spend less. Their expenditure on travel, boarding, and food is saved. Virtual mode of hearing should continue in the future as well. Every new system will have initial glitches, we must learn from them to strengthen the system rather than quitting it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-advocates-cheer-as-physical-hearing-resumes/articleshow/85965202.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||1971 war: Subedar Sewa Singh who defused Pakistan bombs with bare hands||AMBALA: Defusing unfamiliar airdropped Pakistani bombs with bare hands is retired Subedar Sewa Singh’s long-lasting memory at 92 of how he won the ‘Shaurya Chakra’ for bravery as part of the bomb disposal platoon of the Army’s Bombay Engineer Group at Kirkee, Pune. During the 14-day war of December 1971, Pakistan airdropped many bombs at Zira village (now in Ferozepur district) of Punjab, six of which didn’t explode and one of those landed on a pile of grain sacks in a Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouse. These bombs threatened human lives, civilian property, and military installations. Even with a hearing problem, unclear speech, and walking difficulty, Subedar Sewa Singh is energetic enough to recount the anecdotes of war like it happened yesterday. The former bomb squad man said: “The task of our unit was made difficult by those Pakistani bombs, which were either defective or had attached timer to which we were unfamiliar. Between December 3 and 17, the Pakistanis must have dropped almost 1,000 pounds of those over civilian and military targets in border areas of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Many of these British or US-made bombs, a few even carrying the mark of Pakistan's ordnance factory, did not explode.” Sewa Singh’s platoon was called to defuse those. Asked about the risk, the subedar said: “I was assigned to defuse the Zira bombs and save the FCI godown near Ferozepur. By the grace of God, I could do my task without fear. I thought nothing of my life against the lives of many. We had a blessed, skilful, and successful team, and I alone defused five of those Ferozepur bombs barehanded and without any protective suit.” Asked why so many Pakistani bombs had failed, the subedar said: “Maybe the Pakistanis resorted to panic bombing, and used ornance that wasn’t primed. Often it had wrong fusing and they ignored the time factor while dropping those. Besides, many of those bombs were of World War II vintage with worn-out fuses and detonation devices.” On December 24, 1971, the then Indian president, Varahagiri Venkata (VV) Giri, honoured Sewa Singh with'Shaurya Chakra” for gallantry and the soldier also got a chance to stay with his family at the President’s hosue. Seeing those photographs that with the-then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, and the-then defence minister, Jagjivan Ram, activates his memory. The citation dated August 7, 1974, and written by Govind Narain, the-then secretary in the Ministry of Defence, reads: “Subedar Sewa Singh was given the task of disposing of five unexploded enemy bombs on the premises of the FCI at Zeera village near Ferozepur. The fuse and the bomb mechanism were of a new type, and they had no training in neutralising it or special body armour, equipment, and stores to do the job. Undeterred, subedar Sewa Singh, at grave risk to personal safety, decided to extract the fuses manually, with his own hands. His courage, determination, and professional skill are commendable.” About the power of the dropped bombs, Sewa Singh said: “Those could pierce a tank’s armour plate.” On December 24, 1971, the-then chief of Army staff and later field marshal, General SHFJ Manekshaw, had also congratulated subedar Sewa Singh in written on the receipt of “well-merited award of Shaurya Chakra”. The subedar had also seen the 1962 Burma aggression and the 1965 war with Pakistan. Medal motivates recruitsSubedar Sewa Singh deposited his Shaurya Chakra at his Bombay Engineer Group unit at Kirkee, Pune, for its better preservation and serving as motivation to young recruits of the Army. Forward line even in hockeySewa Singh was a skilful forward-line hockey player for the Services. Born in April 1929 at Shahzadpur village of Ambala district, he took his primary education there, and at 18 years, joined the Army in 1947, where he completed the education of “Army Special” with first division. Kirkee was his first posting and Siliguri in West Bengal last in 1975. The medal brings him a yearly benefit and a monthly pension. 4 generations in the ArmySewa Singh's grandfather, Gopal Singh, also retired as subedar, and his father, Piara Singh, as Sepoy, both from the British Indian Army. Sewa Singh had three sons. Two served in the Navy, Dilbagh Singh retired as petty officer, while diver Bhupinder Singh died at sea, while on duty. Sewa Singh lives in Ambala Cantonment with his son, Balwinder Singh, who runs a small business of cleaning material. He has a graduate unemployed son, Deepak Singh, who assists him in the business. Family seeks landSewa Singh’s son, Balwinder Singh, requested the government to allot some agricultural or commercial land to the family so that it’s able to till or run a shop for steady income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/subedar-who-defused-pak-bombs-with-bare-hands/articleshow/85961993.cms||JK Singh

An HSPCB official said the board recently issued final notices to 50 healthcare facilities in the city and told them to comply with the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016, within a week, else strict action would be initiated against them. “We have sent show-cause notices to the healthcare units which are yet to get no objection certificate (NOC ) for handling biomedical waste management rules. We have asked them to reply within seven days failing which we will take necessary action against them,” an official said. According to the HSPCB data, the city has 583 health units. Biomedical waste is the waste generated in the diagnosis, treatment or immunisation of human beings or animals, in research or in the production or testing of biological products, including all categories of infected and toxic waste that is a potential threat to human beings and the environment. Human and animal anatomical waste, solid waste, expired medicines, mercury thermometers, chemical waste, body fluid, blades, contaminated wast like plastic bags, bottle, pipe and used needles and syringes all come under bio-medical waste. According to Biotic, the MCG’s concessioner for biomedical waste management in the city, Gurgaon generates around 7 tonnes of hazardous biomedical waste daily, including 1.5 tonnes of Covid-19 waste, said Vishesh Gaur, director, Biotic. As per rules, all healthcare facilities, irrespective of the method of treatment and the quantity of biomedical waste, have to seek authorisation from HSPCB. “Yes, there are many healthcare facilities which do not have authorisation to handle biomedical waste in the city yet, '' he added. As per the biomedical waste management rules, all healthcare units are to establish a bar-code system for bags or containers containing biomedical waste for disposal. In fact, all units are also supposed to maintain four colour-coded dustbins (green, red, blue and black) for scientific disposal of such biomedical waste through segregation, collection and treatment to minimise the adverse impact on health workers and environment. The ‘yellow’ bin collects anatomical waste, the ‘blue’ bin collects surgical tools and needles, while the ‘red’ bin is for plastics, such as syringes and IVpacks and ‘black’ bin for chemical waste. “If health facilities are found to be violating the norms, action will be taken. Improper disposal of waste increases the risk of infection to the garbage collector,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/biomedical-waste-notices-sent-to-50-labs-private-clinics/articleshow/85961391.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Shortage of specialist doctors hits services at 3 government hospitals||GHAZIABAD: Shortage of specialist doctors at MMG District Hospital, District Combined Hospital and District Women’s Hospital, the three major government hospitals in Ghaziabad district, has forced patients to seek costly treatment at private hospitals or travel to neighbouring districts. Over 20% posts in each of these hospitals, officials said, were lying vacant as specialist doctors have either retired or have been transferred. After the lone cardiologist at MMG District Hospital retired last week, the facility had stopped providing treatment to such patients, officials said. The hospital also does not have a chest specialist. When approached, chief medical superintendent (CMS) Anurag Bhargav told TOI that the hospital periodically informs the state government about the vacant posts. At present, physician is attending to cardiac patients, while serious cases are being referred to higher centres. At District Combined Hospital (DCH) and District Women’s Hospital, too, the authorities are grappling with a shortage of surgeons and other specialists. Three years after the cardiologist at DCH retired, no fresh appointment has been made yet. The hospital, officials said, also running without a general surgeon. CMS Dr Sanjay Teotia said he had raised the issue with the chief medical officer and had received assurance that a surgeon from MMG Hospital would visit the facility thrice a week. “The hospital also does not have a physician and currently a doctor, who holds a degree in community medicine, is attending to general patients,” Dr Teotia added. Similarly, following the transfer of the former chief medical superintendent Dr Deepa Tyagi to Lucknow about a year back, the post of a surgeon at District Women’s Hospital has been lying vacant. Most of the surgery cases coming to the hospital are now being referred to Delhi or Meerut, officials said. CMS Dr Sangeeta Goyal said the hospital administration has written to senior officials to provide a surgeon. The hospital also does not have a radiologist and has roped in a specialist from MMG hospital under a temporary arrangement. With its gynaecologist set to retire within a month and the contract of another set to end at the same, the department is also anticipating a crisis in the coming days, officials said. The three hospitals mostly have one specialist doctor in each department. About a fortnight ago, when the ENT specialist at DCH went on about a month’s leave, officials said, his patients had to be referred to MMG hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/shortage-of-specialist-doctors-hits-services-at-3-government-hospitals/articleshow/85960025.cms||Aditya Dev

The health department also confirmed two malaria cases in the same period. Till Friday, there were five cases of dengue and six malaria patients were confirmed by the health department. While an 11-month-old child was admitted with malaria to District Women Hospital, the case is yet to be added to the district’s tally. Of the 23 dengue cases, one patient is from Shikohabad (Firozabad), which is the worst infected in Western UP. Over 70 deaths due to viral fever have been reported from Firozbabad so far. The Shikohabad patient is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Ghaziabad. A similar situation is being witnessed in other districts of Western UP. In Meerut, about 10 cases of dengue have been confirmed while hundreds of cases of fever are being reported in district hospitals daily since the last week of August. In Mathura, about 25 dengue cases have been confirmed, while five cases have been reported in Agra. While Noida has not confirmed any dengue case yet, it has reported 23 malaria cases this year. Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said, “To deal with the rising cases, Dengue and malaria wards have been created at the MMG District Hospital and the District Combined Hospital. The state-appointed nodal officer for Ghaziabad, Senthil Pandian C, on Sunday took stock of the situation.” As many as 30 beds have been reserved at District Combined Hospital for dengue, malaria and viral fever. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of the hospital said mosquito nets have been arranged for the dengue ward. At MMG District Hospital, CMS Dr Anurag Bhargav said a 10-bed dengue ward has been set up and a fever clinic is being run. Nodal officer Pandian directed the CMS to be vigilant in the treatment of other serious patients including dengue, malaria and typhoid. District officials said that since Covid began, malaria cases have seen a considerable drop in Gautam Budh Nagar. Testing for malaria also reduced after local teams were diverted to Covid duties. However, the cases were still lower disproportionately compared to the tests done. In 2019, there were 424 malaria cases from the 73,568 samples tested. In 2020, it was reduced to 27 cases from 51,350 samples tested. “We are continuing with fogging and awareness drives. Fever screening is also being carried out. We are asking people to not let water accumulate in their homes,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. Officials say that while most vector-borne diseases are reported from July to November, there also seems to be fewer breeding places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/in-48-hours-ghaziabad-adds-18-dengue-2-malaria-cases/articleshow/85960064.cms||Aditya Dev

The nonagenarian, Dr Mishra, was referred to as the ‘Bhishma Pitamah’ among medical fraternity across India owing to his brilliant diagnosis and treatment. He was often the last word for most doctors here. Besides being an outstanding doctor, he was a very good teacher, who nurtured and inspired almost two generations of medicos not only in Madhya Pradesh but across the world. He passed away on Teacher’s Day. The news about Dr Mishra’s death spread like wildfire and there was mourning in the whole medical world. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan expressed deep condolences on the demise of Dr Mishra. “The death of Dr Mishra is a big loss for the medical world of the state.

In some areas, QR codes are already in place and officials said, more areas might be covered soon. Explaining the process, an official said that by scanning QR codes, the power department will get to know the details of consumption in a particular area and that will be compared with meter readings. Irregularities, or aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, can be calculated accordingly. “Line loss, which refers to power that is lost in an electrical conductor during transmission and distribution, can be calculated this way. While there is a certain percentage of loss due to technical issues, power theft leads to a considerable amount of loss. Cumulatively, it is called AT&C loss, and on an average it is around 17% in Ghaziabad,” said Pankaj, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL). “Once electric poles and transformers have QR codes, they can be scanned to determine the exact amount of power that is drawn over a period of time,” he added. He said meter readings of all consumers can be added and compared with the data. “Difference will help us assess issues like power theft,” he added. Usually, an electric pole caters to eight-10 households and a transformer is connected to about 300 households. The process of installing QR codes would be taken up by an agency. “QR codes have been installed in select areas and after determining the efficacy, we might increase the coverage area,” Pankaj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/qr-codes-for-transformers-poles-to-check-power-theft/articleshow/85960090.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Amendment plugs loophole in property registration rules||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a major amendment that has plugged a critical loophole in the property registration rules, the state government has made it mandatory to have the presence of both the buyer and the seller not only in registration, but also the cancellation of a deed. The government has amended the Registration Rules (Kerala), 1958, to curtail the practice of unilateral cancellation of the sale and settlement deeds. As per the Registration (Amendment) Rules (Kerala), 2021, that was notified on Friday, the government has inserted clause (viii) in the rule 30, that says that “no document relating to cancellation or revocation of conveyance on sale or settlement deed shall be accepted for registration unless such cancellation or revocation deed is executed by all the executant and claimant parties of the said conveyance on sale or settlement deed, as the case may be”. The amendment has been made after it came to the notice of the government where some of the parties who executed such documents cancelled it without the knowledge of the other person involved, leading to legal complications. However, while making this amendment, the government has also clarified that this rule shall not apply to the cancellation or revocation of deeds that are executed by or on the order of a competent officer of the central or the state government or of a court of competent jurisdiction. “There were several instances when the same property that was once registered in the name of another person, was cancelled without the knowledge of the recipient, and that then entered into numerous litigations. Once the property changes multiple hands, an illegal act at any point in the chain of transactions will adversely affect several innocent buyers and sellers. The change in the rules will curb such fraudulent tendencies,” registration department sources said. The government has also made amendments to the rules to refund the fees to the citizens who have paid the fee for registration but cancelled the registration subsequently, through online mode. At present, the fee for registration of documents is being paid through e-payment. However, the refund of fee for documents that are not being registered after payment of requisite fee is processed manually. It has now been decided through the amendment that the person seeking the refund should apply for refund of the same through the package for effective administration of registration laws (PEARL), which is the software for the registration of documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-amendment-plugs-loophole-in-property-registration-rules/articleshow/85965464.cms||KP Saikiran

In the days since August 28, Noida has administered more second doses than the first. In the week between August 28 and September 3, more than 1 lakh vaccinations were done in the district.  These included about 65,000-second doses and 35,000 first. Till last Friday, the daily first doses were higher than the second, except on Saturdays, which have been reserved for only second doses now. Since vaccinations began in January, this is the first time that more people are coming in for the second dose than the first. In the past week, Noida has inoculated 10,000-15,000 people on an average daily. Every day, recipients of the second dose have been at least 2,000-3,000 more than those of the first. “This just shows that most people in the district have already got their first dose. We are still keeping several slots open for the first jab as Noida has a huge floating population. However, we have nearly completed our target for the first dose,” said Dr Sunil Sharma, the chief medical officer. Officials said there were about 4 lakh people who were yet to get their second dose. According to sources, the number of people due for the second shot would have come down to only 50,000 now had the second wave not affected the vaccinations. Many people who got Covid in March and April could not take their second dose for months. With the demand for the second dose rising, residents have been asking for more slots and centres exclusively for the next shot. The health department has already reserved six centres only for the second dose.  “These centres are not enough and not even managed properly. Officials say that people can just walk in to get their second dose. But on reaching the centres, the staff ask us to book slots in advance. These slots don’t even show up on the portal and can’t be booked either,” said Sonal Verma, a resident of Sector 48.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/1st-doses-nearly-done-focus-now-on-second/articleshow/85960595.cms||Snehil Sinha
