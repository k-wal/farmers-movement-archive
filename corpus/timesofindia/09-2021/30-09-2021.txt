Abhay R Kulakarni, resident of Basaveshwaranagar, was kidnapped from near a hotel in Nagarabavi II Stage on September 20 morning. “Abhay left home at 9.45am. By 12.30pm, his friend Sajesh Mathew called me on mobile saying Abhay had been kidnapped by a gang that had come in two Toyota Fortuners,” Abhay’s brother Varun R Kulakarni told Annapoorneshwari Nagar police. He called Abhay and a stranger answered the phone saying they had kidnapped him and demanded Rs 10 lakh for his release. "The person said he would send a number to which I should leave a WhatsApp message and they would share the location where I should go with the cash by 2pm,” Varun said. He called him at 4.14pm, saying since he did not bring money, the ransom had been increased to Rs 30 lakh. "He said if I fail to hand over the cash, my brother would be killed. Our family decided to approach police,” Varun said. Four special teams were formed and they traced the abductors and their captive to an office near Byadarahalli, off Magadi Road. At 11.30pm on September 22, police raided the office, rescued the advocate and arrested the suspects. The suspects are M Siddesh, 31, a financier and Vijay Kumar G, 33, who runs an IT firm in Qatar, residents of RMV II Stage; Nelson Kumar F, 23, from Hosur Road, a bouncer, and film artists Yuganand G, 30, and KS Naresh, 30, from Vidyaranyapura, L Arun Kumar, 29, JJ Nagar, R Yuvaraj, 31, of New Guddadahalli, Ashok K, 31, of Doddaballapur and Sanjay, 27, of Bommanahalli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/9-kidnap-advocate-for-30l-nabbed/articleshow/86624885.cms||---

At the meeting with officials of all eight zones, it was mentioned that BBMP had conducted a survey of the city’s old, dilapidated buildings in 2019 and 185 buildings had been identified as unfit for use. However, only 10 were demolished. According to data with the civic agency, officers identified 33 dilapidated buildings in south zone and eight were demolished. Also, 60 buildings in Yelahanka, 46 in east zone, 34 in west zone and three in Mahadevapura were identified as dangerous to inhabit, but none was razed. One building each in Dasarahalli (eight identified) and RR Nagar zone was demolished. Gupta instructed engineers in all zones to inspect dilapidated buildings, review them and submit accurate information. He said following reinspection, contractors must be hired within 15 days to demolish them. Since the pandemic broke out, no action on old buildings had been taken. Gupta asked officers to submit a report where they had taken necessary action, including notices to owners of identified buildings, evacuation and whether structures have been demolished or repaired. While a three-storey building had collapsed in Lakkasandra, Wilson Garden on Monday, the corridor of a three-floor Bamul quarters came down near Dairy Circle on Tuesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bbmp-chief-orders-resurvey-of-dilapidated-buildings/articleshow/86624896.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Palike: Black spots in city down by 50% in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Black spots in the city have shrunk by half over the past year. The reason, say BBMP officials, is that the instances of people dumping garbage post 10.30pm has come down due to better civic sense. According to data accessed from BBMP, there were 1,254 black spots in September 2020, which reduced to 510 in September 2021. Close to 92% of the black spots in east zone have been cleared over the past year, followed by 79% in Bommanahalli zone. Mahadevapura has shown the least progress with only 10% of them being cleared. Over the past few years, the BBMP's Solid Waste Management (SWM) wing has been working to clear black spots. These are portions of land and space which are turned into garbage dumps though they are not earmarked for the same. “Most are largely created by people who do not understand the rightful way of discarding waste,” said Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner (SWM), BBMP. Deployment of marshalls and collaboration with NGOs have helped spread awareness about waste management, he added. “The main reasons were in slums, people would not understand the importance of waste management, auto-tippers wouldn't be able to enter narrow streets, odd timings of waste collection and lack of segregation. People in the slums would often throw waste into empty sites/land at night. People have different work schedules and those in the night shift would be asleep when waste collectors visit their doorsteps and this issue had to be addressed," Khan said. Data accessed by TOI shows in January 2020, there were 2,080 black spots, while the figure was 1,075 in January 2021.“As penalties are being levied, people have become conscious,” said Khan. Comparing waste segregation in Indore to that in Bengaluru, Khan said citizens of Indore share a responsibility towards waste management while Bengaluru residents lack it.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/palike-black-spots-in-city-down-by-50/articleshow/86624976.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||World||US declares fabled Ivory-billed woodpecker and 22 other species extinct||WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday declared 23 species extinct, including one of the world's largest woodpeckers, dubbed the "Lord God Bird." The announcement came via the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which proposed to remove the birds, mussels, fish, as well as a plant and fruit bat from Endangered Species Act protections because government scientists have given up on ever finding them again. "With climate change and natural area loss pushing more and more species to the brink, now is the time to lift up proactive, collaborative, and innovative efforts to save America's wildlife," said interior secretary Deb Haaland in a statement. Perhaps the most iconic of the species was the Ivory-billed woodpecker, with the last indisputable evidence of its existence coming in the 1940s. Noted for its striking black-and-white plumage, pointed crest and lemon-yellow eye, it has been something of Holy Grail for birders in recent decades, with numerous unconfirmed sightings over the years in the southeastern US. "The fundamental thing that drove the woodpecker down to near extinction was the loss of the southeastern first growth forests, which really started taking place after the Civil War," John Fitzpatrick, director emeritus of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, told AFP. Fitzpatrick was part of efforts to search for the bird in Arkansas and other regions in the mid-2000s - but added that, while he agreed with the government about its decision regarding the other bird species, he believed there is still hope for the woodpecker. "Every decade there have been reasonably credible reports coming out of the US, and in the 1980s out of Cuba, that it still existed," he said. The species was revered not just by Alexander Wilson and John James Audobon, considered the founding fathers of ornithology, but also by collectors who hunted them. Its nickname, "Lord God Bird," was said to be derived from the expression "Lord God, what a bird," said Fitzpatrick. Other species declared extinct include Bachman's warbler, a songbird last documented in Cuba in 1981, and eight species of freshwater mussel, which rely on healthy streams and clean reliable water. Eleven species from Hawai'i and Guam are included in the list, including the Kauai akialoa and nukupu'u, known for their long, curved beaks, and Kauai 'o'o that was said to have a haunting call. Also lost was San Marcos gambusia, a freshwater fish from Texas last spotted in 1983. Despite the sad news, Fitzpatrick said there was some cause for optimism. Since it was enacted in 1973, the Endangered Species Act has prevented the extinction of 99 per cent of plants and animals under its care. These include bird species like the whooping crane, which numbered as few as 16 individuals in the 1940s but have since recovered to 500 or 600. On the other hand, today's endangered species also have to contend with the pressures of climate change. Saltmarsh sparrows for example live in coastal marshes that are being rapidly disrupted by sea level rise. Tiera Curry, a senior scientist for the Center for Biological Diversity, praised President Joe Biden's administration for requesting a hefty $60 million increase in endangered species protections, but criticized the fact a new FWS director had yet to be appointed. "Extinction is not inevitable. It is a political choice. Saving species isn't rocket science. As a country we need to stand up and say we aren't going to lose any more species to extinction," she said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-declares-fabled-ivory-billed-woodpecker-and-22-other-species-extinct/articleshow/86625173.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Over 2.29 lakh voters to decide fate of Pipili in bypoll today||BHUBANESWAR: Nearly a year after the death of sitting MLA Pradeep Maharathy, around 2.29 lakh voters of the Pipili assembly constituency are set to elect a new MLA through the byelection scheduled to be held on Thursday. The administration has made the necessary arrangements for the smooth conduct of the bypolls amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which was postponed thrice earlier owing to various reasons. The voting will start at 7am and continue until 6pm in the 348 polling stations of the constituency. District collector (Puri) Samarth Verma, SP Kanwar Vishal Singh and senior officials visited various booths of the Pipili and Delang area on Wednesday to review the preparedness and other arrangements as polling officials with EVMs, VVPATs and other materials have already reached the booths. Nearly 2,200 polling personnel and 2,000 security personnel, including three companies of the Border Security Force, have been engaged by the administration for the free, fair and smooth conduct of the byelection. “Adequate arrangements have been made for a free and fair poll. We are taking all steps to ensure a Covid-safe election as directed by the Election Commission of India,” chief electoral officer SK Lohani said. The thermal scanning of the voters will be done while those with a high temperature will be allowed to cast their vote in the last one hour with additional safety protocols. Additional staff are being deployed to ensure strict compliance of the Covid protocols such as maintaining physical distance while standing in queues, wearing masks and washing hands frequently. Though 10 candidates are in the fray for the byelection, the fight is mainly among the candidates of three major political parties — BJD’s Rudra Pratap Maharathy, BJP’s Ashrit Pattanayak and Congress’s Bishwokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/over-2-29l-voters-to-decide-fate-of-pipili-in-bypoll-today/articleshow/86625763.cms||---

Lalsangmoun Gangte (24) and his younger brother, Lienkhogin (22), were digging earth at their residential complex at Moreh Ward no 9 around 4 pm when the bomb went off, killing them on the spot, a source said. Police rushed to the spot and retrieved the splinter-riddled bodies. In November last year, 122 WWII-era bombs were found near the spot. The bombs had been recovered during excavation work for building construction. Thousands of soldiers of both the clashing Allied and Japanese forces were killed and many others were injured in various pitched battles across Manipur, one of the significant theatres of WWII.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/imphal/two-youths-die-as-wwii-era-bomb-explodes-in-moreh/articleshow/86625829.cms||---

The agreement has been signed by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, industry and commerce minister Chandra Mohan Patowary and representatives of the HPC mills’ unions and associations. “Finally, reached an agreement with the workers and employees of the HPC to resolve long-pending issues of their salaries and dues,” Sarma said after the four-hour meeting with the unions and associations that ended at 2 am on Wednesday. As per the agreement, the state government will approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) through the official Liquidator for taking over all the assets of HPC after due diligence. It added that a relief package of about Rs 570 crore will be disbursed to the employees within two months of the NCLT’s approval of a proposal, submitted by the government. The state will also provide permanent government jobs to 100 young officers and workers as per their qualification at the entry level, and equivalent to the state government pay scale against appropriate posts, by condoning the upper age limit and taking up special recruitment drive. They will be provided provident fund, gratuity, pension and other statutory dues, but not salary. The doctors and other paramedical staff of health establishments of HPC will also get permanent government jobs as per the agreement. The relief amount will be provided to the employees of the paper mills only when they vacate the houses, premises and other assets of the HPC. However, in rare cases, on humanitarian grounds, an extra period of one month may be allowed to vacate the quarter by the deputy commissioner concerned. The employees have been asked to ensure that the possession of the assets is smoothly taken over by the state government without any hindrances and obstacles, and the same will not be disputed in any court of law.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-govt-to-acquire-assets-of-hpc-and-offer-570-crore-relief-to-staff/articleshow/86625863.cms||Mukut Das

---||World||Labour party announces it wants the Indian ethnic voter back||LONDON: The Labour party has officially said the UK should not interfere in the politics of India and that it wants Indian diaspora voters to come back to it. "Some of the motions passed at Labour conference were unhelpful. Given our colonial history, to interfere in the politics of India, absolutely that is not appropriate," Steve Reed, shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, told a Hindus for Labour fringe event on Wednesday during the Labour party conference in Brighton. The Labour party values and the values of the Hindu community are "very very similar," Reed said. "The Hindu community is well represented in professions, the arts and science. It is clear aspiration matters immensely to the Hindu community — that also is what we are for, to open up opportunities to everyone regardless of background, and also values of family and fairness matter immensely to both of us. These are strong foundations on which the relationship between Labour and the Hindu community can be built," he said. "The Labour party has not done enough to secure, to win and to maintain the support of the Hindu community, we have seen too many people from that community ending up supporting the Conservative party. I think establishing Hindus for Labour is a major contribution to re-establishing and opening contacts, friendship, communication, and mutual understanding between our party and the Hindu community," Reed said. He added: "It wasn’t just the Hindu community who we lost support from in the last general election. We lost support from every single community. Hindus make up 1.5% of British community but contribute 6% to GDP. It is remarkable. The Labour party was always an anti-colonialist party and the Labour party played a role supporting those great towering figures of Indian independence, primarily Gandhi. Hinduism is the third-biggest religion in UK and it is important it is represented inside our party." An audience member commented: "I would like to go back to where we had the India high commission every year at Labour conference with a reception. We need to encourage them back." Hindus for Labour is a friends group approved by the Labour party and established in February. Hindus for Labour chairman Dr Neeraj Patil said: "Labour has always been on the side of the Hindu community but unfortunately something happened in 2019 and the Conservatives got hold of the right-wing elements in the Hindu community and launched a massive social media propaganda against our Labour party. There is no place for anti-Hinduism or any kind of prejudice in the Labour party." A seven-foot-high foamex panel of Basaveshwara, the 12th-century CE social reformer, was stationed at the Hindus for Labour stall.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/labour-party-announces-it-wants-the-indian-ethnic-voter-back/articleshow/86626014.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||World||Taliban warn US against violation of its airspace||ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s interim Taliban government warned the United States on Wednesday to stop violations of its airspace in order to prevent any negative consequences. In a statement issued from Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the US drone strikes inside Afghanistan were a breach of national security and violation of international laws and rights. "We recently saw the Unites States violating all international rights, law and its commitments to the Islamic Emirate in Doha, Qatar, as Afghanistan’s sacred airspace is being invaded by US drones," Mujahid, who is deputy minister for information and culture in the Taliban cabinet, said. He urged Washington to end these violations. "Countries, under international laws, are the sole owners of their territorial and air sovereignty. Therefore, the Islamic Emirate, as the sole legal entity of Afghanistan, is the custodian of Afghanistan’s land and airspace," he explained. "We call on all countries, especially the United States, to treat Afghanistan in light of international rights, laws, and commitments, considering mutual respect and commitments, in order to prevent any negative consequences," Mujahid added. Mujahid’s statement followed remarks by US officials who have said that they do not need to cooperate with the Taliban on over-the-horizon counterterrorism efforts. "We retain all necessary authorities to execute over-the-horizon counterterrorism operations and we remain confident in these capabilities moving forward without speaking to specific rules of engagement surrounding airstrikes. There is currently no requirement to clear airspace with the Taliban and we do not expect that any future over-the-horizon counterterrorism strikes would hinge on such a clearance," John Kirby, spokesman for the US department of defence, recently said. On August 29, two weeks after the Taliban had toppled the American-backed previous government, the US military had targeted a vehicle of Zamari Ahmadi, a humanitarian worker, in a drone strike, killing him and nine of his family in Kabul. He was suspected of having ties to ISIS/Daesh-Khorasan. The US had acknowledged this month that the airstrike resulted in the deaths of 10 civilians, including an aid worker and up to seven children. Meanwhile, the cultural commission of the Taliban information and culture ministry has said the King Zahir Shah-era constitution will be enforced until a new constitution is put in place. King Zahir Shah’s constitution has 11 chapters and 128 articles. According to the document, the king is the ultimate authority in decision-making. According to sources, the enforcement of the King Zahir Shah-era constitution was repeatedly put forward by the negotiating team of the Taliban during intra-Afghan talks in Doha.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-warn-us-against-violation-of-its-airspace/articleshow/86626257.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

TOI has seen a letter from him confirming he would address the conference. Abdullah appeared on Zoom from his Srinagar home at around 9.10 am local time when he had a brief chat with the Zoom technician to check his audio and video worked. He was told the event was not due to begin until 9.30 am local time. So he asked if he could take a short break and come back at that time. Abdullah then left the Zoom call and mysteriously never returned. Hindus for Labour chairman Dr Neeraj Patil told the event: "We seem to have an Internet problem connecting with the former chief minister of Kashmir. He is happy to address the conference. He was here earlier and is having an Internet problem." He later repeated: "We seem to be having connection problems with Abdullah." The event finally concluded without Abdullah ever addressing it. He had been due to speak on Kashmir. Patil tried to call Abdullah’s private mobile several times during the event but his phone was switched off. WhatsApp messages also did not go through. "We don't know what has happened with Dr Abdullah. He was on the line. I have got his private number and his phone is switched off. We could not get him because of some Internet issues," Patil said. The Zoom host told TOI: "He logged off from Zoom and we could not contact him." "The Labour party stands for international peace and justice and we want peace in Kashmir. One of the proposals we are recommending is converting the current LoC into a soft international border with free movement of people, goods and services similar to what we have in Northern Ireland and greater autonomy for the whole region of Kashmir," Patil told the event.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/farooq-abdullah-mysteriously-drops-off-zoom-call-whilst-addressing-hindus-for-labour-event/articleshow/86626315.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||Chandigarh||Sidhu blames choice of new AG, ‘tainted’ ministers for quitting||The curious case of Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation as Punjab PCC chief within 10 days of his bête noire Amarinder Singh’s exit as CM unravelled on Wednesday when he declared the new-look Congress government’s choice of advocate general and the re-entry of “tainted” ministers into the restructured cabinet forced his hand. “I am willing to sacrifice anything, but will stick to my principles. We got rid of the system of tainted officers and ministers, and they cannot be brought back to put the same system in place,” Sidhu said in a video message from his Twitter handle. “My political journey of 17 years was to take a stand on the politics of principles... My fight is for Punjab and I did not hanker after any posts. There was never any compromise, I did it as my duty.” Sidhu accused the Charanjit Singh Channi government of “already compromising” on key issues. “People who gave a clean chit to the Badals six years back and inflicted atrocities on young boys have been given the responsibility of ensuring justice. Someone who secured blanket bail for an accused (former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini) has just been appointed advocate general. What sort of an agenda is this? Is this how we are going to reach our goals?” Sidhu said he would neither misguide the Congress central leadership, nor allow anyone to do so. He vowed to continue fighting for truth "till my last breath". "Mein te adun, te ladun (I will take a stand and fight)," he said. According to party insiders, the immediate trigger for Sidhu’s resignation was the inclusion of Rana Gurjit Singh in the Channi cabinet, besides APS Deol's appointment as advocate general. Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota being appointed DGP and the home portfolio going to Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa are his other peeve points, they said. CM Charanjit Singh Channi said he had reached out to Sidhu. "I spoke to Sidhu sahib today over the phone and suggested that we discuss the issues on which he has objections…I asked him to come over and talk. The party president is the head of the family. The head should discuss issues within the family," he told reporters. "If anybody has an objection regarding any appointment, I am not rigid on that. I don't go into ego battles. Everything is being done in a transparent manner." On the controversy over the new advocate general being former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini’s counsel in cases filed against him, Channi said a team of lawyers led by a special prosecutor was being constituted to handle cases involving the state government. While the Congress central leadership hasn't accepted Sidhu's resignation yet, the procession of ministers and other senior party members to his residence continued for the second consecutive day. Cabinet ministers Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Pargat Singh met Sidhu at his Patiala home in the morning before returning to Chandigarh for a meeting of the council of ministers. Two other ministers spoke to Sidhu in the evening. AICC observer Harish Choudhary held a meeting with CM Channi to discuss the crisis triggered by Sidhu's decision to step down. In the event of the Congress leadership being unable to placate Sidhu over the next couple of days, the names of working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu are already doing the rounds in Congress circles as likely candidates to take over the reins of the state unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sidhu-blames-choice-of-new-ag-tainted-ministers-for-quitting/articleshow/86626951.cms||---

Basanta Behera, Hemanta Mistri, Tapas Ranjan Nayak, Sheikh Musafir and Sachin Kumar, who were allegedly honey-trapped by the unknown suspected Pakistani woman, were arrested by the Balasore police on September 14 for sharing classified ITR information with the foreign agent. “According to the established protocol, we will take the help of the Interpol to gather details about the foreign woman, who had contacted the five persons on Facebook and WhatsApp,” additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Sanjeeb Panda said. Sources said the woman had been in touch with the five arrested persons through a UK SIM, whose number was +447947111773, since February last year. The accused allegedly sent photos and data related to the missile tests, cluster bombs and atomic power systems of the ITR her. One of the accused had allegedly received Rs 38,000 from an account in Dubai. The probe agency said the possibility of more financial transactions between the accused and the agent cannot be ruled out. Cyber cell experts of the crime branch have been engaged to thoroughly scan the social media handles and phones of the accused and their chats with the agent. The mobile phones and laptops of the accused have been sent to the cyber forensic laboratory here for examination. Separate teams of the Indian Air Force and the National Investigation Agency have already interrogated the five accused in Odisha. The crime branch said they may seek further police remand of the accused for interrogation. Sources said the Army intelligence wing in Odisha had in July this year shared the details of the anti-national activities of the five accused with the state police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/cb-to-seek-interpol-help-to-trace-pak-woman-in-drdo-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/86626988.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on June 1 predicted that the southwest monsoon seasonal (June 1-September 30) rainfall over the country as a whole is most likely to be ‘normal’ at 101% of the long period average (LPA) with model error of +/-4%. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1961-2010 is 88 cm. The season has already recorded nearly 87 cm of cumulative rainfall even as the monsoon has not yet started retreating. “The IMD had forecast ‘above normal’ rain in September. There were consecutive low pressure systems, and depressions over the Bay of Bengal this month. Thus, the monsoon was active during the month. Our latest prediction for the entire monsoon 2021 was that it may end up being on the lower side of normal, and thus far, the departure from the long period average for June-September 2021 is just -1%. The rain in September made a significant contribution to the season, and overall we had a near-normal monsoon this year,” IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI. As far as rainfall in September is concerned, the month has recorded 34% excess rains at 223 mm (September 1-29) against a monthly normal of 166.6 mm. The rain recorded so far during September in the country is the second best figure for rains during the month since 1994. “September turned out to be just the opposite of August... Several low pressure systems formed over the Bay of Bengal, some of which had re-emerged from the northwest Pacific, which too had not happened in August,” said D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, Pune. Rainfall, linked to cyclonic circulation, in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand is likely to completely end the deficit in next 24 hours, which will see intense rainfall activities due to the remnants of the cyclonic storm ‘Gulab’ that had hit the eastern coast last Sunday. The remnants moving towards the western coast, observed as a well-marked ‘low pressure area’ over south Gujarat region & adjoining Gulf of Khambhat on Wednesday morning, is very likely to emerge into northeast Arabian Sea & intensify into a ‘depression’ by Wednesday morning. The Met department on Wednesday said the cyclonic system is then very likely to move further west-north-westwards and intensify into a cyclonic storm, named 'Shaheen', during the subsequent 24 hours (by October 1). Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move west-north-westwards towards Pakistan’s Makran coasts, moving away from the Indian coasts. IMD’s data on cumulative rainfall over the four homogenous regions shows the maximum deficit of rainfall as on Wednesday in east & north-east India (-12%) followed by north-west India (-4%). On the other hand, the south peninsula region shows a surplus of 11% whereas central India shows a surplus of 3%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/abundant-september-rain-nearly-bridges-4-month-monsoon-deficit/articleshow/86627099.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Not a single customer we’ve met wore a mask: Delivery executives||Earlier this month in Delhi, a woman complained to a food delivery aggregator about a delivery executive not wearing a mask while handing her the order. The very next day, the latter returned to her doorstep – along with a group of other delivery persons – to threaten her, with the police having to eventually intervene to resolve the issue. What’s even stranger than this altercation is the fact that this isn’t a standalone incident. During the pandemic, several such cases have been reported from across the country, wherein not wearing a mask has led to not just a verbal spat, but physical fights, between customers and delivery persons. While customers feel they have the right to “scold’”and complain about delivery executives’ COVID-inappropriate behaviour, the latter argue that despite their moral high ground, “not a single” customer wears a mask themselves! Further, despite placing ‘contactless orders’, most customers refuse to follow social distancing either. Why the double standards?, they ask. Covid rulescovid-appropriate behaviour customers should followCustomers expect us to wear a double mask & be fully vaccinated, but think the rules don’t apply to them: Delivery execsDelivery persons say they keep hearing comments like, “Do you really want to be the reason for another lockdown?”, “This type of behaviour is indefensible and truly shameful”, “Aise mask nahi lagaane ke kaaran hi second wave aaya tha”, etc, but customers seldom follow their own advice. Bhuvnesh, a delivery executive, says, “Mask kahan hai? Mask theek se kyun nahi lagaya? Double mask kyu nahi pehna? Vaccine lag gayi ya corona phailaoge? Aise sawal roz aate hain. Kuch log toh aane se pehle phone karke bhi puchhne lagte hain. Ek customer ne mere double mask nahi lagane pe complain bhi ki thi.” Raju, a delivery person with a home products company, says, “I can’t ask any customer if they’re vaccinated, but almost every day there is at least one customer who is keen to know about my vaccine status. In fact, many of them ask how we are even allowed to deliver with a single dose. I have to enter their homes to set up furniture, so I am careful about my safety, too. There are usually four-five people in one home, and none of them is wearing a mask but they always make sure they ask me ‘mask achhi quality ka hai na?” Follow rulesJaideep Haldar, who delivers groceries, says, “Even before it was a rule, I had added sanitiser and gloves to my gear, besides wearing a homemade mask. I’m usually told – ‘Yeh mask nahi chalega’. On the other hand, customers don’t maintain social distancing, even when they select contactless delivery. They want their order to be delivered directly in their hands. I have never met any customer wearing a mask, barring office orders. Some customers even start chatting, despite having selected contactless delivery.” Most customers don't maintain social distancingAshish, a delivery person, adds, “I have been asked by customers to wear a double mask, but I have never asked any customer, ‘where is your mask?’ Shaming and threatening delivery persons is unfair. And if they are complaining about us, then we have the right to question them, too.” Some delivery execs wear a helmet while delivering an order||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/not-a-single-customer-weve-met-wore-a-mask-delivery-executives/articleshow/86617668.cms||Niharika Lal

---||World||New York attorney general blasts Andrew Cuomo's criticism of her report||NEW YORK: New York attorney general Letitia James on Wednesday dismissed former governor Andrew Cuomo's repeated complaints that the sexual harassment investigation that led to his resignation was tainted by politics, saying the Democrat has "never taken responsibility for his own conduct." James, speaking to a civic group in New York City, defended the 165-page report her office released in August that found Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women. "Mr Cuomo has a lot to say on these matters, but he's never taken responsibility for his own conduct. He's never held himself accountable for how his behavior affected our state government," said James, also a Democrat. Cuomo emphatically denied intentionally mistreating women. He said he was stepping aside to avoid subjecting the state to months of turmoil. Since announcing his resignation, he has promoted opinion columns on social media that question the independence of the investigation and suggest his ouster was an orchestrated, political bludgeoning. "This was politics. Every step of the way," he said in a tweet last week. The five-month, noncriminal investigation by James' office concluded that 11 women within and outside the state government were telling the truth when they said Cuomo had touched them inappropriately, commented on their appearance or made suggestive comments about their sex lives. The report also detailed efforts by his staff to discredit some of his accusers. "Let's not lose sight of what's important," James said. "It's not me. It's not Mr Cuomo, but the survivors of his harassment. The people of our state whose trust he broke. And the people who believed in him, including myself. No one is above the law. And our state can do better moving forward," James contrasted her investigation with one Cuomo himself ran while he was serving as attorney general and investigated then-governor Eliot Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 in a prostitution scandal. She noted that her investigation started after Cuomo's office referred the allegations to her, was led by outside investigators and took five months. Cuomo's investigation of Spitzer, James said, started without an outside referral, took 20 days and was handled within the office. She said her office plans to publicly release transcripts of the 179 people interviewed as part of the probe. James' office has released only excerpts of the interviews. The Associated Press filed open records requests in August for full transcripts and recordings of interviews with Cuomo and other witnesses but has yet to receive the materials. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Cuomo and his longtime spokesperson, called on the attorney general to release those transcripts and a video recording of the former governor being interviewed by James' investigators. "It should raise serious red flags that the AG and her staff duck every time specific questions about omissions and inaccuracies in the AG's report are raised. The public deserves specific answers from the AG as to the credibility of her report - especially while she mulls a run for governor." Before resigning, Cuomo, his attorney and staff attacked the fairness of James' report on his conduct, including saying that records showed one accuser's account of being groped at the governor's mansion couldn't have happened during the time period she claimed. James is considered a potential candidate 2022 candidate for New York governor. After giving remarks at Wednesday's event, James dodged a question from the moderator about whether she will run, saying: "I am focusing on my work, putting my head down and serving all of you as the attorney general."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-attorney-general-blasts-andrew-cuomos-criticism-of-her-report/articleshow/86628275.cms||---
---||India||India set to take part in SCO anti-terror exercise in Pakistan||NEW DELHI: India is likely to send a 3-member team to participate in a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Pakistan next week, ToI has learnt. The Pabbi Anti-terror Exercise 2021 is being held at Pabbi in Pakistan’s Nowshera district from October 3 under the aegis of SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) which seeks to promote counter-terrorism cooperation between SCO member-states. The government believes its participation in the exercise, an SCO event, will not in any way dilute its position that Pakistan continues to promote cross-border terrorism. India's presence though will be seen as a sign of the importance it attaches to the role of the Central Asia-focused regional bloc in security-related issues, especially in Afghanistan. With Iran too joining the group, comprising Russia, India, China, Pakistan and 4 Central Asian countries as full members, SCO is likely to play a key role in the efforts for a political and diplomatic solution to the situation in Afghanistan. Read AlsoIndia yet to take final call on participation in multi-nation counter-terror exercise in PakistanNEW DELHI: India is yet to take a final decision on whether its troops will participate in a multi-nation counter-terrorism exercise of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which will be held in Pakistan later this year and also include Chinese soldiers. The joint exerciseIndia was apparently the last country to confirm its participation in the exercise which was announced in March this year following a meeting of the Council of RATS in Tashkent. In line with the SCO protocol, Pakistan had invited all member-states, including India, for the exercise which doesn’t involve troops and is meant to identify and suppress channels that finance terrorist activities. India is likely to be represented by officials of National Security Council Secretariat in the exercise. The SCO Dushanbe Declaration earlier this month reaffirmed the ``special role’’ of the SCO RATS in the joint fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism in order to ensure regional security. It had also said that member-states will continue to conduct joint anti-terrorism exercises, including the upcoming Pabbi Anti-Terror 2021 exercise. Read AlsoNo proposal received yet by Indian Army to attend SCO exercise in PakistanNEW DELHI: The Indian Army has not yet received any proposal to participate in a multinational exercise planned to be held by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Pakistan later this year. "We have not yet received any proposal for participation in the SCO exercise to be held in Pakistan,"Addressing the SCO summit meeting on Afghanistan in Dushanbe, PM Narendra Modi had said that the government formed by Taliban wasn’t inclusive and asked the international community to not rush into recognising it. The Declaration, while calling for an Afghanistan free of terrorism and drugs, said that all member-states believed it was critical to have an inclusive government in Afghanistan, with representatives from all ethnic, religious and political groups of Afghan society. The SCO exercise will take place at a time India-Pakistan ties seem to be going from bad to worse despite the thaw witnessed in February this year when the 2 sides arrived at a ceasefire agreement. Indian army has accused Pakistan commanders of facilitating infiltration in J&K in the past month and, earlier this week, the army detained a Pakistani militant after an encounter in the Uri sector of LoC.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-set-to-take-part-in-sco-anti-terror-exercise-in-pakistan/articleshow/86628288.cms||Sachin Parashar

Encouraging “Tithi Bhojan” to allow people from community to provide special food to children on occasions and festivals; using harvest from “School nutrition gardens” for cooking mid-day meals; cooking competitions to promote ethnic cuisine and innovative menus; and involvement of Farmers Producer Organizations (FPO) and Women Self Help Groups in implementation of the scheme are among the features which have been added in the new scheme. “Under this scheme, mid-day meals have been extended to students studying in pre-primary or Balvatikas in addition to children studying in class 1 to 8 in government and government-aided schools. This will benefit about 11.80 crore children studying in 11.20 lakh schools,” education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. In addition to the approved financial outlay, the central government will also bear additional cost of about Rs 45,000 crore on foodgrain. “Therefore, the total scheme budget will amount to 130794.90 crore. The concept of Tithi Bhojan will be encouraged extensively,” Pradhan said. While social audit of the scheme is made mandatory in all the districts, special provision has been made for providing supplementary nutrition items to children in aspirational districts and districts with high prevalence of anaemia. Cooking competitions will be encouraged from village level to national level to promote ethnic cuisine and innovative menus based on locally available ingredients and vegetables. Field visits will be facilitated for students of eminent universities and institutions and also trainee teachers of Regional Institutes of Educations and District Institutes of Education and Training.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pre-primary-kids-to-get-midday-meals-too/articleshow/86628872.cms||---
---||India||HC: Breastfeeding inalienable constitutional right of a mom||BENGALURU: Breastfeeding is an inalienable constitutional right of a lactating mother and the right of the infant needs to be assimilated with the mother’s right, the Karnataka high court observed on Wednesday. It was disposing a batch of petitions filed by the biological mother and foster parents of a toddler. “Arguably, it is a case of concurrent rights; this important attribute of motherhood is protected under the umbrella of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is unfortunate that this pretty child for no fault remained unbreastfed, its lactating mother having had no access to it till now. In a civilised society, such things should never happen,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed in his order. While a Bengaluru resident had sought custody of her rescued baby boy, the foster parents from Koppal had sought directions to permit them to retain the child. The couple had also challenged the notice issued to them by the Child Welfare Committee. The child was born in a maternity home in Bengaluru in May 2020 but was stolen from the cradle by a psychiatrist who later allegedly gave it away to the Koppal couple by claiming it was their child born out of surrogacy. The psychiatrist had taken money from the couple. Police caught the kidnapper and traced the child to the couple’s home in Koppal town in May this year. The judge rejected the contention of the foster mother’s counsel that his client should be permitted to retain custody of the child consistent with what Devaki Maa allegedly did to Yashoda Maa, as mentioned in Bhagavata, the revered Hindu purana espousing devotion to Lord Krishna. “It is bit difficult to countenance; no authoritative text of the episode is produced to show there was any dispute of the kind between these two women of grace from the era long gone by,” the judge observed. The judge dismissed another contention of the foster mother’s counsel that his client doesn’t have any children whereas the genetic mother had two and therefore, the custody should be allowed to continue. “Children are not chattel for being apportioned between their genetic mother and a stranger on the basis of their numerical abundance. The principle of distributive justice which intends to bridge the gap between ‘haves and have nots’ is not invocable, at least in this case. It is a matter of common knowledge consistent without experience that a genetic mother treats all her children as being an integral part of her body and soul...,” the judge observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-breastfeeding-inalienable-constitutional-right-of-a-mom/articleshow/86629446.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||World||'Unmitigated disaster': Republicans attack Joe Biden's defence of Afghan pullout||WASHINGTON: Republican US lawmakers tried on Wednesday to pick apart President Joe Biden's defence of his withdrawal from Afghanistan as they attacked his judgment and honesty during a second day of contentious Congressional hearings with Pentagon leaders. Democrat Biden has faced the biggest crisis of his presidency over the war in Afghanistan, which he argued needed to be brought to a close after 20 years of stalemated fighting that had cost American lives, drained resources and distracted from greater strategic priorities. Republicans have accused him of lying about military commanders' recommendations to keep 2,500 troops in the country, playing down warnings of the risks of a Taliban victory, and exaggerating America's ability to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for militant groups like al-Qaida. "I fear the president may be delusional," said Mike Rogers, the top Republican on the House of Representatives armed services committee, calling the withdrawal an "unmitigated disaster." "It will go down in history as one of the greatest failures of American leadership," Rogers said. Under Biden's Republican predecessor Donald Trump, the United States made a deal with the Islamist militant group to withdraw all American forces, leaving Biden with the tough choice of pulling out completely or abandoning the deal and embracing a period of renewed hostilities with the Taliban. Biden's approval ratings have been badly damaged by last month's spectacular collapse of the two-decade war effort, which ended in a chaotic withdrawal that left US troops dead and American citizens behind. General Frank McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, said both he and the top commander on the ground in Afghanistan had recommended keeping 2,500 US troops as well as thousands more coalition forces in the country. McKenzie, secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and Joint chiefs of staff chairman General Mark Milley testified in the House for 4-1/2 hours on Wednesday, after spending almost all day on Tuesday at a hearing in the Senate. McKenzie told the House committee that he had warned that a complete withdrawal would lead to the collapse of the Afghan military and the Afghan government. "That is in fact what happened," McKenzie said. In an August television interview, Biden denied his commanders had recommended keeping 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. He said then: "No. No one said that to me that I can recall." Republicans accused Biden of being untruthful, also citing his promises to leave no Americans behind and scoffing at his assurances in July that Afghanistan wouldn't become another Vietnam even as the Taliban's advance accelerated. The House hearing devolved repeatedly into shouting matches, as representatives argued over what Democrats characterized as partisan Republican attacks on Biden, particularly over the television interview. One committee member, Republican representative Mike Johnson, used the time he had been allotted for questions to read the interview transcript aloud. Republican Joe Wilson said Biden should resign. Other Republicans directed their anger at Milley. They slammed him for doing interviews for books critical of Trump and accused him of being "woke," which Republicans consider a disparaging reference to his comments this summer about the need for military commanders to be aware of racial tensions in America. Trump has repeatedly accused Milley of being a "woke" general more concerned with his image than winning the war. US representative Liz Cheney, who has broken from Republicans to become a vocal Trump opponent, praised Milley. "For any member of this committee, for any American to question your loyalty to our nation is despicable," Cheney told Milley at the hearing. "Strategic failure"Milley testified that withdrawing to zero had a major impact on morale among Afghan troops, who had grown to depend on US assistance for everything from air and intelligence support to training and equipment maintenance. While the US airlift of 124,000 people out of Afghanistan was a logistical success, Milley acknowledged for a second day that it was a "strategic failure" - one that left the Taliban back in power at the end of America's longest war. Democrats faulted Republicans for blaming Biden - who has been President since late January - for everything that went wrong during the 20 years US troops have been in Afghanistan. Representative Adam Smith, the committee's Democratic chairman, said he agreed with Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. "Our larger mission to help build a government in Afghanistan that could govern effectively and defeat the Taliban had failed," Smith said. "President Biden had the courage to finally make the decision to say no, we are not succeeding in this mission."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unmitigated-disaster-republicans-attack-joe-bidens-defence-of-afghan-pullout/articleshow/86629682.cms||---

Cajoling the devotee, Srivari Daadaa, to exercise patience which is the primary quality of any devotee of Lord Balaji, a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana said no devotee of the deity would venture to lose patience with the SC Registry officials and continuously threaten and blackmail them if his petition was not listed urgently. “We are also interested in protecting the tradition and rituals intrinsic to Lord Balaji as we (CJI himself and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli) also are devotees of Him. But, how does a constitutional court interfere in the manner in which daily puja and archana are to be conducted? How could we determine how many devotees are to be allowed for daily darshan? Are these part of an individual’s fundamental rights,” the CJI asked. The CJI turned to TTD’s counsel Satya Sabharwal and asked whether the temple management had responded to the March 18, 2020, representation of the petitioner pointing out several irregularities in the observance of daily rituals. “Every devotee has faith in Lord Balaji. They expect TTD not to deviate from tradition,” the bench said and sought answers from TTD within a week.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-seeks-tirupati-response-on-ritual-irregularities/articleshow/86629733.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With ‘Marathi katta’, BJP aims to cut the Sena hold||MUMBAI: The Mumbai BJP’s ‘Marathi katta’ campaign, to be flagged off on Friday, aims at making a dent into Shiv Sena’s Marathi votebank and contest its claim of representing regional aspirations in the run-up to the February 2022 BMC elections. Eager to wrest the country’s richest civic body from the Sena, the BJP plans to make inroads into 150 of the 227 electoral wards, which boast a remarkable presence of Marathi-speaking voters. Top on BJP’s radar are Girgaum, Worli and Dadar; and the Lalbaug, Parel and Sewri stretch, which is embedded in the Marathi Mumbaikars’ consciousness as ‘girangao’. The ‘katta’ (a watering hole where ideas are exchanged over a hot cuppa) campaign will thus thread its way through south and south-central Mumbai, where the BJP’s presence is scarce, before trundling across the suburbs. ‘Plan to reach Marathis denied amenities under Sena rule’The cavalcade will be helmed by Nitesh Rane, the BJP MLA from Konkan and son of Union minister Narayan Rane. It was Rane Sr who, as Sena functionary, wrested Konkan from the Socialists in the 1990s. However, Narayan Rane turned a Sena-baiter after his 2005 fallout with Matoshree. The Sena-led MVA government ordered his arrest last month after he made an uncharitable remark against CM Uddhav Thackeray. Sunil Rane, the BJP MLA from Borivli, will team up with Nitesh to keep the ‘katta’ on for two months. Like Nitesh, Sunil Rane, a flight purser-turned-politician, belongs to Kankavli in the Konkan. “The idea is to reach out to the city’s Marathi ‘manoos’ who has been denied basic civic amenities under the Sena’s four-decade-long regime in BMC. We want to tell them to think afresh of the disastrous consequences of their one-sided love affair with the Sena,” said Nitesh Rane. The coastal region’s economy hinges chiefly on remittances from Mumbai, it is said. Nitesh Rane said Konkan citizens were upset with the Thackeray regime for not providing relief to Chiplun which was devastated by a storm. The ire has now wormed its way into Mumbai, he said. Sunil Rane said, “The ‘katta’ will highlight Marathi Mumbaikars’ woes: old and dilapidated chawls, job opportunities, the BDD chawl redevelopment, rehabilitation of those affected by MMRDA projects, problems of Marathi medium schools and so on.” “There will be no speeches, no formalities. We would mingle with people, chat them up at a suitable venue in every civic ward,” stated Nitesh. Vada paav, misal and ‘chai’ stalls will enliven the proceedings, he added. Plans are afoot to revive memories of the Samyukta Maharashtra stir in the 1950s, an emotive issue for Marathis. Observers said BJP needs to lean on the Rane father-son duo to shed the party’s pro-Gujarati-UP image. “With PM Modi and Amit Shah heading the party, the BJP has no chance of befriending the Marathi manoos,” claimed a Sena functionary. Pooh-poohing the ‘katta’ crusade, Ajay Chaudhari, Sena MLA from Sewri, said, “The Marathis have unshakeable faith in the Sena.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/with-marathi-katta-bjp-aims-to-cut-the-sena-hold/articleshow/86630040.cms||Ambarish Mishra
---||World||New York governor uses God unfairly in vaccine fight: Lawyer||NEW YORK: New York governor Kathleen Hochul has encouraged religious-minded people to get a Covid-19 vaccine by saying it is God's will that they get inoculated. A lawyer argued before a federal appeals court on Wednesday that the Democrat's comments about God could be encouraging hospitals and nursing homes to ignore court orders that - for now - are supposed to prevent them from punishing workers who won't take the vaccine because of religious objections. Health care institutions across New York this week began suspending workers who failed to meet a state deadline to get a Covid-19 shot. Statewide, about 92% of hospital and nursing home staff had received at least one dose as of the vaccine as of Wednesday morning, according to figures from Hochul's office. New York's vaccine mandate for health care workers doesn't include a religious exemption, but because of legal challenges, courts have temporarily barred employers from enforcing the mandate against people with a sincerely held religious belief against vaccination. During court arguments on Wednesday, the judges with the 2nd US circuit court of appeals in Manhattan did not appear to be particularly impressed by an argument by Cameron Lee Atkinson, an attorney with We The Patriots USA Inc, a group challenging the state mandate, that Hochul's comments about God were discouraging health care employers from granting religious exemptions. One of three judges on a panel said Atkinson's claim that Hochul is telling people "that God wants you to get the vaccine" was not the same as ordering employers to fire workers. Earlier this week, Hochul, who is Roman Catholic, told a gathering of people at the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn that God answered prayers and made scientists, doctors and researchers successfully develop the coronavirus vaccine. Those who are vaccinated are the "smart ones" she said, and added that "you know there's people out there who aren't listening to God and what God wants. You know who they are." Attorney Steven Wu, New York's deputy solicitor general, told the appeals court judges that the state is in "full compliance" with a temporary restraining order granted this month by US district judge David N Hurd that prevents disciplinary action against health care workers who have sought a religious exemption. Hurd is scheduled to rule by October 12 on a request for a more permanent order. The fact that Hurd's temporary order is already in place left the 2nd Circuit questioning on Wednesday whether it needed to take action at all. It made no immediate rulings. The state health department has set up an operations center to monitor health care staffing, and Hochul tweeted Wednesday that "zero health care facilities across the state have been reported closed." "Our 24/7 Operations Center is constantly monitoring developments and working with facilities to troubleshoot any issues," she tweeted. "We stand ready to take additional action as needed."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-governor-uses-god-unfairly-in-vaccine-fight-lawyer/articleshow/86630071.cms||---

The accused was arrested with his aide, an Afghan interpreter, late on Monday night. Both were brought to Noida on Wednesday and presented before a customs magistrate and sent to jail. According to officials, four Afghan nationals and an Uzbek woman were arrested last week from whom DRI got specific input that the head of the drug cartel in the country had escaped to Himachal Pradesh. “He came to India last year after the lockdown, while his Afghan interpreter aide has been staying in the country for nearly five years. During interrogation, the prime accused claimed to be a former member of an Afghan security enforcement agency and said he supervised the drug trade operations in the country and money transactions,” said the source. DRI sleuths said the accused was familiar with India as he had visited the country several times. “The four Afghan nationals arrested earlier from the national capital region were ‘drug mules’ who posed as street vendors selling dry fruits, but sold heroin in pubs, clubs and parties. One kg of heroine fetched up to Rs 7crore. The Uzbek woman was a dancer, who used her rich clients to sell drugs in parties and pubs,” the source said. The DRI also seized Rs 70crore worth heroin, cocaine and other contraband from the accused and booked him under NDPS Act. “Money earned from the trade was channelled back to the kingpin, a former dry fruit exporter in Afghanistan, through a hawala network. The money was directly and indirectly used to sabotage the sovereignty and security of India,” said sources. The consignment was imported from Iran’s Bandar Abbas Port by Aarshi Trading company based in Satyanarayanapuram on the outskirts of Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. The owners of the firm were arrested by the DRI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mundra-port-drug-haul-dri-nabs-head-of-afghan-cartel-in-country-from-shimla/articleshow/86629997.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Business||Piramal acquires DHFL for Rs 34,000 crore||MUMBAI: In the first insolvency resolution in the financial services space, Piramal Group has concluded payment of Rs 34,250 crore to take over Dewan Housing and Finance (DHFL). The deal is likely to help banks that had been hit by the company’s collapse. The payment will bolster the finances of banks that have written off loans to DHFL, whose promoters are accused of fraud. Overall, financial creditors will receive close to Rs 38,000 crore, including the liquid cash with DHFL and Rs 19,550 crore of bonds. The amount received by creditors will be around 46% of their admitted claims. SBI, Bank of India and Union Bank will be among the beneficiaries. Fixed Deposit holders will, however, get less as they had voted against the resolution plan, which entitles them only to liquidation value. As a result, they get only Rs 1,241 crore, or 23% of their admitted claims of about Rs 5,400 crore. Piramal Capital and Housing Finance (PCHFL) will merge with DHFL, and the merged entity will be renamed PCHFL. Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal said in the short-term the group would rebalance its loan book to 50-50 between retail and wholesale, but retail would be two-thirds of the book in the medium-term. Currently, it’s dominated by wholesale exposure. He said the company would offload the wholesale book of DHFL soon. When asked whether the group would continue to look at acquisitions, Piramal said post-integration, the company would have a debt-equity ratio of 3.5:1, giving enough headroom to acquire if an opportunity presented itself. With this deal, the Ajay Piramal-led group has made a decisive shift in focus to retail lending. The group had earlier brought in Jairam Sridharan, a senior executive from Axis Bank, to grow the retail portfolio. Piramal, who made his fortunes in pharma, changed focus to real estate and diversified into lending. Six years ago, the group had looked at IL&FS before the collapse of the infrastructure and finance group. Piramal Enterprises had also parallelly picked up a stake in Shriram Capital with an eye on synergies but chose to exit when things didn’t work out in 2019. Going forward, the group would evaluate the insurance business but had no plans to get into asset management, Piramal said. “The acquisition is in line with our road map to transform our financial services business over the last two years. We raised Rs 18,000 crore of equity and strengthened the balance sheet to take advantage of such large opportunities. We have significantly reduced debt-to-equity — creating headroom for significant growth in the merged entity,” said Piramal. “The combined entity will have 301 branches, 2,338 employees and over 1 million lifetime customers. We have built a technology platform with an advanced analytics engine and AI/ML capabilities, which can be deployed across a larger base of customers,” said Piramal Group executive director Anand Piramal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/piramal-acquires-dhfl-for-rs-34k-cr/articleshow/86630122.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden agenda at risk as Democrats squabble ahead of shutdown deadline||WASHINGTON: Divisions among congressional Democrats threatened to derail President Joe Biden's agenda on Wednesday, as moderates voiced anger at the idea of delaying a $1 trillion infrastructure bill ahead of a critical vote to avert a government shutdown. The White House said talks over twin bills revitalizing the nation's roads and airports, as well as addressing social spending and climate change, were at a "precarious" point as moderates and progressives disagreed over the scope of some $4 trillion in spending. Congress is due to vote on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early December before funding expires at midnight on Thursday. Thursday is also the previously agreed - and once delayed - day that the House of Representatives votes on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the Senate. Representative Stephanie Murphy, a moderate House Democrat who backs the infrastructure bill, warned against a failure of the bill on Thursday - or a delay. "If the vote were to fail tomorrow or be delayed, there would be a significant breach of trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the Biden agenda," she told reporters on Wednesday. But with House progressives warning they will vote against the $1 trillion bill until a deal is reached on a sweeping, multitrillion-dollar plan to boost social spending and address climate change, the vote was not guaranteed. "The only way the vote happens (Thursday) is if we have the votes to pass the bill," Representative Dan Kildee, House Democrats' chief deputy whip, told reporters. Biden canceled a trip to Chicago so he could lead negotiations with Congress. "We're obviously at a precarious and important time," , White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. A White House staffer met at the Capitol with moderate Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who has expressed deep concern over the size of Biden's plans and has the power to block them due to the Democrats' razor-thin majority in the Senate. If this latest resolution to fund the government passes the Senate, the House could vote quickly to send the measure to Biden to sign into law, averting a partial government shutdown in the midst of a national health crisis. Biden's Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers of Congress, campaigned on a platform of responsible government after Republican Donald Trump's turbulent four years in office. Republican Senator John Cornyn expressed optimism on Wednesday. "Democrats don't want to shut down the government. Republicans don't want to shut down the government. That will supply the result that we all expect, which is to keep the lights on," he told a news conference. Senate Democrats tried to both fund the government and head off a potentially catastrophic federal government default next month but were thwarted by Republicans who twice blocked attempts to raise the nation's $28.4 trillion debt ceiling. The government will hit the ceiling around October 18, an event that could cause a historic default with long-lasting economic fallout and implications for financial markets. The House and Senate may vote on a separate bill that temporarily lifts the debt limit, but that too is the subject of a bitter partisan fight. Senate Republicans refuse to vote for it, telling Democrats to act alone, while Senate Democratic leader Schumer has demanded bipartisan cooperation on a measure to address debts racked up during both Democratic and Republican administrations. Investment bank Goldman Sachs this month described the standoff as "the riskiest debt-limit deadline in a decade." DivisionsBiden also must negotiate a $3.5 trillion bill that aims to expand social programs and address climate change. Several senior Democrats have said that the "reconciliation" bill - so called because it is being drawn up under a budgetary procedure to avoid Senate rules requiring 60 votes out of 100 members for passage - will need to be scaled back to pass. Moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he believed it would take weeks to reach agreement on that plan. "(The) reconciliation (bill) is going to take a while; it's not going to be a week or two or three weeks. There's a lot," Manchin said. With Biden fully engaged with Sinema and Manchin, other Senate Democrats avoided criticizing them but showed no sign of relenting on their own demands. "We're going to work very hard to ensure that we have a robust climate program that is in the reconciliation bill," progressive Senator Ed Markey told reporters. "We're not going to be satisfied unless we get it, as I've said many times: no climate, no deal."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/joe-biden-agenda-at-risk-as-democrats-squabble-ahead-of-shutdown-deadline/articleshow/86630145.cms||---
---||India||6 firecracker giants face SC ire over chemicals use||NEW DELHI: Ahead of Diwali, six big firecracker manufacturers on Wednesday faced contempt ire from the Supreme Court, which asked them to explain why contempt of court proceedings be not initiated against them for using banned chemical barium and its salts in producing firecrackers, as was reported by the CBI. In October 2018, the SC had banned use of barium and its salts in the production of firecrackers across the country on a PIL filed in 2015 by few toddlers through their parents highlighting the hazardous impact on health and environment from the noxious fumes emitted by crackers burst during Diwali, which coincides with stubble burning by farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, both combining to envelop the national capital region with a deadly smog blanket. While the SC has achieved little in curbing the recurring annual phenomenon of stubble burning in the northern states, it has proactively banned bursting of crackers in National Capital Territory and restricting use of barium and its salts in manufacture of crackers and their sale across the country. On allegations of cracker manufacturers violating the SC orders, it had sought a CBI probe. The CBI's report, backed by chemical analysis of cracker samples by a government laboratory, has accused six big Sivakasi-based cracker manufacturers - Standard, Hindustan, Vinayaga, Shree Mariamman and Amorces Industries, Suryakala Fireworks, SeIva Vinayagar - of violating the SC orders by continuing to use barium and its salts in the cracker manufacturing and mislabelling them to hide correct chemical composition of crackers. A bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna put the six cracker makers on a seven day notice and asked them to show cause why proceedings be not initiated against them for violating the SC orders. It provided them with a copy of the CBI report and posted the matter for further hearing on October 6. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said the government and Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation have devised a safe formula for preparation of green crackers and that the court could look into that aspect. Focussed on punishing the manufacturers who have violated the SC orders, Justice Shah asked Bhati, "Why is the Ministry of Environment and Forest so anxious to get into that aspect. The moment we permit green crackers, all manufacturers will mechanically label their products as green crackers and the pollution levels will go up." Taken aback by the bench's outburst for pointing out about green cracker manufacturing formula developed by PESO after "a lot of research", Bhati apologised and said she would keep quiet till the court called upon her to respond on the issue. The bench said, "The impact of pollution caused by crackers is severe on children and those suffering from asthma. We know India celebrates many important festivals every month and people burst crackers as part of celebration. But, at the same time we have to consider the pollution caused by it." When a cracker manufacturers association through senior advocate Atmaram Nadkarni pointed out that stubble burning was more harmful to the environment and health of citizens, the bench cut short the debate by saying, "We are aware of it." The CBI in its report said, "During the enquiry, samples of finished firecrackers, semi-finished firecrackers and the raw materials were collected from the factory premises of manufacturers and also finished firecrackers were collected from the shops selling the firecrackers in Chennai. Out of the total samples collected, 104 representative samples related to manufacturers were subjected to chemical analysis to find out the presence of banned chemicals, namely Barium, Lithium, Arsenic, Antimony, Lead, Mercury and Strontium Chromate. The samples were sent to Tamil Nadu Forensic Science Department (TNFSD), Chennai for chemical analysis."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-firecracker-giants-face-sc-ire-over-chemicals-use/articleshow/86630144.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The genomic risk score, also called polygenic score, currently prescribed for high-risk individuals — with family history of heart diseases, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension or cholesterol levels — helps doctors assess risk, prevent or delay heart diseases, said senior cardiologist Dr S Ajit Mullasari at the Madras Medical Mission. Blood samples are sent to specialised labs for genetic screening. "Multiple studies have identified at least 50 gene variants that trigger heart diseases in people. When a sample is screened, the risk score is calculated based on the number of rouge variants and its combinations," he said. Until now, doctors diagnosed heart diseases through routine health checks or when they came into emergency rooms with symptoms. This makes true prevention almost impossible. "The genetic study helps us identify those at increased risk much earlier," Mullasari said. Doctors prescribe exercises, diet changes and preventive medications as a cost-effective way of preventing coronary heart disease in such people. "This is already being done on a large scale in several developed countries," he said. At an experimental level, scientists have shown in animal models that modifying or knocking off the genes can offer cure to heart diseases such as hyper obstructive cardiomyopathy. In 2020, Dr Mullasari and cardiologists from six institutes across India worked with expert teams from the US and the UK to study the risk score. "Scientists concluded that the genetic risk score for coronary artery diseases in South Asians enables striking stratification of disease risk in middle-age," concluded Minxian Wang from the Cardiovascular Disease Initiative, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. During the study, blood samples of nearly 3,000 people, including 1,800 cardiac patients from across the country, were screened. Similar studies done in the UK showed that the polygenic risk score was 1.6 times higher in Indians living in the UK compared to Caucasians. "Our study reconfirmed this. The risk in some groups of Indians went up to nearly 2.4 times compared to their Western counterparts," Dr Mullasari said. Coronary artery diseases are among the leading causes of death across the world as well as India. Several studies have also shown that Indians acquire the disease at a much younger age. For instance, the mean average age for Indians getting heart disease is 54 compared to 64 among Caucasians. Also, the risk of getting a heart disease is up to 21% among Indians aged 45 years compared to 5 to 7% among Caucasians.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8k-genetic-testing-can-assess-heart-disease-risk/articleshow/86630191.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||World||Afghan collapse rooted in 2020 deal with Taliban: US General||WASHINGTON: Senior Pentagon officials said Wednesday the collapse of the Afghan government and its security forces in August could be traced to a 2020 US agreement with the Taliban that promised a complete US troop withdrawal. General Frank McKenzie, the head of Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that once the US troop presence was pushed below 2,500 as part of President Joe Biden's decision in April to complete a total withdrawal by September, the unraveling of the US-backed Afghan government accelerated. "The signing of the Doha agreement had a really pernicious effect on the government of Afghanistan and on its military - psychological more than anything else, but we set a date-certain for when we were going to leave and when they could expect all assistance to end," McKenzie said. He was referring to a February 29, 2020, agreement that the Trump administration signed with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, in which the US promised to fully withdraw its troops by May 2021 and the Taliban committed to several conditions, including stopping attacks on American and coalition forces. The stated objective was to promote a peace negotiation between the Taliban and the Afghan government, but that diplomatic effort never gained traction before Biden took office in January. McKenzie said he also had believed "for quite a while" that if the United States reduced the number of its military advisers in Afghanistan below 2,500, the Kabul government inevitably would collapse "and that the military would follow." He said in addition to the morale-depleting effects of the Doha agreement, the troop reduction ordered by Biden in April was "the other nail in the coffin" for the 20-year war effort because it blinded the US military to conditions inside the Afghan army, "because our advisers were no longer down there with those units." Defence secretary Lloyd Austin, testifying alongside McKenzie, said he agreed with McKenzie's analysis. He added that the Doha agreement also committed the United States to ending airstrikes against the Taliban, "so the Taliban got stronger, they increased their offensive operations against the Afghan security forces, and the Afghans were losing a lot of people on a weekly basis." Wednesday's hearing was politically charged, with Republicans seeking to cast Biden as wrongheaded on Afghanistan, and Democrats pointing to what they called ill-advised decisions during the Trump years. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had said a day earlier in a similar hearing in the Senate that the war in Afghanistan was a "strategic failure," and he repeated that on Wednesday. Milley told the Senate committee, when pressed Tuesday, that it had been his personal opinion that at least 2,500 US troops were needed to guard against a collapse of the Kabul government and a return to Taliban rule. Defying US intelligence assessments, the Afghan government and its US-trained army collapsed in mid-August, allowing the Taliban, which had ruled the country from 1996 to 2001, to capture Kabul with what Milley described as a couple of hundred men on motorcycles, without a shot being fired. That triggered a frantic US effort to evacuate American civilians, Afghan allies and others from Kabul airport. This week's House and Senate hearings marked the start of what is likely to be an extended congressional review of the US failures in Afghanistan, after years of limited congressional oversight of the war and the hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars it consumed. "The Republicans' sudden interest in Afghanistan is plain old politics," said Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, who supported Biden's decision to end US involvement there. Tuesday's hearing also was contentious at times, as Republicans sought to portray Biden as having ignored advice from military officers and mischaracterized the military options he was presented last spring and summer. In a blunt assessment of a war that cost 2,461 American lives, Milley said the result was years in the making. "Outcomes in a war like this, an outcome that is a strategic failure - the enemy is in charge in Kabul, there's no way else to describe that - that is a cumulative effect of 20 years," he said Tuesday, adding that lessons need to be learned, including whether the US military made the Afghans overly dependent on American technology in a mistaken effort to make the Afghan army look like the American army. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas asked Milley why he did not choose to resign after his advice was rejected. Milley, who was appointed to his position as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by President Donald Trump and retained by Biden, said it was his responsibility to provide the commander in chief with his best advice. "The President doesn't have to agree with that advice," Milley said. "He doesn't have to make those decisions just because we are generals. And it would be an incredible act of political defiance for a commissioned officer to resign just because my advice was not taken." Milley cited "a very real possibility" that al-Qaida or the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate could reconstitute in Afghanistan under Taliban rule and present a terrorist threat to the United States in the next 12 to 36 months.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/afghan-collapse-rooted-in-2020-deal-with-taliban-us-general/articleshow/86630218.cms||---

---||India||Chronic mudslingers can't escape contempt through apology: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday warned that chronic mudslingers taking potshots at the judiciary and judges cannot escape the rigour of punishment under the contempt of court law by tendering an apology, which is not borne out of remorse but is an attempt to save their skin when caught in an inescapable situation. Making an example of Rajiv Dahiya, who heads NGO Suraz India Trust, a bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and M M Sundresh said, “The raison d’etre of contempt jurisdiction is to maintain the dignity of the institution of judicial forums. It is not a vindictive exercise nor are inappropriate statements by themselves capable of lowering the dignity of a Judge. These are often ignored but where despite all latitude a perennial litigant seeks to justify his existence by throwing mud at all and sundry, the Court has to step in.” The SC said its power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power, which cannot be abridged or taken away even by legislative enactment. “We have little doubt that what the contemnor has been endeavouring is to have his way or, alternatively, I will throw mud at all and sundry, whether it be the court, its administrative staff or the state government so that people, apprehensive of this mud thrown, may back off. We refuse to back off and are clear in our view that we must take it to its logical conclusion,” Justices Kaul and Sundresh said. A chronic PIL litigant, Dahiya was in 2017 barred from filing PIL in the SC and asked to pay a cost of Rs 25 lakh for wasting judicial time. He did not deposit the cost and continued making disparaging remarks against sitting SC judges through letters addressed from the CJI to the President. When the court caught him and his slandering activities, he sought recusal of Justice Kaul who refused. Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Kaul said, “After all, there cannot be a birthright to file PILs... Let us say at the inception that the easier path is to recuse or give up the matter instead of inviting so much trouble. But then that is not the course for which the Judges have taken oath.” “Sometimes the task is unenviable and difficult but it must be performed for the larger good of the institution. Such litigants cannot be permitted to have their way only because they can plead and write anything they feel like and keep on approbating by sometimes apologising and then again bringing forth those allegations. We have thus chosen the more difficult path,” he said. The bench said despite the SC’s repeated warnings, Dahiya had refused to mend his ways and the advice had fallen on deaf ears. “There is no absolute licence when appearing in person to indulge in making aspersions as a tendency to scandalise the court in relation to judicial matters. Motivated and calculated attempts to bring down the image of the judiciary in the estimation of the public and impair the administration of justice must bester themselves to uphold their dignity and the majesty of law,” it said. “In the current context if seen, the grievance arises on account of the inability of the contemnor to file public interest petitions on account of costs being imposed, which he claims to be unable to pay and the consequences thereof of not being able to prosecute his petitions, which are large in number. The contemnor has apparently made a profession of filing public interest petitions of subjects of which he may not know much and then seeking to scandalise the Court to grant him relief failing which he will continue to scandalise the court,” it said. “We are of the view that the contemnor is clearly guilty of contempt of this court. His actions to scandalise the court cannot be countenanced. He continues with his contumacious behaviour. The apologies submitted by him are only endeavours to get out of the consequences again followed by another set of allegations, thus, a charade. The last apology can hardly be called an apology seeing the contents. This court has held that an apology cannot be a defence, a justification can be accepted if it can be ignored without compromising the dignity of the court," the bench said convicting him for contempt of court and gave him time to argue on the question — what should be the appropriate sentence that could be imposed on him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/chronic-mudslingers-cant-escape-contempt-through-apology-sc/articleshow/86630286.cms||---
---||India||Amarinder meets Shah, stokes buzz of move ahead of Punjab polls||NEW DELHI: Former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday called on Union home minister Amit Shah at the latter’s residence here. The two leaders had a meeting of over 50 minutes, boosting speculation about the Congress leader either joining BJP or allying with it for the Punjab polls. Though there was no clarity about his future plans, Singh tweeted, "Met Union Home Minister Amit Shah ji in Delhi. Discussed the prolonged farmers’ agitation against farm laws & urged him to resolve the crisis urgently with repeal of the laws and guarantee of MSP, besides supporting Punjab in crop diversification." Singh used #NoFarmersNoFood in his tweet, extending support to the farmers opposing the three farm laws — something which was interpreted as an attempt to tamp down speculation and which also underlined the gulf between the two sides over an issue which is central to Punjab politics. Read AlsoSwitchover buzz as Captain Amarinder Singh in Delhi to meet ‘friends’Former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh arrived in Delhi on Tuesday amidst an intense buzz over a meeting with the BJP brass that might be a precursor to an alliance, even as his visit was termed as a personal one to meet “friends”. BJP sources hinted at a “strong possibility” of the veteranMany quarters wondered whether Amarinder had offered to play the facilitator for a fresh dialogue between the Centre and the farmers and to get both sides to relent from their positions. If successful, the fence-mending move will, besides thawing the Centre’s fight with farmers, possibly boost the former CM’s standing with the protesters. As soon as Singh left Chandigarh for the national capital on Tuesday, there was a strong buzz about the possibility of his meeting with Shah and other senior BJP functionaries, including party president JP Nadda, and also about the possibility of him joining the saffron party or forming an alliance with BJP after he formally breaks away from Congress to launch his own platform. The attempt to play down the importance of the meeting notwithstanding, Amarinder choosing to meet the home minister at a time when his party is in the throes of a crisis in Punjab indicated that tensions between him and the Gandhis may have reached the point of no return. Singh, who was forced to resign as CM, has accused the Congress leadership of humiliating him and termed Rahul and Priyanka as "inexperienced". There was speculation about Singh possibly meeting PM Modi and BJP chief J P Nadda. However, BJP sources discounted the likelihood of the PM meeting the former CM until the two sides have worked out a broad understanding. BJP sources said that by meeting Shah at the time of tumult in Congress and when BJP is hardly the favourite formation for the formidable farm lobby, the former Punjab CM has already dropped a strong hint of his willingness to explore the possibility of joining hands. They also said things did not have to be rushed as assembly polls will be due early next year along with four other states. "Singh has given signals and has left no scope for any confusion…One can say that he has shut the possibility of patching up with the Congress high command," a senior leader said. While the government has rejected outright the agitating farmers’ demand of repealing the three farm laws, it has maintained that MSP will be continued and it has been revised upwards to underwrite its assurance. However, farmers are pressing for a statutory guarantee for protection of the MSP regime, which, if done, could be a game-changer not only in Punjab but across the country including UP, where polls will be due along with Punjab next year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amarinder-meets-shah-stokes-buzz-of-move-ahead-of-punjab-polls/articleshow/86630343.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh

It was disposing a batch of petitions filed by the biological mother and foster parents of a toddler. “Breastfeeding needs to be recognised as an inalienable right of a lactating mother. Similarly, the right of the suckling infant for being breastfed too has to be assimilated with the mother’s right. Arguably, it is a case of concurrent rights; this important attribute of motherhood is protected under the umbrella of fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is unfortunate that this pretty child for no fault remained unbreastfed, its lactating mother having had no access to it till now. In a civilised society, such things should never happen,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed in his order. While a Bengaluru resident had sought custody of her rescued baby boy, the foster parents from Koppal had sought directions to permit them to retain the child. The couple had also challenged the notice issued to them by the Child Welfare Committee. The child was born in a maternity home in Bengaluru in May 2020 but was stolen from the cradle by a psychiatrist who later allegedly gave it away to the Koppal couple by claiming it was their child born out of surrogacy. The psychiatrist had taken money from the couple. Police caught the kidnapper and traced the child to the couple’s home in Koppal town in May. The judge rejected the contention of the foster mother’s counsel that his client should be permitted to retain custody of the child consistent with what Devaki Maa allegedly did to Yashoda Maa, as mentioned in Bhagavata, the revered Hindu purana espousing devotion to Lord Krishna. “It is bit difficult to countenance; no authoritative text of the episode is produced to show there was any dispute of the kind between these two women of grace from the era long gone by,” The judge observed. The judge dismissed the contention of the foster mother that his client does not have any children whereas the genetic mother had two and therefore, the custody should be allowed to continue. “Children are not chattel for being apportioned between their genetic mother and a stranger on the basis of their numerical abundance. The principle of distributive justice which intends to bridge the gap between ‘haves and have nots’ is not invocable, at least in this case. It is a matter of common knowledge consistent without experience that a genetic mother treats all her children as being an integral part of her body and soul, regardless of what the children do to her,” the judge observed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/breastfeeding-is-mothers-right-says-hc/articleshow/86630558.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: No hike in engineering fee; miscellaneous capped at Rs 20k||BENGALURU: In a big relief for students, the Karnataka government has ruled out revision of fee for engineering courses in private colleges in Karnataka and fixed a cap of Rs 20,000 for collecting ‘miscellaneous and skill fees’ for the upcoming academic year. As per the agreement struck between the government and private colleges on Wednesday, students who secure admission to private engineering colleges under the government quota this year will continue to pay in two different slabs — Rs 65,340 and Rs 58,806. From this year, students must pay admission fee, miscellaneous fee and skill fee at the Karnataka Examinations Authority office or its website and not at colleges. Now, colleges should provide info to KEA  Private colleges had made a case for 30% hike in fees and a committee headed by Visvesvaraya Technological University vice-chancellor Karisiddappa had favoured 15%-25% increase. However, representatives of private colleges decided not to revise the fees this year due to Covid-19. The decision to cap other fees at Rs 20,000 was taken as per recommendations of the Karisiddappa committee. Earlier, colleges would collect Rs 10,000 to Rs 70,000 in the name of ‘miscellaneous fees’. Now, they should state the purpose for which the fee is being collected and this information should be provided to KEA, department of technical education and VTU, besides publishing it on their website. “This fee, too, should be paid at KEA,” said higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan. The minister gave the example of ‘skill fees’ that was variously charged by colleges to provide ‘additional skill training’ to increase the employability of students. “We now have three slabs for this fee: Rs 10,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000. A VTU team will inspect colleges and fix the slab depending on quality and facilities provided during training,” he added. Manjunatha Bhandari, chairperson, technical committee, Karnataka Unaided Private Engineering Colleges’ Association, said: “We didn’t want to insist on fee revision this year due to Covid. But we have requested the government to hike fees next year at least by 25% for these reasons: Administrative costs go up by 10-15%; AICTE mandates 3% annual revision in basic pay scale; 8% inflation; and 45% of seats go at subsidised rate.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/no-hike-in-engg-fee-misc-capped-at-20k/articleshow/86632530.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: No hike in engineering fee; miscellaneous capped at Rs 20k||BENGALURU: In a big relief for students, the Karnataka government has ruled out revision of fee for engineering courses in private colleges in Karnataka and fixed a cap of Rs 20,000 for collecting ‘miscellaneous and skill fees’ for the upcoming academic year. As per the agreement struck between the government and private colleges on Wednesday, students who secure admission to private engineering colleges under the government quota this year will continue to pay in two different slabs — Rs 65,340 and Rs 58,806. From this year, students must pay admission fee, miscellaneous fee and skill fee at the Karnataka Examinations Authority office or its website and not at colleges. Now, colleges should provide info to KEA  Private colleges had made a case for 30% hike in fees and a committee headed by Visvesvaraya Technological University vice-chancellor Karisiddappa had favoured 15%-25% increase. However, representatives of private colleges decided not to revise the fees this year due to Covid-19. The decision to cap other fees at Rs 20,000 was taken as per recommendations of the Karisiddappa committee. Earlier, colleges would collect Rs 10,000 to Rs 70,000 in the name of ‘miscellaneous fees’. Now, they should state the purpose for which the fee is being collected and this information should be provided to KEA, department of technical education and VTU, besides publishing it on their website. “This fee, too, should be paid at KEA,” said higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan. The minister gave the example of ‘skill fees’ that was variously charged by colleges to provide ‘additional skill training’ to increase the employability of students. “We now have three slabs for this fee: Rs 10,000, Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC upholds boy’s anointment as Shiroor mutt seer||BENGALURU: There is no legal or constitutional bar on giving sanyasa deeksha to persons below the age of 18 years, the Karnataka high court observed on Wednesday, dismissing a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the anointing of a 16-year-old boy as pontiff of Shiroor Mutt. A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma said children of tender age are made monks in other religions like Buddhism, and there is no statutory bar — much less a constitutional bar — on persons below the age of 18 years being initiated into sanyasa. Shiroor Mutt is one of the eight mutts in Udupi. PL Acharya and others, who claimed to be mutt devotees, had sought for action under the provisions of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act against the anointment of 16-year-old Aniruddha Saralathaya, now christened Vedavardhana Teertha, as peetadhipathi of the Shiroor Mutt. The bench said the religious texts quoted by amicus curiae, senior advocate SS Naganand, make it clear that religion permits a person to become a sanyasi before he attains the age of 18 years and added that Sode Mutt, which, as Dwandwa mutt (pairing mutt of Shiroor Mutt), had chosen and anointed Aniruddha, was well within its right as it was a practice being followed for the past 800 years and was indicative of the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya. Citing the judgment of Madhya Pradesh high court in Adarsh Seva Marg Trust case pertaining to rituals of Jainism, the bench noted that in the said case it has been clearly held that high courts are not theological wizards and they, as constitutional courts, cannot transgress by interfering with essential religious practices, which are certainly not opposed to public order, morality, public health or any fundamental right. Observing that courts cannot be expected to overwrite religious texts and so long as no violation has been shown and interfere with religious practices, the bench said the petitioners had failed to point out any violation of statutory or constitutional provisions. The petitioners asserted that the boy is not capable of exercising free consent and is not competent to contract in terms of section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Sode Mutt, which had chosen the successor to Shiroor Mutt as a Dwandwa mutt, claimed Acharya is a blood brother of the erstwhile peetadhipathi of Shiroor Mutt and other petitioners are his close relatives and they had a vested interest in the matter. The court was told that apart from filing PIL, the petitioners had initiated civil and criminal proceedings in the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/hc-upholds-boys-anointment-as-shiroor-mutt-seer/articleshow/86630561.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||India||Loyalists target Sibal, G-23, accuse them of betrayal||The turmoil in Punjab Congress and the G-23 offensive against the leadership has triggered a bitter war of words, with Congress leaders slamming Kapil Sibal and some others for raising concerns about “instability in Punjab”. Former MP and Delhi leader Ajay Maken said, “Sonia Gandhi had ensured that Sibal became a minister at the Centre despite not having an organisational background. Everyone in the party is being heard. Want to tell Sibal and others that they shouldn’t degrade the organization that gave them an identity.” Congress workers, holding placards saying “get well soon”, protested outside Sibal’s residence, accusing him of betraying the party. Youth Congress president B V Srinivas accused the G-23 of deserting the party in times of struggle while enjoying benefits during its good days. He tweeted, “Hear ‘Ji-Huzoor’: The ‘President’ and ‘Leadership’ of the party are the same, Who always took you to Parliament, Made you a ‘minister’ during the good times of the party. When in opposition, you were sent to Rajya Sabha, Always rewarded with responsibilities in good and bad times. And when the ‘time’ came for the struggle, then...” Sibal, in turn, noted that they were not a “ji huzoor” group and were seeking answers to relevant queries. In a jibe at G-23, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel tagged a clip from the movie ‘Gandhi’ and tweeted: “The ‘suit-boot’ club, whether in the government or in the organisation, proves to be neither good for the public nor for the party. This message of Gandhiji should be heard. Today Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi are raising the voice of the farms and barns and the poor, this is the Congress.” However, fingers were also pointed inwards. Congress MP Manish Tewari said the turmoil in Punjab could give Pakistan a handle to fish in troubled waters, stressing that it is a border state which is already protesting against the farm laws. “Punjab is already witnessing anger against the farm laws, and in these circumstances, the present politics in the state can have serious security implications,” he said. Tiwari said that during the days of militancy, Punjab had lost around 25,000 people and there are apprehensions that the ‘deep state’ in Pakistan may again try to destabilise things. Tiwari also said that the change of leadership that resulted in the ouster of Amarinder Singh was not handled properly. Meanwhile, apparently unperturbed by the turmoil in Congress, Rahul Gandhi said in Kerala, “My problem with the Prime Minister is that he is breaking relationships between Indian people. If he’s breaking relationships between people of India, he’s attacking the idea of India. That is why I oppose him.” Congress sits on Kerala veteran’s resignationThe Congress brass hasn’t accepted Kerala veteran VM Sudheeran’s resignation from and efforts are on to persuade him to stay back, the party said on Wednesday. Congress’s Kerala minder Tariq Anwar said the AICC was aware of “serious differences of opinion” within the state unit and would do whatever it takes to bridge the divide through discussions. Sources said the high command was concerned about the old guard not supporting those entrusted with the responsibility of bringing about a change in the party.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/loyalists-target-sibal-g-23-accuse-them-of-betrayal/articleshow/86630723.cms||---

ADG (headquarters), Jitendra Singh Gangwar, has already instructed the officials concerned to beef up security in all the courts. He told TOI on Wednesday, “The security measures will be reviewed and enhanced accordingly.” The Bihar State Bar Council has also urged chief minister, Nitish Kumar, and Patna HC’s Chief Justice, Sanjay Karol, to ensure the safety of lawyers and judicial officers and provision of better infrastructure. Meanwhile, security arrangements have been tightened at the Patna HC after the shootout. Passes with photographs are being issued to the lawyers and the identity of the visitors is being verified by the security personnel. Closed-circuit television cameras, door frame metal detectors, boom barriers, and sensors have already been installed on the premises of the HC. On the other hand, a three-member committee, consisting of DSP-rank officers, has been formed by Bhojpur SP, Vinay Tiwari, to review the security arrangements at the Ara civil court which has witnessed two bomb blast incidents in the past. “A security audit is being conducted and its report will be submitted soon. Meanwhile, we have sent a proposal regarding issuance of identity cards to all the advocates, installation of door frame metal detectors, and deployment of commandos to the district judge,” the SP said. Saran SP, Santosh Kumar, pointed out that the SDPO and the SHO concerned had been instructed to undertake a security review of the Chhapra civil court daily. “We will rope in more security personnel after the panchayat polls end,” he added. A review of security at the Motihari civil court has also been conducted by a committee. “Door frame and hand-held metal detectors are being used at the court’s entrance,” the SP of East Champaran, Naveen Chandra Jha, said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/adg-review-beef-up-security-measures-in-courts-across-state/articleshow/86622900.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The present public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by one Ajay Kumar Mishra, seeking a direction for enquiry into the alleged financial irregularities committed by the office of the respondent, Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA), which was earlier known as Allahabad Development Authority (ADA). The PIL was based on the audit report. However, additional advocate general (AAG), Manish Goyal, submitted before the court that all the audit objections were considered and sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Dismissing the PIL, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Vivek Agarwal observed, “The audit report does not show any financial irregularity requiring investigation and for that the criminal proceedings be initiated. In view of the above, we do not find any ground to issue direction for registration of the case for proceedings under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) only on the basis of audit report. The writ petition accordingly fails and is dismissed.” The court gave this decision on September 24.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/hc-dismisses-pil-againstpda-financial-aspects/articleshow/86622482.cms||---

The four-member team will focus on covering all angles of the case including the statements of the complainant as well as the accused. When asked why SIT was formed when the crime branch was already investigating the case under the supervision of additional commissioner Chirag Koradiya, Singh said, “We want to cover every aspect of the case. The SIT will guide and supervise the investigations that are being conducted by the crime branch police inspector.” The team consists of ACP (traffic) Amita Vanani, ACP (crime), D S Chauhan, ACP (cybercrime) Hardik Makadia and crime branch police inspector, V R Khair. “We have included a woman officer as this is a case of rape and cybercrime ACP has been kept in the team as there are a lot of digital evidences,” Singh told TOI. Meanwhile, 56-year-old accused Raju Bhatt was arrested formally on Wednesday after he tested negative for Covid-19. The police said that Bhatt broke into tears when he was confronted with his photographs with the girl. “Bhatt kept saying that his relationship with the girl was consensual. She had asked for his help in her academics then why did he keep visiting her flat? His intentions were not good and we have photographic evidence too,” said a police official. ACP (crime) D S Chauhan said, “The girl said that she met Bhatt during discussion of a multi-crore deal. But Bhatt denies being part of any such deal. The entire scenario will be clear once we nab chartered accountant Ashok Jain who is still on the run.” On September 19, the girl studying in a private university had accused Jain, who runs a CA firm, of molesting her by spiking her drink at a guest house. She said that Jain also came to her flat and raped her later. She had alleged that Bhatt also raped her and threatened her with dire consequences.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/4-member-sit-to-supervise-probe/articleshow/86623832.cms||---

According to the Hindu lunar calendar, the three-day festival begins on the seventh day of Krishna-Paksha in Ashwin month and continues till the ninth day. “Jitiya vrat, which is popular in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh, is quite strict. On Day 1 (‘Nahai Khay’) mothers make food with ghee and pink salt and consume it only after taking a bath. They observe ‘nirjala vrat’ (fast without water) on the second day and break the fast on the last day (‘Parana’) by eating delicacies like ‘noni ka saag’ and ‘madua ki roti’,” Om Prakash Pathak, a priest, told this newspaper on Wednesday. Sunita Sinha, a resident of New Patliputra Colony, said, “I have been celebrating Jitiya for years for the well-being of my kids.” Echoing similar views, another devotee, Parvati Devi, said, “Although it is tough, I observe Jitiya vrat every year for my children.” A Bailey Road resident, Kiran Sinha, thanked her children for their support. “Since they are always there for me, I do not face any difficulty during the vrat,” she claimed. Two youths, Gaurangani and Mohit Raj, whose mothers celebrate Jitiya, said, “The festival makes us feel special because our mothers observe a strict fast.

To figure out where you have permission to fly your drone and what paperwork is needed to fly it in certain areas, check out the airspace map released by the Centre. The map, which clearly marks the areas where drones cannot be flown, will be helpful to companies and professionals who use the aerial vehicles for several purposes. In Ahmedabad, no-fly zones comprise regions around the airport, ISRO, army cantonment, central government scientific and testing centres. A defined perimeter for these zones have been pictorially depicted on a map on the directorate general of civil aviation’s (DGCA) digital sky platform. “If one wants to fly drones for parcel deliveries and collect spectral terrain data, this map will be useful. If one wants to fly drones in restricted red zones, permissions from the union home department and in certain cases Indian Air Force (IAF) and DGCA will be required,” claims a state home department official. The interactive map on the platform also shows yellow and green zones across major cities and the state. Green zone is the airspace up to 400 feet that has not been designated as a red or yellow zone, and up to 200 feet above the area located between 8 km and 12 km from the perimeter of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel airport. The map also shows a yellow zone which is the airspace above 400 feet within a designated green zone, and above 200 feet in the area located between 8 km and12 km from the perimeter of the SVP airport. The same rule also applies to area located between 5 km and 8 km from the perimeter of an airport. The yellow zone has been reduced from 45 km earlier to 12 km from the airport’s perimeter. Red zone is the ‘no-drone zone’ within which drones can be operated only after a permission from the central government agencies like the Indian Navy, DGCA, Indian Air Force (IAF).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/have-a-drone-keep-it-away-from-these-zones/articleshow/86625114.cms||---

Tejashwi, in his letter, stated that Bihar faces flood and drought every year, leading to loss of human life as well as wealth. Reminding the CM of river linking projects announced in 2011, which were supposed to link Bagmati and Budhi Gandak, Budhi Gandak and Ganga and Kosi-Bagmati-Ganga, Tejashwi said the Centre in 2019 had given clearance to linking of only Kosi and Mechi rivers. “But unfortunately, even this project has not been implemented yet,” he added. The RJD leader demanded that construction of canals and dams should be announced as national projects so that the limited resources of the state could be used in other developmental works. Taking a jibe at the Centre and the state government, Tejashwi said people of Bihar were still suffering despite the double-engine government. “They have 39 out of 40 MPs from Bihar. But forget special status to the state, even a special package has not been given to Bihar. In the past four years, Bihar has not got even proper funds for relief measures against floods, while states with lesser population and damages got more financial aid from the Centre. There is a need to think about it,” Tejashwi wrote. This is for the second time in recent past that Tejashwi has urged CM Nitish to meet PM Modi. In August, Nitish had led an all-party delegation to meet the PM with the demand for countrywide caste census.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/tejashwi-urges-nitish-to-meet-pm-on-flood-issue/articleshow/86623136.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Delhi||South Delhi civic body to roll back property tax to 2019 level||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to roll back the hike in property tax — twice or thrice in some cases — in eight prominent categories to the 2019 level. The tax was hiked last year following the recommendations of the third municipal valuation committee. The beneficiaries include entertainment and recreational clubs, rented non-residential properties, telecom towers, vacant business or commercial plots, educational institutions, guesthouses, banquets etc and in all categories, some factor use values have been reduced. The decision will impact the civic body’s revenue collection by Rs 80-90 crore, said an official of SDMC, in which the civic elections are due in a few months. The tax is basically a certain percentage of the annual value of a property. The annual value is determined on the basis of six factors — age, unit area, structure, occupancy, area and use factor. In the valuation committee report, major changes were proposed in occupancy, unit area and use factor of properties, while age and structure factors remained unchanged. For example, for non-residential rented properties, the occupancy factor was made “two” instead of the existing “one”. “After the proposal is approved by the SDMC House, the occupancy factor will be made ‘one’ again. For industrial properties lying vacant, the use factor will be reduced from ‘three’ to ‘two’,” said a senior official. After approving the rollback in the standing committee meeting on Tuesday, chairman Colonel (retd) B K Oberoi said the decision sought to help traders in reviving their business that had declined during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The proposal will be implemented on the ground after getting the House’s approval. After that, the tax slab rates of 2019 will be applicable,” he said. For banquet halls, the use factor will be reduced from the existing ‘five’ to ‘four’, and for guesthouses, it will become ‘two’ from ‘three’. For telecom towers, the use factor will be ‘two’ instead of ‘four’. Likewise, for entertainment and recreational clubs such as swimming pools, cinema halls and malls, the use factor will be reduced from ‘four’ to ‘three’. “The recommendations were implemented from April 2020, and now the rollback will reduce the revenue collection by Rs 80-90 crore. In SDMC areas, there are about 9,000 commercial properties that have been rented out. So we were anticipating good revenue generation,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/south-corpn-to-roll-back-property-tax-to-2019-level/articleshow/86624910.cms||Vibha Sharma

The civil surgeon of Patna, Dr Vibha Kumari, told this reporter that the number was likely to increase as the private hospitals were yet to send the dengue-related data. “We have circulated a message to all the private hospitals asking them to keep us updated,” she added. According to sources, altogether four patients, including two children, suffering from dengue were admitted to the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) on Wednesday. The hospital’s superintendent, Dr Binod Kumar Singh, said, “Quite a few people with symptoms of dengue consulted our doctors. While four were admitted here, others were given medicines for proper treatment.” Dr Binod also claimed that the cases of pneumonia had declined. On the contrary, no dengue patient was admitted to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Wednesday. “Of the 80 samples, which got tested for dengue at the hospital on Wednesday, seven were positive. While six cases were from other districts, one was from Patna,” said Dr Singh, the head of the microbiology department at the PMCH. He added, “Of the 500 samples, which were tested by the department in the last two months, 57 were positive.” Besides, four new dengue patients were also admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) on Wednesday. Admitting a considerable rise in dengue cases, Dr Ravi Kirti, who is the head of the medicine department at the hospital, said, “At least three to four dengue patients with symptoms like high fever, headache, vomiting, and diarrhoea are consulting the doctors of the AIIMS-P every week.” The doctor advised people to keep their surroundings clean and prevent mosquito breeding.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/number-of-dengue-patients-in-hospitals-crosses-50-mark/articleshow/86621094.cms||VK Tripathi

The move has brought much-needed relief to passengers as it is expected to reduce travel time. Since the past five months, MSRTC buses were not allowed to take the Karnataka route. The longer route had resulted in increased travel time and cost for passengers. Gadhinglaj depot manager Sanjay Chavan said, “The buses travelling to Gadhinglaj, Ajara, Chandgad and into Konkan from Kolhapur have started plying now. As the buses do not stop in Karnataka, passengers from Nipani, Sankeshwar and other villages from Karnataka border will suffer until normal routine is restored.” Rahul Tilganji, a banker from Gadhinglaj, said, “Every day, I would travel to Kolhapur city for my work, and as buses used to take a longer route, a lot of time was getting wasted.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/ktaka-allows-entry-to-msrtc-buses/articleshow/86619745.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The funding round was led by Singapore-based impact investing fund ABC World Asia, and also saw existing investors Coatue, Tiger Global, GGV Capital, Westbridge, among others. The startup, which offers individual and group classes across K-12 and test preparation segments, was valued at a post-money valuation of around $600 million in funding round last year. The company has reached the unicorn status amid speculations that it was in talks with edtech leader Byju’s for a sale, a claim that was strongly denied by Vedantu. Vedantu co-founder Vamsi Krishna denied any discussions with Byju’s for a sale and said that the founding team’s long journey in the education and technology space was an indication of the impact they wished to create as a company. “We have been capital efficient and our annualised revenue run rate is at around $65 million — up almost 3x from last year,” Krishna said. The company intends to use the funds to innovate further on the live teaching format and penetrate deeper in the K-12 segment by reaching more students. It is bullish on international opportunities and is also likely to explore a B2B vertical to engage more deeply with schools as the education sector undergoes massive digitisation. It will also strengthen product engineering functions. Vedantu says it was the first company to offer live online classes as early as 2014 and counts various first-time innovations to its name including its proprietary live teaching platform Wave and the 2-teacher model. Vedantu offers tutoring courses to K-12 students as well as preparation of competitive exams such as IIT-JEE, NEET, commerce, CBSE and ICSE. Each month, over 35 million users access Vedantu through its app and web for free. Its YouTube channel gets 65 million views. Students also access Vedantu through its dedicated Channels on Airtel TV and TATA Sky. Vedantu claims to have catered to over 2 lakh paying students last year — a 300% growth over the previous year.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vedantu-raises-100-mn/articleshow/86625973.cms||---

Major stretches of road, which were resurfaced ahead of municipal polls in February and a few months after the polls, are turning into rubble. These stretches are between 370m to 800m long. According to the west zone office of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), these roads were to last till November 2023. On Tuesday the engineering department in its report to the standing committee had claimed that AMC’s capital expenditure for construction of road, street and footpath had remained below 82% against the budget estimates. This year, the AMC has sanctioned budget to lay 225km of roads. Patheya budget centre, an organization that studies municipal budgets extensively, in its recent report counters that the civic body always has unspent amount from funds allocated for roads each year. “In 2016-17, an amount of Rs 112.32 crore for capital expenditure for road, streets and footpaths remained unspent. This year’s expenditure on roads was just 41.88% of the budget,” said the report. It added, “In 2017-18, the capital expenditure was 65.69% but the unspent capital budget was Rs 56.51 crore. In 2018-19, the unspent budget was Rs 87.52 crore and in 2019-20, the unspent budget was Rs. 75.39 crore.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/resurfaced-for-civic-polls-ranip-roads-turn-to-rubble/articleshow/86624924.cms||---

In Bharuch, a woman died when the wall of a house collapsed in heavy rain at Kasad village. The deceased was identified as Radha Vitthal Vasava, a native of Angareshwar village. She lived at the place with her son-in-law.  In Surat, discharge of 2.06 lakh cusecs from Ukai reservoir continued for nearly 24 hours since Tuesday night due to heavy rain in the catchment area of the dam under the impact of Cyclone Gulab. All beaches were ordered to remain closed for two days till Friday considering the cyclonic conditions. Surat's Dumas, Suvali, Dandi, Dabhari, Valsad's Tithal and Navsari's Dandi and Ubhrat were closed for tourists. The water level in Ukai dam on Wednesday evening was 341.61 foot against the rule level of 345 ft which is also the full reservoir level (FRL). In case of additional discharge, water will enter in city or rural areas. Two flood gates opening in Tapi river at Hanuman Tekri of Jahangirpura area and Dhastipura near Mughlisara were closed by the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to prevent the water entering in the city's storm water channels. As a result, there was flooding in Mora Bhagal and SMC had to deploy dewatering pumps. Total 46 people living at various locations on the bank of river Tapi were shifted to shelter by SMC. Boats were kept ready at Mithi creek in Limbayat, Pandesara and Udhna area and leaves of all SMC employees have been cancelled.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/surat/threat-of-flood-looms-in-surat-areas/articleshow/86624389.cms||---

The bank’s ‘Deep Geo’ initiative, which focused on servicing over 80 lakh customers in semi-urban and rural regions across 2,065 branches during the pandemic, saw good results prompting the private lender to bet big on the segment. This segment saw an annualised loan growth of 18%, while contributing to 25% of incremental retail disbursements. The rural deposits also grew at 19% over the previous year. Sharda started his financial services career with Citibank, where he worked across geographies and businesses in asset and credit. In his eight-year term with Future Generali, he spearheaded its transformation to move up the league tables. “‘Bharat’ is the big opportunity of this decade as the farm sector reforms, infrastructure investments and digital inclusion story plays out in our tier-3 towns and rural India. We are ready to lead in this space and are now creating a separate growth-focused ‘Bharat Bank’ to increase our presence manifold over the next 3 years”, said Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank. “We welcome Munish to Axis Bank and are excited to have him lead our focus on Bharat,” he added Meanwhile, Rajesh Dahiya, executive director (corporate centre) has sought early retirement from the services of the bank, to pursue personal and professional interests outside his executive corporate career.

Prakash also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of being least concerned about the national security or future of youths. “It is unfortunate that they have not given any statement. I am also concerned for the officer who seized the drugs,” he said. Referring to actress Rhea Chakorborty’s case, Prakash said the Enforcement Directorate, Narcotics Control Bureau and CBI were roped in for two packets of drugs, but no one has been arrested for carrying 3000kg of drugs at Mundra port. Though the Adani Group had clarified that it only operated the port and has no authority to check shipments arriving there, Prakash alleged that the Adani’s association with the PM and BJP was a reason for giving him a free hand. Prakash, who is one of the Congress panel members to study the three controversial farm laws, also demanded their rollback. The BJP, however, rubbished the allegations made by Prakash and said it was because of government’s alertness that the consignment was seized. “The government is seriously tackling such issues and any one involved in it will be punished,” said BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/cong-hits-out-at-centre-over-seizure-of-heroin/articleshow/86623009.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Kolkata||Chronic spots flood, but most of Kolkata stays above water||KOLKATA: After last Monday, when large parts of the city were inundated and the waterlogging persisted in some localities for days, there was visible relief among citizens as Kolkata was largely spared inundation on Wednesday. Other than the chronic problem in the Behala-Kidderpore belt, the only other zones that were waterlogged were Golf Gardens and neighbourhoods along the east of EM Bypass that had remained waterlogged for four-five days last week. Waterlogging in Mukundapur and Golf Gardens on WednesdayWhile the usual problem areas, like Muktarambabu Street, Thanthania, Amherst Street, Surya Sen Street and Camac Street, were waterlogged during a sharp spell of rain early in the morning, the water cleared out by afternoon. “Usually, there is knee-deep water when there is heavy rain. But on Wednesday, the waterlogging was only shin-deep. Since there was only a light drizzle for the rest of the day, the water cleared out fairly quickly,” said Abhimanyu Agarwal, who lives near Ram Mandir on Central Avenue. In the rest of the city, too, the waterlogging cleared out by forenoon in some places and afternoon in others as the light drizzle was well within the city’s drainage infrastructure capacity. The city’s storm water channels are capable of clearing 10mm in an hour. In areas where the drainage upgrade project under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) has been implemented, the capacity has increased to 15mm-20mm per hour. KMC’s drainage department and conservancy staff had worked overtime ahead of the cyclone and heavy rainfall warning and that was evident from the clear gully pits that helped water recede fast. In most places, pits clogged by plastic polybags were the primary cause of waterlogging if the rain is not beyond 10mm per hour. In some pockets though, there was no relief from misery. At Golf Gardens, the water on Prince Gholam Mohammad Shah Road was knee-deep. The inundation in internal lanes was higher by late morning. However, the level began to recede in the afternoon after pumps were deployed to flush out the water. “We were really concerned in the morning, but after the pumps began to operate, there was hope,” said Golf Green Citizens’ Association president Shovban Datta. Though a drainage infrastructure augmentation project has been done in the area, the outlet has not been completed yet, which is causing the problem. Parts of Mukundapur, particularly the roads in front of AMRI and Medica, went under water again, causing problems for hospital staff, patients and their relatives. “We don’t know when there will be some relief for us,” said a doctor. In Nayabad, too, there was shin-deep water with the level rising to knee-deep in some places. This forced the power utility to switch off electricity to the area in order to prevent electrocution accidents. “We are praying that it does not rain much and that the water clears out by Thursday,” said brand consultant Amit Banerjee. “These areas will only get relief when a drainage upgrade project is carried out. Though work has been sanctioned under Kolkata Environment and Infrastructure Improvement Project (KEIIP) funded by the Asian Development Bank, work is yet to begin,” said a civic official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/chronic-spots-flood-but-most-of-kolkata-stays-above-water/articleshow/86624792.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Ahmedabad||NRI deposits up across Gujarat as funds flow for Covid care||AHMEDABAD: Non-resident Indians (NRIs) seem to have remitted hefty amounts from overseas to secure their families in India from Covid-19 uncertainties during the second wave of the pandemic. NRI deposits with banks across Gujarat swelled by Rs 5,950 crore at Rs 81,070 crore in April-June quarter of 2021-22 as compared to Rs 75,120 crore during the corresponding period of the last fiscal, shows the latest data compiled by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC). This is the highest NRI deposit surge witnessed during the first quarters of the past four financial years. “After the lockdown, international flights did not immediately resume. Several NRIs were stranded in Gujarat for want of air connectivity and due to other Covid-19 related restrictions,” said an SLBC source. “Faced with a lot of uncertainty, many NRIs deposited a significant chunk of money to meet expenditures of their family members in India,” the source added. Banking sector sources have also attributed the rise to the contingency funds deposited by NRIs into their local accounts. “With the second wave of Covid-19 infections hitting India, including Gujarat, people living abroad had deposited money into local bank branches as an emergency saving to be able to help their family and loved ones with a contingency fund,” said a well-placed source in a public-sector bank. Besides fresh remittances, bankers also said that depositors have earned interest income too. “NRI depositors have earned interest on past deposits at the rate of at least 5% or more. This is also the reason for the overall surge in NRI deposits,” said MM Bansal, convener, SLBC – Gujarat. It may be noted that NRI deposits had eroded during the April-June quarter of the last fiscal. These deposits, however, gradually increased during the subsequent quarters. Meanwhile, overall bank deposits in the state also grew 12.5% at Rs 8.84 lakh crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/nri-deposits-up-as-funds-flow-for-covid-care/articleshow/86624839.cms||Niyati Parikh

At least four people have died in rain-related incidents — an elderly couple in Olpad taluka of Surat, a woman in Bharuch and a college girl in Chhota Udepur — since Tuesday night. Manorama Mohanty, head of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gujarat, told TOI that a well-marked low-pressure area lying over south Gujarat and adjoining Gulf of Khambhat will move northeast and intensify into a depression by Thursday morning. “Due to the system, Gujarat state is likely to experience an active wet spell during the next 3 days,” said Mohanty. Widespread rainfall was reported in Rajkot, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Gir-Somnath and Jamnagar districts of Saurashtra as well as Valsad, Dang, Surat and Bharuch. Saurashtra has already borne the brunt of cyclone Tauktae in May which resulted in massive devastation, and recently floods in Jamnagar district too. Alert has been sounded in hundreds of villages as most dams were overflowing, forcing the authorities to open the gates. In Bhavnagar, 350 people were shifted to safer locations as all 50 gates of Saurashtra's largest dam Shetrunji in the district, were opened. Eight NDRF teams were kept on a standby as several villages were inaccessible to the continuous rainfall that began on Tuesday midnight. An ayurvedic hospital in Gariyadhar town of Bhavnagar was heavily flooded, forcing the administration to shift around 25 people. Most areas of Rajkot city and district were in knee-deep waters due to continuous downpour and the overflowing Aji and Bhadar dams. Threat of low-lying areas in Surat getting flooded loomed large as nearly two lakh cusec water was released from Ukai Dam due to heavy rain in the upstream areas. All major beaches in Surat district have been closed for public till October 1. In Central Gujarat districts of Vadodara and Anand, nearly 120 villages were alerted following forecast of heavy rain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/low-pressure-triggers-high-alert-in-gujarat/articleshow/86624931.cms||---

Deedarganj police station SHO Chetnanand Jha said unidentified bike-borne criminals shot dead small-time garment trader Dinesh Kumar Thakur, 30, near his residence at village Kothiya under Fatuha subdivision. “He was returning home on his bike when the criminals shot him dead between 9pm and 10pm. The reason behind the incident could not be ascertained,” he said. Fatuha SDPO Rajesh Kumar Manjhi said Dinesh was shot in his head from a close range. “He was rushed to a private hospital by the family members but could not survive,” Manjhi said. He said the criminals escaped in the cover of darkness. “A few villagers heard a loud bang which they initially assumed to be of a tire explosion,” the SDPO said and added that the murder might be a fallout of some personal enmity or financial dispute. In the second incident, former Bara PACS chairman’s son Nirbhay Singh (25) was shot dead near his residence at Bara village under Masaurhi subdivision at around 10pm on Tuesday. Bhagwanganj SHO Satyendra Kumar said Golu Kumar (32) and his brother Gunjan Kumar (24) are prime accused in the case. Nirbhay was killed in a war of supremacy. “On Monday evening, Nirbhay had thrashed Golu, who had lodged a police complaint on Tuesday evening. A police team was sent to Bara to look for Nribhay, but could not find him,” the SHO said. Kumar said on Tuesday night, Golu and Gunjan saw Nirbhay standing near his home and shot him dead. “He was shot twice in the back and once in his head. Both siblings are now evading arrest,” he said. The SHO said looking at their criminal background, police had sent a CCA proposal against Gunjan and Nirbhay’s brother ‘Fighter’ ahead of the panchayat election scheduled there on November 3.

Invesco, which has its registered office in Houston, Texas, US, and OFI Global are shareholders of Zee Entertainment representing almost 18% paid-up share capital of the company with voting rights, making it Zee’s largest shareholder. They said that the EGM has not been called for despite a valid requisition by them on September 11. They are seeking to invoke the powers of the NCLT under the Companies Act to convene an EGM of the shareholders of Zee. The requisition by the two shareholders sought also the appointment of six independent directors on the Zee board. A Zee spokesperson said, “The board of the company remains committed to act within the framework of law and is focused towards enhancing the company’s growth and shareholder value. It is in the process of taking the required steps within the statutory period. The company does not wish to comment on any impulsive or premature steps taken by Invesco Developing Markets Funds and OFI Global China Fund, LLC.” On September 13, Zee Entertainment had disclosed to the stock exchanges that it had received the resignation of two non-independent directors — Manish Chokhani and Ashok Kurien. Pointing this out, the application before NCLT added that there has since been a “stoic silence” on their requisition. On September 22, Zee announced approval and execution of a non-binding term sheet with Sony Pictures (Sony India) for a potential merger. Non-calling of an EGM constitutes an “oppressive act” and is “gross mismanagement” of the company’s affairs, the application said. It added that the decision on future governance and board composition of the company rests with its shareholders and not its board. The applicants said they apprehend that, before the EGM, as requisitions, Zee may take various steps to render the process infructuous, adding that there is a large body of public shareholders of the company and public interest involved.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/invesco-moves-nclt-after-zee-doesnt-heed-egm-call/articleshow/86629162.cms||Swati Deshpande

The markets regulator has also asked the two — Ramit Chaudhri of Infosys and Keyur Maniar of Wipro — to disgorge illegal gains of about Rs 2.6 crore made during July 2020. A detailed investigation is ongoing, Sebi said in the report. Sebi’s investigations showed Chaudhri, who was in the Infosys team that worked on the Vanguard deal, told Maniar about the expected deal win. The latter took position in Infosys contracts in the F&O segment just days before the final announcement on July 14, 2020. Maniar started trading positions in Infosys contracts on July 8 and, within 10 days, made a profit of Rs 2.6 crore. This was possible since Infosys’s stock price gained over 6% on news of its Vanguard deal win. Sebi’s whole-time member Madhabi Puri Buch headed the investigation. The probe found that Chaudhri had worked in Wipro and that’s how he knew Maniar. The call records of the two also showed that on July 8, they had a long conversation, and within seven minutes after this call ended, Maniar put his first trade in Infosys contracts. It also found that he started squaring off his positions from July 15, the day after the Vanguard deal was announced. Chaudhri and Maniar “are restrained from buying, selling or dealing in securities, either directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever until further orders”, Sebi noted in the report. It also ordered freezing of bank accounts of Chaudhri and Maniar to the extent of about Rs 2.6 crore. The two have also been directed “to open an escrow account with a scheduled bank, jointly and severally and deposit the…proceeds generated from the prima facie insider trading”. Sebi also gave the two people 21 days to present their side of the case to the investigators.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-bans-2-at-wipro-infy-for-insider-trading/articleshow/86629636.cms||---

They also urged the high court to shift the fertilizers production unit, which uses the selected items from the garbage, to some other location. The petitioners are residents of Macchuatoli, Arya Kumar road, Amruddi Gali mohalla, Anup Nagar, Kazipur, DN Das Lane and Abulas Lane under Kadamkuan police station area. They are being represented by counsel Ajit Kumar. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar took up the PIL for hearing on Monday and sought replies from the urban development and housing department, Patna Municipal Corporation and Bihar State Pollution Control Board within three weeks’ time about possible solution to the problem being faced by the residents. Prasoon Sinha appeared for the corporation while Parijat Saurav represented the board. The matter would be heard again on November 15. As per the PIL, garbage is dumped on a plot of land which was earlier used by the residents for morning and evening walk. It also had Bankipore circle municipal office and a middle school. However, the office shifted more than two decades ago. The residents had urged the authorities to convert the plot into a children’s park, but the government decided to construct a mall, which was never completed and, instead, became a place for antisocial elements and later made a garbage transfer centre.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/residents-urge-hc-to-shift-garbage-transfer-centre/articleshow/86622359.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This is InnoVen’s maiden fund as the firm did not operate in a fund format before. While the fund is stage and sector agnostic, the primary focus will be on sectors such as consumer internet, B2B commerce, enterprise software, fintech, healthtech and logistics. “India is now home to 50+ unicorns and the third-largest venture ecosystem globally. Over the years, we have been fortunate to partner with some of the best founders and start-ups, including 17 that have achieved a unicorn status.

The party leadership is keenly pursuing its bid to forge a pre-poll alliance with the BJP to achieve the target, JD(U) parliamentary board chairman and former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha said on Wednesday. “Our target in UP is to win at least 13 assembly seats for gaining recognition as a registered political party there. How many seats we will actually contest in UP will be decided after the pre-poll alliance with the BJP is formed,” Kushwaha told a section of the media. He also said the states with lesser number of assembly constituencies will require lesser number of seats to be won to help the JD(U) gain national recognition. He added that Union minister R C P Singh had been asked to hold talks on the pre-poll alliance with the BJP in UP. While the JD(U) contested the 2017 assembly elections in UP on its own, its vote count was not to the desired level. Given the backdrop, the JD(U) leadership has decided to first form the pre-poll alliance with the BJP and then go for the bargaining of seats it would like to contest in UP. Asked if the pre-poll alliance did not materialize, Kushwaha said, “In that case, we will contest the UP assembly elections alone.” As to the impact of former JNUSU president and CPI national executive member Kanhaiya Kumar’s joining the Congress, Kushwaha said it would have no impact on any political party in the state. “The RJD has its own support base. The Congress with Kanhaiya will not cause desertion of supporters from the RJD,” Kushwaha said, adding: “There will be no impact on the JD(U).” Kushwaha also said the Congress was “burdened with its own inner contradictions” and, accordingly, no one would be able to save it from its further disintegration, even if Kanhaiya has claimed that to “save the country, it is necessary to save the Congress.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/jdu-eyes-victory-on-13-up-assembly-seats/articleshow/86623218.cms||Abhay Singh

It added that this has no connection with Saudi Aramco’s plans to buy a stake in its oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business. The statement came after California State Teachers’ Retirement Fund, one of the world’s largest institutional investors, decided to vote against the appointment of Al-Rumayyan. Last week, the fund decided to vote against the appointment based on a recommendation by proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which said Al-Rumayyan has a key role in Saudi Aramco as its chairman and in the Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its governor and hence he does not qualify to be an independent director of RIL. Indian rules mandate that an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the person or his company. With PIF already having an equity interest in RIL’s retail and telecom arms and Saudi Aramco planning to buy a stake in the O2C business, Al-Rumayyan’s ‘independence’ on the Indian company’s board is under question, Glass Lewis said. The industry has widely seen Al-Rumayyan’s induction to the RIL board as part of a process to formalise a transaction to sell 20% in the company’s O2C business for $15 billion. RIL announced Al-Rumayyan’s appointment as an additional director, designated as an independent director, at the company’s shareholder meet in June this year. The appointment took effect from July 19 this year and is for a term of three years. However, the voting process on the appointment will end on October 19. RIL, in its filings with stock exchanges, said that Al-Rumayyan satisfies the regulatory criteria laid down for the appointment of an independent director and that his appointment has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco. It said further that the O2C business is being spun off into a subsidiary and, according to the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. “The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,” it said. Al-Rumayyan’s appointment will help strengthen the board’s diversity and skillsets and benefit RIL through the transition from oil to chemicals and the aim to achieve net carbon zero by 2035, it said. RIL added that any material change in circumstances at any time, which may affect the status of a member of the board as an independent director, is reviewed and appropriately acted upon by the human resources nomination and remuneration committee. Further, “it is a practice in RIL that any director who is deemed interested recuses himself/herself from participating in the relevant agenda item”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ril-backs-aramcos-chairman-as-independent-director/articleshow/86629000.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The country’s largest private bank said that it is targeting to issue five lakh credit cards every month to regain the ground it had lost during an eight-month ban. The private lender also announced the launch of three new cards, including one that was targeted at young adults without much credit history. The three new launches are HDFC Bank’s Millennia, MoneyBack+ and Freedom cards. HDFC Bank’s group head (payments & consumer finance, digital banking & IT) Parag Rao said that the growth in digital payments reflected the extent of under-penetration of credit cards in India, which was a “fantastic opportunity”. “We expect the number of credit cards in India to soon cross 10 crores,” he said. The new launches come ahead of the festive season when both e-commerce companies and payment networks launch schemes targeted at a larger share of the customer’s wallet. Rao said that HDFC Bank would launch its festive scheme soon. SBI Card too has announced its festive offer Dumdaar Dus starting October 3, where it will offer 10% cashback for online shopping on multiple domestic e-commerce sites. The offer will not be applicable on online spending in some categories such as insurance, travel, e-wallet, jewellery, education, healthcare and utility merchants. HDFC Bank has over 1.5 crore credit cards outstanding in a market of 6.3 crore cards. Rao said that the bank had a strategy of issuing over 75% of its credit cards to customers who already have an account with it. While the Freedom card is designed for new users, the MoneyBack+ credit card will be targeted at middle-class families who are seeking value on their everyday spending. For affluent, tech-savvy consumers, the bank has launched the Millennia card.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hdfc-bank-adds-4l-credit-cards-since-ban-lifted/articleshow/86629596.cms||---

The framework was designed by the RBI to prevent banks with weak financials from increasing their risk exposure until they got their finances back in shape. The RBI said that the board for financial supervision has reviewed the performance of the bank and, according to the results for the year ended March 2021, the lender was not in breach of the PCA parameters. “The bank has provided a written commitment that it would comply with the norms of minimum regulatory capital, net NPA (non-performing assets) and leverage ratio on an ongoing basis and has apprised the RBI of the structural and systemic improvements that it has put in place which would help the bank in continuing to meet these commitments,” the central bank said. With IOB out of the PCA framework, the Central Bank of India is the only public sector lender that continues to face restrictions. The PCA framework prevents a bank from extending large loans. It also does not allow banks to make certain investments and requires the lender to conserve capital. For the quarter ended June 2021, IOB had reported net NPAs of 3.15% and a total capital adequacy ratio of 15.48% of which common equity tier-1 was 12.96%. The bank had reported a net profit of Rs 327 crore for the Q1FY22. While announcing the results for FY21 in June, the bank’s MD & CEO Partha Pratim Sengupta had said that the bank has not heard anything from the government on the bank being a candidate for privatisation.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iob-exits-corrective-action-rules/articleshow/86629449.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: TTD warns legal action against fake tour operators||TIRUPATI: Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) chief vigilance and security officer (CVSO) Gopinath Jatti warned middlemen and tour operators to not misuse Srivani donation linked VIP break darshan tickets by bundling them into attractive Balaji Darshan tour packages. The TTD launched Srivani trust donation linked VIP break darshan in 2019. Under this scheme, TTD provides one VIP break darshan to every devotee who donates Rs 10,000 and pays an additional Rs 500 towards the darshan ticket. The Srivani donation linked VIP break darshan tickets are issued under both current booking and online modes. The temple body has not fixed any limit on the maximum number of VIP break darshan tickets to be issued under this scheme. But as the TTD continues to impose limits on the maximum number of darshan tickets that can be issued under the slotted Sarva darshan and Rs 300 special entry darshan categories, the demand for Srivani donation linked VIP break darshan has seen a steep rise. Some middlemen and tour operators have cashed in on this demand and added Srivani donation linked VIP break darshan tickets to Balaji Darshan tour packages. In one such case that drew the TTD’s attention, one Vasavi Yatra and Tours launched a chartered helicopter package tour to Tirupati that included VIP break darshan at the Lord Balaji temple at Tirumala and Sri Padmavathi Ammavari temple at Tiruchanoor, along with five-star hotel accommodation and free local travel. Each ticket under this package, which was made available to devotees from Bengaluru, Chennai and Coimbatore, was priced at Rs 1,11,116. After the agency’s promotional leaflets circulated online went viral on social media, the TTD’s vigilance and security wing swung into the action and initiated legal proceedings against the tour operator, identified as B Shiva Kumar. Meanwhile, Gopinath Jatti made it clear that the temple body issues VIP break darshan tickets only to protocol VIPs and those referred by them. In addition, the TTD issues VIP break darshan directly to donor devotees who extend donations to the Srivani trust. The temple has not earmarked any quota for state-run tourism corporations or private tour operators. “We appeal to devotees to beware of middlemen. Devotees should inform the TTD if they are approached by middlemen with such fake Tirupati darshan linked tour packages,” appealed CVSO.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ttd-warns-legal-action-against-fake-tour-operators/articleshow/86624446.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The new system has been tested successfully and the trial run is going on. Airport officials said that it would be operational once the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) approves it. It was found that the airport has no provision of the SAPL system for runway 09 during the audit conducted by the office of the DGCA. Following which, the airport authorities sought temporary exemption till September 15 to establish the system and necessary administrative approval was accorded by the competent authorities of AAI, airport officials said. As a part of its compliance with the mandatory procedures, AAI conducted safety assessment for design and execution in accordance with the laid down procedures. Necessary DGCA approval was obtained on May 19 to execute the project. The work on installing the path lights were completed on September 16 at a cost of Rs 61 lakh, airport authorities said. SAPL fittings have been installed on the extended runway centre line for a distance of 420 meters from the threshold, and 60-meter longitudinal intervals selected for centre line lights. A crossbar of 30m width is considered for installation at 300m away from the runway threshold. The total length of the runway is 2,424 metres. Airport director S Dharmaraj said that from the runway threshold, every 60 meters, one fitting is installed. A total of 420 meters of runway path has been covered with simple approach path lightings. Two more fittings have been installed outside the boundary wall, protected with fencing. fittings are also installed outside of the airport and opposite the runway, he said. “The work is over and the trial run continues, and we have to get feedback from the pilots. Only after getting DGCA approval, the entire facility would be commissioned,” the airport director told TOI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/sapl-system-to-improve-safety-while-landing-at-trichy-airport/articleshow/86629691.cms||---

Troll pages and communities on Facebook that have been suffering from scarcity of ‘eligible’ topics have become hyper-active as the photos and videos of several actors and top cops, who were reportedly made fool by Mavunkal with his fake antiques, surfaced online. “He has Tipu Sultan’s throne with him. But the truth is all except Tipu have sat upon that throne,” said one of the trolls about Mavunkal’s claim that he has the royal throne used by the Tiger of Mysore, among his antique collections. Memes have taken new wings of creativity as users are assuming all possible fake antiques Mavunkal could have made. For example, one of the trolls shows comic character Luttappi from Balarama in the guise of Bhageerathan Pillai (Jagathy Sreekumar) from movie Meesa Madhavan sighing after ensuring that Mavunkal had not stolen his spear. The handmade lamp of Prophet Mohammed, one of the thirty pieces of silver Judas got as reward for betraying Jesus, a spare Sudarshana Chakra of Lord Vishnu, the nail used to crucify Jesus, the methiyadi Vamana used before sending Mahabali to the Pathalam, the axe used by Parasurama while creating Kerala, etc, are some among the things the users have ‘added’ to Monson’s collection. Trolls are being made on all the fake antiques claimed to have been owned by Mavunkal and viewers are sharing it across, with witty comments by users who take the fun further with their own imagination and creativity. A photo in which Mavunkal was seen showing an album to former state police chief Loknath Behera and ADGP Manoj Abraham features the caption ‘The Wedding Album of Shiva and Parvathy’. The users through their comments have criticised the top cops for allegedly falling prey to the fraudster. A video by Youtuber Sreekanth Vettiyar, known for his sarcastic posts, portrays himself as Mavunkal who is busily showing his antiques to visitors and when the police comes to arrest him Mavunkal (Sreekanth) is seen offering them a handcuff used by Jambavan in Ramayana.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/monsons-antics-spark-a-meme-fest/articleshow/86627449.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), housing finance disbursals stood at Rs 5,576 crore in the first quarter of 2021-22, up 142% against Rs 2,298 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21, albeit on a low-base effect due to the lockdown imposed in most part of the first quarter last year. According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), housing finance disbursals stood at Rs 2,856 crore in the first quarter of 2021-22, up 128% against Rs 1,252 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21, albeit on a low-base effect due to the lockdown imposed in most part of the first quarter last year. The 170th SLBC meeting was virtually held on Tuesday. Bankers attribute the reason to an increase in demand for new homes in the post pandemic period. “The demand for new homes and sales have improved over a period of time. The significant surge is due to a low-base effect because last year, due to the lockdown, disbursals took a hit. While fresh uptakes slowed as people were in wait and watch mode due to the lockdown and pandemic-induced uncertainty,” said a top source in the SLBC. “Disbursal of loans takes place as and when construction progresses. Since construction work for residential projects had come to a halt because of the lockdown, disbursals had slowed. However, this time, the demand has picked up and launching of new projects too,” said the source. Real estate industry players also said that the demand for new homes increased in the past year. “Housing sales in the first six months of 2021 surged 67% to 4,208 units from 2,520 units in same period last year,” suggest industry estimates. Ahmedabad witnessed a rise of 137% to 6,226 units in the first half of 2021, as compared to 2,627 units in H1 2020.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/housing-loan-payouts-jump-142-in-q1/articleshow/86625074.cms||Niyati Parikh

Wide spread irregularities have been detected in the revenue collection in zonal offices and few officials have been suspended. The BJP members demanded a discussion on the corruption in the council meeting which was rejected by Mayor Arya Rajendran. It led to a huge hue and cry between the members. Amidst of this the mayor suspended BJP councillor V G Girikumar for allegedly attempting to manhandle deputy mayor P K Raju during the protests in the well of the council hall. Earlier, BJP councillor M R Gopan had demanded discussion on the recent cases of alleged corruption in the corporation zonal offices. He said the corporation should open a help desk for the public to check whether they have lost any money due to fund misappropriation by officials in the zonal offices. However, the mayor said that it was the corporation administration wing that had unearthed the corruption of the officials in zonal offices and hence there was no need for any discussion on this. She said it was due to the effective administrative mechanism that the matter was uncovered. The mayor said the corruption was first reported in the Sreekaryam zonal office following which the local fund audit director was requested to conduct an inspection in all the zonal offices. Following the inquiry, two officials were suspended from the Sreekaryam zonal office and the superintendent and the cashier from the Nemom zonal office. In addition to this an office attendant from the Attipra zonal office has also been suspended. The reports from four more zones are expected soon, after which more actions against the people involved in this will follow. A police case also has been registered over fund misappropriation, the mayor explained in the council meeting. But the BJP members were not happy with the explanation given and started shouting slogans against the mayor for denying the permission for a discussion on this. The members raised placards and banners accusing the ruling LDF members for supporting corruption. This led to several heated exchanges between the ruling and opposition party members. In the melee Girikumar and deputy mayor had some heated arguments following which the BJP member was suspended. However, Girikumar refused to leave the council hall despite repeated reminders from the mayor. The mayor had to rush through the proceedings and the agenda items were passed without any discussion.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/ruckus-in-corp-council-meeting-over-revenue-issue/articleshow/86624981.cms||---

Tiwari has alleged that the project was awarded for Rs 1,256 crore against an estimated amount of Rs 1,216 crore in a single day without obtaining the sanction for them from Delhi government. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey directed the in-charge/director of ACB to file the status report on October 9. In the complaint, Tiwari has alleged that there was a “big fraud/commission of offence in the award of public works department tender” for the setting up of seven temporary hospitals in Shalimar Bagh, Kirari, Sultanpuri, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, GTB Hospital Complex, Sarita Vihar and Raghubir Nagar while giving undue favour to a company. The court noted that the complainant had requested to conduct inquiries regarding the role and involvement of Jain, the PWD minister of Delhi government; Shashikant, PWD engineer-in-chief; and Sanjeev Rastogi, chief engineer of PWD; while awarding the tender to the company for setting up the temporary hospitals. “The complainant alleged that while increasing the justified cost of three cases, the market rate was ignored and no negotiations were conducted with the first lowest… in all the three cases,” the court said in the order. “It is also alleged that all three tenders were awarded to… on the date of retirement of Shashikant and, at that time, the project was not formally sanctioned by Government of National Capital Territory, Delhi as per law,” the court added. The judge further said it was alleged that the bidding capacity of the company was not checked before awarding the work of a huge amount. “It is alleged that officials conspired with each other and awarded tender to… with vested interest, which requires inquiry to ascertain their role and involvement,” he noted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/court-seeks-acb-report-on-tiwaris-charge-of-fraud-in-awarding-pwd-tender/articleshow/86624979.cms||Usha Das

Last year’s inundation of Warangal city is a classic example of this,” a bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice T Vinod Kumar said. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by K Anju Kumar Reddy of Nirmal questioning official inaction despite widespread encroachment of the full tank level (FTL) and buffer-zones of various lakes in Nirmal. The HC said that it was high time that revenue authorities kept a record of lake bed areas in the prohibited land registers at the sub-registrar offices instead of laying stress on keeping private plots in such registers. Reminding the collector that an electric substation too has come up within the FTL of a lake, the bench said, “If the state itself sets up such facilities, then common people would tend to think that it was legal to occupy lake beds.” The bench pointed out the danger of keeping water and electric power together, and said that authorities should act immediately on noticing encroachments and not wait for decades to act. Upon an earlier direction from the court, Nirmal collector Musharraf Faruqui had filed an affidavit on the efforts of the district administration to survey and fence the 12 lakes. “We found encroachments in 8 lakes and tanks. They were both community encroachments and individual encroachments. Community halls, temples, slaughterhouses, etc were built within the FTL of some lakes. We are in the process of removing the illegal structures. We had even removed several unauthorized layouts in the buffer zones,” the collector said. Recording the presence of the district collector before the court, the bench said that the court was not interested in summoning officers and they would rather have bureaucrats in the field doing their job. The bench adjourned the case to October 25.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/govt-must-save-lakes-or-nature-will-hit-back-hc/articleshow/86624973.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Ahmedabad||Education loan disbursals drop by 67% across banks in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: With travel restrictions still in place and a growing number of universities offering only online education, fewer students are now opting to study abroad as compared to the pre-pandemic times. Uptakes for education loans across banks in Gujarat have remained low since the pandemic broke out. The latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) states that education loan disbursals in Gujarat stood at Rs 158 crore in the first quarter of 2021-22. Even though the disbursals surged 11.2% against Rs 142 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2020-21 — during which a nationwide lockdown was announced — it remained significantly low against the pre-pandemic times. According to the SLBC data, education loan disbursals in the June quarter of 2019-20 stood at Rs 490 crore. This means in the same quarter of the current financial year, the disbursals have declined 67.7% over a two-year period. “A large chunk of education loan disbursals comes from students going to pursue higher education abroad,” said a well-placed source in the SLBC. “However, because of Covid-19, the number of students opting for foreign studies declined drastically due to restrictions in various countries.” The source added: “Moreover, unavailability of direct flights was also a reason why many students deferred foreign education plans, which dented loan uptakes.” According to bankers, the severe second wave was one of the key deterrents for those planning to study abroad. As compared to last year, the trend of students going abroad has improved. However, it is not as buoyant as in the pre-pandemic period. “We expect normalcy in another year’s time, by next year’s fall season. This year, more students opted for studies in the US and even in countries such as Australia and Canada, which have opened up for foreign students,” said Hitesh Devaliya, the director of a training institute in Ahmedabad. “As direct flights resume and the Covid-19 situation improves and norms are eased by more countries, uptakes for studying abroad will certainly go up.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/education-loan-disbursals-drop-by-67/articleshow/86625065.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath opens Britannia unit, launches Rs 1,000-crore projects in 2 Uttar Pradesh districts||LUCKNOW: Inaugurating the Rs 340-crore Britannia Industries plant in Barabanki and launching a slew of development projects of nearly Rs 1,000crore in the twin districts of Sitapur and Barabanki on Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath appealed to people to return BJP to power in 2022 while he vowed to complete his development mission in the remaining six months. Britannia Industries manufacturing biscuits and bakery items would provide direct and indirect employment to over 1,000 people and source raw material from local farmers, he said. In what was clearly an election speech, the CM said BJP ensured security and respect of all sections of people. Hitting out at BSP and SP, he said, the two governments would have failed to control Covid-19 pandemic, which his government has “almost managed to eradicate” with the Centre, state and public representatives walking with people at every step. In Sitapur, the chief minister spoke about his government’s social welfare schemes and compared his governance with that of BSP and SP, saying “before 2017, ration meant for poor was either digested by the elephant which had a huge belly or was slyly sent to people in Saifai.” With few months left for the 2022 polls, the CM has embarked on a spree of project inaugurations with development and unshackling Hindus from curbs clamped by previous regimes being cornerstones of his address. In Barabanki, he said, if earlier governments could develop Sufi shrine Dewa Sharif, then Mahadeva Temple too would be developed. “With the pandemic under control, we can now celebrate our festivals. The government will support you in this. Earlier, kanwariyas were not allowed to visit the Mahadev Temple. In case they played DJ songs, they were lathicharged. Even immersion of idols was not peaceful and Janmashtami celebrations were stalled. Today, our government has given safe passage to kanwar yatris and allowed DJs,” he said. In Sadar, he said, “If you had chosen a BJP MLA, the area would have developed like other assembly constituencies which voted for BJP.” Reiterating that BSP and SP had no interest in development, Yogi Adityanath highlighted his government’s achievement in providing power, gas cylinders, ensuring law and order in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. “We have come to Barabanki with projects related to roads, hospitals, rural development, urban development, education, health, tourism and employment generation. In providing facilities and in ensuring crackdown against criminals, our government has not looked at caste, community, language or religion. Previous governments lacked vision and will,” he said. In Sitapur, Yogi Adityanath promised safety, respect and self-reliance. “Sitapur is home to Naimish Dham and the district was first among beneficiaries of government schemes. In the four-and-a-half years, he said, 2.25 lakh families got own homes and nearly 5lakh were given free LPG connections under Ujjwala Yojana. He slammed the Opposition for “neglecting” Sitapur despite is proximity to the state capital. “Earlier when there were floods in the district or an outbreak of any disease, the government in power would turn a blind eye to suffering of the people. That has changed under our government,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cm-opens-britannia-unit-launches-rs-1k-cr-projects-in-2-up-dists/articleshow/86629797.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Through this strategy the revenue department aims to encourage more companies to come forward for paying profession tax. The revenue department will approach the Registrar of Companies (ROC), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the state finance ministry to implement this strategy. The civic authority will ask for a comprehensive list of firms registered with ROC and compare it with its own list of firms. “This way we will be able to find out the firms and individuals who are not paying profession tax,” said Jainik Vakil, chairman of AMC’s revenue committee. He added that it is always not that the firms don’t want to pay tax but are unaware that they have to pay this tax also. “We will issue notices to the non-paying firms, institutions and individuals,” Vakil said. The department has also decided that if a firm, institution or an individual who have not been paying profession tax and does not have profession tax certificate comes forward to pay tax all they have to do is file a self-declaration and pay tax for the current year and past two years. Moreover, the revenue department will approach RBI officials and request them to add profession tax certificate in the mandatory list of know your customer (KYC) procedure when firms or individuals open a current account in any bank. The civic body will also approach state finance ministry and request it to grant it powers to make decisions related to profession tax. “Any local self-government institutions carries out only tax collection, they don’t have powers to make administrative decisions like waiving off interest. We will request the state finance ministry to grant decision making powers to civic bodies,” Vakil said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/amc-plans-to-spread-tax-net-wide/articleshow/86625017.cms||---

Similarly, water from Mir Alam Tank flooded Nehru Zoological Park, forcing animal caretakers to take immediate steps to drain out water for the safety of animals. Officials at the zoo asked GHMC & irrigation department to come out with corrective measures and a permanent solution to divert the flood water. “We have discussed with the irrigation department and GHMC officials on the possibilities for diverting the excess water without entering the zoo,” the zoo officials said. Prior to this, Dr Sidhanand Kukrety, director zoo parks and VVL Subhadra Devi, curator, Nehru Zoological Park took stock of the situation in the park. They had inspected the safari park and Singoji pond area, which are inundated with flood water. Water is being drained out with the help diesel engines. Debris is being manually removed. “All the animals are safe in their respective enclosures. A veterinary team is keeping constant vigil on the health of the wild animals,” Subhadra Devi told TOI. The authorities said that all efforts were being taken by the zoo officials and the field staff in maintaining hygienic conditions and draining out water from all the enclosures. Despite the rains, more than 2,700 visitors visited Nehru Zoological Park on Wednesday.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: For nearly 200 years, a dargah has been the saviour in every major flood||HYDERABAD: Many Hyderabadis know that a tamarind tree in Afzalgunj had saved about 150 people from drowning on September 28, 1908, during the Musi deluge. But little is known about a dargah which sheltered nearly 200 people on that fateful day. This dargah dedicated to Hazrat Syed Shah Moosa Quadri not only saved people in 1908, but also during every major flood since 1829. The dargah’s history was revealed by its custodian during a Musi river walk last week by city unit of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) as part of its September Tughyani (deluge) covering heritage sites along the river. Dargah custodian Moulana Syed Shah Fazlullah Quadri Al-Moosavi told TOI: “My father Syed Shah Yahya Alam Quadri Al-Moosavi opened the doors of the dargah in 1908 as the flash flood left a trail of death and destruction. Around 200 people from several nearby areas took refuge in the dargah, which remained intact.” Citing old records, Moulana Fazlullah said his forefather Hazrat Syed Shah Moosa Quadri had prayed to the Almighty as Musi began to flood the city on October 19, 1829. While praying, he referred to the Almighty saving Prophet Moosa (Moses) and his followers from the Pharaoh by splitting the Red Sea. Incidentally, the river Musi is named after Prophet Moses and its tributary Esi named after Hazrat Esa (Jesus). “God had answered the prayer and since then the dargah gave shelter to all during every major flood,” he said. Dargah deputy custodian Peerzada Syed Shah Wasif Alam Qadri said it was one of the very few structures that had given refuge to people during floods in the princely Hyderabad state. “In 1829, the city ramparts collapsed and a part of Purana Pul gate was washed away. In 1908 as many as 221 tanks had breached leading to heavy flooding of city,” INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy said. The dargah had bagged INTACH award for its architecture, history and heritage, Anuradha Reddy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/for-nearly-200-years-a-dargah-hasbeen-the-saviour-in-every-major-flood/articleshow/86625050.cms||Syed Akbar

He was with two friends Ashraf and Rashid. The trio started swimming from the banks of the backwaters in Poovar side and raced towards Pozhiyoor sandbar beach. However, all three started to drown. Local people who saw the incident rushed to the spot and managed to rescue Rashid and Ashraf. The police said there was strong undercurrents in the backwaters.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hotels again seek restoring of timings, say losses rising||MUMBAI: The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of premium restaurants and star hotels, has again made a representation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and tourism minister Aditya Thackeray requesting extension of timings in the state. Presently all restaurants, bars and hotels work to the 10 pm deadline; the earlier deadline was 1.30 am. The Association has recommended restoring old timings on all days of the week as per the license held by the establishments. It has asked for the relaxation on condition that restaurant staff will be fully vaccinated. TimesViewThe hospitality sector is in a precarious situation. The 10pm deadline for a sector, where bulk of activity and revenue has always been in the post 8pm space, is irrational. Longer the hours, the more dispersed will be the footfall, minimising chances of crowding and spread of Covid-19. Besides, the industry generates so much employment that allowing a longer period of operations will encourage more shifts.After October 2020, restaurants in Maharashtra were allowed to operate at 50% capacity with restricted timings. But the second wave led to another lockdown before curbs were progressively eased to some extent. “Rental and salary expenses, servicing of debts, negative cash flows, and statutory payment obligations have made running a hotel or restaurant an unsustainable business in the present situation. However, things are looking up for the State with around five crore population having received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine and number of new cases on the decline,” said Sherry Bhatia, president, HRAWI. “We request the government to take immediate measures to restore economic activities in the State and help citizens to come out of the huge financial losses they have suffered. For restaurants, the curtailed timings of 7am to 10pm are just not viable,” said Bhatia. The hospitality sector is among those that took the biggest hit due to the pandemic. As of today, 30% of hotels and restaurants in the country have shut down permanently due to losses. Over 20% still haven’t opened fully and the rest run on losses with revenues below 50% of the pre-Covid-19 levels. “We recommend that Government allows hotel and restaurants to revert to pre-pandemic timings through the week. This will also promote staggered venturing out of the public. We are sure this would help Maharashtra to come out of the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic,” said Pradeep Shetty, senior vice president, HRAWI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-hotels-again-seek-restoring-of-timings-say-losses-rising/articleshow/86627530.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The state electricity department is working with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to see if such a project can augment power supply particularly for the industries, said power minister Nilesh Cabral. In a virtual meeting with industry stakeholders, particularly Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), Cabral stressed upon more solar power generation and assured local industries of reliable uninterrupted power supply. GCCI, which organised the virtual meeting, requested Cabral to focus on adequate, reliable, affordable and consistent power supply in the state. “The tourism sector is heavily dependant on quality power for operation, production, utilities and recreational facilities. Interruptions, fluctuations and power drops create a total disruption in this sector. Thus hoteliers are forced to depend on diesel generator sets, which are expensive to run,” said GCCI president Ralph De Sousa. In January, the state government had approached the Union ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) to undertake a feasibility study and provide technical assistance to set up renewable power generation energy projects in the state. Goa requires approximately 540MW of power during the day time and 640MW during peak hours from 6pm to 11pm. Speaking on behalf of the pharmaceutical sector, Dr Praveen Khullar requested the electricity department to permit momentary grid synchronisation which will reduce the power interruptions. Dr Khullar, who is the president of Goa Pharmaceutical Manufacturer’s Association, said that power fluctuations lead to production and financial losses. Admitting that the power supply scenario in the state could be improved, Cabral said he had “big plans” to reform the electricity sector. The power minister also urged the industry to set up solar power generation units. “The government is keen to provide reliable and affordable power supply to the state and adequate steps have already been taken in this regard,” said Cabral. He asked Goa’s private sector, particularly those from the manufacturing and tourism sector to submit ideas for the electricity department’s three year business plan.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-hopes-to-store-solar-power-for-use-during-peak-load/articleshow/86627598.cms||---

While the Gogi-Tillu rivalry is attracting most of the police’s attention as of now, the recent murder of an associate of Mahal in Najafgarh two days ago has added to their woes with Kapil Sangwan, believed to be abroad, having emerged as the mastermind. Officers agree that the Tillu-Gogi rivalry is far from over with Gogi’s henchmen having vowed revenge. Social media posts of these gang members are flooded with talks of revenge. Cops are confident about Gogi gang members striking back to avenge his killing in Rohini District Courts Complex because they are still strong in terms of manpower, weapons and leadership. “A major reason for the Gogi gang still holding ground is due to the recent alliance that had been forged with the Kala Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi syndicate. It was a part of this plan that Gogi had managed the free his Man Friday, Kuldeep Fajja, from police custody at GTB Hospital. Fajja and Deepak Boxer were to handle the gang’s operations from outside, while Gogi and others would run things from jail. However, Fajja was shot by Special Cell soon after his escape and Gogi was killed in the court,” a crime branch officer said, while confirming TOI’s report of September 25 that Gogi’s protege, Boxer, had vowed revenge. Bishnoi, Jathedi and their associates, police said, would happily support Gogi’s men and continue the offensive against the Tillu gang given his proximity with jailed gangster Neeraj Bawania. Bawania has emerged as a sly player in the game and seen progressing rapidly towards establishing his supremacy in Delhi’s underworld, while keeping a low profile in jail. Bawania not only joined hands with Tillu, but also formed an alliance by bringing onboard Naveen Bali and Suneel Rathi to counter the alliance formed by Gogi, Bishnoi and Jathedi. Recently, police filed a chargesheet under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act against Bishnoi, his Man Friday Sampat Nehra, and nine others on charges of running an interstate crime syndicate. “The alliance is aimed at indulging in extortion, drug and illegal arms trafficking, land grabbing and targeted killings in collaboration with their partners in Mexico, Italy and Thailand. On their target are Bollywood celebrities, Punjabi singers and actors and businessmen from Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana,” said police. They also have links with international drug trafficker Amandeep Multani, connected with Mexican drug cartels. Multani was arrested by US Drug Enforcement Agency in April. The second international contact was identified as Monty from the UK, who has links with an Italian mafia outfit. Gangster Kala Rana in Bangkok and Satenderjeet Singh alias Goldi Brar from Canada are supposedly handling the international aspects of this alliance. On the other hand, the gangs of Najafgarh have alarmed police too. Sangwan is learnt to be ordering hits and demanding extortion from the UK, while his elder brother, Jyoti Baba, is handling the gang’s operations from jail with the help of Vikas Langarpuria and others. Cops hope that two notorious gangs of northeast Delhi, led by Irfan and Nasir, don’t start their rivalry again. The gangs had sort of reached a truce three years ago and divided their areas of operation. Since then, only two incidents pertaining to rivalry had been reported.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/two-sets-of-gang-rivalries-give-cops-sleepless-nights/articleshow/86625037.cms||Raj Shekhar

The re-counting process went on till 1.30am on Wednesday before Korat was finally declared the winner at 2am. “When the votes were first counted, there was a talk that Naran Patel had won by six votes. When Korat was declared the winner, defeating Patel by one vote. Patel demanded a re-count and hoped to win by two votes,” according to a source. At the end of final counting, Korat had a total of 1,348 votes and Naran Patel had 1,347.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Crime Branch questions jailed gangster Tillu for three hours in Gogi murder case||NEW DELHI: Jailed gangster Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu was questioned by Crime Branch officials for around three hours on Wednesday evening in connection with the murder of his rival, Jitender Maan alias Gogi, who was recently shot inside a Rohini courtroom, sources said. Tillu was asked whether he had ordered the killing through a phone and how he got the news about Gogi’s killing, the sources said. Tillu, currently lodged in Mandoli Jail, is the alleged mastermind behind the murder conspiracy. Despite being in jail, Tillu reportedly communicated with his henchmen outside and planned the shootout. Two men arrested by Delhi Police have confessed they were working for Tillu, cops claimed, adding that the shooters who were neutralised also had links with him. The investigation has led the cops to look for a getaway car and its driver who was to escort the shooters to a safehouse, a flat located around three kilometres from the court. The original plan, sources said, required the shooters to create a stampede-like situation in the court by firing multiple shots in the air after killing Gogi. They were even asked to take a lawyer or a litigant hostage, if required, and flee. But things changed with the cops shooting back at the assailants without wasting time, they said. Delhi Police are also questioning the arrested duo to get to others. Umang and Vinay were occupants of the flat that was rented a few months ago and are accused of harbouring the shooters, a source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/crime-branch-questions-jailed-gangster-tillu-for-three-hours-in-gogi-murder-case/articleshow/86625141.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Reforms needed in Civil Service coaching sector||The extraordinary media interest in the results of the UPSC Civil Service examination was on account of the extraordinary competition among coaching centres for their share of the flourishing online market. A massive advertising campaign made it as though there were hundreds of successful candidates, though there were only 62 of them. Coaching centres proliferated in the city and elsewhere in Kerala because of the immense interest among the young graduates to compete in the examination. Success in the examination is seen as a one-way ticket to stardom. Though the standard of the examination is at the PG level, more candidates appear for the examination after graduation and one or two years at the coaching centres. Since coaching is entirely online now, it makes no difference whether the candidates are in Kerala or not and so, the competition has gone beyond the existing 28 in the city. The number of successful candidates from Kerala has increased over the years. But it is nowhere near the desirable levels, primarily because of the low standard of English in the colleges. The medium of instruction continues to be English, but since the students have a choice to answer questions in either English or Malayalam, teachers resort to teaching in Malayalam. A few years ago, candidates began to opt for Malayalam literature as an optional paper and many of them not only qualified, but also secured high ranks. But very few exercise the option of writing the entire examination in Malayalam because it is difficult to get study material for general studies. All said and done, the standard of English is the major factor for success. Interestingly, some who have failed the examination several times have turned out to be very good trainers and earn more than those who enter the service. Some may succeed in hitting the target in the dark, but the broad reading and education expected of the recruits will be lacking and they are caught at the stage of the personality test. The earlier tendency for candidates to go to Delhi has been reversed and candidates have begun to come to Thiruvananthapuram from some southern states. But some who have gone outside Kerala do better as they get total immersion in English. A large majority of the candidates give IAS as their first option and the IPS as second. Sadly, many who join IFS come from lower ranks without having opted for it. The lack of awareness of the charms and challenges of the IFS is the main reason for it. But in the last few years, several bright candidates have opted for the IFS and made it, going back to the old tradition of Kerala producing some brilliant diplomats. Coaching industry should be regulated to improve the quality of teaching. Universities in Kerala will do well to offer a PG course in public policy with the same syllabus as the Civil Service examination so that the candidates get good training and a master’s degree, even if they do not make it to the Civil Services.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/reforms-needed-in-civil-service-coaching-sector/articleshow/86625108.cms||---

Palande, who was arrested in June in connection with an alleged money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate, has sought bail along with co-accused Kundan Shinde. Palande’s counsel Shekhar Jagtap in his submissions before the special Judge said that Waze’s statements were made only after he (Palande) submitted an affidavit before a one-man committee of Justice (retired) K U Chandiwal, which is probing the ex-police chief Param Bir Singh’s letter alleging corrupt malpractices by Deshmukh. Jagtap said there was no corroborative evidence.

---||Mumbai||BMC lab gets national accreditation for tests it conducts||MUMBAI: BMC’s molecular diagnostics laboratory, located within the Kasturba Hospital compound in Chinchpokli, has got national accreditation for various RT-PCR tests it conducts. This includes the Covid RT-PCR test. This laboratory was the first in the city to test for Covid-19 in February-March 2020. The accreditation given by the National Accreditation Board for testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) is a recognition of quality and standards observed during diagnostics testing. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said NABL recognition was good and a validation of the services offered at a publicly-funded laboratory. “We at BMC are striving to be self-reliant by conducting tests in our laboratories instead of sending samples to laboratories outside the city,”' said Kakani. Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the BMC laboratory, said the accreditation was a recognition of ensuring quality in molecular diagnostic services. “When one buys jewelry, one looks for the hallmark to establish quality. Similarly, NABL accreditation is a mark of quality and reproducibility of results,’’ she said. Many private laboratories have the NABL accreditation, but only a few in the public sector do, and that too for a handful of tests only. The Kasturba laboratory was set up in 2007 after it emerged in 2005 that there was no local lab to test for leptospirosis during an outbreak. Ever since, the laboratory has been upgraded to carry out more sophisticated tests, beginning with H1N1 epidemic in 2009 and Covid-19 in 2020. Although it is a public molecular laboratory, it carries out inter-laboratory quality checks for 46 private laboratories in the city that test for Covid-19. On August 4, the laboratory got a genomic sequencing facility to check for variants of Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus. Covid samples were sent to Pune and Delhi for genomic sequencing till then.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-lab-gets-natl-accreditation-for-tests-it-conducts/articleshow/86627589.cms||---

Most ex-ministers have applied for bungalows. After the change in the cabinet, the former ministers had been asked to vacate their government bungalows in the ministerial enclave at the earliest, so that they can be allotted to the newly inducted ministers. Key sources aware of developments said that most ex-ministers have requested government bungalows. “Former deputy CM Nitin Patel along with former ministers Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Saurabh Patel, Ganpat Vasava, Jayesh Radadiya, Kunvarji Bavaliya, Jawahar Chavda, and Pradipsinh Jadeja have asked for bungalows,” a source said. “So have former junior ministers such as Parshottam Solanki, Raman Patkar, Vibhavari Dave, Vasan Ahir, Ishwarsinh Patel, and Dharmendrasinh Jadeja.” Citing the rules and conventions, the source said: “When a cabinet reshuffle happens, former ministers can request ‘Ka’ type government bungalows on low rent till the completion of their children’s academic session.” The source added: “However, it is up to the government to either approve or disapprove the application.” Sources added that at present, there are very few ‘Ka’ type bungalows available. “If all ex-ministers are allotted these bungalows, then ministers of state in the current cabinet will have to be given ‘Ga’ type bungalows which are meant for junior IAS officers,” the source said. “The CM and new roads and buildings minister Purnesh Modi will take a final call on the former ministers’ requests for bungalows.” According to another source: “There is a possibility that the state government will appoint BJP leaders in major boards and corporations, or give them statutory posts.” The source added: “These leaders will also demand bungalows, so it is very difficult to address the sudden surge of requests. Many IAS and IPS officers and even top Government of India officers eligible for bungalows are awaiting allocations.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/kursi-gone-ex-ministers-seek-bungalows/articleshow/86625087.cms||Kapil Dave

Accused Manish Singh is also wanted in 16 other offences, said city crime branch officers on Wednesday. Manish, who had a Rs 50,000 reward on his head, worked for notorious gangster Subhash Singh Thakur from Varanasi. Police sources said that Manish came to Ahmedabad in 2015 and posed as Shivlal Yadav. “After adopting the new identity, he worked as a financier in the city and kept travelling between Mumbai and Ahmedabad to run his illegal business. He was also involved in robbing gold worth Rs 23 lakh from a jewellery shop in Manek Chowk in October 2019,” they said. Cops said that Manish’s criminal journey began in 2007 when he joined Thakur’s gang and opened fire at two rival gang members in Varanasi. In the same year, he took a contract to kill a man named R K Singh, director of a hotel group in Uttar Pradesh. The contract had been given by Singh’s business partner Ashok Talreja, who was shot by Manish in 2012 over a money dispute. In 2009, Manish went to Mumbai where he tried to extort money from Krishan Shetty, a bar owner in Santacruz. When Shetty refused to give him money, Manish tried to kill him too. According to police, he continued to extort money from various people and opened fire at some of them too. He was charged with six cases of attempt to murder and under sections of the arms act. In 2014, he shot two people at a petrol pump in Botad town and killed them. In 2015, he came to Ahmedabad. Crime branch personnel were looking for Shivlal Yadav in connection with the Manek Chowk gold robbery when they got to know through an informer that Yadav was Manish Singh who was involved in 19 offences, including three murders and six attempted murder cases. During the probe, they traced him to Vasai. A team of the crime branch went to Vasai, stayed there for 10 days at Evershine flats and nabbed Manish when he came there for his father’s shraddh rituals. The cops brought him to the city and produced him in a local court that remanded him to police custody for seven days.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/man-wanted-for-three-murders-arrested/articleshow/86625116.cms||---

Vrinda, daughter of Vihayan and Molly of Vrinda Bhavan at Thettichira near Pothencode is the victim of the gruesome attack. The alleged assailant, Sibin Lal, 29, later tried to commit suicide by consuming poison. Police said the incident took place at a stitching centre at Kavuvila where Vrinda worked. Sibin Lal, who is the younger brother of Vrinda's husband Sabin Lal, reached the stitching centre around 11 am on Wednesday armed with a can of inflammable liquid, presumed to be petrol or kerosene, and a torch made of papaya stem with cloth wrapped on one end. He called Vrinda out of the stitching centre and had a quarrel with her. In the melee, he poured an inflammable liquid over her body. Though Vrinda tried to run away, the suspect lit the torch and threw it at her, thus setting her ablaze. Her employer Radha and daughter Arya rushed Vrinda to the government medical college hospital here. Based on the information gathered from witnesses, the police tracked the blue Maruti Swift car in which the suspect escaped and found it parked beside the NH Bypass road at Muttathara. He had allegedly consumed pesticide mixed with liquor. The police took him to the same hospital. The suspect told the police that Vrinda had been living separately from his brother and he committed the crime out of frustration after his repeated attempts to convince her for a reconciliation failed. Pothencode sub inspector Vinod Vikramadityan said that as per preliminary enquiry, Vrinda left her husband owing to his alcohol addiction and consequent domestic violence. She had also taken her two children with her. Sibin Lal, who is a parallel transport van driver by profession, used to visit her at workplace and used to request her to come back. ''From his social media posts, it appears that Sibin Lal was very much attached to his brother's children and this might be the reason he grew frustrated when Vrinda did not pay heed to his requests'', the SI said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-set-on-fire-by-brother-in-law/articleshow/86625165.cms||---

---||Mumbai||95% of Mumbai’s power comes from coal, GHG big concern||MUMBAI: A transition to clean energy is critical for Indian cities, including Mumbai, to reduce air pollution, improve residents’ health and deliver climate targets aligned to Paris Agreements. “(It is also critical) for creating jobs,” said Shruti Narayan, regional director (South & West Asia) of C40, a network that has released a report on pollution by coal. The state says expectations on the target to meet 25% of electricity demand through renewables will be met by 2025. “At the same time, as the Mumbai Climate Action Plan is being developed, we intend to identify ways and means to provide more renewables to the grid,” said Saurabh Punamiya Jain, research & public policy assistant to the state environment department. Track the pollution level in your cityAir pollution (PM2.5 annual concentration) in Mumbai is more than three times above WHO guidelines. “Current national plans would expand the coal fleet by 28% between 2020 and 2030, and not reduce it by 20%, threatening the health and well-being of urban residents in Mumbai while undermining India’s climate and air quality targets. Current national plans could increase the number of annual premature deaths from coal plant pollution in Mumbai by 35%,” said Dr Rachel Huxley, head of knowledge and research at C40. In India, business leaders estimate that employee productivity decreases by 8-10% on high pollution days. Proposed coal projects will result in 2.4 million days of sick leave in Mumbai by 2030, as per the report. Investing in clean energy instead of coal would benefit workers and businesses. An energy transition that would supply Mumbai with renewable electricity would also generate 250,000 energy jobs in India between 2020 and 2030 and provide cheaper electricity, research suggests. Jobs would be generated in manufacturing, installation and operations. As Mumbai is drafting its Climate Action Plan, which is expected to be ready later this year, a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory analysis developed under the plan has showed that the energy sector contributes the most to Mumbai’s GHG emissions, given the city’s high domestic power demand and the fact that 95% of Mumbai’s electricity is generated from coal.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-95-of-citys-power-comes-from-coal-ghg-big-concern/articleshow/86627697.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

This is the fourth mosque in Hyderabad to offer its premises to run a clinic to meet the medical and health needs of the poor irrespective of religion. The clinic, which was opened formally on Tuesday at Masjid-e-Adam, serves as a primary healthcare centre catering particularly to seasonal and vector-borne diseases. The mosque clinic will function from 9.30 am to 4 pm daily except on Fridays when it will remain open from 3 pm to 9 pm. The decision to open the clinic at the mosque comes after a door-to-door survey in Hasan Nagar division by Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO, covering 550 households, revealed the poor health status of people and inadequacy of the medical and health services there. About 70% of the respondents said that access to primary care in their basti needs improvement. The survey also revealed that every other household has adults and children sick with viral fever, cold and cough. In all, 65% said they were forced to go to private clinics in the basti, which open mainly after 3 pm and run till midnight. Although these clinics charge Rs 50 to Rs 100, most of these clinics prescribe medicines and tests that cost Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per visit, said HHF managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. “Thanks to tight financial position and loss of income, 55% of the respondents said they can only afford medication of one child and they normally share the same medicine between other siblings if all of them fall sick,” Askari told TOI. The mosque health centre was opened by Mazharuddin Hussaini, executive director, sSEED, a partner in the initiative. This unique model of providing free and quality primary health care from mosques in Hyderabad has so far benefited 1.15 lakh patients this year. It has also helped the poor patients save Rs 5.75 crore out of pocket expenses as the mosque clinics provide free medicines.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/another-mosque-opens-health-clinic-10000-people-to-benefit/articleshow/86625170.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Delhi||Woman in saree: Eatery in Delhi gets closure notice for norm violations||NEW DELHI: The restaurant in south Delhi’s Khel Gaon, which was in news last week for allegedly denying entry to a saree-clad woman, has been shut down. A closure notice was issued by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on September 24 after it was found that the restaurant was running without a health licence, had insanitary and unhygienic conditions and was encroaching on public land. SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan confirmed that the restaurant owner had submitted an affidavit after the closure notice was issued by the department concerned. “Aquila restaurant was operating without a licence. After getting the notice, they closed the restaurant on their own and applied for a licence on the SDMC portal. However, the department will ascertain the time for which they were running without a licence and impose a penalty accordingly,” he added. “Aquila at Ansal Plaza, Khel Gaon was inspected by the area public health inspector on September 21. The trade was found running without a health licence, had insanitary and unhygienic conditions and there was encroachment on public land. Therefore, prosecution action was taken after issuing a challan,” SDMC’s closure notice stated. The notice further stated, “The inspector again inspected the site on September 24 and found the trade running under the same conditions. You are directed to close down the eatery within 48 hours failing which suitable action, including sealing as per DMC Act, will be taken without assigning further notice.” On September 27, an affidavit was submitted by the restaurant owner stating that they had closed the restaurant, applied for a health trade licence, maintained hygiene and trained staff to behave nicely with customers. Speaking to TOI, Aquila restaurant operations head Mukesh Singh claimed the site was temporarily closed due to maintenance work. “There is some repair work going on and soon it will become operational. I’m not sure about receiving any closure notice as we have all necessary documents, except for liquor licence,” he added. The issue was raised in the SDMC House meeting by senior Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj, Abhishek Dutt, on Wednesday. He moved a proposal demanding that a fine of Rs 5 lakh be imposed against any restaurant, bar or hotel that denies entry to any person wearing traditional Indian attire. “Officials only took action after I questioned the department about how the restaurant was running without a health trade licence and that it was sealed for some time in the past. It’s surprising that an eatery at such a prominent location was operating despite violating norms for around two years,” claimed Dutt. In a social media post, a woman had alleged that she was refused entry to the restaurant because she was wearing a saree. The restaurant, however, had claimed that the incident was “misrepresented”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/s-delhi-eatery-gets-closure-notice-for-norm-violations/articleshow/86625216.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Thiruvananthapuram||One-time settlement scheme extended||Thiruvananthapuram: The one-time settlement scheme, announced for settling outstanding loans due in cooperative banks, has been extended by a month. The scheme was set to lapse by Thursday. The decision to extend the one-time settlement scheme was announced by cooperation minister VN Vasavan at a news conference on Wednesday. “The benefits of the one-time settlement scheme would be available for customers till Oct 31. The scheme was introduced for facilitating opportunities to customers to settle their loan arrears by utilizing concessions in interest and compound interest of the defaulted amount,” he said. Loans that fell into ‘default’ category, fully or partially, as on March 31, 2021 are eligible for the relaxations offered through the one- time settlement scheme. Loans of terminally-ill persons and their families would get priority under this scheme. The relaxations would be also applicable for the legal heirs of the people who died as loan defaulters, Vasavan said. “The conditions for one-time settlement would remain the same. It was announced in September,” he added. The one-time settlement scheme is applicable for all cooperative banks except state cooperative bank, Malappuram district cooperative bank, housing cooperative societies, cooperative rural development banks. But, these banks are free to implement the one-time settlement scheme with the permission of the cooperative registrar, Vasavan said. Meanwhile, Kerala Bank is aiming to arrest the fall in prices of agricultural produce through the scheme ‘PACS as Multi Service Centre’ which will make procurement, processing, marketing, and value-addition of agri produce possible. Those projects which meet the stipulated conditions would be given loans of up to Rs 2 crore at 4% interest through PACS. Those who do prompt repayment will get an interest subsidy of up to 3%. Thus, those who repay promptly can get a loan up to Rs 2 crore at 1% under this scheme, the minister said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/one-time-settlement-scheme-extended/articleshow/86627729.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: 54-year-old man assaulted over argument on jumping queue at mart dies||OLD GOA: A 54-year-old man, Joseph Dias, died after he was assaulted at a supermarket in Old Goa, over an argument on jumping the queue. The assailant, Gajanan Pawar, is untraceable. The incident occurred earlier this month, when Joseph was shopping at the mart with wife Caroline. Joseph was waiting in the queue to pay his bill, as Caroline waited at another unmanned cash counter for Joseph to complete the transaction. Seeing the rush, the supermarket staff decided to open the unmanned counter, too, for billing. As the counter opened, Caroline was the first person in line. But Pawar suddenly rushed from his spot in the queue towards the cash counter. In the process, he shoved Caroline aside and took her spot in the queue. She and several other customers objected to Pawar’s actions. Joseph then rushed to the defence of his wife. The FIR said Pawar got abusive and used foul language against the couple. After completing their billing, the Dias couple headed towards the parking lot. Here, Pawar is alleged to have followed them and struck Joseph on the head, which caused him to lose his balance and fall on the concrete, causing serious injuries to him, said the FIR. An injured Joseph was taken to Goa Medical College for treatment. Joseph suffered a brain haemorrhage and he breathed his last on September 20, after fighting for his life for 17 days. The postmortem report states that death occurred due to blunt force damage to the head, said the family. Police said Pawar has fled to Kolkata, going by his phone’s location, which is being tracked. Besides the CCTV footage of the crime, police have recorded statements of eyewitnesses. “The complaint has been registered by police under section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous injuries), which is a bailable offence, and allowed the accused to be released. Pawar should have been booked under section 307, which is attempt to murder. Gajanan Pawar roams free since there is no will from the police to arrest him,” alleged a family member of Joseph Dias. Police inspector (PI) Dattaram Raut, who is handling the case, refused to comment. He only said, “The case is under investigation”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/man-assaulted-over-argument-on-jumping-queue-at-mart-dies/articleshow/86627675.cms||---

Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot had recently told TOI that the Aam Aadmi Party government had approved and recommended a six-month extension for Singh to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.

The order has been signed by principal secretary-cum-commissioner (transport) Ashish Kundra. Delhi government and the Centre have equal stake in the DMRC and its managing director is always designated by the state government, with concurrence of the Centre. This is the fourth extension for Singh, who has been a part of the DMRC since the very beginning. Singh is DMRC’s second managing director and took over from E Sreedharan on December 31, 2011.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Nirbhaya’ cop collars robber who attacks her in local||NAVI MUMBAI: In an act of bravery, a 28-year-old woman constable attached to the GRP’s women cell and part of the Nirbhaya team fought and nabbed a 19-year-old robber who was travelling in the ladies compartment and snatched her gold mangalsutra when she asked him to alight and board the gents coach. The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon between Juinagar and Mankhurd stations. Acting on a complaint by constable Anjali Korde, the accused Krushna Rathod, who hails from Hubli in Karnataka, has been arrested by the Vashi GRP and booked under Section 392 of the IPC for punishment for robbery. “Constable Korde, who resides in Nerul, had boarded the first-class ladies compartment of CMST local at Jui Nagar station at 1.34pm to resume duty in Mumbai. When she saw a youth seated alone inside the coach reserved for women, she told him to get down and instead travel in the gents compartment. But as soon as the train departed from Juinagar station, the youth attacked Korde and snatched her gold ‘mangalsutra’ unaware that she was a cop dressed in plain clothes for vigilance in women’s compartment,” said senior inspector of Vashi GRP Vishnu Kesarkar. “Korde fearlessly confronted him and held on to him firmly till the train halted at Vashi station, where two of her women colleagues Ingale and Kalambe heard her shouts for help and joined her. The three women cops detained the robber and ensured he did not escape,” Kesarkar added. When the train reached Mankhurd station, the women cops and constable Darade escorted the robber to the police ‘chowkie’ on Mankhurd platform. Rathod was found in possession of Korde’s mangalsutra worth Rs 30,000. He was handed over to Vashi GRP and an FIR was registered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-nirbhaya-cop-collars-robber-who-attacks-her-in-local/articleshow/86627750.cms||George Mendonca
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Triple talaq notice allegedly sent through money order||AHMEDABAD: A 40-year-old woman from the Raikhad area of the city on Tuesday filed a complaint with Gaekwad Haveli police, alleging that her husband sent her triple talaq notice through money order. The woman, a teacher at an Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation school, in her FIR said that she married a man from Jamalpur in June 2007. Soon after their wedding, her husband bought a house in Astodia, taking a housing loan in her name. She said that when they were living there, he would fight with her and suspected that she was having an affair with another man. She said her husband defrauded several people of money and fled to Dubai, after which she had to pay the debts. He came to India in July 2019 and sold the house for Rs 72 lakh. Using that money, he bought a house for his sister, she said. She alleged that whenever she opposed him, he beat her up. After that, he went to stay at a rented house in Gomtipur and had first sent a notice of instant talaq on April 16, 2020, though registered AD. The complainant’s mother signed the acknowledgement slip and he thus managed to take send the talaq (divorce) notice for the first time, she alleged in the FIR. On July 30, 2020, he sent two separate money orders of Rs 5,000 each, but as she knew that he had sent the money order with the Iddat (waiting period) note, she refused to accept it, the FIR said. She alleged that her husband continued to threaten her for an instant divorce since then. She approached Gaekwad Haveli police and filed a DV complaint along with charges under the Muslim Women Act against him.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/triple-talaq-notice-allegedly-sent-through-money-order/articleshow/86625254.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||MU reverses decision for 40 answer papers to be evaluated per day||Mangaluru: After drawing flak for its policy of making evaluators assess 40 answer papers per day, from the earlier 30, Mangalore University reversed its order, much to the relief of the teaching community. The move was to expedite the evaluation process, but did not have approval of the syndicate. The university commenced the evaluation process from Monday. According to sources who are engaged in evaluation, MU officials had asked them to assess 40 answer papers per day, but after they protested, it was reduced to the earlier 30 papers, and as per the rules, an evaluator can assess only 30 answer papers a day. “First and foremost, the new rule had no approval from the competent authorities. Secondly, it was not possible to evaluate 40 papers in a day. Thirdly, even if it was done, evaluators from far-off places like Puttur, Sullia and Kundapur would have faced problems with transportation,” said a lecturer from a first grade government college. Another senior lecturer pointed out a serious violation during evaluation, where the identity of the candidate was revealed to an evaluator. “The coding strip which contains the roll number of a candidate is distributed to an evaluator, thereby violating confidentiality of the examination. The roll number consists of college code, where one can easily identify which college a candidate belongs to. What is the use of coding in an examination, when it is not being followed?” the lecturer questioned. When TOI contacted P L Dharma, registrar (evaluation), Mangalore University, he said that they withdrew the order of 40 papers to be evaluated per day, as they did not have permission to do so from syndicate members. It would have created issues while giving payment to evaluators, he added. On distributing coding details to evaluators, Dharma maintained that it was the first evaluation taking place after adopting the new MULinx software for examinations. “There are some glitches, but we have not revealed any details about the candidates to evaluators. We had about three complaints regarding coding issues during the examination, and necessary action has been taken,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/mu-reverses-decision-for-40-answer-papers-to-be-evaluated-per-day/articleshow/86622411.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Goa||Will fight Goa polls alone: TMC||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress will have no alliances with other parties and will fight the assembly elections in Goa on its own. “In Goa, TMC is going to fight the upcoming election alone. Hope this puts to rest all speculations,” party’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said on Wednesday. Abhishek, who is the nephew of party chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, said TMC would throw its entire weight into Goa elections and he and Mamata would be visiting the state after Durga puja. Blaming Congress for practising armchair politics, Abhishek said: “If Congress doesn’t work, doesn’t hit the streets and only stays in the comfort of their homes, then we can’t be expected to be sitting ducks.” He said in the past seven years, TMC has defeated BJP while Congress was defeated by BJP. “Our fight is against BJP and no one else,” he said. Earlier, former Congress veteran Luizinho Faleiro and eight others formally joined TMC after meeting Mamata at her office. Faleiro reiterated that he was joining TMC to unite the different factions of Congress. “I have called up everybody to take the right step in the unification of the Congress family to face BJP. It is the right step to bring a new dawn,” Faleiro said at his first media conference after induction into TMC. “Didi is the only leader who has faced BJP and won against the divisive agenda. She is a streetfighter, a fighter par excellence, whom we need to save the country from BJP,” he said. Faleiro said he had a “long talk” with Mamata. “She has said how she loves Goa and how these two states have so many things in common like love for fish and football and our cultural heritage. She has accepted to lead the election and has promised to protect Goa’s heritage and ethos at any cost,” said Faleiro. “I am starting a journey with Didi because Goa needs a credible alternative,” he said. Mamata took to Twitter to welcome Faleiro and others: “It’s a matter of great pride for me to welcome former Goa CM, 7-time MLA and stalwart Goan leader Shri @luizinhofaleiro to the Trinamool Congress family. Together we will stand up for every Goan, fight divisive forces and work towards ushering in a NEW DAWN for Goa.” Besides Faleiro, others who joined include former MLA Lavu Mamledar, GPCC general secretaries Yatish Naik and Vijay Poi, secretaries Mario Pinto De Santana and Anand Naik, author Shivdas Sonu Naik, Rajendra Shivaji Kakodkar and advocate Antonio Monteiro Clovis Da Costa. TMC national spokesperson Sougata Roy said more persons from Goa were expected to join Trinamool on Thursday, when it would launch its state unit.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/will-fight-goa-polls-alone-tmc/articleshow/86627717.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It has been proposed that the GST rate on apparels and garments costing above Rs 1,000 would be increased from the existing 5% to 12% effective from next January. The Gujarat Garments Manufacturers’ Association (GGMA) made a representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting against hike in tax rate as the industry is still recovering from the after-effects of the slowdown post-pandemic. “Most industrial units continue to operate at 65% of the pre-Covid levels. Moreover, raw material prices have shown a steep rise. Already post-pandemic, at least 15% of garment manufacturing units have permanently shut down or else have scaled down operations,” states the representation. Apparel manufacturers have cited that if the tax rates are increased, it will dent their competitiveness.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/junk-draft-gst-hike-apparel-makers/articleshow/86625229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa University to offer two PG courses fully online||PANAJI: While the Covid-19 pandemic has made institutions realise the importance of online learning like never before, Goa University has gone a step further, and is set to offer two postgraduate programmes entirely in the online mode. The varsity is expected to introduce a new master’s programme in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) even as it is working to offer one of its newly-introduced programmes, MSc/MA in environmental science, in the same format. Both of these will take place exclusively online. It is felt that offering postgraduate programmes entirely in the online mode will help students acquire dual degrees as it enables them to pursue it alongside other courses they may already have enrolled for. We have an idea to make the MSc/MA in environmental science a 100% online programme, so that a student can get two degrees in a duration of two years (dual degree). Similarly, we have also initiated a MSc programme in remote sensing and GIS, envisaged as 100% online, which is awaiting the government’s nod to launch,” GU vice-chancellor Harilal B Menon told TOI. The vice-chancellor said that the MSc/MA in environmental science at GU is a unique programme as students who have either done their BSc or BA can join the course and the first two semesters are common for all students. “We need to have more conjoined programmes. On completion of the programme, the BSc student gets an MSc degree and the BA student gets a MA degree,” said Menon. He said the programme covers a vast array of subjects like women in environment, environmental politics, disaster management, green chemistry, ethics and environment, geoinformatics, etc. As the rush of students to join medicine and engineering programmes continues, the VC sees such conjoined programmes as the answer to getting students interested in acquiring knowledge spanning across streams. “A student pursuing a programme at an IIT, for instance, doesn’t study only technology, but learns other subjects from humanities too, which makes these institutions much sought after,” Menon said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/gu-to-offer-two-pg-courses-fully-online/articleshow/86627760.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

In an additional bonanza for corporators ahead of the BMC elections in February 2022, the municipality will also float tenders for another Rs 650-crore road works and Rs 350-crore road repair works in Mhada layouts. “A 15-day short tender will be called for the road works. But, all Rs 2,200-crore worth of works will not be floated together, it will be done in phases within the next month,” a senior BMC official said. “As it is a short tender, we hope to table the proposal before the civic standing committee for approval by November.” The official pointed out that with such a large amount of works being tendered now, it’s unlikely any new road works will be taken up next year. Also, he added, looking at past experience, it has been decided to ensure stringent conditions are in place from the tender stage itself so that contractors cannot get away with poor quality of work. One of the conditions would be to hold back 20% of the retention money and give it to the contractors six to 10 years after the work is completed. “We propose to pay 4% of the retention money each year after the sixth year and that too after testing the roughness of the road,” the official said. “We also plan to have a quality monitoring agency for each of Mumbai’s seven zones to monitor the road work progress at every stage.” At present, there are only three such agencies for the entire city. The winning bidder will also have to sign a memorandum of understanding with the ready-mix concrete (RMC) plant from where it plans to procure material for the work and only the RMC specified in the tender can be used. “In case any other RMC is used for the road works, the plant will also be held responsible,” said the official. After tenders for the of Rs 1,200-crore road works had contractors bid up to 30% below the estimates, on September 13, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu, in-charge of roads department, in an internal file note had said that the rate analysis is unlikely to justify the possibility of doing proper quality of road works. The department was also asked to justify how the quality of road works would be maintained by bidders in case they are subcontracted and if any mechanism has been put in place to ensure the cement mixture is of good quality. The tenders were then put on hold.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-eye-on-bmc-polls-rs-2200cr-road-works-to-begin-soon/articleshow/86627794.cms||Richa Pinto

Heavy rainfall did not last through the day though, as the IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded only 15.8mm of rain in the nine hours ended 5.30pm. For Mumbai, rain is expected to ease further from Thursday with only a moderate forecast till Sunday. By contrast, in the adjoining areas such as Dombivli, rain water was seen entering Manpada police station as the Kalyan-Dombivli belt reported 121mm rainfall in the 24 hours ended 8.30am on Wednesday. Thane recorded 89mm of rain during the same period. The IMD said the rainfall was a result of the remnants of the cyclonic storm Gulab. “It is very likely to move northwestwards, emerge into the northeast Arabian Sea and intensify into a depression by Thursday morning. Then it is very likely to move further northwestwards, and intensify into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours. Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move northwestwards towards Pakistan and Makran coasts, moving away from the Indian coast,” said IMD. Meanwhile, as on Wednesday, total water stock in the lakes supplying to Mumbai stood at 99% of the requirement.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-rain-petering-out-forecast-says-moderate-showers-till-sun/articleshow/86628238.cms||Richa Pinto

Justice PV Kunhikrishnan issued the order after considering a petition filed by captain Pedro Guilherme Da Veiga Pereira E Oliveira Artilheiro through advocate Aysha Abraham. While allowing the plea for entering the country, the court noted that as the petitioner’s belongings are in India and as his tax residency is also in India, he cannot obtain other employment unless he clears documentation. In the order allowing entry for a week, the court directed the petitioner to inform the relevant authorities, including the Foreigners Regional Registration Office, about his dates of arrival and departure. Through the petition, the captain had informed the court that he was put on leave without pay during the lockdown last year and then his contract was terminated, resulting in cancellation of visa. Though he had alleged that the airline violated labour law and air safety regulations, the court did not interfere in it and allowed him to raise the contentions before the appropriate regulatory authority.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hc-allows-foreign-pilot-to-visit-india-to-collect-belongings/articleshow/86627787.cms||---

Shiju, 26, of Maryapuram was sentenced by Fast Track special court in the city for cases related to sexual abuse against children. The judge R Jayakrishnan has also imposed a penalty of Rs 75,000 on the culprit. The crime related to the case took place in January 2019. As per the prosecution case, the victim, who resided under Poojapura police station limits in the city, was raped twice by the culprit while he was engaged in carpentry works in the area. According to the girl's statement, the culprit first knocked at her door seeking water to drink. When he realised that no one else was at home, he forcibly entered the house and raped her.

If it wasn’t enough that she grows 35 types of crops, she also rears poultry and cattle. In addition, she is an entrepreneur who started processing unsold coconuts during the lockdown to extract oil for profit. Her success story has attracted the attention of PM Narendra Modi, who interacted with her online recently. “Your success story is an example of the ability of women farmers in Goa who can achieve anything if they are determined to do so,” he told her. He commended her ability to wear many hats right from embracing modern farming, vermicomposting and poultry management. Pednekar was trained by experts at Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI, following which she has not only grown food, she is also able to scientifically manage her 50 chickens, three bulls and two cows. She said that using the technologies taught by ICARCCARI, she has tasted success in growing watermelons at her farm for two consecutive years, and sells them at the Calangute market. She even shared the story of how when coconuts from her farm were unsold due to the lockdown last year, she put on her entrepreneurial hat and processed the dried coconuts into oil. She now sells this oil for Rs 300 per litre, which has turned out to be a lucrative venture. “The lockdown seems to have turned out to be profitable for you,” Modi told her. Modi also asked her if she receives benefits from the PM kisan samman nidhi yojana, which offers farmers monetary help. She said that the scheme has proved to be useful to her. “Earlier, my husband — a retired banking employee — would help me in the farming activities, but he is busy now. As a result, I largely execute all the work by myself, which also includes operating the tractor,” she said. However, that is not all. Pednekar went on to claim that success in farming resulted in her children being able to build three new houses and also build a road near them. “We are all very passionate about farming — a skill that I took to while growing up watching my father engage in the activity,” she said. Impressed by her ability to don multiple hats, Modi said that the Goa government is also very passionate about the betterment of farmers in the state. “With your confidence, you have not only emerged as a successful woman farmer but also as an entrepreneur,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/pm-hails-parra-farmer-calls-her-successful-entrepreneur/articleshow/86627808.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Ahmedabad||Piped gas: Gujarat usage 2 times Maharashtra’s||AHMEDABAD: Riding high on its large base of residential piped natural gas (PNG) consumers, Gujarat consumes piped cooking gas twice that of Maharashtra. It is about four times the domestic PNG consumption in Delhi, shows data available with the Union ministry petroleum and natural gas. Gujarat saw around 11.62 lakh standard cubic meter per day (SCMD)—the highest in India—domestic PNG being supplied to individual households during the period from October 2020to March 31. As against this, domestic PNG sales stood 5.73 lakh SCMD in Maharashtra and 3 lakh SCMD in Delhi, according to a report by the union government’s petroleum planning and analysis cell (PPAC). Deeper penetration of city gas distribution (CGD) network and wider coverage of natural gas transportation grid along with the presence of multiple companies supplying the piped natural gas have made Gujarat the largest natural gas consuming state in India, said CGD industry players. “Unlike Maharashtra or Delhi, the usage of PNG by households in Gujarat is not just restricted to urban and semi-urban areas. Piped cooking gas is available in semi-urban and rural areas of Gujarat as well. Hence, the consumption of domestic PNG is higher in the state,” said an industry veteran. For instance: Gujarat had 24.21 lakh domestic PNG connections as of March 31, 2021.The number stood at 19.68 lakh in Maharashtra and 10.56 lakh in national capital territory of Delhi. It may be mentioned here that gas distribution licenses for all the districts in Gujarat have been issued, making it the only state in India to be covered under 100%CGD network. Usage for geysers for heating water is also another factor responsible for higher residential PNG consumption in the state, added industry players. With large industrial clusters in Morbi, Surat and Bharuch consuming natural gas, Gujarat also consumes the highest industrial PNG in the country. Around 1 crore SCMD industrial PNG was sold in Gujarat during October20 to March 2021. As against this, Maharashtra saw sales of 6 lakh SCMD during the same period. Out of the total 11,803 industrial PNG connections in India, Gujarat has the highest 5,411 connections.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/piped-gas-guj-usage-two-times-mahas/articleshow/86625383.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Strict action sought over BTech paper evaluation lapses||Thiruvananthapuram: The Save University Campaign Committee has petitioned higher education minister R Bindhu, seeking strict action against widespread irregularities in the evaluation of answer papers of engineering students of institutions affiliated to Kerala Technological University. Flagging the gross mismatch of the marks awarded to two students whom the university had declared as failed when the 7th semester BTech exam results were announced last month, the committee said the answer paper evaluation in colleges under the university were a sham. Two students who failed in the structural analysis paper of the seventh semester BTech examinations were awarded 24 and 22 marks respectively at the first instance. When they applied for revaluation, their marks further came down to 17 and 10. The students, who were convinced of their eligibility for higher marks, approached the Lokayukta. Following the instructions of Lokayukta, the university had set up a committee to review the marks. When two senior teachers appointed by the question paper board chairman further evaluated the answer papers, the students were found eligible for 76 and 46 marks respectively, making them eligible to clear the course. “Though it was not the fault of the students, the university had charged the students Rs 5,000 each for the final round of evaluation. The lapses in evaluation of answer papers are causing hardships to many students. In many such cases, students lose placement opportunities. Criminal procedures should be initiated against the teachers and officials responsible for such unpardonable lapses,” the committee said in its memorandum to the minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-action-sought-over-btech-paper-evaluation-lapses/articleshow/86627869.cms||---

Dilution of Covid fear after mass inoculation and a surge in orders for casual wear due to the work-from-home culture has been helping the garment industry get back on its feet. President of Tiruppur Exporters Association (TEA) Raja M Shanmugam said close to Rs 28,000 crore business happened during 2019-20. “We are expecting it to cross Rs 30,000, given the positive atmosphere,” he said. “The industry witnessed significant growth after recovery from the impact of demonetisation and GST. The damage was huge during the second wave, which threatened the business over subsequent lockdowns. We came out of it after the demand for informal wear started growing.” Industry insiders say the work-from-home culture has brought conceptual change in the dressing requirement globally. Orders for casual wear are growing substantially at the cost of formal wear. Tirupur is popular for casual wear and the surge in order is evident of this trend. There are roughly 1,500 to 2,000 direct export units and another 10,000 to 12,000 subsidiary units like embroidery, dyeing and knitting. Secretary of Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (Teama) G R Senthilvel said that bulk export orders come from European, American and a few gulf countries as the garment industry in Tamil Nadu is seen as an alternative to China. “Technically, we are sound in manufacturing. Yarn makers had imported sophisticated machines a few years ago to produce quality yarn, which are helping us now.” Tirupur garment industry offers employment to six lakh people. Guest workers constitute 35% of the labour force. While the second wave made them return to their native states, about 90% of them have returned. However, there is a dearth of skilled workers, Sakthivel said. “We have also been training new job seekers who are coming to Tirupur in large numbers from other states,” he said. Kumar Duraisamy, an exporter, said some of the small garment factories had closed because of the Covid impact before the beginning of the peak season. “Big companies are managing to sustain themselves unlike smaller ones. The companies can survive only if there are no more lockdowns,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/garment-industry-eyes-10-15-growth/articleshow/86627934.cms||Sampath Kumar

Doctors in the city are seeing an increasing number of patients, who complain of heart problems, like reduced heart function, chest pain, palpitations, heart attacks and even stroke long after they have recovered from Covid-19. While some of them already had heart ailments before getting infected by the virus, the ailments were also found to have remained undetected in some patients prior to the infection. On Wednesday — the World Heart Day — doctors said that the pandemic has made it even more important form people to keep their hearts healthy. “From a condition, like palpitation, which is not so serious, to tachycardia and even sudden death, a whole range of heart diseases are being caused after the recovery from Covid-19. And it is found not only in aged patients but also in younger people,” said Woodlands Hospital cardiologist, Saroj Mondal, who is also attached with the state-run IPGMER (SSKM). While conditions like palpitation are common in recovered patients, what worries the doctors is that younger people are developing serious diseases like Covid myocarditis. “Patients, who had pre-existing heart conditions, and the condition worsening post Covid recovery is one issue. But we are also seeing many patients in their 30s and 40s coming back four to six weeks after recovery. They are being detected with coronary artery diseases that remained undiagnosed prior to Covid,” said Fortis Hospital cardiothoracic surgeon, KM Mandana. Covid has led to changes in cardiac ailments, pointed out some experts. Weakening of heart muscles and Covid-induced cardiac myocarditis have been common since the onset of the pandemic, they said. “Covid has also led to massive heart attacks while the patients are recovering. Similarly, slow and fast heart rate have also been a common post-Covid ailment,” said CMRI Hospital director of cardiology, Anjan Siotia. He added that post-Covid anxiety is often the trigger for heart ailments. “Blood clots in lungs is another severe post-Covid ailment that we had to deal with,” said Siotia. “Eat healthy, exercise daily and quit smoking if one is addicted to it. It takes a long way to ensure a healthy body and a healthy heart. And the pandemic, which has forced a restricted lifestyle, and also the post Covid heart issues have again brought to the fore the necessity to keep a healthy heart,” said Narayana Superspecialty Hospital Howrah cardiac surgeon, Debasis Das. Cardiological Society of India (CSI) that works towards the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the eradication of cardiovascular mortality is set to embark on an initiative — “Connect to Protect” — that will be a significant step forward in convincing the doctors to consider using digital method while they treat patients and beat cardiovascular diseases. It was launched on the occasion of World Heat Day on Wednesday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/docs-fret-over-rise-in-heart-ailments-after-cov-recovery/articleshow/86625435.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to the proposal, in the first phase of the project, the civic body will spend Rs 10 lakh on 500 teachers, who will be trained by a private firm in handling online teaching applications. Activists have criticised the timing of the proposal being pushed, even as offline school resumption is on the cards. “Are they realising that teachers need such training now? And if so, how were they teaching students for the past 18 months? This Rs 10 lakh proposal should be cancelled immediately and the state government should look into the workings of this board,” activist Maruti Bhapkar said. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil confirmed to TOI that the proposal had been tabled by the standing committee members and said he would look into it. When asked about over 50% of PCMC-run school students lacking access to online schooling, Patil said the pandemic has affected the education system across the world, and the phenomenon is not limited to Pimpri Chinchwad.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pcmc-panel-okays-rs-10l-for-e-training-of-teachers/articleshow/86626184.cms||---

This comes in the wake of the opening up of the state tourism industry. Village panchayats under the Candolim PHC have been advised by health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth to urge residents not to lower their guard and to continue wearing face masks, observing social distancing and using sanitisers. Dr Nazareth told TOI that he has requested sarpanchas of Candolim, Calangute, Nerul, Arpora-Nagoa, Saligao and others under the jurisdiction of Candolim PHC to advise citizens, “not to take the situation lightly”. He said, “People have forgotten about the bad days and are taking things casually. Tourists have now started coming, so it’s better to be prepared. Later if cases start going up then nothing can be done,” he said. Although there have been days when there were zero cases in the Calangute-Candolim beach-belt, a few positive cases are still turning up everyday, with around 70-80 tests being conducted across eight villages, he said.

---||Kochi||High court: CDRF can appoint commission||Kochi: A Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (CDRF) can appoint a commission to conduct local inspection to ascertain the true facts on a complaint received by it, the high court has held. The ruling was given by Justice PB Suresh Kumar after considering a petition by P and N Ceramics of Kottayam challenging Kottayam CDRF’s order appointing a commission for inspection on a complaint filed by Issac Sebastian of Changanassery. In the judgment, the court pointed out that a CDRF has the powers similar to a civil court trying a suit while dealing with a complaint. While it true that Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (Section 38-9) does not specifically confer the power to issue commission for local inspection, the object of the Act is to protect consumers from all kinds of exploitation by providing a summary mechanism for timely and effective settlement of consumer complaints, for which, but for the Act, the aggrieved person had to approach a civil court, the judgment said. When the CDRF is conferred with the power to adjudicate consumer complaints, it should necessarily have all the incidental powers for doing so as otherwise the Act would not secure its objective as some complaints cannot be resolved effectively based on oral and documentary evidence alone, the court said while dismissing the petition challenging the CDRF’s order.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/high-court-cdrf-can-appoint-commission/articleshow/86628023.cms||---

---||Nagpur||BJP, Sena leaders laud MLA Jaiswal for ‘speaking truth’, Cong flays him||Nagpur: A day after Shiv Sena MLA Ashish Jaiswal of Ramtek told TOI that his party and the Congress are ideological opposites, and can never be friends even though together in the coalition government, many leaders from his own party and the BJP have agreed with his views. However, local Congress leaders slammed him for demeaning the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents. Jaiswal’s tirade against the grand old party has once again fuelled speculation in political circles about the old saffron partners coming together. “Whatever Jaiswal said is true, as ideologies of both parties are starkly different. It is only to capture power that they came together with the NCP. It is good that the MLA openly admitted the reality, even though the people knew it for a long time. I want to ask Jaiswal why he is not conveying this fact to his superiors in Mumbai?” BJP MLC Girish Vyas said. He added that the MVA government claimed successful completion of two years of their tenure, however, many of their leaders have spoken openly about their differences. Flaying Jaiswal, Congress MLC Abhijeet Wanjari asked him whether there was any option other than Congress in Vidarbha for Sena, if it was not going with the BJP. “Factually speaking, Sena had no vote bank in this region. Only Congress and BJP are in dominant positions here. Therefore, publicly making such statements against coalition partners is not good. If he is claiming that there cannot be any friendship with Congress leaders, then chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must take cognizance of his statement. He must explain why MVA government is in power when leaders from both parties are not on the same page.” Undermining Jaiswal’s statement, Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said the former was not a leader who decides Sena policy and should therefore be ignored. “Basically, three parties came together with the common agenda of keeping BJP away. Hence, the Ramtek MLA is partially right when he said that our ideologies do not match. However, when he says that leaders from both parties can never be friends, such statements should come from the CM or top party leaders. Has he taken permission from the CM before making such statement demeaning coalition partners? We are running the government on a common minimum programme (CMP) and following all principles of the Constitution of India.” Lauding Jaiswal for speaking the truth, a Sena leader said they joined hands with Congress-NCP to remain in power and keep the BJP away from it. “There are hardly any signs of three coalition partners coming together in forthcoming civic polls. Sena and BJP are natural allies as their ideology is the same. The people of Maharashtra had granted a clear mandate to the saffron coalition in 2019 assembly polls. Though both partners split over differences, there is no reason they cannot come together in future, as they were together for over 25 years,” he said. While campaigning for his party’s candidates for the forthcoming zilla parishad polls, Jaiswal had flayed the Congress, which is contesting against Sena and other parties, saying that the party lost prominence after 2019 assembly polls, and it was only due to the CM that they were included in the MVA government and they are surviving.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/bjp-sena-leaders-laud-mla-jaiswal-for-speaking-truth-cong-flays-him/articleshow/86625497.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Mokariya was arrested on Tuesday for helping Pavagadh Temple trustee Raju Bhatt, accused of raping a law student, in fleeing from the city. Crime branch sleuths produced Mokariya before the court seeking his custody for a week. The request was opposed by Mokariya’s lawyer Kaushik Bhatt who argued that his client had no role to play in committing or helping the other accused to commit the crime as alleged by the law student. Judicial magistrate B R Dave, however, remanded Mokariya to custody for two days as police have to interrogate him along with Bhatt. “It was argued that police have to investigate how Mokariya had helped Bhatt in fleeing from the city and helped him by giving Rs 75,000. Police will also be interrogating him about the mediation Mokariya tried to do between the main accused and the complainant before the case was registered,” said additional public prosecutor Sagar Desai. He added that cops will also interrogate him about why he had introduced the complainant to Bhatt when she was living at his hotel. Meanwhile, the investigators have also sought a new date in the hearing of the anticipatory bail plea filed by another accused Ashok Jain. The hearing will now take place on October 4 when the investigating officer is likely to submit an affidavit to oppose the bail. The investigating officer, on Wednesday, also withdrew the application for Jain’s arrest warrant.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/mokariya-remanded-to-police-custody/articleshow/86623908.cms||---

Western Railway was unable to place the girders above the tracks by August, due to this. WR’s general manager Alok Kansal said, “Oxygen supply was diverted for medical purposes across Maharashtra, so fabrication work related to placing of girders could not be undertaken on time.” WR had planned to complete the work above the railway portion by April 2021, but the pandemic and lockdown delayed the deadline by few months. BMC planned to open the bridge for traffic by May 2022. A senior official said, “We will take 3-4 months to complete work on our portion. Work to be carried out by BMC for approaches will get delayed, and opening of the bridge will get delayed till the end of 2022.” The bridge was shut in July 2018, after it was declared unsafe by IIT experts. WR dismantled the span over railway tracks in June 2019. The design for the bridge was approved by Research Design and Standards Organization in March 2020.

---||Coimbatore||HC: Admit vocational students in affiliated pvt colleges of TNAU||Coimbatore: The Madras high court has directed the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Coimbatore, to admit vocational stream students under the 5% quota allotted to them in both its constituent and affiliated private colleges across the state from the next academic year. Students who have taken vocational stream and studied subjects like agriculture practises were not eligible to join agriculture courses in 28 private affiliated colleges of TNAU. Following this direction issued on September 21 by the Madras high court, students who have pursued their higher secondary in vocational stream will be eligible to join private affiliated colleges of the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU), Coimbatore. However, the same students were given 5% seats in 18 constituent colleges of TNAU. Though these colleges offer 10 courses, 5% reservation for students of vocational stream was in only for four courses. Based on a PIL filed in 2019 by S Moorthy, on behalf of his son master D Iniyan, the Madras high court observed that government order does not in any way restrict the application of the 5% quota only to the constituent colleges. It clarified that the 5% quota must be applied to both the constituent colleges and the affiliated private colleges across Tamil Nadu from the next academic year. The court suggested the government to issue a fresh order whereby students coming under the vocational stream can also be permitted to participate under the general category as well as the reservation category in the four courses. “There is no reason as to why their participation should be restricted only to 5% quota,” the court oberved. The suggestion was made as the students who come from the science stream could participate in all the 10 courses without any restrictions both under the general category as well as in the reservation categories. There is also no reason as to why the students falling under the vocational stream should not be given the same opportunity while participating in the admission for the four courses to which they are eligible, the court observed. A senior official from the TNAU said that they have received the communication on the court order. However, poor academic performance was the only reason for restricting the students from the vocational stream in admission to agriculture related courses.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/hc-admit-vocational-students-in-affiliated-pvt-colleges-of-tnau/articleshow/86628046.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The plan to have the commercial run on the entire 508km corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad was revised to 2023 though it was originally slated for August 15, 2022. Railway minister Ashwin Vaishnav said, “The line will open between Surat and Billimora in 2026.” Nearly 1,035 hectares of land, of the total 1,396 hectares needed for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project, has been acquired. In Gujarat, almost 96% of land is acquired. A total of 75% has been acquired of which 25% is in Maharashtra. Work in Maharashtra cannot begin unless 90% of land is acquired. Vaishnav said, “I have spoken with [the] chief minister regarding land acquisition process in Maharashtra and the response was positive.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bullet-train-run-delayed-by-3-yrs-over-land-issues/articleshow/86630069.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Nagpur||Nagpur gives Maharashtra its first balanced cantilever bridge||NAGPUR: Maharashtra’s first balanced cantilever bridge is ready in the city. The 231.20-metre-long bridge has been built over a railway line near Anand Talkies in Sitabuldi by using advanced technique that involves constructing the bridge segments simultaneously at the opposite ends of the cantilever. To overcome the challenge of crossing the Metro viaduct over tracks, MahaMetro zeroed on the balanced cantilever bridge method. “We had to ensure that rail traffic below the Metro corridor was not hampered. This technology is not just the most optimal, but also advanced,” said MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit. Highlighting the challenges faced during building the bridge, MahaMetro’s director (projects) Mahesh Kumar said, “The construction work was carried out during railway block hours when the movement of trains was restricted. This time span is usually around three hours and at night when frequency of rail movement is less. MahaMetro has completed the construction work in record time, without causing any hindrance to rail traffic.” Construction of the bridge, which is at a height of 22 metres from the ground, started in October 2019. As per officials, the country at present has three balanced cantilever bridges — New Delhi, Lucknow and Kochi. “This bridge is heavier than Ram Jhula. We got skilled labourers from Bihar and Jharkhand. The bridge is going to be one of the iconic structures of the city,” added Dixit. The bridge is expected to get operational by the end of this year. A day earlier, TOI reported that work of two Metro stations has come to a halt due to cash crunch. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) have failed to pay their promised 5% share each in the Rs8,680 crore phase I of the Nagpur Metro project, which comes to Rs434 crore. Overall, NIT has to pay Rs189 crore to MahaMetro, while NMC’s pending share is of Rs366 crore. Dixit while interacting with the media on Wednesday said Metro work won’t be compromised, but that of stations and depots might come to a halt. MahaMetro is soon expected to start phase II work, once it gets the nod from the Union cabinet. “In phase II, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) will be shelling out money. The second phase will prove to be very beneficial for both the agencies in terms of better connectivity,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/nagpur-gives-maha-its-1st-balanced-cantilever-bridge/articleshow/86625647.cms||Manka Behl

Chief minister Pramod Sawant laid the foundation stone for the project estimated to cost around Rs 5.73 crore The box will be constructed on the existing canal to facilitate road widening. Traffic will be allowed to operate on top of the box conduit once the road level is increased and matched with the box. The 14-km-long Portuguese era canal commences from Kushavati river at Quepem and passes through Quepem town, covering villages of Paroda, Chandor and ends at Guirdolim. It irrigates around 375 acres of agricultural land. Water resource minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues said that the Margao-Quepem road being a busiest road, the conduit box was a necessity to avoid accidents. Local MLA Clafacio Dias said that many accidents were reported in the past wherein vehicles had fallen into the canal due to the narrow width of the road.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/govt-to-build-conduit-box-over-paroda-canal/articleshow/86628177.cms||---

The incident on Wednesday occurred at Visava, close to Aarey Dairy. CCTV footage shows the leopard lying in wait outside a house. A woman with a walking stick is seen coming out of the house and sitting on the verandah. As soon as she sat down she was attacked by the leopard. The woman, Nirmala Rambadan Singh (55), used her walking stick to fend off the leopard but suffered scratch marks on her face, chest and back. Gajanan Hire, in-charge of Thane Forest Division which oversees Aarey Colony, said claw marks show the attack was by a sub-adult leopard. “Soon after the first attack over a month ago, we sought permission from the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to trap the animal. There’s protocol to be followed before we can lay the trap and which is being done.” The forest department has set up around 10 camera traps around areas of recent attacks . “We’ve ordered for more camera traps to see if it is one sub-adult or more,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-leopard-attacks-woman-she-fends-it-off-with-stick/articleshow/86628136.cms||Clara Lewis

He said 1,250 medical camps would be conducted under the scheme in the state in a year. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the Varumun Kappom scheme was first launched by former chief minister M Karunanidhi. “The AIADMK government discontinued it because of political vendetta.” The main objective of the scheme, he said, was to prevent diseases among the people and ensure their health. “The scheme will benefit the people in all villages, town panchayats, municipalities and corporations in the state. The chief minister has increased the number of camps under the scheme to 1,250 from his earlier announcement of 1,000 to cover the maximum number of population. At the medical camps, doctors will screen one for all sorts of health issues.” He said the camps would address dental, ENT, stomach, intestine, high blood pressure, diphtheria, bone and joint, kidney, heart, and psychiatric related issues. “Special focus will be given on paediatric issues, pregnant women’s issues and women’s health issues in general.” Subramanian said the scheme would be linked to ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ (taking medicines to people’s doorstep) scheme to help the newly-identified patients get medicines at their doorsteps. “We will issue them identity cards mentioning their name, address and health issues.” He said details about the special medical camps - venue, date and timings - would be conveyed to the public in advance. “Camps will also be organized at remote places without transport facilities.” Stalin, meanwhile, handed over welfare measures to the tune of Rs 24.73 crore to 2,530 beneficiaries and inaugurated the regional transport office at Attur that was constructed at a cost of Rs3 crore. The chief minister also dedicated two buildings constructed by Sagoserve at Attur to sago farmers and industrialists. While addressing them, Stalin said the DMK government was working hard to put the district on the international map of sago production. “For that, we need the support of tapioca farmers and sago factory owners.” Stalin promised to fulfil their long-pending demand for sago storage points, minimum price for tapioca and its produces, and curbing adulteration at the earliest. Referring to the two investors’ meetings that the DMK government organized, he said they had attracted Rs 17,141 crore investment from 35 new investors in the first meet and Rs 2,180 crore from 25 new investors in the second meet, while creating employment opportunities for more than 97,000 people. “Tamil Nadu is a good option in South India to set up industries. We will improve infrastructure to meet the investors’ expectations.” Stalin said the state was presently placed third in the country in the export business. “We have been earning Rs 1.93 lakh crore revenue through exports. My goal is to make the state number one in exports in the country.” The chief minister also interacted with the entrepreneurs at the SIDCO park at Karuppur on the outskirts of the city, before he left for Dharmapuri for the night stay.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/salem/stalin-relaunches-kalignars-varumun-kappom-scheme/articleshow/86628142.cms||---

In the viral videos, Iftikharuddin can be seen telling people the benefits of adopting Islam as a religion. Nirmal Kumar Tyagi, former president of Rajkiya Unnayan Basti, told reporters that CTS Basti in Kalyanpur, which was built by the British, has about 600 to 700 families and the population of around 6,000 people. In October 2016, the then divisional commissioner Mohammad Iftikharuddin’s convoy reached CTS Basti. Residents of the settlement were told that they would have to vacate the place, as this land was to be used for the Metro project. Tyagi alleged that when he pleaded the commissioner not to destroy their houses keeping in mind their poor financial conditions, the commissioner started to lure him to convert to Islam by offering him money. “When the commissioner was making this suggestion, a person present there started giving him literature related to Islam,” added Tyagi. “Several attempts of conversion were made in the settlement. However, the locals decided that they would not accept the offer,” he said. “When they approached the court regarding the issue of vacating the settlement, the crisis was resolved. In spite of this, a resident of Chaubeypur remained in touch with the residents for a while, but later stopped visiting the settlement,” Tyagi added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/ias-iftikharuddin-had-even-lured-me-to-convert-to-islam-rajkiya-unnayan-basti-prez/articleshow/86622957.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cancelled by Vasundhara Raje govt, Gandhian institution gets 7-bigha land back||JAIPUR: The Congress government on Wednesday restored the land allotment of one of the oldest and leading Gandhian institutions, Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh (RSSS), which was cancelled by the Vasundhara Raje government in 2014. The approval was given during the empowered committee meeting chaired by the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal to re-allot 7 bighas worth crores near Durgapura. The previous BJP government had cancelled the allotment of land to the institution, sealed its building after claiming allotment conditions were violated. The samadhi of well-known Gandhian freedom fighter Gokul Bhai Bhatt was also sealed by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). Following the cancellation, the Sangh members moved the high court in 2014 and managed a status quo for seven years. Sources in the UDH department said on September 14, a Sangh representative had given an application to the UDH minister to return the land. An official said in September 2011, the state government had allotted eight bighas and eight biswa land on a token amount of Re 1 to RSSS. From the total allotted land, the state government had given one bigha eight biswa land to the affected house owners of the proposed Gol Market project at Jawahar Circle. These owners were living in Gokul Vatika and their land was acquired for the project. A source said, “The Sangh filed a petition against this in the high court and a stay was granted not to allot land to affected owners on March 25, 2014.” The JDA in its investigation report mentioned that the Sangh was violating allotment norms including construction without the approval of the map, carrying out construction for commercial use, which was a violation of allotment conditions. Based on the report, the JDA on June 6, 2014 cancelled the allotment and took physical possession on June 7. The cancellation of allotment courted controversy as many civil society organisations and activists, including Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangthan, RSSS president Sawai Singh, started to protest alleging that the BJP government wanted to allot land to real estate developers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cancelled-by-raje-govt-gandhian-institution-gets-7-bigha-land-back/articleshow/86628195.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC relief for cop booked for sexual abuse of colleague||MUMBAI: Observing that his claim of consensual relations cannot be brushed as-ide lightly, Bombay HC on Wednesday granted anticipatory bail to an assistant police inspector (API) attached to a city police station. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Nijamoodin Jamadar allowed his appeal, and quashed and set aside the May 31 order of a special judge under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, rejecting his plea. The API was booked on a complaint by a 2013 batchmate at a city police station. The FIR, filed on April 16, said he had forcible physical relations with her over a period of time promising marriage, but got married to another woman in March. Senior advocate Abad Ponda argued that neither offences under the SC/ST Act nor the major offence of rape are prima facie made out against his client. But prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde said that in view of allegations that he abused her with reference to her tribe and refused to marry her because of it, the special judge was justified in rejecting his plea in May. The HC judges noted that reference to the tribe and the alleged abuses in that context are mentioned in an April 9 incident that allegedly occurred in a room at a resort. Conversely the allegation, that he refused to marry because she is a member of ST, is conspicuous by its absence at least up to the April 9 incident which did not occur in public view. They noted that in the backdrop of facts, coupled with the situation in the life of the parties, the API’s claim of consensual sex cannot be brushed aside lightly. “Undoubtedly the question as to whether the physical relationship was consensual is a question of fact and is a matter for trial. But on balance, we find the appellant has made out a prima facie case for grant of pre-arrest bail,” wrote Justice Jamadar. If arrested, he will be released on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 with surety.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-court-relief-for-cop-booked-for-sexual-abuse-of-colleague/articleshow/86630086.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Nagpur||Only 5 Covid deaths in Vidarbha among state’s September toll of over 1,500||NAGPUR: From the devastating 5,600 deaths in Nagpur and Amravati divisions just five months ago in April, Vidarbha’s Covid fatalities for September have dropped to just five as on the 29th of the month. Among all eight divisions of Maharashtra, which collectively reported 1,521 deaths till September 25, only Nagpur (4) and Amravati (2) have Covid toll in single digits. Aurangabad with 24 deaths is third last while Latur has a toll of 104 this month so far. Amravati division has the lowest fatalities at two, including one death being a reconciliation from the month of May, and not actually a September death. The other death took place on September 28 at Akot in Akola district. Nagpur division is second last with four Covid deaths this month. As per the state health department data, Pune division has the highest toll at 627. Of the 11 districts of Vidarbha; Nagpur, Amravati, Chandrapur, Akola, Gadchiroli and Wardha have reported deaths this month. Between September 1 and 15, none of the 11 districts had reported any Covid death. The region’s toll opened following a death in Nagpur of a patient from another district. By this account, Nagpur hasn’t seen a Covid death of a resident of the city or rural areas in September. All the five deceased were elderly or middle aged persons with comorbidities. None of them is believed to have been vaccinated. As on September 28, 21,364 deaths have taken place in Vidarbha comprising Nagpur and Amravati divisions. This is 15% of state’s Covid toll, which is over 1.38lakh. Vidarbha’s toll was 21 in terms of percentage in state’s total in April. The percentage started dropping from May (19%), as deaths dropped to 5,246. Now, the figure stands at 0.32% in the state. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said deaths have reduced because the virus in not in circulation as much as it was some months back. “Covid 19 related deaths occur after a month of increase in infection. In Nagpur, the virus stopped circulating due to herd immunity and automatically there are no deaths. Herd immunity is extensive in Vidarbha because pandemic started early in Vidarbha,” he said.

It is alleged that accused Uma Dutt served victim Baljeet Singh food laced with poison.Baljeet was a resident of Khanpur village, Doraha.His friend Sukhwinder Singh said in his police complaint, “Dutt has his shop in Janta Nagar. He has been a customer of Baljeet, 40, for long. Dutt owed him Rs 2.50 lakh as he had not been paying Baljeet. Baljeet had requested him several times to clear the dues but to no avail. Baljeet had also approached the Khanpur village panchayat with the issue. After some panchayat members met Dutt, the latter promised to clear the outstanding amount and handed over to them some cheques as surety. But later he reneged on his promise.”On September 25, Baljeet called up Sukhwinder and asked him to accompany him to Dutt’s shop. “He said he was going there to ask for the money. As I was busy, I could not go along with him. After some time, I again received a call from Baljeet that Dutt did not return his money. He also said that Dutt served him chole bhature and minutes after eating it, his health started deteriorating. Baljeet asked me to pick him up from near Dutt’s shop as he could not drive back. I, along with my nephew, went there. On the way back to Doraha, Baljeet kept vomiting. We admitted him to a private hospital in Doraha, where he died on September 27,” added Sukhwinder.Dutt gave Baljeet food laced with poison to kill him, he said.Daba police station SHO inspector Rohit Sharma said, “On the statement of Sukhwinder, Dutt has been booked under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.

---||Nagpur||Public trust under RTI? HC refers case to larger bench||NAGPUR: Whether a trust registered under Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950, is duty-bound to furnish information under Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005? The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday directed its registry to submit the case papers before the chief justice for consideration whether this issue is to be referred to the larger bench. “As the question relating to furnishing information by a public trust under the RTI Act regularly arises for consideration, we are of the view that an authoritative pronouncement on this aspect by a larger bench is called for. Accordingly, the question on whether a public trust, which is running an institution that receives grant from Maharashtra government, is duty-bound to provide information under the RTI Act deserves to be referred to a larger bench,” said a division bench comprising Justice Atul Chandurkar and Justice GA Sanap. The order came while hearing a letters patent appeal (LPA) by Peoples’ Welfare Society, through president Madhukarrao Wasnik, which runs PWS Arts and Commerce College in Kamptee. Registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, the petitioner runs various educational institutions in the city. On April 15, one Ravindra Wasnik sought information under RTI from the society, which was declined on the pretext that the Act is not applicable to public trusts. The applicant then appealed to the state information commissioner (SIC) under Section 19(3) of the RTI Act. While allowing his appeal, the SIC directed the petitioner to appoint a public information officer and furnish the information sought by the applicant. The society challenged it in the HC before a single-judge bench which held that since it was running a college that received 100% government grant, such public trust/society was thus bound to comply with the RTI Act provisions being a public authority. The petitioner challenged the verdict before the division bench by filing LPA through counsel PR Parsodkar contending that the society was not receiving any grant from the exchequer so as to satisfy the requirement of it being a public authority. The petitioner said merely because the society was running a college, which was receiving grant from the exchequer, it could not be the reason to hold that it was a public authority and thus liable to furnish information. The society and college run by it were separate and distinct entities. It was only the college that was receiving grant and, therefore, the college alone was bound to provide information under RTI, the petitioner argued.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/public-trust-under-rti-hc-refers-case-to-larger-bench/articleshow/86625695.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Sisodia led a road show in the state capital ahead of next Sunday’s GMC election.

But now, the AAP has emerged as a strong alternative to both the Congress and the BJP.” He went on to say: “I am fully confident that we will sweep these polls.” Sisodia said people are watching the work of 27 AAP councillors elected in Surat. “The way they are working, people are now realizing what a councillor can do,” he said. “People just want to get their work done.

---||Chandigarh||Ban permission for more stone crushers in Mahendergarh: Panel’s report to NGT||Chandigarh: A special committee constituted to monitor and execute orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the issues of water and airborne pollution due to stone crushers in Mahendergarh district, has recommended a complete ban on permission for setting up more units in the area. This came to light on Tuesday, when the committee headed by Mahendergarh deputy commissioner Parveen Chauhan, district town and country planner Rohtash Kumar, divisional forest officer Suneel Dave, Central Pollution Control Board regional director Kuldeep Singh, and HSPCB regional officer Dharuhera submitted their report before NGT. The committee also recommended that mineral grinding units shall necessarily put in place measures to ensure that dust or pollutants emanating from units do not mix up with air at the time of grinding as well as at the time of loading and unloading of material. The committee also suggested that the state pollution control board should come out with elaborate guidelines for the functioning of units, so that it could not pollute the area. There are 162 stone crusher units with major grinding machines of minerals installed in Mahendragarh, Bawal and Nangal Chaudhary tehsils of Mahendergarh district. The committee has been constituted by NGT, on an appeal filed by residents of affected villages who had alleged breathing problems and other health hazards due to pollution caused by stone crusher zone. It is alleged that stone crushers were extracting underground water without clearance from Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA). Of the total stone crushers, some have closed down due to action by officials from Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), after they were denying permission by CGWA as well as pollution control board. “We are hopeful of getting this matter listed for final disposal and directives to state government in near future,” said Amit Rathi, an activist from Panipat who has been watching issues related to environment pollution pending with the NGT.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ban-permission-for-more-stone-crushers-in-mahendergarh-panels-report-to-ngt/articleshow/86628221.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Jaipur||Boost for tourism industry as Rajasthan govt gives up to 75% SGST relief||JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday gave tax relief to the tourism industry and offered loans with 9% interest subsidy. According to a finance department order, hotels and tour operators will get refunds for state GST (SGST) paid by them from October 2020 to June 2021. The beneficiaries will be entitled to reimbursement of 50% of SGST during the October 2020-March 2021 and 75% during April-June 2021. “This order shall be applicable to registered taxable persons in the category of hotels, heritage hotels, resorts and tour operators. This order shall not be applicable for standalone restaurants and clubs,” the order said. Additionally, no reimbursement will be available for SGST leviable and paid on rental or leasing services including own or leased non-residential property. Ranvijay Singh, joint secretary of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Rajasthan said, “The relief extended by the government will provide liquidity comfort to the tourism units. The industry suffered the most during the pandemic and we had been demanding a relief package.” Under the Mukhyamantri Paryatan Udyog Sambal Yojana, tourism units will get 9% interest subsidy on loans up to Rs 25 lakh. These loans will be for three years and applications will be allowed up to March 2022. The scheme will be part of the existing Mukhyamantri Laghu Udhyog Protsahan Yojana (MLUPY) and will be governed by the norms of MLUPY. Bars in hotels and clubs have also been exempted from licence fees on extra counters, which will be entitled to 10% exemption of fees. Last year, the state government had offered SGST relief for the April-September period. But the industry did not benefit because there was almost no business and the tax obligations were miniscule. However, some in the industry said that the government should also waive off the penalty imposed on short lifting of liquor. “The demand for liquor disappeared as people remained indoors. In such a situation, the bars cannot sell 10% more liquor as per the policy. So the penalty should be waived off,” they said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/boost-for-tourism-industry-as-govt-gives-up-to-75-sgst-relief/articleshow/86628259.cms||---

---||Nagpur||HC seeks info on removal of speed breakers from highways||Nagpur: Expressing concern over speed breakers set up on highways in complete violation of rules, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Wednesday sought reply from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as to what steps it has taken to remove them.While asking the NHAI to file a new affidavit, a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor also sought information on the penalty proposed or imposed on the contractors for shoddy works on the NH-53 from Nagpur to Malkapur.“The affidavit should explain reasons behind absence of plants and trees on some portions of the median, poor maintenance of median, neglect of existing plants and trees, absence of signage and shoulder paint indicators at many places, lack of maintenance of highway on regular basis, delay in carrying on repairs, shoddy repair works, removal of defects and deficiencies, and improvement of road condition,” the bench said before adjourning the hearing by two weeks.Hearing a PIL (No 22/2019) by lawyer Arun Patil through counsel Firdos Mirza highlighting the pathetic condition of Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon road and Wardha-Sindkhed Raja road which led to many fatal mishaps and loss of precious lives, the judges pointed out that NHAI had filed affidavit of a different road, which was not the subject of PIL.“On going through the NHAI’s affidavit, we get an impression that the officer has confused himself with another road and not the one which is under scrutiny here. The affidavit refers to the stretches of road from Amravati to Kurankhed to Shelad to Nandura and to Chikhali. All these places except for Nandura, prima facie, would be on a different road. NHAI should file a fresh affidavit depicting the situation regarding stretches of road between Amravati to Malkapur and Amravati to Nagpur,” said the bench.In the last hearing, the HC had slammed the respondents for worsening conditions of national highway passing from Amravati to Jalgaon via Akola, and sought a status report on its repair and widening works. The NHAI had awarded a contract for building Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon stretch to a private firm, which went bankrupt and since then the work was stopped for the last couple of years. Despite many requests to the authorities, no progress has been made and its condition continues to worsen, thus making driving extremely risky and difficult.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/hc-seeks-info-on-removal-of-speed-breakers-from-highways/articleshow/86623016.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel, dealing with an application by one such licence holder for stay on the closure, said that prima facie the new mechanism did not violate any of his rights. “Government ought to be given free movement in the joints. It ought to be kept in mind that change is inevitable and excise policy is no exception. New experiments are always being permitted in matters of policy. Prima facie, we do not want to prejudice the resultant effect of the policy,” the bench observed. It pointed out that to withdraw from the sale and distribution, in a phased manner, of liquor was a policy decision of Delhi government under the new regime, which has its own benefits. “Prima facie, the mechanism which is going to be adopted under the new policy does not violate any right of the petitioner... Even if L7 licences are brought to an end with effect from September 30, there is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner because there is no discrimination,” the court said. The court stated that the public at large was not going to suffer on account of the closure as other categories of vends would continue to operate. “There are different types of licences for different purposes, from L1 to L35... Public at large is not going to suffer. Other licences will continue. Public will have to move out of their comfort zone.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-govt-has-power-to-float-excise-policy-hc/articleshow/86625735.cms||---

After landing at Dehradun’s Jollygrant Airport from Prayagraj, the eight-member team drove straight to Anand Giri’s ashram, located along the Ganga at Gajiwali village on the outskirts of Haridwar. The ashram had been sealed a couple of days ago by Haridwar Roorkee Development Authority and its power supply was also severed. Thus, the CBI team had to make necessary arrangements before raiding the ashram. According to sources, the CBI team is looking for Anand Giri’s laptop, computer, mobile phones and other electronic evidence. It is alleged that the investigation agency is looking for a video that Anand Giri allegedly used to blackmail Narendra Giri, thus prompting him to take the extreme step. While being taken inside the ashram, Anand Giri addressed media persons with folded hands saying, “Please let the CBI team do its work. The investigation will bring out the truth.” Till the time of filing this report, the CBI team and Anand Giri were in the ashram and the investigation was ongoing. It is expected that the CBI team will next visit the Niranjani Akhara too. Meanwhile, circle officer (city) Abhai Singh, along with Shyampur police station officials and over a dozen policemen, was present at the ashram as the CBI raided Anand Giri’s ashram. Earlier on September 20, Mahant Narendra Giri was found dead in his room at Prayagraj-based Baghambari Math. The police had recovered a handwritten suicide letter in which Narendra Giri accused his disciple Anand Giri, along with Adya Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari, of mental harassment. Thereafter, the three were arrested on charges of abetting the suicide.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/cbi-team-raids-anand-giris-ashram-in-haridwar-for-electronic-evidence/articleshow/86623031.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The HC said it would give a month for the state to comply, questioning a department secretary why it was taking so long. The HC bench of S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav had last month permitted construction of 6-lane Thane Creek Bridge III (TCB III) on Sion-Panvel highway but observing that the bridge work would impact customary rights of fisherfolk at Thane Creek, directed the setting-up of a TCB compensation panel. Advocate Zaman Ali, for a traditional fishing community from koliwadas which had petitioned the HC to protect its rights in the wake of the TCB-III project in an ‘eco-sensitive zone’, said despite the HC orders six weeks ago, no action was taken to determine compensation yet. P P Kakade, government pleader submitted a compliance and course action update before the bench on Wednesday, by Atul Patne, commissioner of fisheries, Maharashtra, which said six months may be required to complete the compensation process to the eligible project-affected. He said that “there was a delay in setting up a TCB compensation committee as necessary approvals and confirmations were required to be taken” but assured that the first meeting would be held in the first week of October.  He said a state-wide policy for compensation of fishermen for projects by different agencies would need cabinet nod.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/livelihood-infra-govt-gets-1-mth-to-show-its-compliance-in-mumbai/articleshow/86630101.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||As others quit fray, sole bidder Kukreja got Air India land||Nagpur: Bagging the Air India land deal was a cakewalk for the city realty firm Kukreja Infrastructure as it was the only bidder for the property.The company quoted a rate of just Rs1 lakh above the reserve price of Rs33 crore for the landmark Air India (AI) building, spread in an area of around 27,000 square feet. Kukreja Infrastructure bid Rs33.01 crore for the land. The Nagpur property was put on the block along with the real estate in other cities, including Mumbai. Even as other parties had their presence in the bidding by paying earnest money deposit (EMD) for the Nagpur property, none other than Kukreja Infrastructure actually bid. The auction took place on September 23 and 24.Shravan Kukreja of Kukreja Infrastructure said, “There were three to four other parties present at the time of bidding. They had paid the EMD. However, we were the sole to bid,” he said.As others did not bid at all, the company could take away the deal at almost close to the reserve price. Separate bids were being invited for properties spread in different parts of the country, including Mumbai. The EMDs had to be paid for the properties that were to be bid for, he said.Pankaj Roshan, a broker, confirmed that one of his clients had plans to buy the property for his personal use, but later backed out even after logging in to bid by paying the EMD. Another party, which had also paid the EMD, did not throw its hat in the ring.The auction took place on the MSTC Ltd (formerly known as Metal Scrap Trading Corporation) e-auction site. This was the second round of auction for the land at Nagpur. The first round was held in July, when a number of persons had inquired, but none actually bid for the property. Some of the firms are learnt to have paid the EMD during the first round, but did not bid. Following this, the reserve price was reduced by 10%, bringing it to the current level. Sources said the property was considered to be rather costly, which prevented others from bidding.Kukreja said it was an open auction and anybody could join during the 24-hour window by paying the EMD.In any case, this is being dubbed to be the biggest ever realty deal so far in terms of rate per square feet. The company plans to come up with residential-cum-commercial project on the land, said Kukreja. Further plans will be drawn soon, he said.So far, the company has only got confirmation of its bid being the highest from the MSTC, he added.Sources in the realty business said had there been some competition, the price may have gone even higher.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/as-others-quit-fray-sole-bidder-kukreja-got-air-india-land/articleshow/86623040.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Ahmedabad||Project delayed, bullet train run between Surat and Bardoli by 2026||AHMEDABAD: Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that a small segment of the bullet train project, between Surat and Bardoli, will have a trial run by March 2026. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation Limited had earlier set a target of March 2024 for completion of the stretch between Ahmedabad and Vapi. The minister, talking to reporters said work using the latest technology has begun and about 50 pillars have already been erected. The minister said that he had recently spoke to the Maharashtra chief minister about the project and the delay in land acquisition. He said that there are some issues and these will be resolved soon. NHRSCL officials said that the minister’s deadline of 2026 was on target, as Covid had delayed the project early by nearly two years and now only a section will be complete by 2026. NHRSCL has not set any deadline for completion of the entire project. The minister announced that the government on Wednesday approved the doubling of the Rajkot-Kanalus railway line in Gujarat and the Neemuch-Ratlam railway line in Madhya Pradesh. The decision was taken by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The total cost of the project will be Rs 1,080 crore, he said. The total length of doubling of the line is 111km and the project will be completed in four years. Vaishnaw said, “The project of doubling of Rajkot-Kanalus railway line will create new economic possibilities in Devbhumi Dwarka, Porbandar, Sikka, Okha and Jamnagar, with heavy industrialisation, ports and cultural values. People will get better facilities with these projects,” he said. The single railway line is currently running at 157 per cent capacity, with 30 pairs of passenger trains and eight pairs of goods trains, the track is saturated, he said. “With doubling, the track capacity will increase, and we will be able to provide more services in the region,” he said. The railway line between Rajkot and Kanalus currently handles goods traffic of coal, cement, fertilizer and foodgrain. Personal attention to project in sanctuaryIn response to a question on the Visavadar-Delvada track conversion, Vaishnaw promised that the railways will not disturb the eco-sensitive zone. He said he will personally look at the project and will monitor it, as it passes through a sanctuary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/project-delayed-bullet-train-run-between-surat-and-bardoli-by-2026/articleshow/86625781.cms||---
---||Mumbai||436 lives lost in rain-related tragedies in Maharashtra since June||MUMBAI: Torrential rains that have lashed Maharashtra this year have claimed 436 lives in monsoon-related incidents and tragedies across the state since June 1—the highest toll in recent years —and affected crops on over 17 lakh hectare of total area. Data on the tragedies compiled by the relief and rehabilitation department shows the deaths reported this year are the highest in recent years. Of these, the highest deaths— over 220—were reported in July when heavy rainfall had severely affected the Konkan region, especially Raigad and Ratnagiri, and parts of western Maharashtra, triggering several landslides. Losses due to floods were pegged at Rs 4,000 crore. This year, the state has borne the brunt of two cyclones. The first was Tauktae, which skirted the coastal districts of the state in May causing damage to 16,000 hectare of farmland and over 10,000 structures were partly or fully damaged. A total of 20 people had died in different incidents due to the cyclone. The state had announced a package of Rs 252 crore as compensation for the losses. Now, heavy rain due to Cyclone Gulab has affected the drought-prone Marathwada region the most. At least 17 people have died and over 300 people have been evacuated in the past 48 hours. Although rainfall has subsided in most parts of the state, water being discharged from dams is still causing waterlogging in the region. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also reviewed the situation on Wednesday and directed officials to ensure that stranded people are taken to safe places. Indian Air Force is helping with relief and rescue in Latur and Osmanabad. “This year, the state has been severely impacted by natural disasters. There are several revenue circles that have reported rainfall in three digits in a short span of time. Since June so far, 17 lakh hectares of crop area has been damaged, but the number may further go up to 22 lakh hectares when all the field surveys are completed,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. He said the state has sought financial assistance for the losses due to natural disasters but there is no reply yet. “We have sought Rs 1,659 crore towards losses due to floods in July. A central team is expected to come to the state in the first week of October for a visit and a decision will be taken after that,” he said, adding last year, the state received a fraction of the amount it had sought as compensation. Officials said Thackeray is likely to announce a Marathwada tour once flood waters recede to review the situation and demand for a special package for the region is being made.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-436-lives-lost-in-rain-related-tragedies-in-state-since-june/articleshow/86628317.cms||Bhavika Jain

Of late, orthopaedic doctors in the city have seen a spike in backpain among those belonging to different sectors that switched to work from home following the lockdown.Doctors said unusual methods of working and extended work hours from home have led to a surge in people complaining back and neck pain. Such cases never had previous history, they said.Dr Mohammad Faisal, professor, department of Orthopaedic at GMCH, said many patients who never had any history of back problems are visiting with complaints in the last one year. “IT professionals are more prone to back problems. But work from home has increased back pain incidence not just among the earlier group but also non-IT background people who are now working from home. The main reason is that the employees don’t have proper ergonomic sitting arrangement. Because of casual behaviour, many sit on the bed. Also, as they don’t need to travel, the work hours have been increased to 10-hour shifts. I have seen increase in backpain cases because of work from home,” he said.Dr Nikhil Malewar, spine surgeon and director of Orthoavenue Hospital, said lack of exercise and weight gain have only added to the problem. “Since gym and exercise centres were also closed for several days, people couldn’t follow their routine fitness schedule and ended up with back and neck pain,” he said.Dr Malewar added that potholes too are likely to be blamed for people’s plight. “People commuting by their own vehicles are at the receiving end of the bumpy ride. During this rainy season, there is significant increase in patients coming with complains of back pain. Bumpy rides put pressure on the discs, joints and ligaments of the vertebral column which leads to early degeneration of the disc, joints and bones. Elderly people travelling on a bad road can get a spinal fracture as they often suffer from osteoporosis,” he said.Dr Tushar Bhure, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Kingsway Hospital, said increased screen time has affected the younger population. “Watching TV or using a phone lying down leads to upper back problems. Use of more than one pillow in this position is also harmful,” he said.InfoPRECAUTIONSRide carefully, slowly on road with potholesSit straight while driving or working from homeExercise regularlyKeep your weight under controlDrink lot of waterAvoid smoking, tobacco and alcohol consumptionRED FLAGSMost of the back pain are transient and get relieved with rest and anti-inflammatory medications for couple of days. However, if the pain is persistent, not getting relieved with medications, pain is shooting down the legs, pain is associated with numbness in the foot you should immediately contact a specialist.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/wrong-sitting-in-wfh-causing-back-problems-among-non-it-professionals/articleshow/86623065.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||In IT age, babus cannot plan export scheme due to lack of data||Nagpur: The District Industries Centres (DIC), which have been asked to draw up plans for promoting exports from the region, have been stuck for want of data. The DICs, which come under the state’s industries department, need district-wise data on commodities exported and imported from the area under their jurisdictions. However, there is only a long official channel which can get them the information. The DICs will have to contact the Union commerce secretary through the industries secretary of the state, requesting the former to share the data.The central government has roped in state governments to push the export promotion initiatives. A model of one-district one-product has to be adopted, said a source.The DIC here and in other parts of Vidarbha are also drawing up plans on these lines. For that basic data on exim trade is needed to come up with plans. Knowing the kind of commodities which are imported will also help promote domestic industries making the same items, said a DIC official.The DIC, which approached the customs department office in the city to get the details, was told that the district wise data may not be easily available with it. The matter was also taken up during the export conclave meet held by ministry of commerce last week at the Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA).Currently, only consolidated data is available at the Nagpur office of the customs department. This means exports or imports even from Gondia or any other district will also be shown as those from Nagpur, said a source. The DIC in Nagpur and its counterparts elsewhere, however, need it to be segregated for each district of the region.The customs officials have suggested that the matter should be taken up with the industries secretary of Maharashtra government, who can in turn contact Union commerce secretary to share district-wise details.Now, the industries commissioner in Maharashtra will be writing to the ministry of commerce for getting the data, said a senior official in DIC. Once the communication takes place, the data may become easily available, the source said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/in-it-age-babus-cannot-plan-export-scheme-due-to-lack-of-data/articleshow/86623029.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ludhiana||VB to probe how institutes kept 5 prime properties beyond lease||Times News NetworkLudhiana: A vigilance bureau inquiry has been marked into the municipal corporation’s lapses that allowed five institutes to keep prime properties for years beyond lease wihout paying the revised rates or the arrears calculated on market price.The inquiry is based on a complaint filed by RTI (Right to Information) activist Rohit Sabharwal and the first hearing is on October 5. Sabharwal had alleged that the municipal corporation had to suffer a loss because its officials had misplaced the documents of these properties on purpose. Of the five properties, Arya College, Kundan Vidya Mandir, and Khalsa Education College cover 5 acre each, while Dharam Seva Trust of Jawahar Nagar Camp and Shri Krishna Charitable Hospital of Model Town cover 2 acre each.In 2019, the MC had decided to revise the lease amount of these properties, putting these in the "very prime" category. Sabharwal mentioned in his complaint that years were gone since these leases expired but there was neither any renewal based on the revised market rates nor any recovery of the arrears based on the market rates. A committee formed for the sale of the MC properties or to give those out on lease had recommended recovering a monthly rent from these lessees.Every month, Arya College was supposed to pay Rs 13.20 lakh, KVM Rs 12.72 lakh, Dharam Seva Trust Rs 3.50 lakh, Shri Krishna Charitable Hospital Rs 25 lakh, and Khalsa Education College Rs 90.75 lakh. However, no official took any step to recover the arrears based on these recommended rates applicable since the expiry of the leases, which caused a huge loss to the public exchequer.The officials even refused to provide the previous agreement papers but it was proved that the ownership of these properties was with the government, which makes these five properties under illegal occupation, which either must be vacated or arrears for these recovered, if the eases are not renewed on the committee-recommended rates. The RTI activist claimed that: "It raises a question that where is the original record of these properties? Also, why the leases were not renewed and why the officials did not recover the arrears all these years? All these answers should be found, as the public exchequer was robbed in this case."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/vb-to-probe-how-institutes-kept-5-prime-properties-beyond-lease/articleshow/86623054.cms||---

The court gave the order on a plea by Nimbaram seeking to quash the FIR against him. The RSS leader has been absconding after the FIR was filed. The court said at this stage it could not come to any conclusion. According to the FIR, the BVG company representative and the husband of suspended Jaipur-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar discussed 10% kickback of the outstanding dues of Rs 276 crore to the company in the presence of the petitioner at RSS office Sewa Sadan. The investigation in the case is pending. So at this stage there is no scope for quashing the FIR. The court of Justice Satish Kumar Sharma had directed the ACB to conduct the investigation independently without any political interference. After the investigation the ACB would present the chargesheet or final report before a competent court. The court directed the public prosecutor to file a progress report before the next hearing on November 11. Nimbaram in his petition said BVG had expressed its intention to donate for the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya. But since the period of donation had expired, he had suggested that if the company was willing it could make donations to the Pratap Gaurav Kendra project. The RSS leader claimed that he had nothing to do with the tender being floated by the Jaipur-Greater Municipal Corporation. ACB filed an FIR against Nimbaram along with Rajaram Gurjar, husband of Somya Gurjar, and garbage collection company representative Ommkar Sapre after a video about clearing the dues to the company on a kickback of Rs 20 crore surfaced. Nimbaram approached the high court seeking to quash the FIR alleging that he was being framed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/hc-asks-acb-not-to-arrest-rss-leader-asks-him-to-cooperate/articleshow/86628320.cms||---

Under the HIPEC technique, patients undergo high-dose chemotherapy in the abdomen at a high temperature. The procedure is helpful in killing cancer cells. While conventional cancer drugs don’t enter the blood circulation directly, the HIPEC technique provides an effective way to administer a large dose with minimal side effects. The treatment method has been proved to be highly effective in cases of intestine or ovary cancer. Dr Pankaj Garg, head of the cancer surgery department at Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital, said that a 79-year-old woman, who has appendix cancer, was the first patient to be given high-dose chemotherapy in the hospital. He added that Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital is the only medical facility in Uttarakhand where the HIPEC machine has been installed. Meanwhile, Mahant Devendra Das Ji, the chairman of Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital, congratulated the doctors on performing the HIPEC procedure.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/doons-shri-mahant-indiresh-hospital-starts-high-dose-chemotherapy-for-cancer-treatment/articleshow/86623082.cms||---

A source with the Thavathiru Santhalinga Adigalar Arts, Science and Tamil College said associate professor K Thirunavukkarasu used to chat with the girl student at night. “He had sent her his shirtless photo as well. She had discussed the issue with her senior S Sathish Kumar, who had completed the course and left the college, and he had taken up the issue with the college management last week.” Meanwhile, screenshots of the chat were leaked on social media. The source said Sathish, along with his friends, had first approached Thirunavukkarasu, who had threatened to kill himself if they were to lodge a formal complaint with the college authorities, while confessing to have sent her messages with sexual connotations. “They took video of him confessing to the offence and submitted the same before the college management.” Subsequently, the college management issued a show cause notice to Thirunavukkarasu on Saturday (Sept 25), seeking his response in three days. He submitted his explanation on Monday. “College secretary Maruthachala Adigalar placed Thirunavukkarasu under suspension the same afternoon as the latter’s response was not satisfactory. He also directed the associate professor not to enter the college premises until further orders,” the source said. The copy of the suspension order has been sent to the regional joint director of higher education and the complainant. The source said the college management had formed an internal committee on Wednesday to probe the incident based on Sathish’s complaint. However, the girl student has not come forward to lodge any formal complaint so far. Meanwhile, a section of students staged a sit-in in front of the college on Wednesday and raised slogans against the associate professor. They also urged the college management to dismiss Thirunavukkarasu from service with immediate effect. When contacted, the Perur police said they had not received any complaint in this connection. “We deployed a few police personnel on the college campus as the students were staging protest,” a police officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/sex-talk-with-girl-student-lands-college-professor-in-hot-water/articleshow/86628314.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Schools to fests, Delhi keen to be back on track||NEW DELHI: Saying that the academic gap had to be bridged quickly, the association of the city’s private schools said on Wednesday that the authorities should consider resuming lower classes in schools immediately after Dussehra. Other school principals too reiterated it was time for the children to leave the comfort of their homes for classrooms. The statement of Action Committee, an association of over 400 private schools, came in the wake of Delhi Disaster Management Authority announcing on Wednesday that there would be a phased reopening of schools for all classes. Students of classes IX-XII have already returned to school since September 1. S K Bhattacharya, president, Action Committee, said, “We understand that the possible spread of Covid-19 during the festive season is a genuine concern. However, the decision should be reconsidered after Dussehra. It is time all stakeholders realise there are academic gaps and take proactive decisions to remedy them.” School principals similarly said that it was time the children left the confines of their homes and returned to the new normal in schools. Tania Joshi of The Indian School said, “We are ready to reopen for students of the lower classes. But whether parents will give their consent is, of course, another question. Even now, the attendance in Class IX is thin, so for junior classes it is difficult to conjecture. The thing is the children have also got very used to studying in the comfort of their homes. If blended learning continues, the attendance in schools will remain poor.” In private schools in the city, the attendance in Class IX, which does not face a board exam, has been very thin, as low as 5% in some schools. Ashok Pandey, director, Ahlcon Schools, was okay with the authorities deciding to wait till Dussehra ended to take the final call. “Till then, we should figure out the protocols and sort out the guidelines once and for all,” he said. Though parents are still divided about sending their children back to school, there are many who want classes VI-VIII to resume. Fawad Ahmed Shamsi, whose daughter studies in JD Tytler School, said, “I read about experts saying Covid is going to be endemic, so I guess there is no option but to send the children back to school. We must live with Covid now and cope by taking precautions. For the child’s self-development, the school environment is essential.” Mahindra Singh, the father of a Sardar Patel Vidyalaya student, demurred. “I may not send my daughter to classes as soon as they begin,” he said. “I will wait for some days to assess the circumstances. The festive season and the pandemic situation then will give us an indication. I realise this is the new normal and have to accept it.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/schools-to-fests-delhi-keen-to-get-back-on-track/articleshow/86625898.cms||---

Opposition leader in legislative council Pravin Darekar said the government must declare a wet drought and provide compensation without waiting for a panchnama. Fadnavis said it was shocking to learn 436 persons had died this monsoon. “Several lakh hectares of crops have been destroyed by floodwaters. Farmers are in great distress. After Nisarga and Tauktae cyclones, Konkan farmers are yet to be compensated,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/immediately-release-relief-payout-for-marathwada-farmers-in-mumbai-fadnavis/articleshow/86628406.cms||---

Bhavreen Kandhari, an environment activist, said, “Dumping of soil and debris is again happening on the Yamuna floodplain in violation of a National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. Soil is also being dumped into the river. The dumping started on Monday night.” She also shared images of debris lying on the floodplain on Twitter. According to the NGT order of 2015, dumping of any kind of waste or construction or demolition (C&D) debris on the Yamuna floodplain is banned. Anyone found violating the order is liable to pay environmental compensation up to Rs 50,000. Dev Patel, a local resident, said, “The dumping is occurring at night on both the Yamuna floodplain and into the river. I saw two trucks leaving the area after dumping waste here.” Officials of Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the land-owning agency, were unavailable for comments. “Floodplains play an important role in maintaining the flow of rivers, help recharge groundwater and provide a habitat for aquatic biodiversity, the most significant sign of a river’s health,” Yamuna Monitoring Committee had observed in its final report. A report submitted by Delhi Pollution Control Committee to Union Jal Shakti ministry said 36,200 metric tonnes of C&D waste lying on the floodplain had been removed and a compensation of Rs 1.5 crore had been imposed from 2018 to July 2021 for dumping of malba and illegal parking on the Yamuna floodplain. As dumping of C&D waste and garbage and parking of illegal vehicles are prohibited on the floodplain, 457 challans were issued from 2018 to July 31, 2021. Out of the Rs 1.5 crore fine imposed on violators, Rs 21.2 lakh was recovered. The report stated that while Rs 21.3 lakh compensation was levied in 2020, Rs 36.4 lakh fine was levied from January to July this year. In July this year, construction debris was found dumped on the Yamuna floodplain near Commonwealth Games Village. An FIR was lodged in the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/dumping-of-debris-on-floodplain-flies-in-face-of-green-tribunal-order/articleshow/86625913.cms||---

The administration also confirmed one death while another person who died had dengue-like symptoms. Hundreds of patients were seen lining up before OPDs of hospitals and health centres across the district as the health department struggled to cope with the rush. The department is setting up screening camps in villages and interior areas to ensure no fever cases go unreported. Divisional surveillance officer (DSO) Dr Ashok Taliyan said, “32 new cases of dengue were reported on Wednesday taking the total toll to 439.” “Among the 439 cases, 157 are active. We have reported one confirmed dengue death while one teen died of dengue-like symptoms but her test wasn’t conducted,” added Tayal. Commenting on the death of 28-year-old Ravi Kumar from Kalindi village, the DSO said that there is no confirmation on it. The health department is saying that weather is responsible for vector-borne disease which is common at this time of the year. The doctors are also advising the patients not to take viral fever lightly and ensure that they take medication only after consulting a doctor. “We are in touch with the civic body and continuous fogging is being done to ensure no larva breeding takes place in residential localities. All hospitals have been put on alert to tackle fever, dengue and malaria cases,” said chief medical officer, Meerut, Dr Akhilesh Mohan||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/meerut-reports-32-fresh-dengue-cases-one-death/articleshow/86623204.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||Kumbh Covid scam: HC grants relief to owners of Max Corporate Services||Nainital: In a major relief to the owners of Max Corporate Services, one of the firms accused in the fake Covid testing scam, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) gave both Mallika and Sharat Pant protection from arrest till October 8. The court has now directed the Pants to cooperate in the investigation and approach the chief judicial magistrate of Haridwar for interim bail. On Wednesday, the bench of Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe was informed by the counsel appearing for Pants that section 467 (forging a document which purports to be a valuable security) of the Indian Penal Code was added to the original FIR only with the intention to secure their arrest as none of the earlier sections carried the punishment of more than seven years. The counsel appearing for the state government, however, informed the court that investigation revealed several offences committed by the accused and that’s why section 467 was added. As reported by TOI earlier, after the section was added to the FIR, police moved to a lower court in Haridwar seeking the arrest of Sharat and Mallika Pant as well as Navtej Nalwa of Nalwa laboratories who was also named in the report. Subsequently, the lower court issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused on August 29 but all of them have been absconding since then. Later, Pants challenged the addition of section 467 to the original FIR. Hearing the case, the HC directed the investigating officer to only proceed with the arrest of the couple if the conditions of the CrPC are satisfied and not on ipse dixit (unproven statement).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-scam-hc-grants-relief-to-owners-of-max-corporate-services/articleshow/86623200.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Jaipur||Covid fee row: Three private schools in Jaipur served notices||JAIPUR: Three private schools here have been served notices by the join director of school education on Wednesday following allegations of harassment in recovering fees and barring students to attend online classes. Seedling Public School, Jawahar Nagar, Jaipuria School, Milaap Nagar, and MPS Group of Schools in Pratap Nagar, Tilak Nagar and Chaura Rasta have been served notices by the joint director of school education Ghanshyam Dutta Jaat. The complaints were made by Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh secretary Manish Vijayvargiya. Vijayvargiya said parents of kids of three schools have raised different issues. “Seedling Public School has refused to give transfer certificate to a student because he was not able to pay fees. The parent of the child has written to us that due to pandemic, he was not able to pay full fees but the school did not consider it and refused to give TC,” said Vijayvargiya. Similarly, in MPS Group of Schools allegations have been made that a fee committee was formed without consulting parents in any of the matter and without following the guidelines of Rajasthan School Fees Act. Another allegation was made by a parent that school was barring students in attending online classes for not paying fees. Allegations have been levelled against Jaipuria School that it stopped online classes because of non-payment of fees, although as per Supreme Court guidelines, schools are not allowed to do that. All the schools have refuted the claims made by the parents. CEO and director of Seedling Public School Sandeep Bakshi said these claims were false and classes of all students were going on properly. “We have not stopped classes of any student. In both online and offline mode, classes were on,” said Bakshi. MPS School principal Ashok Vaid said the allegations made by parents were false and school administration had followed all the due procedure to form the fee committee and no student had been debared from online classes. TOI tried to contact Jaipuria School administration, but they didn’t respond.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/3-pvt-schools-in-city-served-notices/articleshow/86628382.cms||---

Nagorao Tiknare (50), his wife Rukmabai (45) and their 11-year-old son Chandrakant had to spend the night on the terrace of their inundated house as an earlier rescue operation, which used safety boats, proved futile on Tuesday evening. Saqueb Osmani, the Latur district disaster management officer, said the flow of the Manjra river water prevented the rescue teams from reaching the stranded trio despite many attempts. “The IAF helicopter could reach the spot around 7 am on Wednesday morning and immediately started the rescue mission. Initially, the trio could not climb up to the helicopter using the rope thrown to them. Therefore, a small bed was tied to the rope in order to airlift them,” Osmani said. Latur district witnessed five rescue operations in which the lives of 101 citizens were saved in the Renapur and Latur tehsil limits. In Aurangabad district, around 52 people from the Lasur village were rescued on Wednesday morning after the Dheku river level rose further. Ajey Choudhari, the Aurangabad district disaster management officer, said a National Disaster Response Force team (NDRF) was in the area in anticipation of more flooding. Among other areas, Osmanabad district administration said around 459 people were shifted to safer locations, including 16 individuals who needed help of the NDRF teams to come out of the floodwater, over 24 hours ending on Wednesday morning. Six people trapped in the Dautpur village in the tehsil limits of Osmanabad were rescued using a helicopter. Meanwhile, no major rainfall activity was reported in Marathwada over the 12-hour period ending on Wednesday evening and this helped ease the flood situation in many places. Earlier, the region reported 24 mm showers on average, ending 9am on Wednesday. The rainfall tally since June 1 has been 1,020 mm, 151% of expected showers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/aurangabad/iaf-rescues-flood-hit-family-in-latur/articleshow/86620591.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nashik||News of fresh exams eases worries of candidates||Aurangabad: Amid complaints from several candidates in Marathwada and a few other regions in the state missing the State Common Entrance Test (CET) due to rain-related issues, the government on Wednesday announced fresh examinations for those affected. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, in a video posted on Twitter, said that the CET cell would declare the dates for fresh examinations soon. “Various areas in Marathwada, Vidarbha, Konkan and Western Maharashtra have seen heavy rainfall, leading to flooding of different rivers. In Marathwada, connectivity issues have surfaced with many roads getting submerged. This has led to many students being deprived of taking the CET. Such students need not worry as the chief minister has asked for necessary intervention,” he said. Samant said all students, who had already enrolled for the CET but were unable to appear for the examination due to rain-related issues, would be considered for the fresh examinations. The date for the examination is expected to be announced in a couple of days. A group of students from Aurangabad could not take the CET for engineering courses as the road connectivity between Jatwada area and the city was snapped due to overflowing of Harsul dam, which submerged a connecting bridge on Tuesday. CET aspirants from Hingoli and Nanded could not reach the examination centre on Wednesday as the MSRTC bus in which they were travelling was stuck near Latur due to overflowing of Manjra river.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/news-of-fresh-exams-eases-worries-of-candidates/articleshow/86620554.cms||---

Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma and state law minister Brajesh Pathak were the guests of honour of the concluding day function. The ministers praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath for promoting the tourism of UP. The visitors gave mixed response to the event. While one Dr Pratibha Singh said there was lack of awareness about the carnival, Anju Shrivastava felt the event should be made into a regular affair. “It was a very nice experience on seeing such a carnival for the first time,” said Adarsh Kumar Pandey. “The carnival should be extended for at least five more days so that more people could enjoy,” said Digvijay Pandey. The carnival witnessed many cultural events including mesmerizing folk and Sufi performance by the Anhad Band. The performance of SaReGaMaPa fame Harshit Mishra also left people craving for more. Several other events like magic show, puppet dance and folk dance of UP were also organized, besides the food festival. Few of the winners were Nitin Rawat of Ritz Continental (best food stall), Aradhana Jaiswal (rangoli), Shashak (quiz) and Shreyashi (poster).||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/tourism-carnival-concludes-on-a-come-again-note/articleshow/86628391.cms||---

---||Delhi||Play list: Ramayana without mela, food stalls in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The uncertainty among groups that organise the re-enactment of stories from the Ramayana during the Dussehra festival period was finally lifted on Wednesday. Delhi Disaster Management Authority permitted Ramlilas to be organised this year, though with strict Covid restrictions. The organisers are now planning ways to implement Covid-appropriate measures. Accordingly, the Lav Kush Ramlila will have no mela, food stalls and giant swings or on-site camps for members, said its committee secretary Arjun Kumar. A limited number of passes will be given out and the entry of visitors to the Ramlila site restricted, as per DDMA’s directions. “Unlike in the past, when we distributed over one lakh passes, this year we will keep the celebrations lowkey,” said Kumar. “We have spoken to some news and religious channels to telecast our Ramlila live in Delhi and neighbouring states. We will engage volunteers at the venue to maintain social distancing and other Covid protocols.” The Lav Kush Ramlila Committee is planning to invite President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other dignitaries, to attend its Ramlila and Dussehra celebrations. “The Ramlila will start from October 6 and conclude 10 days later,” said Kumar.” The committee has invited Union minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal to sing a bhajan and MP and former Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari to act in the play. Kumar said all efforts would be on live streaming the Ramlila to allow the maximum number to watch the performance. Vijay Sarathi, head of Sri Ramlila Committee, will soon approach the authorities to clarify some points. “The Ramlila Maidan, where we stage our event, has been converted into a 500-bed Covid facility by Delhi government. We now need to resume talks with the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the land-owning agency, and other authorities for permission to use the field,” said Sarathi. “Ours is the oldest Ramlila in the capital and was started by Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar around 180 years ago.” Shri Dharmik Leela Committee, which organised its own performances at the Red Fort Ground every year, is still to confirm whether it will be going ahead with the event this year. “There are just eight days to go for Ramlila and we still have to apply for and get various permissions from the Archaeological Survey of Indian, Delhi Police and Delhi Fire Service. We can take a decision only if assured we can get these permissions in time,” said Dhiraj Dhar Gupta, committee secretary. Organising members also said there were too many restrictions, such as on a fair and food stalls, for the event to be grand. “We have approached the artistes, but we are uncertain about the nine-day event,” said Ravi Jain, press secretary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/play-list-ramayana-without-mela-food-stalls/articleshow/86625939.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Coimbatore||Flyover work hits bus services to GN Mills Junction||Coimbatore: The decision to temporarily stop bus movement to GN Mills Junction to facilitate Mettupalayam flyover work has affected hundreds of school and college students in and around the junction. Till Monday, buses were allowed to the junction via KNG Pudur Road and Udayampalayam Road. However, police and the national highways wing of the state highways department started diverting heavy vehicles, including buses, on KNG Pudur Road and Udayampalayam Road on Tuesday in the wake of deck work commencing at GN Mills Junction. It is to be noted that there are a couple of schools, an arts and science college, government ITI for boys and girls, and other government facilities like employment exchange offices in and around the junction. The students and local residents have to now either walk anywhere between 1.5km and 2km or hire autorickshaw to and from the nearest bus stop. Hundreds of students coming from the villages near Karamadai and Mettupalayam said they were forced to walk all the way to and from VG hospital, where the nearest bus stop was located. An ITI student hailing from Karamadai said, “It takes 30 minutes for me to reach VG hospital to catch a bus. It is too tiring to walk in the evening after the classes.” A student of Kongunadu Arts and Science College said earlier they had to walk only up to Vellaikinar Junction, as buses were allowed till that place. ‘Now, buses are allowed only till VG hospital and we have to walk for another 10 to 15 minutes.” M Devendran, secretary, Coimbatore District Roads Protection Association, said the flyover construction was progressing at a snail’s pace, affecting the students, residents and other commuters. Pointing out that the work was started in mid-2018, he said the flyover should have been ready by November 2020. “Officials should have put in place service roads before commencing the work. They should at least do it now and ensure bus movement is not affected,” he said. A highways department official, who didn’t want to be named, said a service road would be provided soon for hassle-free vehicular movement. However, bus movement on the service road may not be feasible, because of the space crunch. “Bus movement is stopped since more space is required for the deck work. We will discuss with police, district administration and the transport department and take measures to address the problems faced by the students and local residents.” The official said Covid-19 was one of the reasons for the delay in completing the project. “While we have instructed the contractor to complete the work in another six months, it might drag on for another couple of months.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/flyover-work-hits-bus-services-to-gn-mills-junction/articleshow/86628400.cms||V Devanathan

With the new entrants, the cultivation area of the crop and sugarcane production has also seen a considerable jump. District cane officer R D Dwivedi said, “After discovering a new variety seed of the cane, called '0238', the recovery rate (conversion rate from molasses to sugar) of the sugarcane has increased remarkably. Earlier, farmers used to get 50 quintals from one bigha land. Now they are getting 70 quintals.” Now, two lakh farmers are growing cane in comparison to 1.6 lakh in 2015, he said. According to officials, in the crushing year 2016-17, the recorded sugarcane growing area stood at 1,26,872 hectare which has now reached 1,68,015 hectare in 2021-22. The cultivation area of sugarcane in the district has increased by 42,596 hectares during the last five crushing years. As many as eight sugar mills in the district have started preparation for crushing for the 2021-22 season. “The sugarcane farmers had been paid Rs 2,200 crore in 2015-16 by these mills. Now, the last payment was 3,200 crore in 2020-21. The payment of the sugarcane has increased Rs 1,000 crore in five years,” the cane officer said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/new-sugarcane-variety-draws-42000-farmers-to-sweet-crop-in-5-years/articleshow/86623255.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The project was launched by PM Modi in 2016, a few months before the assembly elections. Speaking at a virtual address to the party’s ‘shakti kendra’ conveners and booth poll in-charges, the BJP national president said, “The Rs 12,000-crore project would boost tourism in Uttarakhand and get the state global recognition, making it a much sought-after tourist destination.” He urged booth-level party workers to strengthen the party at the grassroots level by reaching out to voters and apprising them of the works done by the central and state governments. “The BJP is the only party that banks on its booth-level workers, not leaders, to contest and win polls,” he said, adding that BJP will again form the government in the state and register a ‘massive victory’ in the elections. “Quest for transparency and good governance has made people of Uttarakhand choose the BJP in the 2014, 2017 and 2019 elections; and the party will once again come to power in 2022 under the leadership of Puskhar Singh Dhami,” Nadda further said. Meanwhile, the saffron party has named former union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank as the head of its manifesto drafting committee, while the election management committee will be headed by state BJP president Madan Kaushik.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/char-dham-all-weather-road-work-to-be-completed-by-2022-nadda/articleshow/86623235.cms||Gaurav Talwar

With this, all the 11 major dams in the region were simultaneously witnessing the release of water, which is a rare sight for drought-prone Marathwada. While all major dams were filled to the brim last year during October, these reservoirs have crossed the designed storage capacity relatively earlier this year due to a good run of monsoon, authorities said. As per the flood control room of Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC), 18 gates of Jayakwadi dam were lifted by three and a half feet, facilitating the release of water at the speed of 66,024 cusec by 5.30 pm on Wednesday. Jaising Hire, the assistant superintendent engineer with Command Area Development Authority of GMIDC said barring Jayakwadi dam, other 10 major irrigation projects were already witnessing discharge of water due to heavy rain in catchment areas during the first half of September. “With Jayakwadi dam also filled now, the region has sufficient water to suffice the drinking water needs, irrigation and industries till the arrival of next monsoon,” he said. Majalgaon dam (27,642 cusec), Manjra dam (5,242 cusec), Vishnupuri dam (2.4 lakh cusec), Lower Dudhna dam (25,992 cusec), Yeldari dam (84,393 cusec), Siddheshwar dam (69,888 cusec), Isapur dam (48,203 cusec), Lower Manar dam (2,541 cusec), Lower Terna dam (16,004 cusec) and Sina Kolegaon dam (8,869) were among major irrigation projects from Marathwada that have been witnessing increased discharge by Wednesday due to heavy rainfall in past 48-hours.

Minutes before she died, in a chilling reminder of the Sabarmati dowry death in February this year, she recorded a voice note for her brother, asking him to explain what she did to her parents. The purported minute-long audio clip went viral on Wednesday and is now part of the police investigation. Her husband and father-in-law were detained under the Dowry Prohibition Act. “Dear brother, you won’t like what I am about to do. Please explain everything to mother and father. They should not worry. After I die, do not take even a spoon from this house. Nor should you file a police case,” Pooja is purportedly heard saying. “When your sister is no longer around, there is no need to maintain any ties with this house. Don’t do anything. You have done a lot for your sister, please do this as well. Don’t take the car either. These are my last words to you. Do listen to me.” In February, Ayesha Banu, also 23, had allegedly jumped into the Sabarmati river after months of harassment. Before she killed herself, she had recorded a video message for her family saying she was setting her husband “free”. Her husband Aarif Khan was booked for abetment to suicide. Pooja, a graduate from a family of farmers, had married Sanjeev Kumar, 24, last year and had been living with his family — his parents, brother and sister — at Kamalpur village in Bijnor since then. “Before they got married, Sanjeev’s family said he worked as a TTE (travelling ticket examiner) with the railways. When my sister married him, she found out he was unemployed,” said Pooja’s younger brother Raj Kumar. “She asked him, and he said he was on leave because of the pandemic.” Things turned worse after that. “Sanjeev and his family would torture her, forcing her to get more as dowry. We had already given a lot, including a car, to Sanjeev,” Raj said. “It was not suicide. My sister was killed for dowry. On Tuesday afternoon, Sanjeev and his family informed police that they had found Pooja hanging. Another brother of Pooja, Ranjan, to whom she had addressed her voice note, filed a complaint at the Chandpur police station in Bijnor, on the basis of which Sanjeev and his father were booked for culpable homicide and under the Dowry Prohibition Act. “The two of them have been detained. The dowry charges are being investigated,” said Bijnor SP Dharamvir Singh. The investigation has been handed over to Chandpur circle officer Shubh Suchit, who said, “I have heard about the audio clip though I don’t have it myself as of now.” Cops said the audio clip is part of the investigation. Pooja’s autopsy has been done, which concluded hanging was the cause of death.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/death-by-dowry-woman-23-records-chilling-message-for-bro-before-killing-self/articleshow/86623311.cms||Harveer Dabas

MNS leader Hemant Gadkari criticized both central and state governments for their failure to give respite to citizens on the prices of essential commodities, fuel and electricity. Gadkari said the transport wing of MNS also took part in the rally as most of the autorickshaw owners and drivers were badly affected in the last one-and-a-half years due to lockdown, and now the rising fuel prices were taking a toll on them. Gadkari added that their leader Raj Thackeray had repeatedly raised this issue with the central and state government but the “deaf governments are hardly concerned about the citizens” and hence, MNS was again out on the streets of Nagpur to fight for the common man. Later, a delegation comprising Hemant Gadkari, Ajay Dhoke, Vishal Badgeh, Sachin Dhote, Manisha Papadkar and Sangeeta Sontakke met divisional commissioner Prajakta Lanjewar Verma and submitted a memorandum in this regard to her at the divisional commissioner office.

The company allegedly worked in collusion with education department officials, three of whom face an inquiry, to claim 90% of the project cost before abandoning the project, embezzling crores. In 2008, the Centre had released funds for the project, launched in 2004, to build residential schools for girls from weaker sections. Each school would have space for 100 girls and classes from VI to VIII. The first violation occurred in how the contract itself was awarded. “The rules say that the work can only be given to a government agency or a cooperative agency. But here, it was allotted to a private company. The basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) then, Varun Kumar, was suspended,” said a Bijnor-based official on condition of anonymity. That one company had been awarded projects across 17 districts was also a red flag. In Bijnor alone, 13 schools were to be built at Rs 36 lakh each. The deadline was 2010. But the company did not finish even one while it siphoned off 90% of the budget. In 2012, the company was blacklisted and an FIR registered at Bijnor police station. Three company officials were booked — managing director Bhikarey Singh, chief manager Vinod Singh and project manager Dharmender Singh. They had all been on the run. “I had set up a team to nab one of the accused, Dharmender, from Banda. The company had embezzled over Rs 3 crore while abandoning the project,” SP (EOW, Meerut sector) Swapnil Mamgain said. “A departmental inquiry was set up against three former BSAs.” The Bijnor-based official added that besides Varun Kumar, the two others were pulled up for allegedly manipulating the amount of money the company was asked to pay up. “Varun’s successor Sanjay Kushwaha was issuing recovery notices to the company of amounts far lower than that determined by the inquiry committee. When he was gone, the one who followed him, RP Srivastava, did the same,” the official explained. Meanwhile, the abandoned schools were handed over to government agencies, like the public works department and the construction and design services, to finish 10 schools. The agencies refused to work on three buildings because they “were not constructed in keeping with mandatory parameters”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/crores-siphoned-off-in-up-school-building-scam-pvt-co-claimed-money-never-finished-work/articleshow/86623278.cms||Sandeep Rai

More than four out of five CVD deaths were due to heart attacks and strokes and one-third deaths occurred in people under 70 years. On the occasion, Sharma said people must adopt a healthy lifestyle to prevent cardiovascular diseases. He said apart from normal exercise, traditional exercises like cycling and swimming should be included in the daily routine to avoid heart-related diseases. He said CVDs were the leading cause of death globally. He said every year an estimated 17.9 million people die from this disease. Cardiologists organised a cycle marathon to create awareness among people on heart-related diseases. A large number of the general public along with doctors took part in this marathon. CSI vice-president Dr GL Sharma said the cycle marathon in Jaipur kicked-off from Jaipur Medical Association (JMA), SMS Medical College. Meanwhile, the police commissionerate and The Art of Living organised a Yoga, Pranayama and Meditation camp at Police Line Stadium, Chandpole.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/cardiovascular-diseases-leading-cause-of-deaths-globally/articleshow/86628454.cms||---
---||Mumbai||3 dozen Maharashtra dams overflow for first time in recent years||MUMBAI: As Cyclone Gulab swept through the state and had the worst-ever impact on the drought-prone Marathwada and Vidarbha regions, standing crops on an estimated 11 lakh hectare of land were completely washed away. On the other hand, following heavy rainfall, water stock in more than three dozen dams in the state has crossed the 100% mark. It is for the first time in the state’s recent history that water stock in such a large number of dams has crossed 100% capacity. Significantly, considering the record stock in the dams, the number of water tankers now has reduced to a single digit, to only six, in the entire state. According to the water resources department website, water stock in the 3,267 dams across the state stood at 83% on September 29 compared with 84% on the same day last year. In the Amravati region, the total water stock was 97% (98% last year), Aurangabad 89% (91%), Kokan 99% (87%), Nagpur 89% (88%), Nashik 92% (96%) and Pune 93% (94%). Significantly, most dams in Marathwada have more than 95% water stock. A senior bureaucrat said although the high water level in dams will help tide over the summer of 2022, Cyclone Gulab will result in a huge burden on the cash-strapped state. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said, “One after another, Maharashtra has been badly affected by cyclones. First it was Nisarga, followed by Tauktae and now Gulab. We are yet to compensate farmers affected by Nisarga as well as Tauktae and now hundreds of farmers in the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions have been affected. Out of the 10 districts in Marathwada, seven have been the worst hit,’’ he said.  “We feel that central cabinet members from Maharashtra must step in to knock at the doors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for immediate financial assistance,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-3-dozen-state-dams-overflow-for-first-time-in-recent-years/articleshow/86628533.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Tech to infuse life into Eldeco’s dead lake||LUCKNOW: Over two decades back, Eldeco-II was developed near Rae Bareli Road with a vision to provide better quality of living to citizens. Neglect of civic and development authorities over the years, however, has made the residential colony uninhabitable. The 36,026 sq m lake has turned into a solid waste dumping ground, while filth from the broken sewerage finds its way into it, polluting the water and killing aquatic life. The condition has deteriorated to such an extent that scores of homes in the low-lying area are flooded every monsoon. Taking cognizance of the problem, Lucknow Development Authority is all set to introduce bio-engineered water cleaning technology to cleanse the lake. It would be for the first time when bio-engineered cleaning technology is being used in UP . Officials said certain microbes would be added and specific plants and vetiver grass will be sown to remove the toxicity of the water and the lake would be beautified. The project is estimated to cost around Rs 5 crore. LDA chief engineer Indushekhar Singh told TOI, “Over the years, the water of Eldeco lake has been contaminated by surrounding untreated water sources, leakage from damaged sewerage and dumping of solid waste. LDA aims to rejuvenate the perennial lake by using bio-remediation, phytoremediation and bio-engineering components.” “It would be the first such effort in the state and would be a pilot project for other water bodies in the city and state,” he added. Assistant engineer Alok Singh, said, “In bioremediation, microbe colonies break down or remove toxins and harmful substances from water and soil, while phyto-remediation involves growing vetiver plants for containment of contaminants in soil, sludge, sediments, surface water, and groundwater.” “We expect that the rejuvenation project will start showing results in nine to 12 months,” he added. Eldeco II resident Neeraj Kumar said, “It took two decades for authorities to realise the importance of the lake. Hopefully, they will restore the broken roads also.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/tech-to-infuse-life-into-eldecos-dead-lake/articleshow/86628447.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The HC has directed the state government to not transfer (or divert) MKP College land to any non-educational institution while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the move. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma after a former student of the college, Sonia Beniwal, moved HC. Beniwal argued that using the premises of educational institutions for non-educational purposes goes against the law and therefore, should not be allowed. The court, meanwhile, has also issued notices to the state government, University Grants Commission (UGC), Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University, DM Dehradun, and MKP College Society. All of them have been given four weeks to respond. The college, founded in 1902, was once a premier institution for women’s education in the country but has of late been caught in a legal battle between its founding family and the current managing society.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-stays-state-govts-decision-to-shift-doon-collectorate-to-mkp-college/articleshow/86623317.cms||Prashant Jha

The investigating officer told Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar that the Forensic Science Laboratory results were awaited and are likely to be filed by October 15, following which the chargesheet would be filed. The court directed the FSL director to expedite the process and listed the matter for October 21. Meanwhile, the court also sought a reply from the investigating officer of the matter on an application seeking preservation of CCTV footage of the day of the incident and the day after. “Let notice be issued to the IO as to whether the CCTV footage of August 1 and 2 can be preserved or not,” the judge said. The jail authorities, on the other hand, informed the sessions court that all the accused in the said case were completely safe and secured in prison. The submissions were made in their reply to an application claiming that the accused faced threat to their life in prison and were allegedly beaten in a police van when they were brought to court. “It is not possible to provide a separate van for their court production. As per the report, directions have been given by the jail superintendents to all the officials to ensure their safety during court production and in jail,” the judge noted. During the court hearing, one of the accused Laxmi Narayan’s counsel claimed that a case of murder was not made out against his client and there was a delay of 10 hours in registration of the FIR. To this, the judge said, “Let the FSL reports come… How can you say it now that such a case is not made out against the accused? There are extra judicial confessions. Extra judicial confession is admissible although it is a weak piece of the evidence.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/additional-charges-in-9-year-old-girls-rape-murder-soon/articleshow/86626048.cms||Usha Das

Though there has been no third wave yet, kids suffering from seasonal and viral diseases have flooded the state’s biggest government-run child-specialty JK Lon Hospital. Since all the 45 ICU (medicine) beds are fully occupied and the scene in wards is even more concerning where more than one patient is crammed on a single bed, the hospital is planning to shift patients to Covid RUHS Hospital, which is currently lying vacant as Jaipur is reporting few cases. “We are in touch with RUHS Hospital where we have been allocated 200 beds for paediatric patients. Here all the beds are full. Also, we are renovating two wards as preparation for Covid treatment. Since we require more beds for paediatric population, we have 200 beds in RUHS Hospital and 60 beds in Sethi Colony Hospital allocated for us,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. It is likely that from October 1 children will be shifted to RUHS for treatment of seasonal diseases. As of now, the average occupancy of beds in JK hospital is 1.5. “We are working on decongesting the hospital. We will shift children to RUHS to ensure ideal situation of one bed, one patient,” said Dr Ashok Gupta, head of the department (medicine, paediatrics), JK Lon Hospital. Dr Gupta said if more than one patient is accommodated on a single bed, there are chances of cross infections and other hospital acquired ailments.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/jk-lon-to-shift-kids-to-ruhs-as-icus-and-wards-are-full/articleshow/86628478.cms||---

The number of doses administered was much less than the target set by the Kolhapur administration. The authorities had planned to vaccinate 2 lakh citizens in a single day. The administration has 2.17 lakh doses of vaccine in stock due to the low turnout of beneficiaries during last few weeks. Farukh Desai, the district vaccination nodal officer, said the number of doses administered on Wednesday is almost two and half times more than doses administered on regular days. He said the reasons for low turnoutwill be found soon. The large number of beneficiaries turned out during 11am to 2 pm. The administration had planned to vaccinate 500 beneficiaries at each centre. Officials said the high turnout on Wednesday was from rural areas mainly due to presence of large number of vaccination centres. Also high turnout was of people from the age group of 18 to 44 years. The administration had allowed on spot registration or walk in registration. The doses to all citizens above 18 years of age were administered in the drive. So far 23.09 lakh citizens have been administered with the first dose, of them, 9.33 lakh have been fully vaccinated. The district administration had set a target of fully vaccinating 31 lakh citizens On the occasion of International Day for Older Persons, on October 1, a special drive has been planned to vaccinate those above the age of 60 years.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/over-82k-doses-administered-in-kolhapur-on-single-day/articleshow/86620662.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Covid damage: Rajasthan NGOs and sarpanchs mull ways to bring girls back to schools||JAIPUR: Several state-based NGOs and sarpanchs have asked the state government to conduct learning surveys of students in government schools especially girls to assess the damage caused to their learning in the pandemic year. These NGOs held a consultation here on Wednesday stressing ton the need to take a feedback from civil society members on student dropout last year. During the meeting, girl students from 10 districts narrated the tale of how they were unable to attend classes since last March. The recommendations on restoring girls back to school will be submitted to the NITI Ayog. “The state should have introduced remedial classes for adolescent’ girls rather than reopening schools. The majority of girls have not been able to keep pace with online education due to non-availability of mobile phones and Internet connection. Even if the family had access to the same, priority was given to the boys,” said Shabnam Aziz of Educate Girls. The adolescent girls from different districts narrated their tale of how they suffered in education due to the pandemic. Sultana, a girl from Ajmer, recalled how she dropped out of school last year due to loss of livelihood of her family. “It is not about me, but several girls in my village had to leave school last year due to the closure and non-availability of mobile phones and Internet. I am lucky that one NGO helped me in joining the school but not others,” said Sultana. Mukesh Goswami, sarpanch of gram panchayat, Gaharda in Bundi, said closure of schools had cast a spell on girls. “It is not only about education, but girls were devoid of sanitary pads and free ration kits under the midday meals.  Our GP is keen to launch a campaign of tracking and re-enrolling girls which are only possible after the state gives us institutional support or frame a policy for the same,” said Goswami. The exact figures of dropout in the pandemic year is not known since no statewide survey had been conducted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/covid-damage-raj-ngos-and-sarpanchs-mull-ways-to-bring-girls-back-to-schools/articleshow/86628497.cms||---
---||Delhi||Late approval takes shine off Durga festivities in Delhi||NEW DELHI: After Delhi Disaster Management Authority gave its nod on Wednesday for festivals to be celebrated in public with precautions, several Durga Puja organisers in the city talked of lowkey events. Many added that with just two weeks left, there wasn’t much time left anyway to organise grand functions. Delhi Durga Puja Samiti in Kashmere Gate, the oldest in Delhi, will do without the idol again, the second year in a row. Som Prakash Mitra, member of the Samiti, said, “We will go ahead instead with ghot, or kalash, pujo this year too. Even if the new guidelines permit us, we don’t have the time to finalise an idol. It takes at least a month and a half to prepare the idol.” Mitra added that there wouldn’t be the usual entertainment section at the puja, neither distribution of prasad. “Around 4,000 people used to queue up at our pandal for bhog. That is not possible now,” he said. “We will wait for the detailed notification and then take a call on the number of visitors we will entertain.” At Chittaranjan Park, the hub of Durga celebrations, several organisers felt handicapped by the lack of time to think of mega pandals and gala gatherings. P K Paul, secretary, East Bengal Displaced Persons’ Association, which has 16 puja committees under its purview, said, “We will go to the district authorities on Thursday for the relevant puja permissions. As of now, we have decided to go ahead with ghot pujo only. Bhog will not be served this year either.” Tamal Rakshit, one of the puja organisers at CR Park’s B Block, similarly said the celebrations would be scaled down, perhaps with only ghot pujo on Ashtami. “At this juncture, even if we get the required permissions, it will be impossible to erect a pandal,” Rakshit said. A decision on the number of visitors to be allowed at CR Park Kali Mandir will be taken once the notification is issued, said Pradip Ganguly, member of the managing committee. “We will replicate what we did last year,” disclosed Ganguly. “Those interested in bhog will need to make prior bookings online and people can view the rituals online. We have ordered an idol, but it is much smaller than what we normally install.” New Delhi Kali Bari will, however, both distribute bhog and have dhaakis for festive cheer. Swapan Ganguly, one of the puja organisers, said, “The plan is to keep the number restricted. We realised last year that with 200 people in attendance, we could conduct a very smooth puja.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/late-approval-takes-shine-off-durga-festivities/articleshow/86626027.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Lucknow||Housed in wobbly buildings, govt schools perilously poised||LUCKNOW: The recent collapse of ceiling of two classrooms at the Government Girls’ Inter College, Narahi, has sent alarm bells ringing in a number of dilapidated government and government-aided schools of the district. According to teachers’ associations, around 70% of the government primary schools in Lucknow are awaiting maintenance for decades due to financial crunch. Though the condition of government inter colleges is comparatively better as they got funds recently under the Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, condition of about 87 government-aided secondary schools out of 101 in the district is worrisome, they added. While government schools are managed directly by the state education department, the government-aided schools are run by trusts with aid from the government. A TOI reality check found some veracity in teachers’ claims. Bishan Narayan Inter College in Hazratganj, which is converted into a polling booth during elections and where prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to cast vote, is crying for attention. In the absence of maintenance for decades, the condition of the classroom is such that there is no difference in studying in a room or in the open. With doors and windows missing and cracks on walls, Lucknow Inter College in Lalbagh, is also in ruins. In Ram Bharose Maiku Lal Inter College, reaching the classroom becomes a challenge on a rainy day as the entire campus gets flooded. At Balika Niketan Inter College in Kaiserbagh, plaster and bricks can be seen coming off from the roofs. “As many schools are running in rental buildings, the responsibility of maintenance is neither taken by the school authorities, nor landlords. Schools running in government-owned buildings get just Rs 10,000 per annum for maintenance,” said Sudhanshu Mohan, president, UP Primary Teachers’ Association. Explaining the reason behind the bad state of government-aided schools, general secretary, UP Ashaskiya Sahayta Prapt Vidyalaya Prabandhan (an association of managements of government-aided schools) Anil Agarwal said, “Prior to 1971, these colleges used to get government grants for maintenance, but later state decided to pay only for teachers’ salary. As students’ fees are nominal, not even enough to pay electricity charges, nothing is left for repair works.” State secretary UP Secondary Education Teachers Association, RP Mishra said, “As most government-aided schools are over 50 years old and students’ fees cannot be hiked, the state should support them as it does the government schools under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.” President of the Rajkiya Shikshak Sangh, Chaya Shukla said, “Another factor that obstructs maintenance of government schools is that the funds are mostly given for making new classrooms/buildings and not for repair of existing infrastructure.” Renovation, repairs top priority: Official Additional chief secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla said, “Renovation of schools is our top priority. We are already making a list of such schools not only in the city but in the state, which are in urgent need of repair.” Additional DIOS, Lucknow, Rita Singh, said, “Survey of schools that need urgent repair has begun. The GGIC, Narahi, was earlier a primary school and managed by the basic education department. It was upgraded to a secondary school sometime back and hence its repair work could not be carried out.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/housed-in-wobbly-buildings-govt-schools-perilously-poised/articleshow/86628516.cms||Mohita Tewari

Joshi said that the Leader of the Opposition is daydreaming. The people of Rajasthan have elected the government for full five years and the government would complete its term. Joshi said that Kataria has been in the news earlier also for his controversial statements. He had to apologise publicly for the controversial statement made on Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram. His statements are not taken seriously by the people of his own party, nor are the people of the party concerned with his statements. In BJP, Satish Poonia, Rajendra Rathore and Kataria all give statements to hog the limelight. With the announcement of the dates for the by-elections in two assembly seats in Rajasthan, the political activity has intensified. While talking on the reshuffle of the Gehlot cabinet in the state on Tuesday, Kataria had said that the Congress government would fall with the reshuffle as so many claimants for a few berths in the ministry.

The prices in the retail market may also feel the after-effects in a few days as the farmers are unable to take their produce due to the heavy rainfall in Lasalgaon. Lasalgaon APMC secretary Narendra Wadavane said the continuous heavy rain in the district has had an impact on onion arrivals. Farmers are unable to bring their produce to the markets because of the rain, he said. Other Lasalgaon APMC officials said the daily supply has fallen by almost 70% — from more than 15,000 quintal around four days ago to just 4,500 quintal now. Accordingly, the wholesale prices of onion at Lasalgaon has shot up from Rs 1,450 per quintal around four days back, to Rs 2,250 per quintal now. Vegetable supplies have also been affected in other mandis of the district. The supply of green vegetables at the Nashik APMC, which is the largest vegetable mandi in the district, has dropped. According to Nashik APMC secretary Arun Kale, the APMC has seen a 30% drop in supply of vegetables over the past two-three days due to the rainfall. This has also led to 15-20% increase in the wholesale prices of vegetables at the mandi. Tomato prices double The Pimpalgaon APMC, which is known as the largest tomato mandi in the country, has recorded a 41% drop in arrivals over the past week. The supply of tomatoes dropped from 2.42 lakh crates (20 kg a crate) a day around a week ago, to 1.40 lakh crates a day now. The average wholesale tomato prices have also increased from Rs 15 a kg to Rs 30 a kg over the past three days due to drop in supply.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/rain-hits-onion-vegetable-supplies-to-apmcs-wholesale-rates-increase/articleshow/86620743.cms||Tushar Pawar

The victim was identified by Ramnagariya police as Priyanka Dutta, a resident of Jankipuran locality in Lucknow. She had moved to Jaipur on July 30 to work as an intern at a five-star hotel located in the Jawahar Circle area. According to SHO Purushottam Maheriya, the accident took place early Tuesday morning. “The car lost control and skidded before hitting a tree off the road. The car driver was also injured in the mishap, but his condition is stable,” he said. Priyanka’s mother filed an FIR at Ramnagariya police station against the car driver Divashu under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (causing death by negligence). Her mother told police that Priyanka was living as paying guest (PG) in a rented room in Durgapura. “The mother claimed that she had received a call from Priyanka’s other friend who was present in the car. He told her that Priyanka was sitting in the back seat while Divashu was driving the vehicle when the accident took place,” an official said. Police said that the car skidded at least three times before it hit the tree, possibly due to excessive speed. “It is an isolated spot in a rural area. There is barely any movement of people around that place during wee hours,” the official said. Cops suspect that friends had gone out for an early morning drive when the accident took place. “We have not been able to speak to other passengers who were present in the car because they had also sustained injures,” the official added. Meanwhile, Priyanka’s mother came to Jaipur and the body was handed over to her after the post-mortem.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/25-yr-old-lucknow-girl-killed-in-car-mishap-on-goner-road/articleshow/86628580.cms||---

The video was widely shared online, sparking outrage, as such incidents of tourists riding or driving on the beach negligently are growing frequent. The incident also prompted chief minister Pramod Sawant to state that the government will be forced to initiate strict action if such violations on Goa’s beaches continue by tourists. Porvorim police later identified two of the violators, brothers Harchitter Singh and Harvinder Singh from Punjab, and fined them as per the Motor Vehicles Act, for negligent driving. The tourists were, however, not booked. “When tourists come to the state, they should follow the law of the state.

Addressing participants virtually at the Ficci South India GST Conclave, Kerala finance minister K N Balagopal pointed out that prior to the introduction of the GST regime, Kerala had an income growth of 14-16% every year but after the introduction of GST, there was a stagnation of its income in the two years followed by negative growth due to Covid-19. He said that state governments being major spenders, any decline in income will impact their spending capacity and will impact the overall economic growth of the country. Describing the GST system as ‘shaky’, Tamil Nadu minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said, “The fears of the loss of autonomy have been fully realised because the way the system has been set up, the states now have very little independence in any matter of taxation….” However, given the current state of affairs, he rooted for making the GST system more robust by leveraging data from GSTN to make decisions. Karnataka industries minister Murugesh R Nirani pointed out that the GST council has been addressing the concerns on a regular basis and constantly improving the system.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/states-rue-excessive-tax-centralisation-seek-use-of-data-to-take-decisions/articleshow/86626054.cms||---

---||Dehradun||U’khand HC extends DP Yadav’s bail, reserves judgement in conviction case||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday extended the short-term bail of DP Yadav, a former member of parliament (MP), on health grounds. Yadav had moved the high court after he was convicted of Ghaziabad MLA Mahendra Bhati’s murder by the CBI court in 2015. The CBI court had found that Yadav and his associates shot Bhati at Dadri Railway Crossing (Gautam Buddh Nagar) on September 13, 1992. While the case concerning Yadav’s plea challenging his conviction is ongoing in the high court, he has sought bail citing an urgent need to undergo treatment for his spine-related problems. He has already been granted bail thrice on this ground. This time, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma said that Yadav cannot be granted bail again and again. To this, Yadav’s counsel told the court that he could not be operated upon because of old age, several co-morbidities and depression and therefore, needs more time for treatment. The CBI, on the other hand, has opposed the bail application arguing that treatment for spinal problems seems an excuse and a condition should be imposed that if he is not treated in the next 30 days, he shouldn’t be allowed to seek bail on the same ground again. In April, Yadav was granted bail for two months. Then in June, he was given another two months to get himself treated.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-extends-dp-yadavs-bail-reserves-judgement-in-conviction-case/articleshow/86623451.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Nashik||Panic gives way to relief as showers cease in Nashik||NASHIK: Local residents heaved a sigh of relief after the alarming rise in water level in the Godavari river eased by Wednesday evening, when rainfall finally stopped. On Wednesday afternoon, the water resources department put its plans to discharge around 15,000 cusec water from the Gangapur dam on hold as there was no further rainfall in the district. Further discharge from the dam would have inundated low lying areas on the banks of Godavari river. Various government agencies were engaged in a flurry of activities on Wednesday as the water resources department enhanced the quantum of discharge from Gangapur dam following constant rain in Nashik, especially in the catchment area. The water discharge, which was around 3,500 cusecs on Tuesday night, was increased to around 7,000 cusecs at 9 am on Wednesday. After a couple of hours, the quantum was further hiked to over 10,500 cusecs. The swelling Godavari river in Nashik city submerged small temples in Ramkund area. The average rainfall in Nashik district over the last 24 hours, ending 8.30 am on Wednesday, was over 68.6 mm, including 39.4 mm in Nashik city. As many as 49 revenue circles in 15 talukas of the district received about 65 mm rainfall. On Wednesday morning, district collector Suraj Mandhare issued an alert for those residing near the river to desist from venturing into it. Nashik rural superintendent of police Sachin Patil alerted police patils to remain vigilant and ensure that no one ventured into the river. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had earmarked a few schools, where families would have to be shifted in case there was flooding in low-lying areas near Ramkund. NMC teams, including fire tender personnel, were stationed at Ramkund and they removed a few shanties set up in encroached land near the riverbank. The teams used the public announcement system to warn people to move away from the riverbank. Over 600 shopkeepers, including around 200 jewellers, whose shops are located in low lying areas of the city, started removing their goods from shops as they would get damaged, if inundated. The staff at these shops packed the goods in big bags before shifting them. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal visited Ramkund area in the evening, along with Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, to take stock of the situation. Officials from NMC and water resources department said that the situation is stable in Ramkund since rainfall has stopped. “However, there is a need to remain alert as further rainfall would require higher discharge of water from Gangapur dam,” said an official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/panic-gives-way-to-relief-as-showers-cease-in-nashik/articleshow/86620779.cms||---

Noting that the lower court’s verdict was “contrary to law and suffers from perversity” Justices Manish Pitale and M S Jawalkar set aside and ordered the North Goa principal district judge to rehear the case on October 1. “In our considered opinion, the order passed by the learned district judge is totally erroneous against the provisions of law. The impugned order needs to be set aside as it is patently erroneous. The learned judge failed to appreciate evidence in its proper perspective or to apply provisions of law,” the high court said. Kastub Shipping, a Ponda-based firm, had defaulted on a Rs 1.8 crore loan taken in 1998 from EDC, a government-backed lending agency, to purchase a barge. The firm defaulted on the loan and also moved the barge M V Indira out of Goa as allegedly there was no viable business in the state. EDC has been trying to recover the loan since 2001 and had offered Kastub Shipping various options to restructure the loan, but once the company and its directors — Anand Desai and Balkrishna Kamat — failed to abide by the conditions, EDC approached the district court. Despite the evidence, the district court dismissed EDC’s application on the grounds that it did not have territorial jurisdiction, prompting EDC to appeal to the high court.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/re-hear-case-on-loan-recovery-hc-directs-district-court/articleshow/86628597.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At present, the officers in development authorities, urban improvement trusts and municipalities are not issuing such pattas. People are being asked to come on the first day of the camp for pattas. The idea, however, has not gone well with residents and many allege timely lease deeds should be issued to those who have applied. Gajendra Singh, a plot owner, said the purpose of the government was to give lease deeds to plot owners who are stuck and waiting for regularisation for years. To increase the numbers, officials stopped issuing lease deeds and asking them to collect it on October 2. This is unnecessarily creating a hassle.” To increase the numbers, the government has also taken decision to issue lease deeds to government offices in old areas. The bodies concerned will issue leases deeds to these offices for free. For the same, the directorate of local bodies (DLB) has issued the orders. An official said, “The government offices are operational in Walled City and old areas for years, but do not have a lease.” Also to provide hassle free operations in distribution of lease deeds, powers have been delegated to authorised officers in local bodies. These officers will have powers to issue lease deeds of plots having a size up to 500 square metres. An official said, “As majority of the population in urban limits live on the plots measuring between 500 and 500 square metres, rights have been given to the local empowered committee to issue lease deeds. The cases of larger plots will be forwarded to the state government. The lease deeds will only be issued after the state government’s approval.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/to-achieve-1l-target-on-oct-2-civic-bodies-not-issuing-lease-deeds-now/articleshow/86592893.cms||---

Eyebrows are being raised regarding a land deal being mentioned by the alleged survivor. The land deal being discussed widely is that of 120 acres of land acquired by Sahara India for a township in Jesingpura and Sikandarpura in the city. The victim was allegedly promised a share in profits of a project that the accused were planning on the land. Investors in Sahara India’s investment schemes and its agents have been left stunned by the mention of the land. An activist Indravadan Rathod, who has been fighting for the cause of the investors said that the land had been taken over by the government and it was not possible to deal in it. He said that the land was acquired by Sahara in 2004-05 from farmers. “The land should have been converted to non-agriculture land within six months, but this did not happen even after an extension till 2009,” he said. Rathod said that since the purpose for which the land was acquired was not served, he sought that the land should be taken over by the government. “An order acquiring the land was done in January this year,” Rathod said. “How can someone deal in land owned by the government. This needs to be investigated. I have written in this regard to the district collector,” Rathod said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/mention-of-sahara-land-sparks-row/articleshow/86623944.cms||---

The 9-valent HPV vaccine — Gardasil 9 offers protection against nine HPV serotypes (6, 11, 16,18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) and can be administered to girls and women in the 9-26 years age bracket and boys aged 9-15 years. The three-dose nano-valent vaccine has to be administered via intramuscular injections over a period of six months, MSD Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd said on Wednesday. According to the company, the vaccine helps reduce disease burden of cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancers among females and can also help prevent genital warts, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, anal cancer and precancerous or dysplastic lesions in males. Pointing out that these nineserotypes contribute to a majority of global HPV disease burden, Rehan A Khan, managing director, MSD-India, said some of these serotypes are also prominent in India, with nearly 98.3% of cervical cancer cases, 95% of vulvar cancer cases, 77% of vaginal cancer cases and 70% of anal cancer cases in India attributable to seven HPV serotypes. Khan also pointed out that as India has the world’s highest population of youngsters with nearly 229 million people in the 10-24 years age bracket, vaccination can play a crucial role in reducing incidence of HPV-related cancer burden, reported at around 1.7 lakh cases annually in men and women. “Current estimates indicate that every year 96,922 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 60,078 lose their battle to the disease. Cervical cancer ranks as the second most frequent cancer among women in India and second most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age,” MSD India said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/msd-rolls-out-indias-first-gender-neutral-hpv-vaccine/articleshow/86627023.cms||---

With the 1.5 FSI available here encompassing stilt/basement space — this is exempted from the FSI in GHMC limits — many are illegally using the cellar space for various purposes, they add. This includes security rooms, hired parking spaces, AC plant units, electrical cabins etc. Worse, residents say that the SCB has turned a blind eye to these violations. “Over 90% of the silt/basement space is being used illegally,” said Vikram Kumar a resident of Picket. He added: “This practice has led to widespread corruption in SCB’s engineering wing. Many of these structures are allowed to flourish. They take note of an irregularity only when it is brought to their notice. But often times, even that’s ignored.” Senior advocate BVVS Srinivasa Rao agreed to this becoming a menace in SCB areas. “But this cannot be brought under control unless there is a merger. Property owners will also be relieved from Cantonment’s FSI norm, if it becomes a part of GHMC,” he said. Denying allegations about the SCB not acting on illegalities, a senior engineer said: “We do maintain any separate data on unauthorised constructions in the silt/basement. We demolish all such unauthorised structures, following an inspection report submitted to SCB’s chief executive officer.” “If anybody finds deviations they can lodge a complaint with the SCB CEO along with photos. Appropriate action will be taken if the property owner is found violating the the Cantonment Act,” the SCB official added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/illegal-structures-mushrooming-due-to-fsi-norms-say-residents/articleshow/86626869.cms||---

Deputy collector Gavde told TOI that they heard the grievances of the locals as well as the quarry operators. The locals went home happy after being told that action will be taken within ten days. Locals alleged that cracks had developed on the walls of their houses as well as that of the nearest temple due to continuous blasting using explosives. Also, low-lying paddy fields have been damaged due to the discharge of polluted water. “We are not benefited by the quarries. Their operations must be stopped since the high court has also stayed quarrying on disputed lands,” a local said.

---||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad research team develops hydrogel to regenerate cornea||HYDERABAD: Scarring due to corneal injury can now be prevented thanks to a novel technology developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H). Currently, no treatment is available other than partial donor corneal graft or transplantation for corneal scarring. A corneal scar is either opacity or irregularity in the cornea that could limit the cornea’s ability to accurately focus light. Researchers from the biomedical department at IIT-H collaborated with LV Prasad Eye Institute and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology to come up with a technique, which is less invasive and can replace complex surgical procedures in ophthalmology. Using discarded cornea from slaughterhouses and disqualified cornea for transplantation from eye banks, the team of researchers have developed a tissue-derived hydrogel that when injected can regenerate the cornea without scarring. “We have tested the corneal hydrogel for two complications associated with cornea — corneal scarring and keratoconus — and, in both cases, we found that this can be successfully used as a new treatment strategy to avoid complicated surgeries,” Shibu Chameettachal, PhD scholar, department of biomedical engineering, IIT-H, said, adding that the institute was also planning for human pilot studies for some of its applications soon. Experts believe that this technology would have a huge impact in countries where there was a scarcity of eye bank and donor tissue. “The southern part of India is much more developed than north for eye care. Still, states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have the least accessibility to donor cornea and they have to travel to south India for any corneal perforation, scars or related disease. This technology will even be used to prevent blindness in rural north India, where there is limited availability of donor cadaveric transplantation grade cornea,” said Dr Vivek Singh, senior scientist, LVPEI and one of the principal investigators. Finally, the aim of the research is to develop a complete human cornea to replace the human cadaveric donor cornea with 3D bioprinting technology. The researchers have filed both Indian and US patent for the preparation of the hydrogel.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/iit-h-research-team-develops-hydrogel-to-regenerate-cornea/articleshow/86627120.cms||---

To preserve such works and retain cultural significance of commercial products, geographical indication (GI) tag has been awarded to seven indigenous products from Uttarakhand. These include Kumaon’s chyura oil, Munsyari rajma, Bhotia dann (a rug made by Bhotias, a nomadic community), aipan (traditional art made on special occasions), ringal craft (art of making items by knitting bamboo strands), copper products and thulma (blankets spun from locally-sourced fabric). Besides, the state has also applied for a GI tag for 11 farm products - red rice, Berinag tea, gahat, mandua, jhangora, burans sarbat, kala bhatt, chaulai/ramdana, Almora lakhori mirch, pahari toor dal and malta fruit. Expressing happiness at the state’s products getting GI tags, government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said, “It is a matter of great pride that the original products of the state are getting global recognition. GI tags play an important role in the promotion of indigenous products in local as well as international markets.” He added, “Of the 6.48-lakh hectares of agricultural land in the Himalayan state, traditional products are being cultivated on 3.50-lakh hectares. Tejpatta was the first product to get the GI tag.” “Having accorded with the GI tag, the products will fetch a good price, with the demand likely to go up. Those associated with the production of these items will also benefit,” said the minister.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/gi-tag-for-7-indigenous-products-of-ukhand/articleshow/86623486.cms||Kautilya Singh

But the doctors took up the challenge and around 1.75 litres pus was removed from the psoas abscess of an eight-month pregnant woman on Monday. The rare surgery was followed by a normal delivery and both the mother as well as the newborn baby girl are safe, doctors informed. A psoas abscess is a rare medical condition in which pus gets collected in the psoas muscle of the spine. The psoas muscle is located in the lower lumbar region of the spine The 23-year-old tribal woman from Samni village of Bharuch was brought to the hospital with fever, loss of appetite and weight loss. The mother was not able to sleep in a straight position due to the huge abscess. “If she was not operated immediately the abscess might have burst inside her abdomen. It could have led to sepsis, endangering the life of the mother as well as the child. We started the surgery, but the amount of pus discharged even surprised us,” said Dr Krunal Champaneri, orthopedic surgeon at Civil Hospital, Bharuch. Wife of a farm labour, the woman must have been suffering from pain for several weeks, the doctors said. “Occurrence of psoas abscess is not a frequently reported illness in this region. The ailment occurring during pregnancy is even rarer. It was a challenging operation,” said Dr Champaneri. “Such a surgery was performed for the first time at the Bharuch Civil Hospital.

---||Jaipur||No gadgets, kids from three dists can’t attend e-classes||Jaipur: A biannual survey conducted by Save The Children, an NGO, has revealed that most students in Dungarpur, Banswara and Rajsamand were unable to attend online classes due to lack of gadgets. The aim of the study, Voices of Children: A Pulse Check of Intervention Districts, was to find the effects of closure of schools and the challenges faced by children. As many as 1,897 children from the three districts responded to questions for the study conducted between January and June. Only 77 students said they were able to attend online classes using laptops or mobile phones, while 567 children said they couldn’t due to lack gadgets. As many as 958 children said they received no support from schools, while 668 said they did receive guidance from school teachers. The survey covered 308 villages of 150 gram panchayats in eight blocks. As many as 1,726 students wanted to attend classes regularly when schools reopened. Another positive indication was that 1,026 children conceded that they received mid-day meal. However, 582 said that they did not receive meals and the remaining children either did not know about the facility or were not eligible for the scheme. “Key challenges faced by children and their families were loss of education, limited livelihood opportunities and shortage of food. There were both positive and negative findings of the report. Nearly 50% received the mid-day meals, but most could not access online classes,” said an official, who was a part of the research. “The good point was students actually want to go to school. Now that the schools have reopened, it needs to be ensured that Covid-19 protocols are followed strictly,” the official said. The study also said Banswara reported the highest Covid-19 casualties (53%) among the three districts considered for the study. “It should be ensured that children who have lost their family members get linked to appropriate social protection schemes for better future,” said the official.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/no-gadgets-kids-from-three-dists-cant-attend-e-classes/articleshow/86628661.cms||---
---||Pune||Tomato prices at 6-month high of up to Rs 35 per kg in Pune||PUNE: Weeks after farmers dumped their tomato produce as prices crashed, the cost of the kitchen staple has increased in wholesale and retail markets in the district. In retail markets, the cost of 1kg of tomatoes was Rs20-35. At the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC)- run Market Yard in Gultekdi, wholesale prices were Rs14-25 per kg on Wednesday. The increase in tomato prices comes after of nearly six months. In August, prices dropped to Rs2 per kg due to excess harvest and poor quality, leading many growers to dump the produce. Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section of the Market Yard, said on Wednesday that the demand and supply equation has been disturbed. “We expect to see a further increase, at least over the next few days. The fresh harvest will not arrive soon,” said Kalamkar. Vilas Bhujbal, head of the commission agents’ association of the Market Yard, said sowing of fresh tomato crops is low. “The farmers suffered huge financial losses due to the prolonged decline in the prices over the last six months. Most of them did not plant fresh tomato crop and this will hit supply,” he said. Some officials said there is a good demand for tomatoes as restaurants and food giants are operating at full capacity. “Household consumption is lower than commercial requirements. But tomatoes have good demand in the food industry; the prices will remain high range till the fresh harvest arrives in bulk,” said an APMC official. The Narayangaon tomato market, one of the largest in the state, is receiving 25,000-30,000 crates (each containing 20kg of tomatoes) every day, as against 50,000 crates. “The arrival is mainly from Beed and some parts of Pune district. But the harvest is low compared to the last six months. Thus, prices have gone up now,” said Sanjay Kale, chairman of the APMC market, Naryangaon. “One crate is being sold for Rs550-750. The same crate was sold as low as Rs50 in August,” added Kale. Farmers said their harvest has been affected by the rain. “Even if the prices are high, growers will not benefit unless they have a good harvest. Now, few growers have a good harvest in the district,” said Rajesh Pote, a farmer from Naryangaon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/tomato-prices-at-6-month-high-of-up-to-rs-35-per-kg/articleshow/86626159.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad sees 300% jump in housing sales||HYDERABAD: Houses in Hyderabad seem to be selling like hot cakes. According to a latest market report, the city sold 6,735 homes between July and September (Q3) alone — a 300% jump over the same period last year — to make its way to the top of the charts, nationally. Even in its supply of new properties, Hyderabad beat most others to stand only behind the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), with as many as 14,700 new homes hitting the market in the last three months. In comparison, Bengaluru saw just about 7,640 houses being launched during the last quarter, as per Anarock Property Consultant’s recent housing sector analysis. “Hyderabad has been one of the most vibrant real estate markets among all top cities both in terms of new launches and housing sales. It is witnessing renewed interest by all stakeholders including investors, homebuyers and developers,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Group. He attributed this tremendous churn in the local market to multiple reasons: Favourable socio-economic conditions, well-developed infrastructure and relatively affordable prices. While the Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1.5 crore segment reported maximum buying in Hyderabad — the city’s revised definition of ‘budget’ homes, interestingly, comprise those priced between Rs 80 lakh and Rs 1 crore —affordable and luxury properties too found some takers, the report shows. And much like other major cities, the IT/ITeS sector continues to drive the bulk of housing demand even in Hyderabad. “The improved job security and robust hiring in the IT/ITeS and financial sectors piggybacked on record-low home loan rates and growing home-ownership sentiment. The ongoing work-from-home culture continues to influence residential sentiment on two major fronts - overall housing demand and unit sizes. The fast-paced vaccination drive is an added sentiment booster, especially in terms of increased site visits,” Puri added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/city-sees-300-jump-in-housing-sales/articleshow/86626973.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Agra||Hathras case: Student taken back to jail to be brought to AIIMS-Delhi||AGRA: Nearly a week after a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Lucknow asked the Mathura district jail to ensure “proper treatment” of Atiq-ur-Rahman, 26, who was sent back to jail after he suffered a cardiac and respiratory disorder, prison authorities said they’ve decided to take him to AIIMS-Delhi for a checkup. Rahman, a PhD scholar at Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, was arrested last year with Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan and two others on the way to Hathras to meet the gang-rape victim’s family and charged with sedition and under UAPA. Later, the Enforcement Directorate had started investigating money laundering charges against them. Rahman was being taken to the PMLA court for a hearing when he got sick. He was taken to a community health centre, from where he was sent to the district hospital in Agra and then to SN Medical College in the same city. The doctors there referred him to a higher centre — SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences) in Lucknow or AIIMS in Delhi. But authorities took him back to jail instead. Now, after the PMLA court in Lucknow asked authorities to ensure that Rahman gets the right treatment and is moved to a higher centre if needed, the DG Prisons UP has issued an order to take him to AIIMS. “The order has been issued but its written copy is yet to be received. We will send him there as soon as we get the order, which should be by Thursday or Friday,” jail superintendent Brijesh Kumar told TOI. “He is in the jail hospital now and his condition is stable.” Prison authorities said they had taken him back because they thought his condition was “not life threatening.” Kumar said, “The (SN) medical college doctors did a complete checkup and prescribed some medicines, which we are giving him. Doctors advised to take him to a higher centre after being told that he was being treated at AIIMS-Delhi earlier.” Rahman has a congenital heart condition, aortic regurgitation, for which he was being treated at AIIMS before he was arrested. His father-in-law Sakhawat Khan had written to the DM about his condition, requesting that he be “provided urgent medical treatment at AIIMS or an equivalent centre” and moved the special PMLA court over it. The court has asked for a report on Rahman’s medical condition. The next hearing is on October 12.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/hathras-case-student-sent-back-to-jail-after-cardiac-disorder-to-be-taken-to-aiims/articleshow/86623446.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The number of aspirants seeking tickets has made the job tricky for both BJP and Congress. Both are banking on sympathy votes after the death of sitting MLAs, but family feuds and internal differences in the parties have left the two parties in a dilemma. In Vallabhnagar constituency, from the Congress there are five ticket seekers. Preeti Kunwar Shakawat, wife of late MLA Gajendra Singh Shaktawat, is claiming the ticket keeping in consideration the sympathy votes. Devendra Singh Shaktawat, elder brother of the late MLA, too is an aspiring candidate from the Congress. He was district deputy chairman and was also the nagar palika chairman in Bhinder. Similarly Bhim Singh Chundawat, who has always been a close aide of the Shaktawat family, is claiming a ticket from Vallabhnagar seat. Kuber Singh Chawda, youth Congress secretary and member of the panchayat samiti, is another contender for the ticket. Raj Singh Jhala from the Shaktawat family is also in the race for the Congress ticket. In Congress, there are five faces in the race for the ticket, while in BJP there are four aspirants namely Udailal Dangi, who had contested the previous election and lost by 11,000 votes. He is the leader of the opposition in Bhinder panchayat samiti. Aakash Vagrecha, a graduate, has a grip in the party. Similarly Mahaveer Vaya and Dhanraj Ahir from the BJP are claiming tickets for the polls.

---||Jaipur||‘RAS & RPS officers allowed entry to cop’s wife’||Jaipur: A day after an RAS and two RPS officers from Sawai Madhopur were suspended for their alleged involvement in cheating during REET, senior police officers said officials had allegedly facilitated the entry of a constable’s wife into the REET hall even though she arrived late. A senior official said Yaduveer Singh, arrested with his wife in the cheating case, was posted as a reader to DSP Narayan Tiwari. SDM Narendra Kumar and another DSP Raju Lal were part of a flying squad responsible to keep a check on students. “Yaduveer Singh had arrived late with his wife at the exam hall. He requested his senior officer to allow her to enter. DSP Tiwari reportedly informed members of the flying squad who let her in,” an official said, adding that police later arrested Yaduveer Singh and his wife along with eight others for allegedly using unfair means during the exam. “Since Yaduveer Singh was found to be involved in the cheating racket, it was important to examine the entire sequence of event,” the official said. PHQ officials told TOI that they had directed local units to keep close surveillance over “suspicious” elements to weed out malpractices during REET. “Senior officials may not have a direct hand in cheating, but they did not follow the strict SOP (standard operating procedure) which was laid down several days before REET,” the official said, adding that constables from Sawai Madhopur and Sirphi districts were already shunted when it became clear that they had directly indulged in activities that could have compromised the sanctity of the exam.

Speaking to the media here Asnotikar said that building a base for JD(S) in Uttara Kannada district is a difficult task. He would soon talk to JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda and former CM Kumaraswamy and take their consent to contest as an Independent. Asnotikar joined JD(S) in 2018, a month before assembly poll after BJP had denied him a ticket. Later he contested the parliamentary election in 2019 and lost to Anant Kumar Hegde of BJP by a margin of about 4.50 lakh votes from Uttara Kannada constituency. “I have realized that it is difficult to make people here accept JD(S)despite the charisma of Kumaraswamy. Voters are evenly divided between BJP and Congress and I have decided to contest as an Independent. Before that I will seek the blessing of Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy,” he said. There has been a mass exodus from JD (S) of late. Two weeks ago Pradeep Devarabhavi, former ZP member who had contested on a JD(S) ticket from Kumta, and several other local body members quit the party to join Congress. Many supporters of Madhu Bangarappa too have left the party to join Congress. Shashibhushan Hegde, nephew of former CM Ramakrishna Hegde, too is expected to join Congress.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/asnotikar-hints-at-quitting-jds/articleshow/86621979.cms||---

Police identified the deceased as Hritvik Sonawane of Yerawada. “Hritvik’s friend, who was riding the bike, suffered fractures to his hand and shoulder and is undergoing treatment at a hospital,” police said. For now, a case of accidental death has been registered pending recording of statement of the injured victim, whose father owned the bike. The father told the police he had no idea when his son and Hritvik went out on his two-wheeler. The police said the two teenagers were proceeding towards Bund Garden from Ramwadi and took a left turn towards Kalyaninagar near Aga Khan Palace. “There is a tree located on the turn of the widened road and the bike rider could not anticipate it and lost control in a bid to avoid the tree. The bike crashed into the tree resulting in the accident,” said inspector Viijay Chavan of the Yerawada police.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pillion-rider-dies-after-teenager-crashes-bike/articleshow/86626174.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad Cantonment Board’s restrictive by-laws hampering realty growth||SECUNDERABAD: While realtors in neighbouring Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits are building skyscrapers, construction activity in Secunderabad Cantonment is progressing at a snail’s space. This, as action over demands of increasing floor space index (FSI) from the existing 1.5 to 2.5 for additional built-up area remains at a standstill. Several realtors whom TOI spoke to said that they wanted the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) to exclude stilt floor and parking from computation of FSI and height of buildings. They have also represented their demands to the Union ministry of defence (MoD) for these exemptions. “It is better to implement the building by-laws which GHMC applies to its property owners by increasing permissible floors (beyond G+3). FSI should not consider parking, cellar or balcony as built-up areas and commercial spaces in residential layouts,” S Chandramouli, a property owner from Trimulgherry told TOI. In 2017, new building by-laws were drafted and approved by the cantonmet board. However, they have been stuck with MoD despite repeated requests by SCB ward members for approval to relax the rules. “While GHMC areas surrounding Secuderabad Cantonment, including Malkajgiri, Alwal, Kukatpally and Kapra are seeing the rise of skyscrapers, SCB remains with its decades-old G+2 FSI norm,” said one builder who has been involved in several projects in GHMC areas. “The lack of exemptions in FSI norms has become a white elephant for the engineering wing. Several buildings have had to be built with deviations from the sanctioned building plans as the built-up space became an issue,” explained A Parthasarathi Reddy, a retired roads & buildings engineer. “We have sent new building by-laws to the defence ministry for approval and even clarified several queries raised by defence officials, but they are yet to clear it. If new building by-laws are implemented, SCB’s revenue may go up Rs 500 crore per annum through building sanctions,” a SCB engineering official informed.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/scbs-restrictive-by-laws-hampering-realty-growth/articleshow/86626736.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Many calls from young girls worried about photos, videos leaked online’||PANAJI: The Cyber Peace Foundation, at a session on online safety for women organised by the national and Goa State Commission for Women and Facebook, has advised caution while using social media - keeping one’s account private, not sharing one’s location and taking swift action if one’s picture or video has been shared online without one’s consent. “Content can be taken down very easily by filling up some forms,” cyber security specialist and manager for communications and training at Cyber Peace Foundation, Janice Verghese said while speaking at the online session on Data Privacy and Social Media Safety. Chairperson of the state women’s commission, Vidhya Gaude said the commission during her tenure over the past one year has received many cyber crime complaints where women and children are the primary victims. Better training and a cyber security branch will aid in resolution of cyber crime cases, she said. Several young women face the problem of image-based abuse where their pictures and videos have been leaked online without their consent. “If somebody is in this situation don’t blame or shame them. They’re already in a difficult situation. It’s common for family members to blame the girl for sharing private photos or video, but it’s not their fault. They didn’t do anything wrong by trusting their partner or a person they loved. The only person at fault is the one blackmailing them and sharing their photos,” Verghese said. The foundation receives calls in the middle of the night on its helpline number from young girls distressed about their photos and videos being leaked and wanting to take extreme steps. “We don’t want anyone taking any drastic steps. You’re not in the wrong. You’re only a victim. The person at fault is the person blackmailing you,” she said. She shared the case of a 22-year-old whose content was leaked on 23 pornographic sites by her partner from a previous relationship. With the help of the foundation, the girl got the content removed from 18 pornographic websites within two days and from the remaining five within the next few days. “Within one week all content was taken down. The police identified the man and action was taken against him. Don’t feel like things are out of control and you cannot do anything about it,” she said. She advised victims to fill up the violation of privacy form, the abuse content take down form or violation of coypright forms provided by the platform and do a Google search to be able to easily find the methodology. Content on adult websites also will be taken down once a victim sends in the content removal form that the content has been uploaded without consent but will have to go through a VPN to access the form on the adult website. Even after getting content taken down, she advised to report cases of breaking into accounts, unauthorised use of photos, to law enforcement. If police refuse to register an FIR and if a person knows a crime has happened, she advised escalating the complaint to the SP, district magistrate who have powers to take one’s statement and direct police to investigate. One mustn’t feel helpless, she said, and suggested contacting the state and national commissions for women that have power to intervene if police are not helping. There is also the 24 by 7 helpline of the national commission. The team at Cyber Peace Foundation also will guide a victim on the steps to be taken as they work closely with the police and government. “Don’t suffer in silence. It’s high time women stand up for themselves and speak up,” she said. The foundation also advised contacting the grievance officer on the social media platform.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/many-calls-from-young-girls-worried-about-photos-videos-leaked-online/articleshow/86628683.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh ranks 2nd in sexual harassment at work||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh ranks second in India after Himachal Pradesh when it comes to sexual harassment instances at workplace, according to Crime in India 2020 report released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). A total of 70 cases were reported last year, just two less than Himachal Pradesh and four more than Maharashtra. Compared to 2019 NCRB data, there has been a 218% increase in sexual harassment cases in workplaces in 2020. The Crime in India 2019 document had ranked Andhra Pradesh eighth in the country for workplace sexual harassment with 22 cases. Overall, there has been a 13% increase in sexual harassment cases (section 354 of IPC) in 2020 compared to 2019. According to cops, the increase in workplace harassment cases is in a way, a healthy sign for the state as it indicates more women are coming forward in exposing their ordeals. “Disha programme played a significant role in the increase in overall harassment cases. Previously, women used to be hesitant approaching police station and now, things are changing, and they don’t have to put up with workplace harassment,” a senior Disha police official told TOI. Nevertheless, cops also acknowledge that a large number of workplaces – both private and government are yet to set up an internal complaints committee (ICC) under the Vishaka guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. Eight years after the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (commonly referred to as POSH) came into force, Andhra Pradesh police have found that most businesses, educational institutions and even government offices have failed to comply. Other significant areas where sexual harassment is prevalent in the state include the public transport system and shelter homes for women and children. Sexual harassment cases account for five percent of overall crimes against women. Not surprisingly, the major chunk (around 38%) of crimes against women include 498A of IPC (cruelty by husband or his relatives). Contrary to the popular belief that COVID-induced lockdown might have increased domestic violence, AP saw a 16% dip in 498A cases in 2020 .||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/ap-ranks-2nd-in-sexual-harassment-at-work/articleshow/86623493.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Of these, 178 were children, locals confirmed. However, the chief medical officer (CMO) claimed 63 cases of deaths due to dengue-like symptoms following a “verbal death audit” in the past month. Since August, 4,360 cases of dengue have been reported in the district. With hospitals reserving all their resources for patients in critical condition, over 25,000 people are now bedridden at home, according to officials. More than 1,500 cases of dengue have surfaced in the nearby districts of Agra, Mathura, Kasganj and Etah as well. Nagla Amaan village, where the first cases of viral fever were reported last month, so far, 10 families have moved out following 12 fever-related deaths in three weeks. Some 200 residents are still battling with the fever, but the government health centre at the village is still shut. Anshu Yadav, a grocery shop owner at Nagla Amaan, said, “Ten families with five to 10 members each have left the village. The situation is the same in nearby villages. Almost every family in the village has a member suffering from dengue-like fever, but proper treatment facilities do not exist.” Veeresh Kumar, a village elder, said, “People are dying without proper treatment. So far, 12, including four children, have died. Families are either leaving or sending their children away to protect them.” He blamed local authorities for poor sanitation and waterlogging at the village, the main reasons for the spread of infection. Village Nagla Mavasi resident, Virendra Singh who works as a farmer said, “I have sent my two kids to their aunts’ house in Aligarh. Others have also done the same. The only children in the village are the ones who’ve come back from hospital. So far, 14 people have died in the village. Most of them were children. Each family has a member suffering from fever.” Village Okhra resident, Kamla said, “Eight persons have died here in the past one month. Two children died waiting for treatment at the Firozabad medical college. People are scared to go to government hospitals and are selling their jewellery and animals to arrange for treatment at private centres.” There are 64 active camps in the district and 5,000 people, including those suffering from fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. The CMO blamed the dengue outbreak on improper water storage by the public that allows mosquitoes to breed. “So far, 4,360 cases of dengue have been confirmed in the district,” he said. The CMO added, “Over 100 teams of health staffers have been tasked to conduct door-to-door surveys to identify the patients and provide them with medicines and required assistance. So far, 63 deaths of patients suffering viral fever and dengue symptoms have been confirmed following a verbal death audit conducted by our teams.” In Agra district, two children suffering high fever died under treatment on Wednesday, taking the district toll to 31. Of these, 26 were children, health department officials said. So far, 160 cases of dengue have been found in the district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/over-4000-tested-for-dengue-in-firozabad-death-toll-crosses-200/articleshow/86623516.cms||Deepak Lavania

They both are beat marshals posted with the Vishrantwadi police. Shirsat said “We were patrolling the Dhanori area, when a boy told us an autorickshaw was abandoned outside a society from Monday. He said a man was trying to start the vehicle. We reached the spot and instructed the man to furnish documents. Rajmane was examining the vehicle registration number when the man started the vehicle and picked up speed saying he was the owner.” He said they signalled him to stop, but he hit Rajmane with the vehicle. “I chased the driver on my bike. I fell twice after the autorickshaw grazed my vehicle. The driver grazed some vehicles in the Gokulnagar vegetable bazaar and tried to hit pedestrians, creating commotion in the area.” The driver stopped the vehicle on a narrow stretch at Kalvad vasthi because he couldn’t travel further. “He ran and jumped over a compound wall and fled,” he said. Assistant inspector Sachin Nikam said, “We traced the vehicle owner, but said he sold the vehicle. The new owner claimed his vehicle was stolen recently.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/auto-driver-booked-for-assault-on-2-cops/articleshow/86626181.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Pune Municipal Corporation officials said there was a plan to appoint a consultant to take up the feasibility study of a flyover or grade separator on the stretch. Local corporators, however, said the proposal was tabled following frequent traffic jams on the stretch. Dilip Wede Patil, a local corporator, said the project would improve traffic flow on the busy stretch. “Preliminary inspections have been conducted to provide some facility like a flyover on this stretch. Some funds are also set aside in the civic budget for the facility,” Patil said. Harshad Rane, a regular commuter, said, “There are two to three crucial locations prone to traffic jams. Vehicles take turns at these spots interrupting traffic flow. The flyover or grade separator can provide direct access to vehicles wishing to pass through,” Rane said. The road further goes towards Bhugaon-Mulshi and further to Tamhini ghat. Mangesh Thakar, a Bhukum resident, said the stretch from Chandni Chowk to Pirangut needed road widening. A PMC official said steps were initiated to appoint a consultant for the project’s pre- and post-activity and supervision.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/civic-body-plans-flyover-on-pirangut-road-to-ease-traffic/articleshow/86626216.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Jaipur||Clear backlog on OBC quota: Panel to Rajasthan govt||JAIPUR: The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) has asked the state government to clear the OBC quota backlog pending for years. Sudha Yadav, a member of the commission, held a meeting with the state social welfare department officials on Wednesday urging them to expedite the listing of left out OBC communities in the central list in order to have counting of OBCs in the state. The commission members started the session three hours late from the scheduled time at 1 pm. She argued that the state is among those states which have not shown seriousness in filling the backlog leading to the injustice with the OBC communities. “Every state should have 27% of reservation for OBC like the Centre is giving in its jobs. We are here to correct the model state is following so that both the state and the Centre will be on the same page,” said Yadav. Replying to a question as to why many communities which are listed in the state OBC list doesn’t find themselves in the centre list, she said, “It is the state who has to recommend the union government to include the names of communities in the OBC list,” said Yadav. The nationwide demand of the counting of OBC population including Rajasthan, Yadav says that unless the states remove the confusion by coming on the same page with the union, the census which is a central subject cannot be done. “For example, in Rajasthan Jat community is in OBC in some districts while they are not in other districts is a confusion for the central government to keep them in the list of OBCs or not,” said Yadav. The members came four hours late from the scheduled time 10 am and stayed for about 30 minutes for the hearing. Umeed Singh Rabari, a nomad who came with a delegation from Niwaru was disappointed for not being able to meet the members. He argued that atleast five communities that are not including in the OBC list are a matter of shame. “Still the real communities are out of the reach of OBC,” said Rabari.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/clear-backlog-on-obc-quota-panel-to-raj-govt/articleshow/86628728.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mini India gears up to cast vote for the second time in five months||Kolkata: A microcosm of India will vote on Thursday to elect a representative for Bhowanipore assembly constituency. Not only Bengalis, but Sindhis, Punjabis—both Hindu and Sikh—Gujaratis, Marathis and Malayalis have also made Bhowanipore their home, and many of the families have been living there for generations now. Starting from Kyd Street, Park Street and Elgin Road in central Kolkata, the constituency covers large portions on either side of SP Mukherjee Road, Harish Mukherjee Road, portions of Kalighat, Alipore, Chetla and Kidderpore (wards 63, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77 and 82). The entire area is dotted with places of worship set up by each of the communities that have been living there for more than a century. Take the Sindhis for example. A majority of Kolkata’s 25,000-odd Sindhis are settled on Park Street, Theatre Road and Elgin Road in apartments, like Ambassador, Apsara, Neelam and Embassy. The community’s central place of worship remains Amrit Vela Temple on Marquis Street. “We are old voters of the Bhowanipore constituency and are looking forward to Thursday’s polls again. But the skies have to allow us,” laughed Nanik Samtani, a prominent member of the community. Though many Punjabis, both Hindus and Sikhs, have now moved out to different other parts of Kolkata, Bhowanipore still remains the hub of the community. Gudwara Sant Kutiya on Harish Mukherjee Road is the fulcrum, around which the Sikhs live and they can be found at Kachhi Bari, Dr Rajinder Road, Puddapukur, Roy Street, Mohini Mohan Road and the lanes branching out from Elgin Road. “The Sikhs probably came here more than a 100 years ago and gave an impetus to the transport business of the city. They have been traditional voters of Bhowanipore. Since trucks are not allowed to enter the city these days, many have relocated to the fringes but they still maintain their old places and vote from here,” said Narinder Singh, a businessman. Almost every sect and sub-sect of the Gujaratis—Patels, Jains, Raghuvanshis, Lohanas, Brahmins—are represented in Bhowanipore. The number of Gujarati residents here has, however, come down to one-fourth of the earlier 1,00,000, said chartered accountant Kishore Dattani, who has been studying his community closely. “Gujaratis have remained consistent voters of Bhowanipore as is borne out by the past turnouts. Many people could not vote during the assembly elections because of the Covid scare. But since a majority of people have already been vaccinated, the turnout rhetoric is positive.” The constituency also has 100-odd Marathi-speaking families, most of them being cloth merchants and jewellers. Some said they had been settled here for over three generations. “We have been consistent voters. We take deep interest in the affairs of the constituency though one may not find us very vocal. That is because we are mostly businessmen and do not find much time for generating public opinion,” said Prakash Jadhav. Many Malayali families are settled in Bhowanipore around churches and schools, most of them being into teaching and business. Many of the women from these families are work as para-medical staff and nurses. Neville Roy Varghese, who owns a capsule manufacturing unit, echoed what Jadhav had said and described the community as “silent” voters. A large number of traditional Bengali families have also been living there for centuries. Some of the city’s oldest mansions owned by aristocratic families still remain there. “I have seen my great grandfather vote and now, my nephew will vote, So, five generations. We are looking forward to voting on Thursday,” said Sandip Banerjee, a member of one such old family that owns the heritage Chandralaya on Harish Mukherjee Road. Then there are some, like retired bank employee Samiran Majumdar, who has shifted out of Chetla to Lake Gardens, but will return to vote on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mini-india-gears-up-to-cast-vote-for-the-second-time-in-five-months/articleshow/86626199.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Hyderabad||Will Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao's gambit on Dalit Bandhu save TRS in bypoll?||HYDERABAD: Will the state government’s ambitious Dalit Bandhu scheme pay dividends for the TRS in the October 30 Huzurabad by-election or backfire in its face? While it remains to be seen how effective the scheme will impact voters’ preferences in exercising their franchise, the opposition parties alleged that Dalit Bandhu was introduced by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao primarily to woo Dalit voters in the assembly constituency. The segment has around 45,000 Dalits who form part of the total electorate of around two lakhs. Initially, KCR had planned to implement the scheme only in Huzurabad. Later, he sprang a surprise by unveiling it in his adopted village of Vasalamarri in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district. Around 76 families were extended the benefit. Following innumerable requests from MLAs, the government decided to take up the scheme on a pilot basis in four mandals in SC reserved constituencies in four corners of the state. After choosing to roll out the scheme in Huzurabad constituency as a pilot project, the CM announced that the scheme would cover about 400 families in Huzurabad. About Rs 2,000 crore had already been released by the government for the scheme. When apprehensions grew amid opposition parties’ allegations that it would be extended to only a few select beneficiaries, KCR declared that every Dalit family in the state would be given the benefit of Rs 10 lakh each. Government employees, both in service and retired, would also be brought under its ambit, he stressed. RS Praveen Kumar, state co-ordinator of BSP, asked:“ If the government is truly worried about Dalits and their welfare, why hasn’t it launched in the last seven years. Why were the landless Dalit poor not given three acres of land as promised by KCR till now,” he wondered.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/will-cms-gambit-on-dalit-bandhu-save-trs-in-bypoll/articleshow/86626249.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nashik||Hosps overcharged for Covid treatment: Survey||Nashik: A statewide survey of 2,579 Covid patients, conducted jointly by two NGOs, has found that many private hospitals have overcharged them for treatment. Office-bearers of the NGOs — Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti and Jan Arogya Abhiyan — revealed the findings of their survey at a meeting of widows of those who had succumbed to the infection. The rapid survey through a Google form was conducted across 200 talukas in 34 districts of Maharashtra over a fortnight this month. Dr Abhay Shukla, public health specialist associated with Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said the survey revealed that 121 patients (4.6%) of the sample size had taken treatment in government hospitals and the remaining 95.4% in private hospitals. While 49.8% patients recovered during the course of treatment, the remaining 50.2% succumbed. Of the total deaths in the survey, 1,059 patients were male. Shukla said the government had issued guidelines to private hospitals about the daily treatment fee they could charge from hospitalized Covid patients. While the fee for isolation in private hospitals was Rs 4,000 per day, that for ICU treatment was Rs 7,500 and for ICU with ventilator support Rs 9,000. Nonetheless, the survey found that the average daily charges that Covid patientis paid in private hospitals was Rs 21,215. The people involved in the survey were mainly those requiring isolation for the infection but who were unable to stay at home as they needed to earn a daily livelihood. Shukla said the survey was just the tip of an iceberg. He said there were many who faced a similar predicament. He demanded that the state health department immediately contact all those admitted to hospitals for Covid treatment and conduct an audit of all complaints regarding hospitals overcharging. He said the excess bill amounts should be refunded to the patients or their families. A woman from Nashik who lost her husband to Covid fought back tears while narrating how she changed three hospitals for his treatment and paid up to Rs 20 lakh in bills for 55 days of hospitalisation. Her husband recovered from Covid but died of a heart attack later. Another woman from Niphad said she too changed three hospitals in a month for her husband’s Covid treatment and incurred expenses up to Rs 25 lakh for hospitalisation and medication. Herambh Kulkarni, president, Corona Ekal Mahila Punarvasan Samiti, and others also expressed their views. Dr Sameer Chandratre, joint secretary, Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, said, “IMA has always been working keeping in mind the interest of citizens. If there is a difference between the rates charged by hospitals, the government should definitely intervene. However, it also needs to be noted that the government rates were applicable to 80% beds in private hospitals. These hospitals were allowed to charge their fees for patients taking up the remaining 20% beds. Most patients were not aware of this.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/hosps-overcharged-for-covid-treatment-survey/articleshow/86620899.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||TMC poll managers plan high turnout measures||Kolkata: A day before the Bhowanipore bypoll on Thursday, Trinamool poll managers were busy planning last-minute strategies. They have decided to focus on two areas: one, making sure the weather does not keep their core voters from stepping out and two, ensuring high turnouts, given that polling percentages are usually low in bypolls. The party has set up three committees at every booth. “While one committee comprises booth agents and booth relievers, members of the second are in charge of setting up booth-level party camps. The third group will work in tandem with this camp and identify voters who might need help to reach the booths. The third group has also been given a time, within which they will help voters reach the booth,” said a Trinamool leader in Rashbehari. At some wards, every worker has apparently been given the responsibility of ensuring at least five families went to the booth. A team fluent in Hindi and Gujarati will monitor the turnout among apartment residents. “Those who are good at communication and enjoy a good rapport with locals are part of these groups,” a member said. Efforts were on to maximize voting from slum areas, he said. Party sources confirmed senior leaders not belonging to Bhowanipore have been told not to enter the constituency to avoid unwanted attention. While minister Subrata Mukherjee, who is in charge of Ward 63, will work from his Gariahat office, minister Patha Chatterjee will track the goings on from his Naktala home and later, from his Behala office. Party workers are confident of a high polling percentage in Wards 77 and 83, besides chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Ward 73. “We target a 80% turnout in wards 77 and 83, our stonghold. We also hope for a rise in turnout in Ward 74 and a win in Ward 70, where BJP enjoyed a healthy lead even a few months ago,” said Rana Haldar, a Trinamool leader from Gopalnagar.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/tmc-poll-managers-plan-high-turnout-measures/articleshow/86626232.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The high court asked the director of school education, V Chinaveerabhadrudu, who appeared before the court, how he would justify the proceedings issued by the Kadapa DEO. The court had on earlier occasion taken a serious view of the proceedings issued by the Kadapa DEO and summoned the school education director. Chinaveerabhadrudu told the high court bench headed by the Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that there has been a clerical mistake happened in drafting the proceedings by Kadapa DEO. He said no school was being pressurised or coerced to give consent and the scheme was voluntary. Chinaveerabhadrudu explained that corrective measures have been taken and the proceedings issued by the Kadapa DEO were withdrawn. He said all the officers concerned have been directed not to force any aided school to give consent for takeover by the government. The bench asked Chinaveerabhadrudu to submit the directions given by him. As he said the instructions were given orally, the high court asked why the such directions were given orally over the phone and not in the written form. The bench observed that it appears the officials are coercing the school managements to given consent. Chinaveerabhadrudu said no instructions were given to any official and the scheme was completely on voluntary basis. Director of school education told the bench that no instructions were given to any official in the state and the takeover scheme was completely on voluntary basis. The schools that are willing to continue in the existing form will be given aid as usual by the government, he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/no-pressure-on-aided-schools-hc-told/articleshow/86623603.cms||Srikanth Aluri

He saw the girl playing outside her house and took her to a nearby shop on the pretext of buying a ‘samosa’. Thereafter, he assaulted her sexually and drowned her in a water-filled pit due to fear of being caught. He then ran away from the village. The girl’s clothes which were missing from her body were recovered a few metres away from the crime scene. Superintendent of police (Rural) Shubham Patel said that investigations are on. A few people, meanwhile, had created ruckus when the girl’s body was being taken out by the police. They have been now booked under various sections of IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder). Around 80 people, including 20 identified ones, were booked and of these four were remanded to judicial custody on Wednesday.

The neighbour had come along with his wife and a minor son for dinner at the nine-year-old's house when he took her away and sexually assaulted her. The man was under the influence of alcohol and also threatened the girl to remain quiet which is why she didn’t inform her parents about the assault earlier, police said. The crime was reported from a locality under the limits of Izzatnagar police station. The man’s wife is four months pregnant. She was horrified to know about her husband’s heinous act. An FIR was registered on Tuesday after the little girl complained of pain in her private parts and upon further questioning by her grandmother, she told her that she was sexually assaulted by the “uncle”. The girl’s parents immediately informed police and ensured the accused was arrested and sent to jail. On Wednesday, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “The accused is known to the family and had threatened the girl to remain quiet. She was scared and told her grandmother about the assault after two days.” After the complaint, police registered an FIR under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC along with the Pocso Act. A medical examination was conducted and doctors confirmed sexual assault.

As per the plan, Agarwal arrived in Bhiwadi from Haryana on August 21. “He conducted a recce of a scrap dealer and bakery shop in the region. He then contacted one Pankaj Dubai through Amit Dagar. The latter facilitated men and firearms and directed Agarwal to drop extortion slips at the doorsteps of the two businessmen,” an official said. Pankaj arranged several goons who met Agarwal at different locations near in Kmp highway and Dharuhera overbridge. On August 24 and September 13, the accused fired several rounds at the two commercial establishments and dropped notes demanding extortions from their owners. All the accused scurried off in different directions after the incident. Bhiwadi police said that a special team was constituted which tracked down the tree accused following an intensive search across multiple cities from Haryana to Uttar Pradesh. Police discovered that the gang members were operating from different jails of the country while one of the kingpins was based in Dubai. They planned extortions by speaking to each other through different apps. Police said that Deepak Agarwal has joined the criminal world out of desperation because he had a lot of debt on him. While the other accused involved in the crime are still on the run, police said that special teams are working round the clock to arrest all shooters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/3-of-extortion-gang-held-for-firing-at-bakery-scrap-shops/articleshow/86628838.cms||---

Speaking after inaugurating Hima Dialysis Centre at Kalikavu in Malappuram, he said that India was not merely a territory, but ‘its people and the relationships between the people’. “My problem with the Prime Minister is that he is breaking relationships between the people of India. He is attacking the idea of India. And in the same way he breaks relationships, it is my job, my duty and my commitment to build a bridge between people of India,” Rahul said. He added that every time the PM uses hatred to break the relationships between people, his job was to rebuild the bridges between people of India. Rahul said that the political fights taking place in the country were between humility and arrogance. “The political question being asked today is what is India? If you read people like Savarkar, they would say India is geography. They take a pen, draw a map and say this is India; outside the line is not India and inside this line is India. But, India for me is the people who live here and also the relationships between the people who live here. These are the two visions of India. They say India is a territory, we say India is people and relationships,” he said. The function was attended by Opposition leader VD Satheesan, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, IUML leader Panakkad Sadikali Shihab Thangal, MP PV Abdul Wahab, among others. Later in the day, he inaugurated a recreation centre for senior citizens at Chennamangallur in the district and laid the foundation stone for AIMER at Markaz Knowledge City in Kozhikode. Rahul, who arrived at Calicut International Airport in the morning, was received by KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan. Rahul had discussions with the KPCC leadership on the organizational issues in the state unit of the party at Kadavu resort in the morning. Later, speaking to the media in Kozhikode, the KPCC president said that Rahul appreciated the activities carried out by the state unit during the meeting.

The government will initially start promotion of the Lakhimpur Kheri-Pilibhit-Katarniaghat circuit that has Dudhwa tiger reserve, Pilibhit tiger reserve and Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary since it is developed and will start development of three others on priority. UP Forest Corporation (UPFC), which is nodal agency for ecotourism, has proposed dry runs on three ecotourism circuits — the Agra-Etawah circuit, Vindhyan circuit and Gorakhpur circuit. “The dry runs will be held by local officers of the forest department during the wildlife week, which is the first week of October. The department will take its officials on a tour of the circuit to review the existing facilities and identify others that need to be provided to tourists,” said UPFC GM Eva Sharma. The Agra-Etawah circuit would start from Taj Nature Walk and include the Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary (Keetham lake) in Agra, the National Chambal Sanctuary famous for ghariyals and over 300 bird species and finally the lion safari at Etawah. Since there is a heavy footfall of foreign tourists in Agra, tapping them for ecotourism would be a profitable move for the forest department. The Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit would start from Varanasi and cover Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls on the dam built on Chandraprabha river flowing through the state’s oldest wildlife sanctuary, the Chandraprabha Wildlife Sanctuary in Chandauli.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/govt-to-push-ecotourism-add-facilities-at-nine-circuits-in-up/articleshow/86628943.cms||Neha Shukla

The statement came in response to the National Child Commission for Protection of Child Rights’ claim that the proposed amendment legitimises child marriages. The state commission said misconceptions were being spread regarding the bill and that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 can only be amended only by the central government. The state bill gives legal rights to minor girls who become widows at a young age, said RSCPCR chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal. The activists, on the other hand, claim that the proposed law would validate child marriages in Rajasthan and would make annulment of such marriages even more cumbersome. Calling child marriage a curse, Beniwal said, “We often get to see such cases where the girl is a child widow and due to non-registration of marriage, she is denied the rights in husband’s property and not accepted in society, which ruins her life. In the event of any crime, children cannot be deprived of other justifiable rights. A similar situation is also with those children who have been born from child wedlock and in the event of the death of their parents, their mental and social development is deeply affected. This amendment has been made for child widows and children. It will be successful in getting the children their right in society.” Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009 said the parties, or in case the parties have not completed the age of 21 years, the parents or as the case may be, guardian of the parties, shall be responsible to submit the memorandum within a period of thirty days from the date of solemnization of the marriage to the Registrar within whose jurisdiction the marriage is solemnized or both or any of the parties resides. However, now the proposed amendment allows for parents of girls below the age of 18 and boys below the age of 21 to register their children’s marriages within 30 days“Marriage registration will be more helpful in protecting the rights of the victim-affected children such as child marriage annulment, protection services, maintenance, custody of children born out of child marriage, connected with survival and various other benefits”, added Beniwal. Stating that child marriage is a curse, a social evil and illegal, she appealed to the people to inform authorities if they have any information about a child marriage being conducted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/child-marriage-a-curse-amendment-does-not-encourage-it-commission/articleshow/86628915.cms||---

In the past 10 years, speeding vehicles have knocked down seven tigers and a leopard on roads passing through the forest areas of these districts. The speed limit, which is 30 km per hour, is flouted with impunity in the absence of any check. This despite the fact that forest department can enforce law if any vehicle hits a wild animal. To teach a lesson to such offenders, a fine of Rs 4.50 lakh was slapped on a Gujarat-based tourist bus for mowing down a deer on July 17, 2020, but that, too, did not yield the desired results. Field director, DTR, Sanjay Pathak said, “We request people to follow speed limit while driving past forest areas. A tigress was recently run over by a car. The animal suffered excruciating pain and died eventually. The scene is still fresh in my mind. Compassion is all we need to save wildlife.” “We are on the lookout for the car driver and will ensure he is arrested and sent to jail, “Pathak added A wildlife activist, Siddharth Singh, told TOI, “UP has lost eight tigers in 2021 and two of them, both females, died in road accidents. The recent revival of NH-730 that passes through dense forests of PTR and DTR poses a risk to the wild animals as there are no speed breakers. The ministry of road transport and highways had decided to remove the speed bumps to ensure a smooth ride for motorists on national highways. “Safety of animals should be a priority while carrying out construction works in a wildlife habitat. Every year, several reptiles are killed by rashly-driven vehicles. The ministry of environment forest and climate change should provide necessary equipment to the forest department and ensure hefty fines on those violating the speed limit."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/eight-big-cats-knocked-down-by-speeding-vehicles-in-up-since-2011/articleshow/86623777.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

For the past two board exams, the marks were awarded to students based on internal assessments as well as previous year’s marks. However, school representatives said there should be clear guidelines on the internal exams and marking pattern so that they are ready in case there is a situation of no-exam in February-March. The education officials said that a committee has been formed to decide the assessment pattern and once they submit the report, the details would be announced by the department. Vaidehi Pawar, a school teacher in Indapur said, “We have started our planning for the internal assessment which will be the second so far this academic year. However, if the department had announced the plan at the start of the academic year it would have been easier for us to schedule the exams.” For the last two exams, the internals were largely used as base for marking the board students, but it had created a lot of confusion among school teachers as many marks had to be revoked from the past and students were made to reattempt in some cases when their marks were not found. Another school teacher, Prakash Satpute, said, “Many students had not given the internal exams or class assessments as they were in remote places and had a tough time with network and connectivity. We had to conduct the exam for such students after the decision about assessment was announced by the government. It was a lot of work in very little time. If we are given some idea about the assessment and plan B is announced in case exams are not conducted in paper and pen manner then it is going to be very easy for all of us to be prepared for it.” Soham Pathak, a std XII student, said, “Looking at the situation, it looks like we will have to give the exam in a traditional manner, but the situation can change at any point and not just students, the government should be ready for it and anticipate the uncertainties. We started classes in April so we are in the last leg of the portion as we will have mock tests starting from November-end and the government is still not ready with its plan.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/schools-edgy-about-std-x-xii-assessments-indecision/articleshow/86626412.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar sought a response from the government while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by K Gurunathan of Trichy district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that as per provisions of the Central Act, Lokpal was conferred with powers to inquire into corruption charges against anyone including the Prime Minister. He added that as per the central Act, Lokpal has a separate inquiry wing and prosecution wing to inquire into the allegations of corruption against the officials and to prosecute them. There was no separate inquiry or prosecution wing to deal with the corruption charges against the officials under the state Act. The petitioner further stated that the central government employees should submit their assets and liabilities to their concerned department every year as per the central Act. There was no such provision in the state Act. He added that the state Act was powerless and is against the Constitution and was also against the Centre’s policy of ‘zero tolerance against corruption’. Gurunathan stated that he submitted representations to the government seeking to amend the state Act to make it more powerful like the central Act.

A delegation led by TPCC senior vice president G Niranjan met Shashank Goel on Wednesday and requested him to ensure a free and fair by-election in Huzurabad Assembly constituency. “Despite having written twice to the Election Commissioner of India (ECI) that the first level checking (FLC) of electronic voting machines was not done properly and that it should be done in the presence of political party representatives, the ECI has announced the by-poll without even consulting the political parties,” Niranjan said. The Congress leader also brought to the notice that the budget of Dalit Bandhu scheme is being rooted through bank account of the district collector, who in turn is also the district election authority. “Ministers T Harish Rao and Gangula Kamalakar are holding meetings with caste-based organisations.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra University IP policy to promote innovation||VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time for any university in Andhra Pradesh, Andhra University has prepared an ‘Intellectual Property Policy’. Now, ‘The Centre for IPR’ of the university will oversee the documentation process and bear the cost involved in filing for IP rights such as patents. The faculty of the varsity can avail a three-year sabbatical, if they want to work on their venture/start-up (academic spin-off). As per the IP policy, all the research scholars from applied sciences and engineering branches should apply for IP rights for their research work. IPR has been made a mandatory credit for a few branches of engineering students of the varsity. DPIIT-IPR Chair, Andhra University, Prof Hanumanthu Purushotham said that the grant of the patent usually takes about three to four years. “The process involves 56 steps, costing about Rs 8-10 lakh. Now, the university has decided to bear all the costs involved in filing IP rights under this new policy. Once granted, The IP rights will lie with the university. The inventor will get 70% of the revenue generated out of licensing and royalty, while the university will have 30% share. The university may also accept equity in lieu of licensing fee and royalty from the start-ups and academic spin-offs,” said Prof Purushotham. The university has allocated Rs 2 crore for ‘The Centre for IPR’ from funds appropriated under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme, apart from the financial assistance being received from the union ministry of commerce and industry. The department for promotion of industry and internal trade of the Union ministry of commerce and industry recently sanctioned an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Chair to Andhra University. Prof Purushotham added that students, research scholars or faculty members can now directly approach the Centre. “They shall submit the invention disclosure form, which will be evaluated for its novelty, patentability criteria and market potential. The policy is expected to nurture innovation and IPR culture in the university. The benefits include improving employability skills of the students and creating awareness on the innovations and IP rights. ,” said Prof Purushotham.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/au-ip-policy-to-promote-innovation/articleshow/86623795.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This was revealed in reply to an RTI petition by activist K Hakkim which gave details of seven types of taxes due to these corporations.The 11 other corporations are Thanjavur, Dindigul, Erode, Hosur, Tirupur, Salem, Nagercoil, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Vellore and Avadi. The total amount due on these seven taxes was Rs 5855 crore, but only Rs 2,333 crore or about 40% of it could be collected. The 13 corporations should have collected Rs 2,759 crore property tax in the last three years, but only Rs1,207 crore had been collected, with dues worth Rs 1,552 crore pending. The civic authorities seemed to be lenient on collecting vacant land tax also as only Rs 74 crore of the Rs 345 crore was collected. Similarly, only Rs 372 crore of Rs 802 crore water tax, and Rs 86 crore of Rs 382 crore underground drainage tax were collected.The previous government had collected only Rs 226 crore of the Rs 425 crore pending professional tax. Non-tax revenue, that is recurring income for the government from sources other than taxes, was Rs 909 crore in these corporations but only Rs 230 crore was collected. SUC tax (for sewage maintenance) was Rs 229 crore but only Rs 92 crore was collected. Hakkim points out that the collection of taxes could go a long way in implementing many developmental projects in the civic bodies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/13-tn-corpns-have-to-collect-rs-3522-cr-tax-dues/articleshow/86626487.cms||---
---||Madurai||Udhayanidhi asked people to take fraudulent gold loans: Annamalai||Tuticorin: BJP state president K Annamalai has accused DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin of instigating people to take fraudulent gold loans during his assembly poll campaigns and hence he should be the first to be booked.“Udhayanidhi Stalin campaigned that they will come to power and asked those who have not pledged their gold to do so and obtain money. He said they will return the jewellery to them after assuming power. Now the chief minister said in the assembly that action will be taken against those who availed those loans through fraudulent means. It will be fair if the first FIR is registered against Udhayanidhi Stalin,” Annamalai told reporters here ahead of campaigning for the local body elections in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi.On the revenge murders in the southern region, the former IPS officer said the police are capable of keeping them under check provided the government extended a free hand to the police without interfering in their work. “That will reduce law and order issues by 50%,” he added. The BJP leader accused the DMK of stealing the credit for schemes introduced by the Prime Minister by affixing stickers with images of their leaders on relief materials such as PM Garib Kalyan Yojana. The PM is also not being given credit for the mass Covid-19 vaccination camps in the state. He questioned the TN government’s logic behind reopening schools for students of Classes I to VIII who are not vaccinated and not reopening temples from Friday to Sunday for vaccinated adults. On NEET, he said it was not the test but the deceitful speeches of DMK ministers and leaders that are enemies of students.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/udhayanidhi-asked-people-to-take-fraudulent-gold-loans-annamalai/articleshow/86626509.cms||---

---||Pune||Second wettest September in 27 years bridges monsoon deficit||PUNE: This month has turned out to be the second wettest September for the country in the past 27 years, India Meteorological Department (IMD) data revealed. With one more day left for September to end, the month has recorded 34% excess rains at 223 mm (September 1-29) against a monthly normal of 166.6 mm. The rain recorded so far during September in the country is the second best figure for rains during the month since 1994. Consecutive low pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal caused September to get excess rains, causing the seasonal monsoon rain for 2021 to touch the near-normal level despite a deficient August. India’s monsoon rain on the whole touched 867.8 mm till September 29, as against a normal of 877 mm. The best September in terms of monthly rain for the country after 1993 was in 2019, when India recorded an excess of 52% during the month. September 1993 had recorded 36.9% excess rain, after which September 2019 and 2021 have received the highest monthly rain. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI, “The IMD had forecast above-normal rain in September. There were consecutive low pressure systems, and depressions over the Bay of Bengal in September. Thus, the monsoon was active during the month. Our latest prediction for the entire monsoon 2021 was that it may end up being on the lower side of normal, and thus far, the departure from the long period average for June-September 2021 is just -1%. The rain in September made a significant contribution to the season, and overall we had a near-normal monsoon this year.” D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “September turned out to be just the opposite of August. August this year ended up with a big deficit in Central India at -39% as well as Northwest India at -30. 6%.  In September, the negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) weakened and Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) became favourable, which was not the case in August. Several low pressure systems formed over the Bay of Bengal, some of which had re-emerged from the northwest Pacific, which too had not happened in August.” Pai said the monsoon trough was very active in September, giving very good rain in central India. “In September, India received more rain than it had in August (196.2 mm) , though the normal rain for August is higher than that of September,” said Pai. Monsoon generally tends to weaken in September as it gets into its withdrawal mode. “But it did not this year. “Because the monsoon was strong in September, the depression over Bay of Bengal turned into the cyclonic storm Gulab. Even before Gulab, India’s total seasonal monsoon rains had touched 98% of normal,” he said. Pai said northwest India’s rain in September had been 40.2% excess till the 29th of the month, which will be favourable for rabi crops. Central India’s September excess so far is a massive 83%. “Good September rain will ensure good soil moisture in the rabi season. Also, with the increased dependence of agriculture on groundwater, good September rain helped in recharging aquifers that may have been used to irrigate crops during kharif this year,” said Pai.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/this-month-2nd-wettest-sept-in-country-in-27-years-imd/articleshow/86626483.cms||Neha Madaan

AICC general secretary (in charge of Kerala) Tariq Anwar informed that Sudheeran’s resignation has not been accepted by the party high command. He admitted that there is a serious difference of opinion between the leaders in state and it will have to be settled through discussions. However, the high command is concerned that senior leaders in the state are not supporting the new leadership which was appointed to bring about a change in the party. Sources in the high command said the resignation of Sudheeran and the outbursts by senior leaders like Mullappally Ramachandran will only weaken the party now. The high command is also concerned over the ongoing process of reorganizing the committees at KPCC and DCC level since it feels that it would be a hard task as there are serious differences between leaders. KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan will be reaching New Delhi on Oct 8 for talks with high command. Already, group leaders have submitted a list to the KPCC leadership on the persons who have to be accommodated in different committees. It is learnt that the KPCC president has decided to submit the list given by group leaders to the high command since he was at the receiving end on the choice of new DCC presidents, defying the demands of the groups.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-high-command-hasnt-accepted-sudheerans-resignation/articleshow/86626557.cms||---

The chief minister asked Nishad to give a complaint in this regard for further action. After being nominated as MLC, the NISHAD Party chief met the CM on Friday and raised the issues of Phoolan’s property and reservation to the ‘machhua’ community. The CM said minister Siddharth Nath Singh has been entrusted with the task to get anomalies in reservation benefits to Nishads removed. Nishad Party alleges that Phoolan’s property was usurped by her staff. Dr Nishad had visited Phoolan’s samadhi sthal at Chaubeghat in Mirzapur earlier this month and had said he would appeal to the central and state governments to order a high-level inquiry to probe what happened to her property after her death. “Her mother is living in a pitiable condition,” he had added. Phoolan was shot outside her residence in Delhi on July 25, 2001, when she was Samajwadi Party MP from Mirzapur. She was born in August 1963 in a Mallah family of Shekhpur Gudha ka Purwa village in Jalaun and became MP in 1996.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/phoolans-property-usurped-her-mother-is-in-pitiable-state/articleshow/86629030.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

His blood tests showed low haemoglobin, low white blood cells and platelet count going below 14,000. His liver and kidney function tests were deranged. Last week, Sagar was diagnosed with haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLH), an increasingly reported complication of dengue. Investigations revealed that the complication had stemmed from secondary dengue infection, which was confirmed after he tested positive for two different dengue antibodies — IgM and IgG. While dengue IgM antibody shows recent infection, the dengue IgG antibody shows past infection. A different strain of the dengue virus had infected Sagar for the second time. The first dengue infection with a different strain would have been many months or years ago. Secondary dengue is the biggest risk factor for severe dengue and doctors are seeing a rise in such cases in Pune over the last two months. Ruby Hall Clinic’s physician Abhijit Lodha said, “Of late, we are seeing quite a surge in cases of secondary dengue infections in Pune where dengue is very severe and patients undergo a lot of complications.” Lodha has seen 15 cases of secondary dengue infection in the last few days. Agreeing, Abrarali Dalal, chief executive officer, Sahyadri hospitals said, “We have recorded five cases of secondary dengue infection in the last few days.” “During a primary (first) dengue infection, patients’ IgM dengue antibody levels are very high but they test negative for IgG dengue antibody. But in secondary dengue infection, patients test positive for both the antibodies. And their IgM antibody levels are lower than IgG,” Lodha said. The levels of IgG actually increase during secondary infection. Clinicians can measure the amount of IgM and IgG to tell if a patient has a primary or a secondary dengue infection, Lodha said. Secondary dengue can manifest as persistent vomiting, abdominal tenderness, fluid accumulation in lungs and abdomen, bleeding, lethargy and restlessness, jaundice and very low blood pressure (shock). “Rarely patients can develop HLH (like in case of Sagar), which results due to abnormal and dysregulated activation of our immunity due to dengue infection,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans. Senior physician and intensivist Rajesh Gadia has seen 50 cases of secondary dengue infection since July. “In secondary dengue infection, patient’s IgG dengue antibody shows a spike in the first five days, and then s/he tests positive for IgM antibody. We see a sizable number of patients with secondary infection in Pune.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/patient-count-with-secondary-dengue-infection-rises-in-city/articleshow/86626554.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The district collector issued the draft notification shortly before the Election Commission of India (EC) released the bypoll schedule with enforcement of model code of conduct (MCC) on Tuesday. Though the constitution of a new revenue division with Badvel as headquarters has been on the cards for the past one year, the district administration delayed the issuance of the notification as it was held up with one election after another. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had in fact laid foundation stone for the construction of revenue divisional officer’s (RDO) office during his visit to the constituency in July. Badvel is presently part of Rajampet revenue division. The new revenue division would comprise seven mandals of Badvel assembly constituency and three mandals of Mydukuru assembly constituency. Badvel will be the fourth revenue division in the district as it already has three divisions - Kadapa, Rajampet and Jammalamadugu. Interestingly, Kadapa district, with just 10 assembly constituencies, is getting one more revenue division while many big districts have just three revenue divisions.The new revenue division is expected to take the administration closer to the public and resolve their grievances fast. Badvel is a border revenue division close to Nellore district and is located nearly 60km away from the district headquarters city Kadapa. Many of the mandals in Badvel are over 100km away from Kadapa due to which people were facing hardship in reaching the headquarters.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/ap-clears-notification-for-badvel-revenue-div/articleshow/86626537.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Will raise Hindutva cause for BJP victory in UP polls, says Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha national president Tejasvi Surya||LUCKNOW: After setting caste equations on a salutary course, BJP is all set to woo the youth by instilling the core ‘Hindutva’ ideology in run-up to crucial UP assembly elections early next year. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Tejasvi Surya, national president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), youth arm of BJP, said, “We will go all out to raise the Hindutva cause, which is the essence of India’s civilisation and ensure the party under CM Yogi Adityanath’s leadership returns to power with a thumping majority.” Bharat can only survive with the strength of Hindutva, said the 30-year-old BJP MP from Bangalore (South), a day ahead of his maiden visit to Ayodhya, a nerve centre of Hindutva politics. Surya is also scheduled to address the inaugural session of BJYM working committee meeting in Lucknow on Friday. The lawyer-turned-politician will reach Ayodhya along with senior office-bearers of BJYM’s UP unit. Besides ‘darshan’ of Ram Lalla and visiting Hanumangarhi, Surya is scheduled to attend ‘Yuva Samagam’ at Ram Katha park in the temple town, where scores of youth are expected to reach. The programme is also expected to be attended by Ayodhya MP Lallu Singh, BJP MP from Basti Harish Dwivedi and Kaiserganj MP Braj Bhusahan Sharan Singh. “I will be going to the birthplace of Ram as a devotee from the land of Hanuman,” said Surya, whose profile on the Lok Sabha website categorically defines him as a “core believer in Hindutva, an inclusive philosophy that has been the core of Bharat since ancient times.” He lauded the Yogi government for taking various steps, including renovation of temples and re-building holy cities, besides introducing anti-conversion and love jihad laws. “All these are important issues for ushering in ‘Ram Rajya’ and protecting the identity of UP as an important state of India,” he said. Known for his proximity to RSS, Tejasvi was learnt to have been propped as a party candidate in 2019 Lok Sabha elections at the instance of BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, a Sangh affiliate. He was chosen over Tejaswini Ananth Kumar, widow of senior BJP leader Ananth Kumar who passed away in 2018. Surya’s visit to Ayodhya and Lucknow coincides with BJP rolling out its election machinery with swift political moves like appointing Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan as party in charge of UP elections and deputing Union minister Anurag Thakur to head the IT war-room and mobilise the youth. The party has also firmed up the alliance with Sanjay Nishad-led NISHAD party and inducted cabinet ministers from different castes.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/will-raise-hindutva-cause-for-bjp-victory-in-up-polls-tejasvi-surya/articleshow/86629080.cms||Pankaj Shah

At other times, the 29-year-old first-generation graduate teaches art to children, which is his passion.The youngest of five children of Karuthakalai and Panchavarnam, Sankar did his BSc and MSc at Raja Duraisingham Memorial Arts College, Sivaganga. All his four siblings, two brothers and two sisters, were working as daily wagers and they had all pooled in their earnings to educate him. ``I applied for many jobs, but never got a salary exceeding Rs 5,000 a month. So, I opted for diploma in fine arts and started teaching art in private schools, but that job too was short-lived when Covid-19 struck and schools closed,’’ he said.All the while, he has been going to graveyards and helping his parents, something he was used to from a young age. At the age of fifteen, he had started cremating bodies. Now, with no proper job on hand, it came in handy. He has been cremating bodies in the five graveyards in Manamadurai which do not have electric crematoriums. “Now, I have to fend for my family which includes my parents, wife and daughter,” says he.It was during the second wave of Covid that he became really busy in the crematorium, handling more than hundred bodies. ``There were many bodies and there were distraught people who did not have money for cremation. For them I did it free of cost,’’ he said. The fee for a single cremation ranges between Rs 500 and Rs 600. But sometimes when people say they do not have sufficient cash, he asks them to bring him a sapling when they can as payment.Sankar dreams about getting a job as he is a first-generation graduate in his family. He is counting on chief minister M K Stalin’s word that the government will give priority to first generation graduates in government jobs.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/he-toiled-to-earn-pg-now-he-cremates-bodies/articleshow/86626529.cms||---

Hence, new tenders should be called and the roads laid before the northeast monsoon, he added.He said that the capacity of the motors in sewage pumping stations was not powerful enough to deal with the load, as the number of residents had increased in Madurai city. Hence, this problem should be rectified, Raju said.Raju said that when the AIADMK came to power in 2011, he and others had approached the then chief minister J Jayalalithaa and sought Rs 500 crore for developmental works in Madurai. She had sanctioned Rs 250 crore immediately. Now, chief minister M K Stalin should sanction Rs 1,000 crore for Madurai, he said.Karthikeyan convened a meeting on expediting the Periyar bus stand work which was being implemented and said steps should be taken to bring it to public use soon.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/expedite-various-civic-body-works-in-madurai-ex-minister/articleshow/86626551.cms||---

"Many film producers and theatre owners are against the government's proposal to take control of collections. I raised the issue and asked the government to solve it.

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar was hearing the PIL filed by an academician K K Suresh of Thanjavur district challenging clause (d) which says that a candidate must have published not less than 10 research papers as first author (at least six months before the constitution of VC search committee) in the rated journals after acquiring PhD and clause (e) which says that a candidate must have guided at least five successful PhD candidates.He stated that the government has the power to notify only the qualification regarding education and experience. The qualifications prescribed under clauses (d) and (e) do not qualify either as education or an experience.The petitioner stated that qualification under clause (e) would exclude all those who work either in the academic line or in the research institutions other than the cities of Madurai and Coimbatore where research for PhD could be pursued.

Joint deputy director of education, Meena Shendkar said students are still waiting for a chance to get admission in popular, well-regarded colleges. “The cut-off has not reduced below 90% and students with lower marks are still hoping that they have a chance in these colleges. Hence, many students have still not confirmed their admissions yet,” said Shendkar. Many colleges have not filled up their seats and the situation in some colleges is such that they are contemplating shutting down FYJC because of poor enrolment.

Owaisi cited specific provisions of service rules and Supreme Court rulings to challenge the government’s decision. “Uttar Pradesh government has set up an SIT to investigate a six-year-old video of senior IAS officer Mohammed Iftekharuddin. The video has been taken out of context and is from a time when this government was not even in power. This is blatant targeted harassment based on religion,” he said during an event in Lucknow. Later, talking exclusively to TOI, Owaisi said if the parameter was that no officer should be associated with any religious activity, then the use of all religious symbols and images in offices should be banned. “If merely discussing faith at home is a crime then punish any officer who participates in public religious celebration. Why double standards,” he asked. Lambasting the SP, BSP and the Congress for their silence, he said: “Why are all parties scared of speaking up on an issue related to a Muslim IAS officer?”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/probe-against-ias-officer-is-targeted-harassment-owaisi/articleshow/86629133.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Another co-accused, P Shanmugam, an IAS officer who was director for rehabilitation of disabled when the offence was committed, was sentenced to a three-year jail term. While the former minister, who switched loyalty and joined the DMK a few years ago, and her husband were taken into custody immediately after the verdict as the jail sentence exceeded three years, the former IAS officer filed a petition ‘seeking suspension of sentence. Indira Kumari complained of chest pain on hearing the judgment and was taken to Government Royapettah Hospital. In 1997, the CB-CID had booked Indira Kumari, her husband, personal assistant and two other senior IAS officers in the department after they were found to have floated two trusts M/s Mercy Mother India Charitable Trust & M/s Bharani Swathi Educational Ttrust and committed criminal breach of trust to swindle government funds to the tune of Rs 15.4 lakh. According to the prosecution, the former minister’s husband Babu was the managing trustee of these trusts. The accused had connived and siphoned off government funds in the guise of establishing and running a special school for hearing impaired children by Mercy Mother India Charitable Trust in the then North Arcot district and a special school for severely orthopedically challenged children in Chennai, causing loss to the government. CB-CID had booked them under various Sections of IPC including 420 (cheating), besides for offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, based on a complaint from the then social welfare and nutritious meal programme secretary, Lakshmi Pranesh. After completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed before the principal sessions judge, Chennai, in February 2004 and subsequently the case was transferred to the special court for criminal cases concerning MLAs and MPs. After more than 17 years of trial, assistant sessions Judge N Alicia sentenced Indira Kumari and her husband to rigorous imprisonment for five years each, and a fine of Rs 10,000 each, failing which they shall undergo six more months of imprisonment.

Their heart conditions worsened by the time they got hospitalized,” he added. He further said that steps must be taken to reduce the time of the onset of the symptoms of ischemia (reduction in blood flow) to patient arrival to the hospital.Dr N Ganesan, head, department of Cardiology, MMHRC, said that heart disease is the number one killer, accounting for 30% of all deaths in India. “It is pitiful that about 40% of the heart patients are under 45 years of age. When people in their most productive years of 30s and 40s develop or succumb to heart diseases, their families face severe financial hardships,” he added. He added that fast-paced life factors like stress, fast food and lack of sleep are emerging as big risks for young adults. “Youth must assess their risks of getting a cardiovascular disease early, develop a plan for appropriate lifestyle changes and adhere to it in order to remain healthy,” he noted.Meanwhile, doctors, students, nurses at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), took out a rally to observe World Heart Day from the hospital to the Madurai district collectorate. The theme of the ‘World Heart Day 2021’ is ‘Use heart to connect’.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/delayed-care-caused-40-rise-in-heart-attacks-out-of-hospital-last-year-docs/articleshow/86626603.cms||---

But any new cars bought or hired by the government from April 2022 will be electric vehicles,” he said while addressing a news conference in the city. He said charging stations should be made available at petrol pumps and parking lots of housing societies and single buildings to encourage the use of electric vehicles. Thackeray said the government had a plan to make Pune a carbon neutral city by 2030. “Green house gas inventory of 43 cities will be conducted to understand what remedies should be undertaken. Pune should qualify to be one of the top 10 Bloomberg cities. We have spoken to the Pune divisional commissioner to appoint a point-person for the initiative.” He said, “Ever since the ban on single use plastic five years ago, the bar has been set high for Pune because the city is considered to be the knowledge capital of Maharashtra and the industrial powerhouse of the country. It is a place where citizens participate in cleaning campaigns at riversides as part of their weekend plans.” He said, “There has been a good response from NGOs, corporates and individuals for Majhi Vasundharaa, an initiative by the environment and climate change department to encourage active participation in various climate change mitigation initiatives in the state’s urban and rural areas.” Thackeray said the government was in talks with Pune International Centre (PIC) and Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) to work towards climate-resilient agriculture in the state. “The rains have been unreliable due to climate change over the past five-six years. We are trying to collaborate efforts to look for various ways to improve the situation. Focus will be on implementation of drip irrigation, rain water harvesting and intervention of technology where it can be helpful,” he said. Along with working towards carbon neutrality, the minister said, efforts would be taken to increase the use of electric vehicles, cycling tracks, urban forests and solid waste management in the entire Pune Metropolitan Region. Thackeray also visited the plant of the electric vehicle maker Kinetic Green, where he toured the facilities and was shown its inventory. He sought for an aggressive implementation of the new electric vehicle policies, adding that the state government would implement the purchase policies for such buses and cars, as well as vehicles for waste management and tourism. Will rising fuel prices push more people to shift to EVs?||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/from-april-maharashtra-govt-to-buy-only-e-vehicles-for-its-use/articleshow/86626662.cms||---

This is why autonomy has to be given to schools instead of it being a state-wide decision to reopen. Some areas have fewer Covid-19 cases while others have higher,” he said. With lockdown relaxed for most other facilities in the state, teachers and parents are asking if keeping schools shut for any longer is justifiable. K Saravanan, a primary school headmaster and zonal president, Child-Friendly Schools (CSF), said that on reopening, teachers must also reconsider their teaching methods for which training is needed. “Teachers will have to bridge the learning gap, especially for those at primary levels. They need to put in innovative ideas to ease children back into learning and keep classes interesting and exciting more than video lessons. Students need counselling too,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/many-schools-prefer-phased-reopening-for-classes-i-to-viii/articleshow/86626696.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The District Congress Committee had called a meeting on Wednesday at Sirsi to discuss the panchayat raj issue. Prashant Deshpande, son of RV Deshpande arrived late to the meeting and went up to the dais. He was urged by party leaders on the dais to address party workers. Prashant said he would speak later. But Ghotnekar, who was in the stage stood up and said he would speak first. When allowed Ghotnekar started his speech and said he has no knowledge about the panchayat raj system. He is an MLC elected from local bodies which include gram panchayats, taluk panchayats and zilla panchayat. Suddenly he changed the topic and started attacking RV Deshpande without naming him. Ghotnekar alleged that there were enemies within the party who were not interested in its growth. “These enemies block any work that is done for the growth of the party by expelling people who have joined Congress from BJP,” he alleged. This angered party workers who shouted at Ghotnekar and began raising slogans in favour of Deshpande. At this juncture, Ghotnekar’s supporters also raised slogans in favour of their leader. Senior leaders intervened and separated the clashing groups. An embarrassed Congress leader said it was a ‘minor’ incident and will be sorted out.

According to police, the burglars broke open the office of Moeen Ali Malik on Tuesday night when it was raining heavily in the city. The thieves stole Rs 5 lakh cash from the ground floor of the office and 1,400 grams of gold jewellery and raw gold from the upper floor. Police said that the gold belonged to Malik’s customers, who had given it to him for designing different ornaments. During investigation it also came to light that the burglars had broken the CCTV cameras of the office and had stolen the digital video recorder of the cameras too. “There was another safe which was fixed in the wall due to which the thieves could not break it. Had that safe been broken open, valuables worth crores of rupees would have been stolen,” said a police official. Cops are now interrogating the 25 workers employed by Malik. They are also going through footage of CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity. Police from A Division police station and crime branch sleuths are probing the incident. Malik, a native of West Bengal, had been running the jewellery firm Murali Ornaments for the last eight years in the city. Malik’s wife, brother and two sons are partners in the firm.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/cash-gold-worth-rs-80l-stolen-from-jewellers-office/articleshow/86626753.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||‘Cut 40% air pollution in city to meet NCAP goal’||Lucknow: To be able to achieve goals set under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Lucknow needs to cut its current pollution level by about 40%. This would require a multi-pronged strategy that addresses challenges like reducing vehicular pollution, checking dust and reducing smog, monitoring activities of the industry and brick kiln and improving public transport. The facts came to fore at a round table on ‘Air Pollution: Facts to Act’, organised by a consortium of social organisations led by Lung Care Foundation here on Wednesday. Setting the context for the initiative, Dr Arvind Kumar, founder trustee said: “Air Pollution is a silent killer. In polluted countries, there are no non-smokers as air pollution impacts the lung the way second hand smoke does. It affects every organ in our body, including asthma, COPD, stroke and diabetes. The problem is as much related to unborn children as adults and children and cannot be ignored.” Retired IPS officer AP Maheshwari, who brought stakeholders on a common platform said: “There is no force equivalent to that of a civil society movement and cooperation. Unless the members of civil society take a firm resolution, no amount of efforts of various stakeholders can bring about success.” Calling for concerted action, founder trustee Rajiv Khurana said: “the consortium aims to evolve a stronger public private partnership, jointly understand the issues and undertake the solutions for the common good of the public for clean air and health.” Sectoral experts and academicians spoke at length on the various facets of the issue to chalk out a plan for policy makers. One of them, Shruti Bhimsaria, Lead, Research and Partnerships, EPIC India said “We hope that air quality life index (AQLI) findings will provide the policymakers and citizens much needed justification and motivation for implementing clean air policies."||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cut-40-air-pollution-in-city-to-meet-ncap-goal/articleshow/86629306.cms||---

The lab is expected to enhance rabies surveillance in the country. Balram Bhargava, secretary of the department of health research and director-general of ICMR dedicated the lab to the nation. ICMR-NIV also organized a webinar on rabies. A large number of scientists, medical faculty, researchers, and students from all over India participated. Rabies continues to be a major public health burden in India. The disease kills around 60,000 annually worldwide, with about 20,000 of these deaths in India alone. Though rabies is 100% preventable with vaccination, the general awareness about the disease remains quite low, leading to deaths, experts attending the webinar said. A global call for action, called ‘Zero By 30’ has been initiated by the World Health Organisation and other agencies, for eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths by 2030. Several experts in the field of virology including Priya Abraham, director, ICMR-NIV, Nivedita Gupta (scientist F) and in-charge of virology unit of ICMR, state surveillance officer Pradip Awate, medical expert Reeta S Mani, additional professor of neurovirology, NIMHANS, Bengaluru and medical expert Anita Mahadevan, head, department of neuropathology, NIMHANS and medical expert Sudhir Patsute, medical superintendent of Naidu Infectious Diseases hospital, Pune spoke on rabies.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/icmr-niv-unveils-rabies-lab-for-surveillance-hopes-to-meet-zero-death-target-set-for-2030/articleshow/86626726.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Society, govts following double standards, Muslims feeling oppressed, says Madani||Lucknow: Accusing the governments and the society of following “double standards” while dealing with Muslims, president of Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind (JuH), Mahmood Madani, on Wednesday claimed that the minority community “is feeling suppressed and isolated”. Speaking at a conclave organised by a private news channel in Lucknow, Madani alleged that the governments were registering cases against Muslims even for protesting in a democratic manner while no action was taken against other communities. “At least 24 incidents of mob lynching were reported in the last one month alone but no action was taken. Muslims are being sidelined because of their identity and are asked to prove their patriotism. This is destroying the multicultural identity of our country,” he said. “The recent arrest of Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui (for alleged illegal conversions) is another example. He has been working for years but the UP government has woken up now after four-and-a-half years and arrested him on the basis of false claims. Days before his arrest, he also met (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat during an event. Why was he invited to the event then? We will continue to defend Maulana Kaleem,” Madani said. Though Madani dodged direct questions on JuH’s stand on Taliban, he, however, said that the use of sword against an unarmed person cannot be justified at any cost. He claimed that the assembly elections in UP would be fought on communal lines rather than development and added that both the Centre and UP government were distracting people from real problems and divert their attention through communal issues. “Many cases were registered for anti-CAA protests but no FIR was lodged against anyone for lawlessness during the UP panchayat elections,” he remarked. Madani refused to comment when asked about his views on AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/society-govts-following-double-standards-muslims-feeling-oppressed-says-madani/articleshow/86629327.cms||Yusra Husain

The Pune ZP’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “After the general body approval, we forwarded the proposal to the state government for sanction. We have identified a land parcel, belonging to the state animal husbandry department, where the new facility is to come up.” Bhor and Velhe tehsils currently have one rural hospital and five primary health centres (PHCs). “The villages located on the highway do not have government-run medical facilities,” said ZP vice-president Ranjeet Shivtare. “The centre will benefit those living in 50 villages in Bhor, Velhe, Haveli, and Purandar,” he said. During the second wave, many patients could not get medical care in Bhor, said Chandrakant Bate, a resident of Kenjale village. Lahu Shelar, a resident of Malwadi, said the rural hospital in Bhor was 25km from the villages on the highway. “Beds were not available during the second wave and most of them were admitted to private hospitals. The government should construct the facility at the earliest,” Shelar added. “The location of Nasrapur is strategic. People from Bhor and Velhe tehsils can reach the facility conveniently,” Prasad said. A senior ZP health department official said, “We are in the process of getting CSR funds from corporates. A multinational company has agreed in-principle to construct the facility under its CSR activity. Once we get the sanction, a modern facility will be set up,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/zp-approves-trauma-unit-in-nasrapur-to-help-road-accident-victims-locals/articleshow/86626756.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kochi||KCBC denies discord among Churches, bats for harmony||Kochi: Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC), which includes Latin Catholic, Syro-Malankara and Syro-Malabar bishops, on Wednesday said that the council rejects attempts to create an impression that any kind of division or tension exists between Churches. The council’s statement urges that when social evils are being pointed out, strong action needs to be taken with serious discussion and studies, instead of deviating from the topic with other issues. The statement comes in the backdrop of the recent controversy over the ‘narcotic jihad’ remark made by Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt. Earlier, a meeting of leaders from various religions hosted by Cardinal Baselios Cleemis, major archbishop of Malankara Church, was held and it was attended by Archbishop Soosa Pakiam of the Latin Church. Interestingly, it was not attended by any leaders of the Syro-Malabar Church. Cardinal Cleemis had said at the meeting that narcotics must be viewed as just that and not anything else. KCBC, however, in Wednesday’s statement did not directly refer to the narcotic jihad remark. The statement said that the council rejects the tendencies to harm religious harmony by exaggerating and misinterpreting the ‘warnings’ given out with the aim of preserving life in society. “Inter-religious dialogue and religious harmony is based on the basic tenets of Christianity which are love, truth and justice. On this, the Kerala Catholic church’s stand is the same as that of Pope Francis. KCBC sincerely wishes that secularism and religious harmony would prevail here forever and would always strive for the same. We also express our willingness to work with other communities in the fight against social evils,” said the statement, adding that everyone should treat others with respect. Bishop Kallarangatt had made the controversial remarks while delivering a message at Kuravilangad church in Kottayam district on September 8. Deepika, the church-run daily had published the transcript of the speech on September 11. “What we generally say about narcotic jihad is that it is a practice of destroying the lives of non-Muslims, especially youngsters, by making them drug addicts,” the bishop had said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kcbc-denies-discord-among-churches-bats-for-harmony/articleshow/86626811.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Ashram head booked for raping married woman||Rajkot: A seer of an ashram in Savarkundla was booked for allegedly raping a married woman in July. The 29-year-old woman lodged a complaint on Tuesday after telling her husband about the crime. According to police, the woman’s family members believed in the head of Kabir Ashram Guru Amardas. The woman has a daughter, but the family wanted her to have a son too and took her to the guru on July 18. The seer told the woman that a ceremony will have to be performed and she will be able to give birth to a son. But since it was the day of Guru Purnima, many followers were present at the ashram. The accused therefore told the woman to meet him at midnight under a specific tree in the ashram campus. The woman went to meet the guru at midnight and consumed an apple as directed by him. After eating the apple, the woman lost her senses and the accused allegedly raped her. On regaining consciousness, she realized she was sexually assault but fearing that her image would be tarnished, she did not reveal anything to family. However, recently the accused sent a message to the woman on a social media platform apologizing and requesting her to not tell anyone about it. The woman’s husband saw the message and asked her what the message was about. It was then that the woman told her husband about the crime. She approached police and lodged a rape case at Savarkundla police station after her husband encouraged her.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/ashram-head-booked-for-raping-married-woman/articleshow/86626775.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cop set to spread awareness on women’s safety among students||NAGPUR: Senior inspector Ashalata Khapre from Wathoda police station aims to take the issues of women’s safety and empowerment to doorsteps of students, especially those between 13-17 years of age, in the coming days at various venues across east Nagpur. This week, Khapre and Nandanvan police senior inspector (senior PI) Mukhtar Sheikh jointly addressed students of KDK college of engineering through digital media. In the webinar, attended by around 120 students, the two senior officers assured assistance to women and girls in distress at the police-station level. Khapre, who had rescued five girls who left home after a tiff with parents earlier this month, said youngsters are “more prone to make hasty decisions” which go against their well-being. “We are observing that those between 13 and 17 years of age are falling prey to different allurements on social media. Our aim was to create awareness among these young girls, for whom the outside world is replete with traps,” said Khapre, who during the webinar with the engineering students, referred to the threats of human trafficking and flesh trade racketeers. She also said that any girl or woman who leaves home or elopes with her Facebook/Instagram friend just on the basis of some days of chatting, and goes 200-300km away is a recipe for disaster. Apart from young girls, Khapre also spoke on the plight of married women, who are often victims of domestic violence and abuse. “Women must come forward to lodge complaints and cops will definitely look into genuine grievances,” she said, adding that the enactment of Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, had helped police take stringent action, but one must be careful for their safety and security. Talking to TOI, Khapre said all the desolate places and vulnerable spots were being patrolled and monitored as per the instructions of city police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar and joint CP Aswati Dorje. “The Nandanvan senior PI and I intend to visit more schools and other educational institutes to create awareness about women’s safety," she said. Sheikh too said that they aim to raise the awareness level of young girls about security issues and safety measures. During his interaction with the engineering students, Sheikh motivated them to stay strong and positive, and “not to give in to suicidal thoughts”.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cop-set-to-spread-awareness-on-womens-safety-among-students/articleshow/86626794.cms||Soumitra Bose

The softshell turtles are listed under the schedule-1 of Wildlife Protection Act, a category which also has lions and tigers. The turtle was found in the Dhokadhar area of a village in Gir Gadhada taluka. After examining the softshell turtle, Dr Idrish Patel brought it to the forest rescue centre at Jamwala. Further examinations revealed that the fishing hook has got stuck in the nostrils of the turtle. As the doctor tried to remove the fishing hook, the shy creature used to go into its shell. “The turtle used to get scared of being touched and this made our task difficult. So, it was only after giving anaesthesia that I was able to remove the fishing hook from its nostrils,” Dr Patel said. Later, the turtle was released in its natural habitat. The fishing hook had damaged the turtle’s buccal cavity as well both the nostrils, Dr Patel informed. The fishermen use small fish or wheat flour as prey in the fishing hooks. The turtle might have got injured while eating such bait, Patel said. According to the forest department this species of turtle is normally seen in the rivers of Gir area. The maximum distribution of this turtle is in the northern part of India. This species is in danger because of loss of habitat due to pollution and constructions of dams and tidal barrages. Another factor contributing towards its declining numbers is overfishing.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/fishing-hook-removed-from-softshell-turtle/articleshow/86626883.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Residents of 100 more critically unsafe buildings in Kolkata still at high risk||KOLKATA: It was a disaster waiting to strike and it did at 10 Ahiritola Street on Wednesday. But the address could easily have been in Beadon Street, Sovabazar, Shyampukur or Jorasanko in the neighbourhood, or Cossipore further north, or Burrabazar and Hare Street to the south. There are at least 100 buildings that have been declared critically unsafe by KMC years ago but continue to be inhabited by residents who put their lives at risk every monsoon. According to a KMC records, the department has listed 3,000 city buildings as insecure. At 10 Ahiritola Street, the KMC building department had listed the building as critically unsafe a year ago and had urged the residents to vacate it. But despite the warning, 27-odd people who resided in the building continued to do so till the Wednesday morning collapse claimed two lives. “All the buildings that have been declared critically unsafe are equally at risk and can collapse any day. Several of them are located within a 2-km radius. Every time there is heavy rain, KMC building department engineers have a nightmare,” recounted a senior civic official. While most of the buildings that have been marked highly insecure are in north and central Kolkata, including College Street, Taltala, Ripon Street, Elliot Road and Lenin Sarani, there are neighbourhoods to the east like Park Circus as well as to the south like Bhowanipore, Lake Road, Kidderpore and Old Ballygunge where tenants living in crumbling buildings are at risk. “In the past four months, 50 insecure buildings have collapsed. Of these, there could have been fatalities in at least 15 cases,” a KMC building department official. Time and again, the KMC building department has failed to convince the tenants to vacate the buildings. The civic brass had even tweaked the building rules three years ago to offer the owners of insecure buildings incentives for reconstructionso that they could find the venture profitable even after providing the tenants their space in the newly built structure. “One of the incentives which offered 100% additional FAR to the owners was really attractive. Besides, we had decided to relax several other rules for reconstruction of old, dilapidated buildings,” said a KMC building department official. Though initially a section of the owners took advantage of the scheme, it fell flat after a municipal building committee comprising officials from different state and private agencies raising objections in offering extra advantage.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/residents-of-100-more-critically-unsafe-buildings-still-at-high-risk/articleshow/86624359.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KSEB chief alleges fraud in the name of the President||Thiruvananthapuram: In a case of suspected forgery in the name of President Ram Nath Kovind, KSEB chairman and managing director B Ashok who is also the CMD of Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) has petitioned state police chief Anil Kant against a builder who is claiming to have a decree from the President issued in his favour to return the documents of his property that has been pledged with KTDFC and also refund Rs 1.27 crore to him that he had repaid in excess. In his petition, Ashok said that two individuals, Salim M Kabir, MD of Grandtech Builders and Developers in the capital, and another person P P M Ashraf, are responsible for the purportedly forged documents in the name of the President. As per the complaint, Kabir, who had availed a loan of Rs 10 crore from the corporation, produced a document claimed to be a decree issued by the President’s Secretariat. “I direct Shri Dr B Ashok, chairman and managing director of KTDFC or his successor in office and other board members to take steps within 50 days to refund the excess amount collected from Grandtech Builders and Developers (P) Ltd,” the ‘decree’, a copy of which was attached with the complaint (accessed by TOI), said. It further said that till the directions are complied with, the KTDFC should not initiate any action against the company or securities, and if action is taken, the President would exercise doctrine of pleasure against the KTDFC MD. Ashok said that being familiar with the legal instruments used by the Centre and the state government over the last 23 years, he does not recollect any valid instrument prescribed to be made out by the President in his name directing an executive officer on a subject pertaining to the administration of the state government. “I understood that the individual is prima facie attempting to present a fraudulently made order… I warned him that it is a serious offence under the provisions of the extant penal law. He, however, brushed aside my caution and informed me of the dire consequences if the presidential order is not carried out immediately,” Ashok said. In his petition to the DGP, Ashok said that the individuals behind the ‘decree’ could be making similar fraudulent orders in the name of constitutional authorities and an inquiry is required into the issue. In his petition submitted to KTDFC along with the ‘decree’ on September 17, Kabeer said that the petition to the President was made through convenor of all India citizen’s forum Ashraf and got favourable order from the President after proving his claims that KTDFC had charged his company excess interest in violation of the rules of the RBI, is genuine. When contacted, Saleem said that he came in touch with Ashraf through an advocate, who told that he could receive relief as KTDFC has charged his excess interest. “The decree obtained by Ashraf was then verified by our advocate before we produced it along with a representation before the KTDFC managing director. If it is found to be fake, we will take legal action against those who managed to get the document for us,” Saleem said. Ashraf told TOI that the documents produced are genuine and challenged the KTDFC to prove otherwise. “If the directions made in the decree are not complied with, the officer will have to face action including removal from the service,” he said. Meanwhile, sources in the state police headquarters said that the police have launched an investigation into the matter.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/kseb-chief-alleges-fraud-in-the-name-of-the-president/articleshow/86627016.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Choked canals add to rain woes in Behala, Kidderpore||KOLKATA: A large part of Behala, Haridevpur, Thakurpukur and Kidderpore went under water on Wednesday after night-long rain. These areas received the highest rainfall in Kolkata. Over 100mm rainfall — 50% of which in two hours since early morning — was recorded in these areas. Worse, it takes inordinately long for water to recede as the three key outfall channels — Begor, Manikhali and Churial — are all choked, highly silted and at some places encroached upon by illegal settlers. All these areas are vulnerable to inundation even if it does not rain heavily. Residents of Behala were shocked to see large parts turning into a water body, with major areas going under waist-deep or knee-deep water. According to a KMC sewerage and drainage department source, Behala received 112mm rain in 12 hours. About 50 % of this in just two hours. “Several low-lying areas like Shakuntala Park, Sarsuna, Parnasree, Pathakpara, Motilal Gupta Road and areas off James Long Sarani recorded heavy rain in a short duration. It led to severe waterlogging. As most of these areas have poor drainage infrastructure, storm water will take time to recede,” said a KMC official. Mahendra Banerjee Road, Unique Park, Barisha, Gopal Mishra Road, Indira Devi Road, Sakher Bazar and Silpara — all under Borough XIII and XIV — were no less affected. Sunirmal Ghosh, a senior citizen and a resident of Parnasree, had an urgent appointment with a doctor off DH Road. Repeated calls to app cabs yielded no results. “Though the appointment was urgent, I couldn’t muster courage to wade through knee-deep water and avail taxi services from Parnasree bus stand. I decided to cancel the appointment. Now I will have to wait for water to recede to visit my doctor,” Ghosh said. Similarly, several areas of Kidderpore, Mominpur and Ekbalpore received heavy rain, leading to inundation. “The Mominpore drainage pumping station recorded 115mm rain in 12 hours,” said a KMC official. Mohammed Aslam, a resident of Ekbalpore Lane, said going by the nature of inundation, it was evident that he would have to stay indoors for the entire day. “I hope storm water will recede by night if it doesn’t rain afresh,” he said. “We are fed up with being marooned after every shower. Floodwater invades our rooms as well. We keep complaining, but our grievances seem to be falling on deaf ears. All the canals are choked. Even KMC once dumped waste into the canal. Settlements have come up in their path, stopping the flow of water,” said Anubhabh Chatterjee, a resident of Rabindra Nagar. Storm water from Behala is channelised through the Manikhali pumping station into the Hooghly. Manikhali can hardly drain out water because of siltation. A Rs 700 crore drainage overhaul project, which had started in 2016, had to be halted due to non-availability of land.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/choked-canals-add-to-rain-woes-in-behala-kidderpore/articleshow/86624395.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Goa||Goa gears up for new football season||Panaji: The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over, but fans will still be delighted to return to the stands for the season opening charity match between Sporting Clube de Goa and Dempo SC at the Duler Football Stadium in Mapusa on Friday, 4pm. The Goa Football Association has said they will allow restricted entry and issue limited tickets. This was not the case last year due to the number of rising Covid-19 cases which forced the organisers to conduct the Goa Professional League behind closed doors. Matches were streamed live and fans were allowed at the venue only in the later stages of the league. The situation is much better now and cheered by fans, teams can expect to do better. “Because of the supporter’s, players also get encouraged. Parents and friends are also always good to boost the players,” said Sporting coach Savio Vaz, who guided the team to the Pro League title last season. The state league is much sought after in the country and has been a hunting ground for Indian Super League (ISL) teams. Sporting centre-back Kunal Kundaikar and Youth Club of Manora defender Manushawn Fernandes were signed by FC Goa this season, while midfielder Gaurav Kankonkar moved to Kerala Blasters FC. For the second successive season, the ISL will be held in Goa behind closed doors from November 19. “All the ISL clubs are practicing here. During practice matches against Pro League teams, our Goans boys get a good chance to be spotted. It is a good opportunity for Goan players,” said former international and head coach of Dempo SC Samir Naik. Not only ISL but I-League clubs also have Goan players on their radar. This season defending champions Gokulam Kerala signed 23-year-old striker Beneston Barretto from Guardian Angel. More could follow. The Pro League is likely to commence on October 16 with Sporting facing Panjim Footballers. Although relegated, the GFA retained Sesa FA to make it a total of 12 teams. It will be conducted on a single leg basis, followed by the Super League and Relegation League.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-gears-up-for-new-football-season/articleshow/86664183.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

Nashik city police commissioner Deepak Pandey said this will be the new measure that the police would initiate to ensure that riders in the city wear helmets. The city police have already imposed the ‘No Helmet No Petrol’ rule at fuel stations and have been sending bikers without helmets to counselling sessions. A large number of two-wheeler riders have now started wearing the safety headgear. “We want every two-wheeler rider to wear a helmet and the police would take various measures to make that happen. Our new drive is kind of a non-cooperation drive. We want all people and all departments to not cooperate with bikers who do not wear helmets. Our aim is to ensure that even if a biker goes to a garage without wearing a helmet, the garage owner should not entertain such a customer,” Pandey said. Police personnel cannot be present everywhere, but they would make surprise visits to appeal to people to not cooperate with bikers without helmets, said the police commissioner. The police are in the process of finalizing the terms for the non-cooperation drive against helmetless bikers. Police officials said all these measures are aimed at reducing road fatalities of bikers. The city police even launched a helmet-checking drive in the city and a large number of helmetless bikers were sent to the children’s traffic education park every day.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/non-cooperation-movement-againsts-helmetless-bikers/articleshow/86619426.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Manaslu, eighth highest mountain in the world at a height of 8,163 metres.  Her father, Deepak Savekar, said Kasturi set out for the summit on September 4. After two rotations, she started climbing on September 25. She reached Camp 2 on Sunday (September 26), then reached Camp 3 on Monday (September 27). She started climbing again at night and reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal on Tuesday morning (September 28) and waved the Indian flag with pride. He added that this year in March, Kasturi received a setback as due to strong winds, she had to call off her Mount Everest quest from camp 4, when she was only 200 metre away from the summit. After successfully scaling Mt Manaslu, she has again set her eyes on the Mount Everest Summit in the year 2022. Kasturi's mountaineering guide Dr Amar Adake said, “The challenges of the eight thousand-plus height peaks are different. Biting cold, more than 60 km/hour winds, snowfall, and climbing in extremely rugged terrain with only 1% to 2% oxygen level in the air is a miraculous feat. There are a total of 14 peaks in the world, which are 8,000 metres or more in height. Kasturi is the youngest climber from Kolhapur to wave the tricolour on Mount Manaslu. Kasturi has shown that big dreams can be achieved and looking at her, many young climbers from the Sahyadri region will get inspired to conquer the mighty Himalayas.” Kasturi’s father Deepak Savekar is a four wheeler mechanic, while mother Manasvini Savekar is a home maker. Kasturi started trekking at a young age. Deepak Savekar recalled that Kasturi faced a lot of hurdles due to the Covid situation. “After overcoming many difficulties due to the Covid pandemic, she left for Everest on March 14 this year, but the heavy winds and snowfall on Everest played spoilsport. For safety, her team had to come down from Camp 4 our to Camp 3 and again to Camp 2 and finally eave the summit,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/19-yr-old-from-kolhapur-scales-mount-manaslu/articleshow/86619441.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Low-scale rain, week’s pre-emptive work save Salt Lake, New Town||KOLKATA: Still reeling under the after-effects of last week’s waterlogging, New Town and Salt Lake residents were waiting with bated breath for another round of misery with the prediction of a low pressure. But fortunately, relatively lower rainfall and some preventive measures taken by the civic bodies saved the townships from getting flooded once again. As it started to rain on Wednesday morning, there was slight water accumulation in some New Town lanes, but it receded fast. “We did not let the 20HP pump that was used last week to be withdrawn. The pump was again operated today to flush out water. Secondly, plastics were removed from the adjacent culvert and the drainage lines were cleaned up. However, it is difficult to say what would have happened had it poured once again,” said Mainak Kanrar, a resident of Shukhobristi housing complex. “There was no waterlogging on Wednesday. We had kept a pump ready to flush out water,” said Rakesh Gupta, a resident of Balaka Abason, another housing that has been badly affected by waterlogging. “We had taken several preventive steps. A control room was opened and all our engineers were on the road to keep an eye. The drainage lines were cleaned up and officers were keeping an eye on whether the sandbag wall placed on the sides of the canals were getting breached. All the pumping stations and pumps were operated from early morning,” said a New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) official. In adjacent Salt Lake too, there was no report of any major waterlogging. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) operated a control room from the civic body headquarters and the drainage lines across the township were cleaned up over the last few days. Pumps were operated to flush out water to periphery canals. Both BMC and NKDA are working on plans with the irrigation department, PHE and KMDA authorities to revamp Kestopur and Bagjola canals. The canal is likely to be dredged and desilted and the height of the banks is likely to be raised. Also, lock gates are likely to be repaired and fence put be to prevent dumping of waste. The work is expected to be taken up after the Pujas.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/low-scale-rain-weeks-pre-emptive-work-save-salt-lake-new-town/articleshow/86624432.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The MLA, in his application to the police, claimed that the gangster’s nephew had warned him of dire consequences if he did not withdraw the petition filed against state food and civil supplies minister and district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the Bombay high court. On September 23, Suhas Kande moved the HC seeking the court’s direction to remove Bhujbal from the position of Nashik district the guardian minister. Bhujbal also heads the Nashik district planning committee, which takes calls on allotment of development funds for all talukas in the district. Kande told TOI that he had moved the HC as his assembly constituency has been getting ‘step-motherly’ treatment in allotment of funds compared to the neighbouring Yeola taluka — represented by Bhujbal. Riyaz Shaikh, senior PI of the Gangapur police station, confirmed that they have received the application from Kande. “We have not registered an offence so far based on the application from MLA Kande. Nonetheless, we are investigating the matter,” he said. Kande was not available for comment. On Wednesday, Bhujbal issued a statement in Mumbai that he has instructed Nashik police commissioner Deepak Pandey to take strict action against those involved as a threat call to MLA Kande was a serious issue. Bhujbal said he has also informed the chief minister, deputy chief minister and the home minister about the threat call to Kande. He said the state government would never tolerate instances of people’s representatives getting threat calls.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/nandgaon-mla-says-he-got-threat-call-nashik-police-start-probe/articleshow/86619446.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Delhi||‘End trial of minors accused in petty cases in six months’||NEW DELHI: Over 1,900 children in conflict with law (CCL) continue to face the tag of “criminal” as they await prolonged trial (inquiry) in cases of petty offences. Highlighting their plight, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has moved the high court, urging it to end proceedings against those whose inquiry is pending beyond six months since they were first produced before a juvenile justice board. A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani on Wednesday took a grim view of the situation and indicated they will pass detailed orders on ending such proceedings and rehabilitation of children. Delhi High Court also asked the state government to verify and provide data. In its application filed in a pending matter before the court, DCPCR has cited Section 14 of the JJ Act, 2015 to argue that inquiry under this section is supposed to be completed within a period of four months from the date of first production of the child before the board, unless the period is extended, for a maximum period of two more months by the board. It said that under the same section of JJ Act, it is laid down that inquiry for petty offences if it remains inconclusive even after the extended period, the proceedings shall stand terminated. The child rights body said it also sought legal opinion in this regard from former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan Lokur, following which its chairman Anurag Kundu issued a recommendation in March advising JJBs “to immediately terminate the proceedings of the CCLs involved in petty offences which are pending beyond six month.” It also collated data of such juveniles involved in petty offences and found that 1,320 cases of CCLs involved in petty offences were pending beyond the statutory period of six months before the JJBs as on 31.12.2020. In 2021, “it has been shockingly found that the pendency of cases of CCLs involved in petty offences has risen to 1,903 cases, out of which 795 cases were pending for more than six months and 1,108 cases were pending for more than one year.” DCPCR said continuing these proceedings beyond the legally permissible time limit is a violation of the statutory rights as well as personal liberty of these children. “The stigma faced by these children with the tag of CCL when the proceedings are being pursued against them in JJBs beyond the statutory prescribed time limit not only adversely affects their mental health but also denies them their familial love and affection,” it added urging HC to intervene.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/end-trial-of-minors-accused-in-petty-cases-in-six-months/articleshow/86624541.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Patna||Haven’t yet given up demand for special status to Bihar: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said his government has not yet abandoned the demand for special category status to Bihar. He set aside the claim of planning and development minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav that his government was “tired” of pursuing this demand and will now root for special package from the Centre for the state’s development. “The minister concerned has said it in his own way,” Nitish told the media while reviewing the preparations on legislative assembly premises for the centenary celebration of the state legislature building on October 21. President Ram Nath Kovind will participate in the event. “All that (the minister said) is a separate matter, but we have not yet abandoned the demand for the special category status to Bihar,” Nitish insisted. “The Centre alone has to take the decision on it. We have been pursuing it since 2007,” he said. Referring to a committee set up under the then RBI governor Raghuram Rajan under the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre, Nitish said, “That committee’s report came, but the Centre did not take any decision on it. Subsequently, the 14the Finance Commission also submitted its report and the Centre said it had not mentioned it.” As to demand for caste census, the CM said, “When in Delhi, I had said that an all-party meeting will be held again (at Patna). We will sit together and discuss whatever has to be done in the new situation with regard to the caste census. We will also discuss the kind of development activities the state needs and, in fact, should be done,” Nitish said. When reminded of another letter sent by the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on flood issue, Nitish said in a lighter vein: “Do letters reach me? Before coming to me, the letters are passed on to the media. I must make it clear that I do read letters if they are addressed and sent to me.” He said besides personally visiting the flood-affected areas, the ministers in charge of the districts also toured the areas to get feedback on the problems faced by the people. “All the reports have come with regard to the damages. Required follow-up actions will be taken,” the CM said, adding that not a single Covid-19 case had been reported on Tuesday in the tests performed. Meanwhile, Nitish, accompanied by assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha and a few ministers went around the lawns of the state legislature building to have first-hand information about the preparations being made for the centenary celebration of the state legislature building. The CM also inspected the premises of the legislature building, including the entry points. He issued required instructions to the officials concerned to remove the damp marks and also give quality finishing touches. Among the ministers who accompanied him were deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, Vijay Kumar Choudhary and Ashok Choudhary.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/havent-yet-given-up-demand-for-spl-status-to-bihar-nitish/articleshow/86622181.cms||Abhay Singh

Padmasree Cinema reopened banking on the forthcoming big releases. While a section is relieved that flow of Bollywood content will have a positive impact on sales figures, others are worried about the impending third wave. A section is unsure if viewers who are used to good content on OTT will return to theatres. Exhibitor-distributor Satadeep Saha is pinning his hopes on the Hindi releases. According to him, this announcement can be a ‘game changer’ for the exhibition industry. “There are some 25 Hindi film announcements till next Christmas. That will change the scenario and people will return to the theatres with a bang,” he said. According to Syamal De, one of the managing partners of Padmasree Cinema, the single screen reopened with hope of drawing a crowd. “The sale deed is yet to be signed. In the meantime, we decided to reopen,” said De. Padmasree’s caretaker Shambu Gope told TOI that he is expecting better footfall during Durga Puja and Diwali. “We had reopened with ‘Radhe’ and then shut for three weeks since the sale was poor. We reopened again with ‘Mukhosh’. During Pujas, we plan to screen Dev’s ‘Golondaaj’ and Jeet-Mimi’s ‘Baazi’. The news of Maharashtra reopening its cinemas from October 22 with big Hindi releases is a boost for us ,” he said. Many feel the pandemic has changed the viewing pattern of people. Good Malayalam and Tamil films with subtitles have become popular with remote-friendly viewers of Kolkata. Instead of waiting for film festivals or downloaded copies, they now have access to recent movies on OTT platforms. “I am myself watching Turkish movies with subtitles at home. That apart there are interesting web series available on OTT. While I want footfalls at my theatres, I have to accept that people will flock only for good content,” said Suranjan Paul, owner of Minar, Bijoli and Chhabighar. Pranab Kumar Roy of Menoka is worried about the impending third wave. “All announcements are welcome. But everything can change after Pujas. Crowds are the biggest spreaders of Covid. Even educated people from the industry don’t wear masks,” Roy said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/padmasree-reopens-city-exhibitors-hope-bolly-content-will-boost-footfall/articleshow/86624552.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The plan is being touted as the first-of-its-kind in Karnataka, with biologist and wildlife enthusiast Sanjay Gubbi among those expressing his interest in helping the department draft the plan.Bandipur lies at the very heart of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, which, in turn, is an integral part of the Mysore Elephant Reserve. Besides boasting the highest population of tigers in the country, Bandipur is home to a large number of elephants.Despite the dense wildlife population, there is no master plan in place to conserve eco-sensitive zones inside the reserve, conservation of water bodies and restoration of areas not covered by trees. The proposed master plan hopes to address these lacunae in the management of Bandipur.Forest department officials told TOI that the new plan would identify all the existing places of worship inside the reserve, tribal hamlets, agricultural land and enumerate the bodies of water. The plan is being drafted under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and officials across all the departments in the state government are being consulted, given the impact of its implementation on conservation of the local ecology.The eco-sensitive zone inside the Bandipur Tiger Reserve is home to 123 villages that are spread across Nanjangud and HD Kote taluks in Mysuru, Gundlupet and Chamarajanagar taluks in the border district. The land-use pattern in these villages is predominantly for agriculture and horticulture crops, while public utilities such as roads, health centres, et al, take up the remaining space.Bandipur’s Gundlupet sub-division assistant conservator of forests K Paramaesh told TOI, “The department has issued a tender inviting experts to submit their proposal for the master plan. Sanjay Gubbi has expressed his interest in drafting the plan. Deadline for submission of the plan is December.”Paramesh added that the Bandipur Eco-Sensitive Zone Monitoring Committee would allow farmers to construct farmhouses in the five guntas specially dedicated for the purpose. “Farmer will have to obtain the department’s permission before constructing the house. The committee has, however, warned farmers against constructing illegal buildings or use the land for commercial activities under the pretext of using it for organic cultivation. The committee has asked the revenue department to demolish structures built without authorisation,” Paramesh said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/experts-may-prepare-master-plan-to-preserve-btrs-eco-sensitive-zone/articleshow/86621729.cms||---

The CBI team took a flight from Prayagraj airport to and landed at Jollygrant airport in Dehradun on Wednesday evening. Anand Giri was taken to his Shyamnagar ashram in Haridwar. This is the same ashram where he was getting construction works done against wishes of late Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad chief, Narendra Giri. “The residence of Anand Giri and his electronic devices would be taken in possession by the team,” said a source privy to the probe. The other two accused — Adya Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari — are in CBI custody at Police Lines in Prayagraj.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 12 policemen disguise themselves as municipal staff to catch burglars||NEW DELHI: To nab criminals involved in a burglary case, 12 policemen disguised themselves as corporation employees and conducted a Covid-19 awareness drive recently. Their effort led to the arrest of four people from Ambedkar Colony. On September 18, one Manjeet Kaur filed a complaint with police alleging that her house in Kalkaji was burgled by unidentified people and jewellery items worth over Rs eight lakh were missing. Investigators got clues about the four accused after they scanned about 60 CCTV cameras. “We then chalked out a plan that a team of 12 cops from Kalkaji police station would go to their area for a raid but in the guise of corporation employees. On Wednesday (last week), we reached Ambedkar Colony and informed people that we were conducting a Covid-19 awareness drive,” a police officer said. Cops visited at least 15 houses to spread awareness. “We wanted to ensure that no one should suspect that we are policemen,” the officer explained. After some time, two cops reached the house of the mastermind in the case, Nitu. “They knocked on the door of his house and he came out. Nitu was wearing a gold chain that was burgled from Kaur’s house. We first informed him about the drive and later caught him,” the officer said. The other three accused, who stayed in the same area, were also arrested. Deputy commissioner of police (South East) Esha Pandey said that apart from Nitu (25), they arrested Anoop (24), Irfan (26) and Ashu (24). “They are addicted to alcohol and smoking. They used to target unmanned accommodations to steal valuable articles,” she said. The team that made the arrests was led by SHO Virender Singh.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/12-policemen-disguise-themselves-as-municipal-staff-to-catch-burglars/articleshow/86624621.cms||---

The exhibition was aimed to attract attention of the civic authorities towards the issue that is causing inconvenience to the citizens on a daily basis. Most of the roads in the city have developed potholes mainly due to heavy rains couple with movement of heavy traffic. Shubham Shirhatti, convenor of the exhibition, said, “The commuters are complaining about back-related issues due to the bumpy ride. The autorickshaw drivers are complaining about frequent breaking down of their vehicle. They also need to wait for days to get their vehicles repaired. We earlier had submitted a petition to the civic authorities asking them to get the potholes repaired immediately, but nothing has been done yet.” Later, chief city engineer Netradip Sarnobat interacted with the activists and assured to repair the roads once the rains stops. As per the rules no repair or development work of public infrastructure can be carried out during monsoon as the rains may wash out the repair work. Sarnobat said the work to survey the roads is being carried out.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/kolhapur-photo-exhibition-of-pothole-riddled-roads/articleshow/86619496.cms||---

Hyderabad police’s Central Crime Station (CCS) has booked a new first information report (FIR) and slapped cheating and forgery charges based on the recent complaint lodged by Enforcement Directorate (ED), Hyderabad unit. Apart from Hong Kong and China, the scam’s tentacles have spread to Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad. CCS has named 26 accused in the FIR. “In ED’s fund trail investigation of credits and debits into the bank accounts of Chinese companies Linkyun Technologies and Dokypay (which are already facing probe in betting app case), it was found that large amounts were transferred to a few Hong Kong companies. The money has been transferred allegedly for cloud computing services and freight forwarding services,” CCS said in the FIR.. “Statements of Indian directors and employees of Linkyun and Dokypay revealed that they took no such services. The outward foreign remittances were allowed by officials of State Bank of India and State Bank of Mauritius without checking,” the CCS FIR added. The banks had allowed hundreds of crores of payments of freight forwarding charges without insisting on the bill of entry and allowed remittance on the back of airway bills (AWBs). Linkyun Technology Private Limited, Dokypay Technologies Private Limited and Spotpay Technology were suspected to be involved in online betting by running games of chance and duped several Indians. ED investigations had found that Great Trans International, Genex Shopping, Asia Pacific Cargo, Radiant Spark, Connecting Worldwide and Achiever Biz International received money from the Chinese companies accused of betting.

Due to several factors including availability of food and proper environment, the bird has not been sighted in the city since then. The birds were sighted by birders and photographers outside Mysuru last year.“Warbler, a migratory bird found near bushes and water bodies, are very active and sensitive. They start arriving from Central Asia from early September and return in March for breeding. This is a small species with a grey back, whitish underparts, a grey head with a darker ‘bandit mask’ through the eyes and a white throat. It is slightly smaller than the whitethroat. The birds are insectivorous, but also eat berries and other soft fruit,” Mysuru Nature Group member S Shylajesh told TOI. Stating that the migratory birds travel hundreds of kilometres to reach Mysuru and surrounding areas for food and breeding during winter season, Shylajesh said that deforestation in Africa has increased the temperature in Europe. “This increase in temperature will bring down the migration of birds from Europe to South India in the coming days. Earlier, farmers used to take up sowing and harvesting activities based on the arrival and departure of migratory birds. If we don’t protect the environment, then we will not see any birds and animals, which will be disastrous to our own future,” he said.City-based birder B Shivakumar told TOI that lesser whitethroat was recently sighted at Nanjangud. “But it has not been sighted in Mysuru since several years,” he added.“It’s a good sign that the birds have been sighted. People must work towards providing a favourable environment to these migratory birds which travel hundreds of kilometres from far off places for survival,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/lesser-whitethroat-sighted-again-near-chamundi-hills/articleshow/86621750.cms||---

The man was also accused of threatening the survivor with dire consequences. The incident came to light when the video clip made by the convict went viral. One of the recipients of the clip then contacted the principal of the school and the latter lodged a formal complaint with the Satara area police station. The incident then caused a major furore across Aurangabad city, prompting the police to arrest the accused and complete the investigation in a time-bound manner and file a chargesheet before a special fast track court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Special public prosecutor Sudhesh Shirsath told TOI, “The court sentenced the accused to three years for each of the different offences he was tried for. This included the main charges of sexual assault and sexual harassment under the Pocso Act. The court also imposed an overall fine of Rs 1.02 lakh on the convict.” The court also convicted the accused under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act and three different counts of the Motor Vehicle Act.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 2nd chance to appear for MHT-CET on October 9-10||MUMBAI: Due to heavy rain and a flood-like situation in some districts in the state, nearly 30,000 students have been unable to appear for MHT-CET in PCM (physics, chemistry, mathematics) group in two days. Students unable to appear for entrance exam in PCM and PCB (for biology) groups for admissions to engineering, pharmacy and agricultural courses, will be given a second chance on October 9 and 10, higher & technical education minister Uday Samant said on Tuesday. For PCM group, around 30,000 students downloaded admit cards, but were unable to reach exam centres. Others have been unable to attempt the exam due to technical difficulties, or due to Covid, or even reached centres late on account of traffic but did not get extra time or had two exams on one day. Considering this, and keeping the best interests of students in mind, the state plans to give them a last chance, said Samant. Students who missed the exam will be informed by email and SMS from October 1-3. They will be registered free as they have paid exam fees. Registered candidates will be given new admission cards based on availability of centres.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-2nd-chance-to-appear-for-mht-cet-on-october-9-10/articleshow/86629601.cms||---
---||Nashik||Farmers must check trader record before deals: SP||Nashik: Superintendent of police of Nashik rural Sachin Patil has cautioned farmers ahead of the harvest season to be wary of new traders and urged them to take all necessary precautionary measures before entering into any deal. The police have received several complaints from farmers about being cheated at the hands a few traders, who buy the agricultural produce but turn away from making the payment. Patil recently took a meeting with farmers in Dindori and appealed to them to exercise adequate caution while dealing with traders. He said that in many cases, it was found that a dispute took place between the traders and the farmers over the rate at which the agricultural produce was sold. “We have, therefore, appealed to the farmers to enter into an agreement with the traders about the rate and the quantity of agricultural produce before striking a deal. The agreement should preferably be on a stamp paper and copies of the PAN and Aadhaar Card of the trader should also be attached to the agreement copy,” Patil said. The SP said that not all traders cheat farmers. There are some traders tend not to pay the farmers after buying the agricultural produce. Hence, once a trader comes to strike a deal with the farmer, the latter should approach the local police station and request character verification before striking the deal. The police would then inform the farmer if the trader has any cases registered against him. This will help the farmer take a decision about carrying out the trade. Last year, former Special IG of Nashik Division, Pratak Dighavkar, had launched a special drive to catch such traders. On his instructions, the police of Nashik Rural, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar and Dhule had filed cases against traders, who had cheated farmers. In a few months, cheating cases worth Rs 46 crore were registered across the division, mostly in Nashik district. The police investigations into the cases lead to recovery of approximately Rs 6.75 crore.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/farmers-must-check-trader-record-before-deals-sp/articleshow/86619598.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Hyderabad||Appoint judges or abolish tribunals: Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday impleaded Union ministries of law & justice and the railways, seeking to know why they rendered the Railway Claims Tribunal in Secunderabad defunct by not appointing a judicial officer to preside over it. Cautioning against non-appointment of judges to various tribunals and interfering in the administration of justice, the bench of justices A Rajasheker Reddy and T Vinod Kumar perused the contents of the Railway Claims Tribunal Advocates Association that highlighted the pathetic state of the tribunal, lying in a defunct state, because the quasi-judicial body does not have a vice-chairman-cum-judicial member to settle the claims for long. “Earlier, civil courts were hearing such matters. But the Centre had brought in specialized tribunals for almost every subject. Now the civil courts are barred from hearing matters that fall under the purview of these tribunals. But the tribunals are lying in a defunct manner with no judges in them to hear the pleas,” the bench said. Appearing for the Centre, assistant solicitor general, Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao, raised an objection over making the Union cabinet secretary a respondent in the case. The bench, while agreeing with ASG’s contention that the parties concerned are the ministries of law and railways, the court made both of them as parties. But the bench minced no words to express its ire at the Centre. “You are depriving the citizens of their right to justice. If you cannot make appointments, you better abolish the tribunals. The civil courts will deal with the issues,” the bench said while reminding the Centre’s counsel that the Supreme Court too recently expressed its anguish over a large number of defunct tribunals all over the country. “The chart shows huge vacancies of judicial members in various tribunals. You had set up tribunals. Now fill the posts in them,” the bench said and adjourned the case.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hc-appoint-judges-or-abolish-tribunals/articleshow/86630235.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Mumbai||60-70 field hospitals to come up in Maharashtra only for Covid||MUMBAI: The state plans to build 60-70 field hospitals across districts to cater to Covid patients round the year, with signs emerging globally that it is becoming endemic. These 50 to 100-bed facilities are part of a larger plan to create parallel infrastructure so that future Covid waves don’t disrupt non-Covid work at permanent hospitals. The field hospitals would largely come up in tier-II and tier-III cities that tend to get overwhelmed with any spurt in cases, a senior state official told TOI. “That’s what we are preparing for. Essentially, it is to live with Covid.” The field hospitals will have durability for 20 years and won’t be temporary structures. Covid patients will be sent to these field hospitals first and only once they have crossed 100 patients, will the regular hospitals start admitting Covid cases, he explained. The hospitals will be built using funds allotted under the Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package: phase-II (ECRP-II) that is partly funded by the Centre. Around 35 hospitals will be 50-bedded while the remaining 30-35 will have 100 beds. The state is also planning to augment its medical oxygen capacity by 2,000 kilolitre and add 3,000 ICU beds. Under ECRP-I, the state had got Rs 1,185 crore during the first wave. For ECRP-phase-II, the state has proposed Rs 1,380 crore, a part of which will be used to create the field hospitals. Nationally, 203 field hospitals are likely to come up with ECRP funds. ECRP-II projects are supposed to be completed by March 2022. Currently, the state has around 37,000 active cases which are mainly concentrated in seven to eight districts. “In the remaining districts, massive Covid facilities are running with barely 4-5 patients,” said the official, adding that smaller field hospitals would come in handy to save resources and manpower. With a steady decline in cases, the state has terminated the services of 18,000-odd people who were temporarily recruited for Covid care. BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said work on three jumbos in Kanjurmarg, Somaiya grounds and Malad will continue though cases are declining.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-60-70-field-hosps-to-come-up-in-state-only-for-covid/articleshow/86627219.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The city received 71 mm rain till 8.30 and another 20 mm till 5.30 pm that submerged large parts of central and north Kolkata and led to a collapse of some old buildings, killing at least two people. The rain - triggered by a well-marked low-pressure area that lay centred on Gangetic Bengal - continued till late afternoon even as the Met office said that the system has started moving westward which could lead to heavy showers in the state’s western districts while the rain could lessen in Kolkata by Thursday. As the low-pressure reached Gangetic Bengal and hovered over Kolkata at 7 am on Wednesday, an intense spell of thundershower struck the city along with South and North 24 Parganas, Howrah, East and West Midnapore, Jhargram and Hoogly. “At around 7 am, the low-pressure reached the central part of Gangetic Bengal, hovering right over Kolkata and the surrounding areas. It increased the rain intensity for the next 2-3 hours and a steady, consistent drizzle continued through the day. It was accompanied by gusty winds at 30-40 km/hr,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. The system, however, moved away towards Burdwan by 9 am. Kolkata, though, continued to receive a steady downpour that occasionally got heavy till the rain lost intensity at around 3 pm. The sun broke through the clouds for a brief while even as drizzles continued to return. Das added that the weather is likely to improve in Kolkata and most parts of south Bengal on Thursday. “We expect Kolkata to remain relatively dry and occasionally sunny on Thursday. But the rise in temperature will lead to heating and may trigger thunderstorms in and around Kolkata on Thursday. But as the system moves westward, Purulia, Bankura and Birbhum could receive heavy showers on Thursday,” said Das.

Stating that no action has been taken by the authorities concerned in response to the demands of resident doctors as promised earlier in August, the MARD, in a letter addressed to state education minister Amit Deshmukh, said it needs assurance in writing that all the demands would be fulfilled. “There were no academic classes during the pandemic as teachers were also busy in the fight against Covid. The resident doctors have been discharging service since day one of the pandemic outbreak. They should be given waiver in fees that is around Rs 90,000, per academic year,” MARD vice-president Pranav Jadhav said. The MARD has also pressed for giving Covid incentive such as risk allowance for resident doctors engaged in the management of the pandemic situation. Deshmukh could not be reached for his comments. Divisional health authorities said the Directorate of Medical Education and Research has formed a proposal regarding the demands raised by resident doctors and the same has been tabled before the state government.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/resident-doctors-firm-on-strike-from-oct-1-to-press-for-fee-waiver/articleshow/86619661.cms||---

The congregation is a much awaited event as the price to be paid by the sugar mills to the cane farmers is decided during this time by Shetti. This year the crushing of canes by mills is going to start from October 15. The Centre announces fair and remunerative price (FRP) — minimum price the mills must pay to the farmers — and at the annual congregation Shetti makes a demand in addition to the FRP. “This year we will hold the congregation in open and I will not seek permission from the authorities to hold the event. This is the 20th year of the conclave and the sugarcane farmers are going through several difficulties. The conclave is held to make a demand on behalf of farmers which is calculated based on the cost of inputs borne by them,” Shetti said. “The Centre and state are conspiring to allow mills to pay FRP amount in instalments which will ruin the life of the farmers. We want FRP payment to be done in one go so that the farmers are able to pay back the loans and save some money to grow sugarcane for the next season,” he added.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/cane-farmers-congregation-to-be-held-on-oct-18-shetti/articleshow/86619642.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Supreme Court seeks Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam’s response on ‘irregularities’ in rituals||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought response from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to a year-and-half old complaint by a devotee of Lord Balaji that irregularities have crept into daily ‘puja and archana’ in the temple causing consternation among devotees of the principal deity. Cajoling the devotee, Srivari Daadaa, to exercise patience which is the primary quality of any devotee of Lord Balaji, a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana said no devotee of the deity would venture to lose patience with the SC registry officials and continuously threaten and blackmail them if his petition was not listed urgently. “We are also interested in protecting the tradition and rituals intrinsic to Lord Balaji as we (CJI himself and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli) also are devotees of Him. But, how does a constitutional court interfere in the manner in which daily puja and archana are to be conducted? How could we determine how many devotees are to be allowed for daily darshan? Are these part of an individual's fundamental rights,” the CJI asked. After conversing with the petitioner in Telugu and making him see reason, the CJI turned to TTD's counsel Satya Sabharwal and asked whether the temple management had responded to the March 18, 2020 representation of the petitioner pointing out several irregularities in the observance of daily rituals. “Every devotee has faith in Lord Balaji. They expect TTD not to deviate from tradition. What has happened to his representation,” the bench said and sought answers from TTD within a week. The Andhra Pradesh HC had on January 5 rejected the petitioner's PIL and said, “Procedure of conducting rituals is the exclusive domain of the Devasthanam and cannot be a matter of adjudication unless it impacts secular or civil rights of others.” TTD is an independent trust that manages temples, including the famous Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala. Daadaa has alleged that the temple authorities have been performing sevas - Abhishekam Seva, Thomala Seva, Arjitha Brahmotsavam, Yekanta Utsavalu and Maha Laghu Darshan— in a “wrongful and irregular” manner.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/sc-seeks-ttds-response-on-irregularities-in-rituals/articleshow/86630237.cms||---

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: DVAC unearths Rs 15 crore excess assets in raids at office assistant’s premises||TRICHY: Sleuths of directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) on Wednesday conducted searches at six locations of an assistant in rural development and panchayat raj department as well as his family members in Pudukottai and unearthed assets worth over Rs 15 crore disproportionate to his known sources of income. DVAC teams from Pudukottai, Trichy and Sivaganga carried out the search at the places of V Muruganandham, 47, who is an assistant at the office of the assistant director (audit) of the department, his wife M Gandhimathi, 38, president of Mullankurichi panchayat in Karambakudi union, and other family members. Sources said the raid was conducted at the residences of Murgunandham, his brothers Palanivel and Ravichandran at Kadukkakadu, two houses in Pudukottai and a commercial complex near new bus stand in Pudukottai in the morning. The team was searching Vijay Shooting Academy functioning at Charles Nagar. Muruganandham’s son attends shooting training at a shooting academy in Trichy. DVAC deputy superintendent of police G Imayavaramban booked Muruganandham and Gandhimathi for amassing wealth disproportionate to their known source of income under sections of prevention of corruption Act, 1988 and the act as amended in 2018. DVAC valued their properties at Rs 15.73 crore and calculated the percentage of disproportionate assets as 1,260 %. Hailing from a middle class family, Muruganandham started his career as a part-time panchayat clerk of Veppankudi village panchayat in 1996 before being regularised in government service. He wealth increased to several crores, particularly between 2015 and 2019, when he was junior assistant at the office of the assistant director (panchayat) in Pudukottai. Going by the list of properties mentioned in the DVAC’s first information report, Muruganandham and his wife purchased a shopping complex at Sathiyamoorthy road, house sites and apartments worth Rs 12.83 crore between 2017 and 2020. Muruganandham also bought 12.9 hectares of agricultural land worth Rs 62 lakh at Mullankurichi, Veppankudi and Kannakankadu in Karambakudi union during the same period. The FIR mentioned the purchase of a Mercedes car worth Rs 70.43 lakh by him in the name of Gandhimathi.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh don on the run for 12 years held in Mumbai after 20-day ambush||LUCKNOW: A hardened criminal who wriggled out of UP Police’s dragnet 12 years ago and was on the run since then, was nabbed by Ahmedabad crime branch late Tuesday from Mumbai. The fugitive, Manish Singh, was a member of the dreaded Subhash Singh Thakur gang with criminal records in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Better known as Raju alias Chhotu in the Mumbai underworld, he carried a bounty of Rs 50,000. In 2009, he escaped from UP police custody while being taken to court and fled to Mumbai, where he expanded his criminal activity. Ahmedabad deputy commissioner of police, crime, Chaitanya Ravindra Mandalik, told TOI it took 20 days to zero in and ambush Manish Singh in his den after a definite tip-off. A Gujarat crime branch team disguised as watchmen and sweepers infiltrated the staff deployed at Rashmi Garden at Evershine City, Vasai, where Singh resided. They worked in three shifts to keeping vigil, while not raising suspicion. “Singh had a well-oiled network and would flee within minutes of getting a whiff of police movement. This time we were determined. So, we trained select cops for several weeks to work in disguise, before dispatching the team to Vasai. On September 28, Manish came out of his apartment for a stroll and was immediately nabbed,” the officer said. Manish had unleashed his terror run in Varanasi in 2007, when he opened 12 rounds of fire on two persons, Munnagiri and Brajesh Mishra, in Janasha Bazaar. Months later, he shot a hotel management institute owner, RK Singh, 40, in Bhelupura. “In 2012, he committed two crimes on a single day. First, he and his aide, Deepak Dubey, shot at a Sigra-based hotelier Ashok Talreja and then gunned down a hardware businessman, Harinath Patel in Raja Talaab Bazaar after he refused to cough up Rs 25lakh extortion money,” said the officer. In 2015, Singh shot at Dr Ashok Rai, owner of a private hospital in Varanasi after he too refused to pay extortion money of Rs 50 lakh, said Mandalik. After he dug in his heels in Mumbai, Manish began targeting bar owners in Santacruz and Vakolo. His name cropped up during interrogation of Kamal Singh alias Sonu, who was arrested with a pistol by Ahmedabad Crime Branch in 2014. And Manish became a ‘most wanted’ for Gujarat police after it was unearthed that he provided guns and ammunition to the Parmar gang, which shot Bharatinsh Vala and Ranchhod Kevadia Patel in Botad district.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-don-on-the-run-for-12-yrs-held-in-mumbai-after-20-day-ambush/articleshow/86629613.cms||---

The second and final admission round ended on Wednesday. Out of the total 14,000 seats, as many as 8,318 seats have remained vacant this year which is a major cause of concern before the colleges, especially non-aided ones. Subhash Chougule, CAP secretary, said, “The number of students who registered to seek admission in city-based colleges was much less than the total number of seats. We have learnt that many students have joined diploma or ITI courses that may be a major reason for less number of students securing admission. Also, other factors such as non-availability of hostel facilities or bus services with many colleges may have forced the rural students not to seek admission in city colleges.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/only-23-students-secure-seats-in-fyjc/articleshow/86619663.cms||---

---||Trichy||Cops seek help from lathe owners, auto drivers to stop crimes||Trichy: Lathe owners in Trichy district have been asked by the police to cooperate and inform of anyone visiting their lathes to make or buy weapons like knives and machetes or pruning them, in order to prevent crimes. Police also made a similar appeal to autorickshaw drivers as the criminals often travel in these three-wheelers. The appeal comes in the wake of police tightening their grip on anti-social elements as part of ‘Operation Disarm’ undertaken by the Tamil Nadu police. The city police led by the commissioner of police, G Karthikeyan shifted its focus on lathe owners and autorickshaw drivers after arresting more than 150 anti-social elements who were found with an intention to commit crimes including murder. Police had launched the operation nearly three weeks back after back to back murders for revenge in Gandhi market and Golden Rock police station limits. On Tuesday, police organised a meeting with 118 lathe owners in Gandhi market, Fort, Palakkarai, Thillai Nagar, Woraiyur and Srirangam police station limits at Ravi Mini hall in Trichy. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) S Sakthivel spoke about their role in preventing the crimes and advised them to install CCTVs and record all the particulars including the name, address and mobile number of those who buy weapons. The same should be communicated to the police once in a week. The Trichy rural police led by the superintendent of police Pa Moorthy, which recently arrested 19 anti-social elements and seized machetes and knives, identified 40 lathes in Jeeyapuram, Lalgudi, Musiri and Manapparai police divisions and made a similar appeal to the owners. Police roped in 375 autorickshaw drivers in Cantonment, Golden Rock, Fort and Srirangam police station limits in the past few days. Observing that the offenders used the autorickshaws to travel to commit the crimes, police said that the drivers should inform them if they come to know about the plans of such offenders.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/cops-seek-help-from-lathe-owners-auto-drivers-to-stop-crimes/articleshow/86629639.cms||---

According to sources, CB conducted examinations in both the houses of Monson in Cherthala and Kaloor in Ernakulam on Wednesday. The complainants in the case appeared before the investigation team on Wednesday morning even as Mavunkal’s interrogation progressed. Before going to the CB office, the complainants told reporters that digital evidence of the scam and information received from others who contacted them about similar scams by Mavunkal would be handed over to CB. Mavunkal’s attempts to dupe others too are coming to the fore. MT Shameer, a complainant, said that he would hand over emails Mavunkal sent to the complainants about the funds, which he claimed to have in a private bank, and documents attached with the same. “After an FIR was recorded on our complaint, several people with similar complaints contacted us. Those details will also be handed over to the investigation team,” Shameer said. Yakoob, another complainant, said that Mavunkal had strong connections with senior police officers and Monson had made more people meet senior officials. Police are yet to confirm this claim. “If phone call details and call data records are analyzed, then details of money transacted through accounts can be known. His connections would become clear if a thorough investigation is done to find where the money went,” said Yakoob. Anoop, one of the six persons who filed the complaint against Mavunkal to the chief minister, also appeared before the CB team. Another person, Rajeev, whom Monson reportedly duped in connection with a land deal also appeared before CB, sources said. The complainants also released visuals of Mavunkal canvassing them. Meanwhile, NK Kurian, who runs an agricultural theme park in Kaduthuruthy, claimed through Facebook that Monson had approached him in 2012 with a similar deal. Mavunkal had offered investment in his project and sought Rs 8 lakh to clear an issue that he was facing with the Reserve Bank. He stopped getting his calls after a month, Kurian said in his FB post. CB had arrested Monson on September 25 in a case registered against him under sections 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471(using forged documents as genuine) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the IPC. According to CB, Mavunkal, who claims to be an antique collector, was arrested for allegedly duping various persons of nearly Rs 10 crore. CB had on Sunday raided his house which he had decorated like a museum and kept several ‘antiques’ on display, which were seemingly fake.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/cb-searches-mavunkals-house-questions-him/articleshow/86627304.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC shrinks scheme to pay developers with credit notes||MUMBAI: The BMC has cut back its controversial plan to give out credit notes instead of money to contractors to construct 12,000 housing units for project-affected persons (PAPs) for nearly Rs 9,000 crore. Now, it will build only 4,000 units in Chandivli via the ‘cashless means’ for nearly Rs 2,500 crore. The proposal for constructing 4,000 PAP units by way of credit notes and Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) has been placed before the BMC’s improvements committee for approval. The developer will be able to use these credit notes to pay municipal taxes and premiums to the BMC, or even sell the credit notes to other developers. “We had received applications for construction of PAP units...We conducted a detailed rate analysis by verifying the actual agreement value of transactions in the zones from the inspector general of registration and stamps and found that the rates were feasible for only one zone in Chandivli. So we are only going ahead with that,” said a civic official. Officials said the value of the credit notes is Rs 1,584 crore, of land TDR Rs 295 crore and of construction TDR Rs 619 crore. Each PAP unit, measuring around 27.9 sq m, will cost the BMC just over Rs 60 lakh. Compared to the market rate, BMC’s total savings will be around Rs 178 crore. Officials said based on the ongoing infrastructure projects, the BMC needs 36,000 PAP units. Facing a massive cash crunch, the BMC, in March, had for the first time decided to go cashless for its then nearly Rs 9,000-crore mega project to construct housing for PAPs. Of the total amount, around Rs 6,000 crore was to be paid through credit notes, while the rest would have been in the form of TDR. As per the plan, land owners who own land parcels reserved for PAPs or housing for the dishoused have to come forward and offer their lands to the BMC. These owners must also do the construction for the BMC and hand it over. The BMC will house people affected by its various infrastructure projects like road widening, laying of drains, constructions of flyovers and bridges, among others. In April, BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had punched holes in the controversial plan. The opposition has alleged that the scheme would turn out to be a scam when developers start paying premiums using the credit notes when the BMC is facing a financial crisis.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-shrinks-scheme-to-pay-developers-with-credit-notes/articleshow/86629676.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

KMDA officials said following the incident of dead fish, the matter was referred to the expert committee to recommend some measures on ways to improve the quality of the sarobar water. “The expert committee has recommended installing aerator machines to increase the oxygen level of the lake water. Initially seven to eight aerator machines will be installed. An aerator machine creates a momentum to make a circular flow of water, this helps in increasing the water’s oxygen level. Preparations are on to work out on the plan,” said a KMDA official. Officials said another plan is to restart the water fountain situated at one end of the waterbody which earlier used to be used for conducting light and sound shows. “The fountain has remained shut for quite some time so we are planning to restart the fountain. It will help in the cycling of the water and generate more oxygen,” said an official. Environment activists said the plan to install aerator machines was a good step but a more long term planning was needed to increase the sarobar’s depth as having seven to eight aerator machines in the entire 73 acre waterbody can only increase the water’s oxygen level to about one or two percent. “Installing aerator machines to increase the oxygen level of the water is a good step but it is more of a short term measure. The sarobar once had a depth of about 25 feet which has now come down to only 10 feet in some places. Due to silt deposition, the sarobar water holding capacity has reduced. There is a need for scientifically conducted desilting and dredging of the waterbody to see that the lake water does not get contaminated through the sewer lines. Also, people should be prevented from bathing and dumping plastic in the waterbody,” said environmentalist Somendra Mohan Ghosh, a lake regular. KMDA has already started working on plans to develop the 192 acre of sprawling green land as an eco tourism destination. The sarobar premises will have a new look with new green zones like medicinal garden, nature observatory zone, fungus garden and other such zones. Presently, there are around 7,000 trees of 70 to 75 different species inside Rabindra Sarobar.

---||Trichy||Farmers say e-DPC system unviable for procuring paddy||Trichy: Farmers have opposed the proposed implementation of e-DPC system for procuring paddy, stating that the process will be practically unviable for many farmers especially for registration of land and other documents online. The system requires farmers to register particulars like name, details of the land, Aadhaar and bank account numbers with the TNCSC (Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation) website before taking their paddy to the direct procurement centres (DPCs). At a meeting chaired by TNCSC senior regional manager N Uma Maheshwari in Thanjavur on Wednesday, officials explained the process to be followed while registering documents to the farmers and village administrative officers (VAO). Based on the registration on the website, respective VAO should allot a procurement centre and spell out the date and time of the grain to be taken to the centre. This system would come into effect on October 1. However, several farmers said the new system may have been intended to cut the long waiting time for them at procurement centres, but it will only provide room for further irregularities. V Dharmarajan, a farmer from Nedar, said a majority of small and marginal farmers are still without an android mobile phone. “How can they register their details online? They have to roam around in search of net centres or e Seva centres. After registration, farmers have to wait till the concerned VAO would conduct a field visit to fix the date and time of selling grains. In case of rain or other natural disasters, how can farmers let their produce get spoiled without harvesting their crops,” he added. Another farmer, V Jeevakumar of Rayamundanpatti, said all VAOs are asked to visit the respective paddy field to forecast the yield. This would burden the village level officers, leading to further delay to get tokens from them. However, senior regional manager N Uma Maheshwari explained the process involved in the system and how farmers stand to benefit without leaving their produce to get drenched in rain.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/farmers-say-e-dpc-system-unviable-for-procuring-paddy/articleshow/86629673.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Will take legal action against Monson Mavunkal, says K Sudhakaran||KOZHIKODE: KPCC president K Sudhakaran denied having any financial dealings with fake antique scam accused Monson Mavunkal and said that he will take legal action against Mavunkal for misusing his name and for propagating falsehoods. Addressing media persons at the DCC office here after attending a party district leadership meeting on Wednesday, Sudhakaran reiterated that he neither took a single rupee from Mavunkal nor had any business talks with him or the complainants in the case. Sudhakaran conceded that one of the complainants, Anoop, had come to the Mavunkal’s house when he was there once. “When I was leaving the house, he (Anoop) came to me and introduced himself and we shook hands, I asked his name and left the house. I can tell for certain that I had not talked business-related matters with either Monson or Anoop,” Sudhakaran said. Mavunkal’s act of asking Anoop to reach his house could have been an attempt to strike a deal by showing his presence, said Sudhakaran. He said that he will file a case against Mavunkal for misusing his name. Asked whether there was lack of vigil on his part to seek medical treatment from Mavunkal, Sudhakaran asked what was the need for vigil as Mavunkal was conducting treatment in the heart of the city and top government officials and IPS officers were frequenting the place. “I have seen several famous film stars and government officials, who protected the chief minister like a golden idol, frequenting the place,” said Sudhakaran. He accused the state government of giving protection to Mavunkal’s house by assessing the security there three times daily. Sudhakaran said that CPM was trying to use the false allegations to destroy him politically as the Left party feared his attempts to revive the Congress party through organizational changes. “We had stopped the fight against Pinarayi Vijayan. Now we will have to rethink about it,” he added. Sudhakaran said that about 1.2 lakh Congress unit committees (CUC) will be set up in the state as part of strengthening the grassroots-level machinery. The inauguration of the first phase of CUC formation would be held at Karimpuzha in Palakkad on Thursday.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kozhikode/will-take-legal-action-against-monson-says-sudhakaran/articleshow/86627390.cms||---

State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI that detailed guidelines were in place for all the districts and collectors to implement them. The state should carry out 2 lakh tests a day and there should be no reduction of tests in districts that have already been listed as either districts of concern or those with low testing. In the week from September 22 to September 28, the state conducted 5.6 lakh RT-PCR tests and 5.2 lakh Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), which was well below the 2-lakh daily norm. Over 13 districts continued to register less than 5,000 tests on a weekly basis. Sources said a few were affected by the heavy rains over the past few days. “The government has announced that some unlocking orders for various sectors will be issued shortly. The orders will be issued keeping in mind all Covid protocols. However, there should not be any complacency,” said Awate. State task force member Shashank Joshi told TOI that Covid cases in Maharashtra had substantially come down and have not risen after the Ganpati festival. “However, Covid continues to be around. The cases might have dropped, but the pandemic is not gone yet. The government is carrying out the unlocking process amid strict SOPs,” he said. Joshi advised against any congregation ahead of Dasara and Diwali. “Vaccination and ventilation arrangements will be the two keys to tide over any situation,” he said. The ‘districts of concern’ at the moment are Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara. Pune, Ahmednagar and Satara are also among the nine districts with a weekly positivity rate higher than the state’s average of 2.1%. Pune zilla parishad CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI that only two talukas in the district — Junnar and Ambegaon — currently had a weekly positivity rate above 5%.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/maharashtra-must-test-2l-daily-warns-health-dept-as-13-dists-do-fewer-than-5k-a-wk/articleshow/86627347.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The accused was arrested with his aide, an Afghan interpreter, by Lucknow and Nodia regional units’ teams late Monday night. Both were brought to Noida on Wednesday and presented before a magistrate and sent to jail. According to officials, eight drug mules, including four Afghan nationals and an Uzbek woman, were arrested last week from whom DRI got specific input that the head of the drug cartel in India had escaped to Himachal. “After extensive digital surveillance and monitoring, the accused was traced in Shimla. He came to India last year after lockdown, while his Afghan interpreter aide had been staying in the country for nearly five years. During interrogation, the prime accused claimed to be a former member of an Afghan security enforcement agency and said he supervised the drug trade operations in the country and money transactions,” said the source. DRI sleuths said the accused was familiar with India as he had visited the country several times. “The four Afghan nationals arrested earlier from the national capital region were drug mules, who posed as street vendors selling dry fruits, but sold heroin in pubs, clubs and parties. One kg of heroine fetched up to Rs 7 crore,” the source said. The Uzbek woman was a dancer, who used her rich clients to sell drugs in parties and pubs,” the source further said. DRI also seized Rs 70 crore worth of heroin, cocaine and other contraband from the accused and booked him under NDPS Act. “Money earned from the drug trade was channeled back to the kingpin, a former dry fruit exporter in Afghanistan, through the hawala network. The dirty money was directly and indirectly used to sabotage the sovereignty and security of India,” said sources. Meanwhile, the special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) court in Gujarat directed DRI to investigate if the “Mundra Adani Port, its management and authority gained any benefits from the import of the 2988.22 kg heroin seized by DRI on September 15.” The consignment was imported from Iran’s Bandar Abbas Port by Aarshi Trading company based in Satyanarayanapuram on the outskirts of Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. The firm’s owners Machavaram Sudhakar and his wife Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali were arrested by DRI.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/mundra-drug-haul-head-of-afghan-cartel-in-dri-net/articleshow/86629655.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The system, moving at a slow speed, is likely to come over Jharkhand, late on Wednesday night and cover the state on Thursday causing light to moderate rainfall in most parts of the state. Head, Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the well-marked low pressure area will cause rain and thunderstorm along with high speed winds blowing at a speed of 30-40km per hour gusting upto 50km per hour. “During the last 24 hours, the monsoon was active over Jharkhand and maximum rainfall of 49mm was recorded in Rajmahal area of Sahibganj district. The influence of the well-marked low-pressure system is likely to continue for five days —initially causing rainfall in most parts of the state and in many parts from Friday onwards,” he said. Because of back-to-back low-pressure system originating over the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon reinvigorated during the last two weeks of September mitigating the shortfall in seasonal rainfall. Out of the 24 districts, 17 have recorded normal rainfall while five are still in the deficient category with Lohardaga being the only district to record excess rainfall. Anand said as against the normal of 1,050mm, the state has received 1,003.7mm indicating a negative departure of 4%. “During the next four-five days this shortfall is expected to get mitigated due to the possibility of rainfall in most parts of the state,” Anand said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jamshedpur/well-marked-low-pressure-to-shift-over-jharkhand-today/articleshow/86639486.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Tribal youth begins crowd funding to study at FTII||RANCHI: A tribal boy from Ranchi, Saurav Kumar Munda, after clinching a seat for himself at the prestigious Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, for a three-year PG diploma course in film direction, has now begun crowd funding to source nearly Rs 4 lakh to pursue his dream. Munda (28) is among the first few from his tribe in Jharkhand to make the cut in Asia’s best film school but financial crunch is threatening to firewall his ambition. He is also a gold medalist from Ranchi University of 2018-20 batch, a postgraduate in journalism and mass communication from Gossner College. Before that, he graduated from prestigious BIT Mesra in hotel management in 2016. “My father is a retired teacher and is now 71. Although they want me to pursue filmmaking course, we have a financial crunch,” he told TOI on Wednesday. Munda is the youngest of three siblings. His elder brother works as a teacher posted in Chaibasa (West Singbhum district) and his sister is married. “They have their own families and can’t bear the cost of my education. Hence, I have started crowd sourcing. Banks won’t provide loans unless collateral security deposit which we don’t have immediately. Moreover, filmmaking is a field where you cannot expect direct placement after completion of the course to be able to start repaying the loans,” he rued, adding that he got hooked to an unconventional field of filmmaking during his stint in BIT Mesra which further strengthened after taking part in a filmmaking workshop in Ranchi two years ago. “While doing hotel management, I realised that filmmaking was my true calling but had to first complete my graduation as my parents had paid a hefty sum then. For the next two years since 2016, I tried to get into SRFT Institute in Kolkata but failed to qualify. Last year, I sat for FTII exam and cleared it,” he said. In January this year, he paid Rs 35,000 as first installment by arranging funds from his friends and family for the first semester. For the three-year course and other expenses to stay in Pune, he requires about Rs 4 lakh. Munda is currently in his hometown Ranchi owing to closure of the institute due to Covid-19 pandemic. Since he hails from a Scheduled Tribe, he will be eligible for government scholarship but it will cover only 50% of the tuition fee. “The rest will have to be borne by me,” he said. Shri Prakash, a city-based ace documentary filmmaker, who also teaches the subject at St Xavier’s College, has appealed for crowd funding through his social media platforms calling out donors to support the aspiring tribal filmmaker by sharing his academic and bank details. Prakash said, “I felt I should support his cause because education of tribal students like him is significant that will inspire many more from his and other marginalised communities to walk into the field of filmmaking to tell the untold stories through the medium of cinema. Being from a Munda tribe, he is possibly or among the first few students from his community in Jharkhand to qualify for FTII. He now stands before a barrier that needs to be scaled to complete his course.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/tribal-youth-begins-crowd-funding-to-study-at-ftii/articleshow/86623780.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Crop developed by BAU VC in list released by PM Modi||RANCHI: A crop variety of rice, developed by Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) vice-chancellor Onkar Nath Singh, featured among the 35 improved crop varieties that Prime Minister Narendra Modi released on Tuesday to tackle the vagaries of climate change and boost agriculture output. BAU, Jharkhand’s lone and premier agriculture university, on Wednesday said a variety of rice crop, CR Dhan-201, was among the list of 35. “It was developed by the BAU vice-chancellor when he was the principal scientist-cum-head of the division of crop improvement, ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack,” the university said in a statement. It added, “This variety was released by the Central Variety Release Committee of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare, GOI, in 2014, especially for Chhattisgarh and Bihar. But it is useful for any region battling proper irrigation facilities.” Singh said it took about 10 years of extensive trials and experiments, including data verification, for the new crop variety to be developed. On its USP, the expert added, “It is tolerant to major diseases of rice in field conditions and has yield potential of 5-6 tonnes per hectare. CR-Dhan 201 also takes less water compared to other crop. For example, if other crops of rice take about 5,000 litres of water for production of one kilogram of paddy, this variety requires half the amount. It is very suitable for Jharkhand too.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/crop-developed-by-bau-vc-in-list-released-by-pm-modi/articleshow/86624471.cms||---

On the occasion of World Heart Day, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Ranchi Chapter organised a talk with cardiologists to educate the public about the risks developed from cardiac ailments and ways to tackle them. Cardiologists said that patients have developed physiological as well as psychological complications post Covid-19 infections and acute coronary syndrome cases have been on the rise. Senior interventional cardiologist at Bhagwan Mahaveer Medica Super specialty hospital, Dr Anupam Singh, said: “The two major problems which have been detected among patients with cardiac ailments are thickness of blood and rhythm disorders. As Covid-19 patients are prone to develop coagulation in coronary as well as pulmonary arteries due to endothelium dysfunction, we have seen an increase in such cases. Apart from that, rhythm disorders among patients have also increased as we see patients coming with increased heart beats which is due to anxiety as well as sinus tachycardia. So we need to ensure that a recovered Covid patient must take post clinical advice in order to avoid any kind of major incidence.” Senior cardiologist and assistant Professor at RIMS cardiology department, Dr Prashant Kumar, said that people can avoid heart attacks by changing lifestyle. “Primarily the main reason behind thrombosis in which a formation of blood clot happens within a blood vessel which prevents blood flow through circulatory system is due to clots. However, clots can be developed due to different reasons and the most common way to avoid this is by adopting a healthy lifestyle.” “Regular exercise, avoiding saturated fats which are plenty in junk food and controlling salt consumption reduce the risk. Smoking is another major factor which leads to congestion in blood vessels. So we should ensure proper diet with green veggies so that the heart can be kept healthy,” said Dr Prashant. Ranchi IMA President Dr Shambhu Prasad who was instrumental in conducting the session said: “We organised the meet as many people who need assistance ignore the symptoms and then it becomes life threatening at times. We wanted to spread the word about the risks so that people visit their doctors regularly and keep their heart healthy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/cardiac-ailments-on-the-rise-among-patients-post-covid/articleshow/86624200.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Goa||Stop every truck carrying sand, post cops 24x7 at mining hotspots, says high court of Bombay at Goa||PANAJI: Finding that “illegally extracted sand is transported quite freely”, the high court of Bombay at Goa has given comprehensive directions, including for stopping every truck carrying sand and deputing police personnel round the clock at sites where violation is rampant. The court cited two sites below the Amona bridge — Amona and Candola (PWD property) — and two more, one at Bhati and the other at Oxel-Siolim (fisheries department property). “We have noted that rampant illegal sand mining in and around the Amona bridge site is posing danger to the foundation of the bridge itself, apart from degrading the highly sensitive ecosystem in the area,” the division bench stated in its latest order further directing that CCTV cameras be installed here within 15 days. Pointing out that the state has issued no permits for sand extraction, the court stated, “According to us, the RTO authorities should stop every truck transporting sand.” Despite several orders, illegal sand mining activity continues in North Goa, the high court observed, stating that “…authorities, who were duty-bound to prevent this sand mining, do not appear to be seriously interested in implementing the orders made by us from time to time”. The high court also directed that canoes found parked below Amona bridge and at Oxel-Siolim be “immediately seized and kept at a secured location, away from the river banks”. “These canoes have no good reason to remain parked on government property. The government also has no good reason to permit such canoes to be parked on its property, particularly when these properties appear to be hotspots for illegal sand mining,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. The bench stated that the responsibility of complying with its directions would be that of the Captain of Ports (CoP). It directed the CoP to file a compliance report within a maximum period of seven days from the date of the order, along with photographs and details. The high court stated that the persons involved in illegal sand mining are “out to hoodwink the authorities”. “Unfortunately, we find that in many cases even the authorities appear to be too eager to be hoodwinked. Therefore, if no steps are taken against the unregistered canoes parked on the river banks, such canoes are invariably used for illegal sand mining no sooner there is no surveillance from the authorities. The implementation of the ban is, then, rendered most difficult.” Advocate Norma Alvares representing the Goa Rivers and Protectors Network suggested that the fisheries department’s property at Oxel-Siolim be temporarily fenced at the earliest and pointed out that this was a suggestion of the nodal officer for North Goa. Advocate general Devidas Pangam said that temporary fencing is already provided at the site. The high court accepted the statement of the advocate general that canoes involved in illegal sand mining will not only be seized but the same will be destroyed and rendered unusable before they are disposed of as scrap. He added that unregistered canoes plying in rivers will be seized and not be permitted to so ply unless they obtain necessary registration but added that unregistered canoes parked on banks cannot be seized or otherwise interfered with. The high court also accepted Pangam’s statement that the confiscated suction pumps will not be auctioned or disposed of but will be retained by the government for use by the government departments, like sanitation, sewage treatment, etc.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/stop-every-truck-carrying-sand-post-cops-24x7-at-mining-hotspots-hc/articleshow/86627409.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Ranchi||Low pressure to bring rainfall across Jharkhand||RANCHI: The well-marked low pressure originating over the Bay of Bengal remained over the bordering areas of West Bengal and Jharkhand on Wednesday causing light to moderate rainfall in several parts of the state. The system, moving at a slow speed, is likely to come over Jharkhand, late on Wednesday night and cover the state on Thursday causing light to moderate rainfall in most parts of the state. Head, Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the well-marked low pressure area will cause rain and thunderstorm along with high speed winds blowing at a speed of 30-40km per hour gusting upto 50km per hour. “During the last 24 hours, the monsoon was active over Jharkhand and maximum rainfall of 49mm was recorded in Rajmahal area of Sahibganj district. The influence of the well-marked low-pressure system is likely to continue for five days —initially causing rainfall in most parts of the state and in many parts from Friday onwards,” he said. Because of back-to-back low-pressure system originating over the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon reinvigorated during the last two weeks of September mitigating the shortfall in seasonal rainfall. Out of the 24 districts, 17 have recorded normal rainfall while five are still in the deficient category with Lohardaga being the only district to record excess rainfall. Anand said as against the normal of 1,050mm, the state has received 1,003.7mm indicating a negative departure of 4%. “During the next four-five days this shortfall is expected to get mitigated due to the possibility of rainfall in most parts of the state,” Anand said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/well-marked-low-pressure-to-shift-over-jharkhand-today/articleshow/86623889.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Uproar over on Rajdhani’s proposed detour through Choupan||RANCHI: The Jharkhand Passengers Association (JPA) and the netizens of Ranchi have expressed their displeasure over the Railway Board’s deliberations to run the Ranchi - New Delhi Rajdhani Express through Choupan in Uttar Pradesh twice a week. JPA secretary Prem Kataruka, in a communique to Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnav earlier this week, has urged that the train be operated through the Ranchi - Lohardaga - Tori - Garhwa Road - Mughalsarai route in order to save travel time. “Operating the train through Choupan, which comes under Uttar Pradesh's Sonbadhra district, will result in a travel time of more than 15 hours. The very purpose of diverting the train through the Lohardaga - Tori route will be defeated,” Kataruka said in his letter. The Railway Board had earlier this month given its in-principle approval to run the train through Ranchi - Lohardaga - Tori route up to Garhwa Road junction in place of the usual Ranchi - Muri -Barkakana route. The diversion is supposed to prune the distance by 97 km between Ranchi and New Delhi railway stations, which, in turn, will save approximately two hours of travel. However, a formal notification in this regard has been delayed after Railway Board began toying with the idea of running the train Lohardaga - Tori - Garhwa Road and onwards to Choupan in place of the normal route to Allahabad through Mughalsarai junction. “While the current distance between Ranchi and New Delhi is 1,339 km, the travel through Lohardaga - Tori - Garhwa Road- Mughalsarai will reduce the distance to 1,242 km. But if the train is running through Choupan, its travel time will increase,” sources in the railways said. Officials in know of things claimed that the diversion is being mooted at the behest of Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who has been placed at the helm of affairs of BJP’s election affairs in Sonbhadra district in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Senior railway officials refused to comment on the matter when contacted.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/uproar-over-on-rajdhanis-proposed-detour-through-choupan/articleshow/86623608.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand misses alt energy target: Data||RANCHI: Jharkhand has been a habitual defaulter in meeting the renewable energy purchase obligation (RPO) as mandated by the Centre for achieving the ambitious dream of 175GW power through renewable sources by 2022. RPO is a mechanism by which the obligated entities which includes discoms, open access consumers and captive power producers, are obliged to purchase certain percentage of electricity from renewable energy sources, as a percentage of the total consumption of electricity. RPOs are categorized as solar and non-solar. With the objective of achieving the target of 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022, including solar energy capacity of 100 GW, the ministry of power (MoP) has notified the target RPO trajectory up to year 2022 for all the states and Union Territories. The obligation for Jharkhand, beginning year 2010-11, for renewable power was fixed at 2% of net energy consumption of 16,443.84 million units back then. Out of this 2%, category breakup of 0.25% solar —corresponding to 41.11 million units and 1.75% of non-solar corresponding to 287.77MU was fixed. While not a single unit of solar power was purchased resulting in shortfall of entire 41.11Mu obligation, in non-solar category 46.88 MU power was purchased indicating a shortfall of 240.89MU in 2010-11. The trend of short fall has continued all through. In the year 2016-17, solar and non-solar obligation was fixed at 1.80% corresponding to 370.88 MU and 3.50% corresponding to 721.16MU respectively. In comparison, the achievement was 98.15 MU and 120.30 MU in both the categories respectively indicating an overall shortfall of 873.59MU. The achievement deteriorated further in the year 2017-18, when solar and non-solar obligation was fixed at 3.75% and 4% of net consumption respectively corresponding to 290.96 MU and 310.35 MU and not a single unit was purchased in either category resulting in collective shortfall of entire 601.31 MU. Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JSERC) notified the JSERC (Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation and its compliance) (First Amendment) Regulations, 2021 on January 21 this year thereby fixing the annual target for RPO. Under the new notification, the total obligation of 21% divided equally into 10.50% of solar and non-solar power is to be included in 2021-22. It must be increased to 23% by 2022-23 and further to 25% of net energy consumption by 2023-24. Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (JREDA) is the state agency mandated to achieve the given target and file its quarterly compliance report to the commission. As of date, the commission is lying defunct without a chairman, secretary or members as a result of which the agency is not sure where to file the compliance reports. Project director JREDA Bijay Kumar Sinha said the agency is working on three kinds of projects for harnessing solar power — canal top, rooftop on government buildings and installation of solar-powered water pumps in farmers’ fields. “The 2MW canal-top solar plant, 3MW solar plant for airport and a 150MW floating panel solar plant by SECI is in the pipeline whereas around 23MW collective rooftop grid connected solar power plants on government buildings, around 16MWs of off-grid plants in Deoghar and Seraikela and roughly 2MWs of rooftop plants in private buildings have been commissioned,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/jharkhand-fails-to-meet-target-on-renewable-energy-purchase/articleshow/86623702.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The multi-purpose building will offer facilities for sporting activities like badminton, and table tennis, besides housing a gym. The digital studio, on the other hand, will ensure state-of-the-art hybrid mode of teaching at the varsity. Bais said, “Both the facilities were the need-of-the-hour and will help in the overall development of the academic environment in the varsity.” Bais added, “The pandemic has hampered the education system but we need to work through innovative ways to bridge the gap.” He urged the other varsities to also set up digital rooms. Asked about his priorities, Bais, who is the chancellor of all the universities in Jharkhand, said, “My priority will be to fill up all the vacancies of the professors and teachers in all the universities and colleges of the state at the earliest.

They said that TMC will only help split opposition votes in favour of BJP. “Now that elections are coming up everyone will come to Goa to campaign. Whoever is coming to campaign here, I cannot say anything about it, but I can only say that BJP will form the government in Goa once again,” Sawant said. Godinho was more blunt in his criticism of former Congressman Luizinho Faleiro shifting to TMC, calling it political ‘rehabilitation’. “When a person feels lost, he wants rehabilitation, and some persons are very shrewd about rehabilitating themselves very comfortably and show it as a sacrifice for the whole of Goa. Where is the sacrifice and when have these people sacrificed? There are talks of getting some Rajya Sabha seat for him. If they are so good, then how they lost elections twice. And these people are going to shake BJP?” Godinho said. He said TMC and other players will only split the opposition vote, while BJP’s vote bank in Goa will remain intact. “Whoever is coming, you analyse it carefully. It is advantage BJP in most constituencies. They are assuring BJP of majority by their own actions. It will harm our political opponents, I don’t want to name any political party. I want to say that BJP is on the right track. Whichever more parties are coming, it is said more the merrier, but it is merrier for BJP,” Godinho said. Ajgaonkar said that parties are cropping up in Goa now with only the upcoming 2022 assembly polls in sight. “BJP’s voters will continue to vote for BJP. As per season, the parties are cropping up here. Like the CM said, it is political tourism. We are ready to face the people. We are asking for votes based on the good work we have done,” Ajgaonkar said. BJP’s former Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldesai said TMC had attempted to poach him on several occasions.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/new-players-will-only-split-oppn-votes-cm/articleshow/86627577.cms||---
---||Delhi||Middle school classes may start in Delhi after festival season||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) is likely to allow reopening of middle school classes (6-8) in the city after the festival season is over. A final decision will be taken after considering the prevailing Covid situation. The government seems to be playing it safe with no word on resuming primary classes. However, Dussehra, including Ramlilas, and Durga Puja celebrations have been allowed with strict conditions. A DDMA order is likely to be issued on Thursday. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who chaired the DDMA meeting on Wednesday, tweeted: “As suggested by experts, it was decided to consider opening middle school classes 6-8, after the festive season.” Last year Covid-19 cases had surged after the festival season was over. Experts have expressed satisfaction over the prevailing Covid situation but strongly reiterated that there can be no let-up in enforcing Covid-appropriate behaviour, especially in view of the forthcoming festive season in order to avoid frittering away of the gains made in Covid management. The DDMA, according to sources, has imposed strict conditions for Dussehra and Durga Puja celebrations. At the festival venues, no standing crowds will be allowed and separate entry and exit points will have to be created to avoid crowding. The organisers will have to ensure appropriate social distancing while making seating arrangements. The number of visitors must not exceed the number of seats available. No crowd-pulling attractions — like fairs, stalls, eateries and ferris wheels etc — will be allowed. Hundred per cent mask compliance will be a must. The onus will be on the organisers for ensuring that the SOPs are strictly followed. These are likely to spelt out in the DDMA order. Schools had been allowed to open for classes IX-XII for practical and project work from September 1. The education department, which has analysed the month-long experience, has found that the reopening has not let to any surge in Covid-19 cases and schools are running smoothly in compliance with SOPs. Since almost all economic activities have been permitted, many parents want schools for all classes to reopen so that the children do not lose any more time. Around the world, experts have suggested that schools are not superspreaders and children are losing valuable time at a critical period in their lives due to schools being closed for a long time. The LG said that all the stakeholders were called upon to work in a coordinated manner for ensuring adequate preparedness for tackling any future challenges. An official said the DDMA directed chief secretary Vijay Dev to revisit the SOPs for the festive season and synergise it with the SOPs issued by the central government for effective Covid management. "Delhi Police and the district administration will enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and ensure that gatherings that take place during the festive season are strictly in compliance with the SOPs," said an official. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, Dr V K Paul from Niti Aayog, AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria and others attended the meeting. The health department made a presentation on the current Covid situation while the education department presented its experience of opening the schools for classes IX to XII. The DDMA observed that while vaccination has increased remarkably, a change in strategy to mandatorily cover all groups that have a high public interface, like government employees, health workers, teachers and other school staff and service providers like public transport drivers and delivery persons, was needed. "It was also decided to undertake a targeted and intensified vaccination drive through camps and mobile vans with ambulances to facilitate the elderly, differently abled, indisposed and domestic helps etc to avail of the vaccine," an official said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/middle-school-classes-may-start-in-delhi-after-festival-season/articleshow/86631686.cms||Alok K N Mishra

---||Chandigarh||Tangled Channi-Sidhu strife working both ways for Cong||Jalandhar: Suggestions, both subtle and open, are being made that Navjot Singh Sidhu is not accepting Charanjit Singh Channi as the latter is a scheduled caste (SC) and these seem to be percolating down among the community. At the same time Sidhu questioning appointments of officiating DGP and advocate general, for their roles in the past on sacrilege and police firing cases, is also finding traction, which is clearly palpable on social media. After BJP and AAP attacked Sidhu, stating that he apparently did not like the elevation of a SC as chief minister of Punjab, Congress national spokesperson Udit Raj on Wednesday tweeted, “What Congress hasn’t done for Navjot Siddhu? Made him minister & PPCC president, fulfilled his wish to remove Capt Amrender as CM and Channi was also his choice. May be a dalit CM was the cause”. Both the factors that were working for Congress – Channi being first SC Sikh CM of Punjab and party promising justice in sacrilege and police firing cases of 2015 – are now going in different directions. Channi has succeeded in striking a chord not only among SCs, but even among others, including Jat Sikhs, who liked his mannerism and gestures to project himself as a common man’s CM. But at the same time, Sidhu after facing initial ridicule from a section of netizens on Tuesday evening after his resignation, started getting a lot of support a few hours later as details of issues due to which he resigned came out. Long and short social media posts praised him for taking a principled stand on questionable elevations and appointments. Notably, first announcement Channi made after becoming CM was to ensure justice in sacrilege and firing cases. Sidhu seems to have his finger on the sentiments on issues of sacrilege and police firing. Sikhs themselves, whose biggest component is Jat Sikhs, pulled down two biggest Jat Sikh leaders of Punjab – Parkash Singh Badal and Amarinder Singh — on issues of sacrilege and police firing. If due to Badal’s part SAD was relegated to third place in 2017 assembly elections — something unprecedented after reorganisation of Punjab in 1966 — and just two seats in 2019 general election, Amarinder faced the heat through his party MLAs who were facing questions on ground. Moreover, the farm movement has started the trend of questioning politicians when they go to villages. This can compound the situation in case Channi government fails to give any convincing justification over controversial appointments and elevations in the cabinet.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/tangled-channi-sidhu-strife-working-both-ways-for-cong/articleshow/86627622.cms||IP Singh
---||Goa||‘Drive away migrants loitering at public places in Margao’||Margao: The growing tendency of migrant labourers to hang around in groups near the municipal square, municipal building and the municipal garden in Margao has got the goat of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) chief officer Agnelo Fernandes, who has now written to the Margao town police to “drive them away.” “Several migrants are seen loitering outside the municipal garden and other public places, thereby creating nuisance in the municipal garden. The public has observed them spitting and dirtying the municipal garden, which has become an eyesore,” Fernandes wrote to the Margao town police inspector. Pointing out that a number of migrant labourers are seen gathering by the side of the municipal garden every morning and squatting in the municipal square, Fernandes said,, “You are directed to drive them away… (it is) depicting a bad image of MMC. There is every possibility of murder and other anti-social activities (sic).” The rokda market (daily wage workers’ assemblies) offers skilled and unskilled labour services for several works such as masonry, tile-fitting, plumbing, manual cleaning of septic tanks, etc. Recently, considering the rise of migrant labourers in the rokda markets at various places in South Goa and the rise in criminal activities, police had begun cracking down on such migrant gatherings as part of a larger exercise of cracking down on violators of the tenant verification rules. The police had launched a ‘roko toko’ (stop and check) campaign that had created a sense of deterrence among criminals. Considering the possibility that there could be hardened criminals or gangsters lurking among these labourerswho assemble at specific points in various towns, the police, as part of their campaign, would randomly stop suspicious-looking elements and question them. If they failed to give satisfactory answers, they would be rounded up and their antecedents checked.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/drive-away-migrants-loitering-at-public-places-in-margao/articleshow/86627802.cms||---

The protesters also locked the office of the market committee in Thanesar. Earlier, farmers reached the grain market with their paddy crop loaded in tractor-trolleys and raised slogans against the Haryana government. The state government is starting paddy procurement from October 1, but the crop started to arrive in the grain market five days ago. The protesters claimed that the government had originally ordered to start procurement from September 25. After locking the office of Thanesar market committee, the farmers went to the Kurukshetra district mini-secretariat with their paddy-loaded tractor-trolleys and protested there. Thanesar sub-division magistrate Narender Malik reached the farmers and told them the government would be start paddy procurement from October 1, after which they lifted the protes. Stop crop-selling portal: BKU (Charuni) Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to Kurukshetra deputy commissioner (DC), demanding that Meri Fasal Mera Byora (MFMB) portal should be stopped. The union said a complaint centre should be established in all grain markets where farmers could take up their issues related to glitches in MFMB. “The portal should be closed, so farmers are able to sell their crop in the grain market like before. Farmers who fail to register in time due to glitches in the portal, don’t get minimum support price (MSP),” said BKU (Charuni) in the memorandum. “It is difficult to register details of land on MFMB portal. Many farmers farm on government land, panchayati land or shamlat, and their OTPs (one-time passwords) go to concerned BDPOs and the BDPOs do not share OTPs with farmers or they do not come on calls. In such a situation, it is hard for farmers to register their details,” said BKU (Charuni). It also demanded an increase in the per-acre limit of paddy which could be sold from 30 quintals to 35 quintals.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/farmers-end-protest-after-haryana-govt-promises-paddy-procurement-from-oct-1/articleshow/86627927.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Haryana medical body alleges rampant corruption in health dept||AMBALA: The Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA) on Wednesday alleged rampant corruption and favouritism in the state health department. It also threatened to resort to strike if their grievance are not resolved in a time-bound manner and claimed that no action has been taken on its representation given to officials concerned about their demands on September 13. HCMSA president Dr Jasbir Singh Panwar issued a statement on this issue, and added that the association feels proud that the top leadership of the state, including the chief minister and the health minister, is honest and upright. “Even our honourable Prime Minister says na khaunga, na khane dunga (neither will I indulge in corruption, nor allow anyone else to). But contrary to this slogan, there is rampant corruption in the health department. At all levels, money is being demanded for transfers, postings, promotions and deputation. It is an open secret now,” alleged the body. “One director has been entrusted with all important works, sidelining other senior officers... Recently, a bizarre policy regarding specialist cadre was also framed by this director in an autocratic manner, sidelining suggestions from HCMSA and other senior officers. It has also come to our notice that the same officer is being given extension in service, whereas in recent notification dated September 1, many senior doctors were retired,” said the HSMSA. The association also demanded a pay hike, saying their salary must be at par with the Union government. “Four assured career progressions were proposed at 4, 9, 13, 20 years, which was approved by the chief minister and health minister in 2019. But the file is still stuck in the finance department... Due to direct recruitment of senior medical officers (SMOs), there is a stagnation in HCMS cadre,” he said. Denying any such nexus, Haryana’s additional chief secretary of health Rajeev Arora said, “Haryana is giving a fair and decent pay to the doctors, and genuine demands of the doctors are always accepted.” About direct recruitment of SMO, he said, “This is not happening for the first time and this is part of their service rules. Present DGHS and many other officers got selected after direct process. For all the SMO posts, there is a 75% quota through promotions and 25% through direct quota.” About HSMSA’s objection about specialist cadre, he said, “This cadre has not been formed yet, but the department has only uploaded a concept (draft policy) on its website. Comments have been sought from all the concerned stakeholders and after receiving comments from all, each and every comment will be analysed and required changes will be made. Then we will come out with a final policy.”||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-medical-body-alleges-rampant-corruption-in-health-dept/articleshow/86628068.cms||JK Singh

The health workers were hired on contract during the peak of the pandemic. Punjab paramedical and health employees coordination committee chairman Narinder Singh also spoke out in support of the health workers on Wednesday, and urged the state health department to reconsider its decision of terminating all of them on September 30. “These are the people who actually served the Covid patients, changed their clothes, gave them food when even their relatives were hesitant to come near them. In the event of death, these Corona warriors managed their bodies and went to crematorium for their last rites,” he said. Sing said that instead of appreciating them for their services, the state government is planning to show them the door. He also appealed to chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi to adopt a humanitarian approach allow them to continue with their jobs. “Most of these contractual employees are from poor background and their contract as safai sewak is the only source of income,” he said.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amritsar/punjab-govt-decides-to-terminate-contract-of-176-corona-warriors/articleshow/86628208.cms||---

Farmers raised slogans against the Haryana government and burnt the effigy of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and former BJP MLA from Assandh Bakhshish Singh Virk. BJP district chief Yogendra Rana and former MLA Bakhshish Singh Virk were supposed to attend the event party’s ‘Tridev Sammelan’ at Jundla. But as soon as farmer leaders came to know about it, they circulated messages on the social media. Farmers assembled at Jundla grain market at 9am to oppose this event. A farmer leader said, “BJP had to cancel its programme because of farmers’ opposition. It is a victory for farmers.” On the other hand, Yogendra Rana said the programme had to be postponed for technical reasons as names of booth level workers who will handle booths during the election could not be uploaded on the software. He refuted the farmers’ claim that the protest was a reason behind the cancellation of the event. Rana alleged that these protesters were not farmers.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/bjp-cancels-event-after-farmers-protest/articleshow/86628287.cms||---

---||Delhi||Deaths due to coal pollution in Delhi may double in 9 years, says study||NEW DELHI: The number of premature deaths occurring from coal-related air pollution in Delhi could almost double in the next nine years, with 5,280 premature deaths expected till 2030, a new study shows. The report comes in the light of India’s plans to expand the coal fleet by another 64GW between 2020 and 2030. The report by C40 Cities, “Coal-free cities: the health and economic case for a clean energy revolution”, says Delhi records 330 premature deaths due to coal-related pollution a year. However, 250 more deaths would be added each year till ’30. Around 12% of India’s coal-generated electricity falls within 500km of Delhi. The current plans will expand the national coal fleet by around 28% between 2020 and 2030, not reduce it by 20%. This will threaten the health and well-being of Delhi residents and undermine India’s climate and air quality targets. It could nearly double the number of annual premature deaths in the city due to air pollution from coal power plants,” said Dr Rachel Huxley, head of knowledge and research at C40. In addition to premature deaths, 8,360 preterm births and 10,310 asthmatic emergency visits to the hospital are also likely to occur owing to coal-related pollution. It would likely increase 1,360 asthma cases among children in Delhi over the next decade. Nationally, 52,700 premature deaths, 31,300 preterm births and 48,600 asthma-related emergency hospital visits are expected, the report adds. Track the pollution level in your cityC40 Cities is a climate leadership group connecting 97 major cities around the world that are determined to take bold climate action, leading the way towards a healthier and more sustainable future. It represents over 700 million people and a quarter of the global economy. Among Indian cities, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru are part of C40. Research shows 37 coal units around Delhi generating 6.6GW of power, which are currently some of the most-polluting and least cost-effective plants, could retire in the next two years, followed by 21 (5.7GW) other coal units by 2030. A full phase-out could be carried out by 2045, shifting focus to renewable energy, which the report says could lead to job creation as well as better productivity among employees. “Around 5.5 million million sick days could be caused by air pollution from coal-based power plants in Delhi if the current proposed expansion takes place. Over the coming decade, the economic health costs in Delhi are estimated at $8.4 billion. In India, business leaders estimate that employee productivity decreases by 8-10% on high pollution days. An additional 2.3 lakh energy jobs could be created by 2030 by retiring the oldest and least competitive coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy,” the report states. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants can travel long distances and the concentration levels puts even healthy people at risk. It’s particularly harmful for vulnerable citizens, such as the young, elderly, those suffering from respiratory problems and pregnant women, say experts. “A transition to clean energy is not only critical for Indian cities to reduce air pollution, improve residents’ health and deliver climate targets aligned to the Paris agreements, but also to create jobs,” said Shruti Narayan, regional director C40, south and west Asia.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/deaths-due-to-coal-pollution-in-delhi-may-double-in-9-years-says-study/articleshow/86631787.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

BMC education officer Raju Tadvi on Wednesday issued a circular permitting reopening of schools for higher secondary students after a go-ahead from municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal. The state had given its nod on Friday and left the final decision in urban areas to the civic chiefs or collectors. The civic bodies of Thane and Navi Mumbai will take a decision on reopening schools on Thursday, while the Vasai-Virar and Palghar district administrations will take a call next week. In Mumbai, a total of 2,553 schools and junior colleges can bring back 5.13 lakh students to classrooms. Most schools, however, are planning to start in a phased manner by welcoming Class 10 students. Many principals said Class 12 students (who are not vaccinated as they are still not 18 years old) will not be able to reach their colleges as they will not be permitted train travel. Schools may bring in Std 10 pupils back first, those in 8 and 9 in NovemberSchools may bring class 8 and 9 students back in mid-November, when the second semester begins. All schools and junior colleges have first-semester exams next month in online mode. Most junior colleges will begin their new academic year for class XI students online from next week. All the standard operating procedures chalked out by the state will have to befollowed, Tadvi said. Parental consent will be mandatory, and educational institutions will have to keep online learning going. “We will bring back our class X students as they can get down with their practicals and mock tests before their first semester online boards in November,” said Perin Bagli, principal, Activity School, a Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examination (CISCE) school. The BMC has already given permission to CISCE, CBSE and international education boards in the city to conduct physical exams till November. The principal of a state board school said it will be a challenge to plan the return of 327 class X students. “With 24 benches in a class, we cannot accommodate more than 12 students. Teachers will not be able to conduct online and offline classes simultaneously,” he said. Vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff is still underway and many will not be allowed train travel, the principal said. St Xaviers College vice-principal (junior college) Hasnain Naqvi said they will take a call on reopening after considering government guidelines and their readiness. Schools and colleges have started collecting consent letters from parents, but say the response has been poor. When schools in rural areas opened for classes 8-12 in July, only 10% of students attended physical classes. Over 35% of schools in the state had reopened. The 781 civic schools with 67,361 higher secondary students have got down to putting Covid protocols in place. Vaccination and quarantine centres in civic schools have been ordered to move out. Civic teachers on Covid duty have also been asked to be relieved for teaching work.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 15-acre Worli Dairy to make way for marine research centre & aquarium||MUMBAI: The state government will soon convert the sprawling 14.5-acre Worli Dairy land into a marine research centre, a world-class aquarium and an exhibition centre. CM Uddhav Thackeray is believed to have directed the urban development department to change the land reservation. “In the next few days, the state will issue a public notification under MRTP Act 37 (1), inviting objections and suggestions,” highly placed Mantralaya sources told TOI. The proposal seeks to carve out 11 acres of the complex for these new public facilities including an aquarium. The remaining area will be retained by the dairy commissioner’s office while the dairy itself will be shifted to Kurla. “The land has been under-utilised for many years and only a small quantity of milk is processed here,” an officer said. Dip in dairy output prompts govt to plan Worli revampThe government feels the land is not being appropriately used considering the dairy activities have reduced,” said a senior officer. The state animal husbandry department, controlled by the Congress, had resisted the move to shift the dairy operations. “However, the CM convinced them about the new facilities on the plot and they have agreed to it,” said the officer. The land falls within the assembly constituency of Aditya Thackeray. The state government will hand over the land either to the BMC or the tourism department once a formal decision is taken to change the land reservation. In March 2020, just before the pandemic lockdown began, state finance minister Ajit Pawar had announced the project on the Worli Dairy land in his budget speech. He said the objective was to attract domestic and international tourists. Over the years, the property has been eyed by several builders because of its prime location on Worli Sea face. The real estate is worth thousands of crores because of its size and location. At one time, government is believed to have considered monetizing the land to raise funds for metro projects. The dairy department also has large tracts of land in Kurla and Goregaon. Last year, a 25-acre plot in Kurla, which once housed a Mother Dairy complex, was to be taken over by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for commercial exploitation. MMRDA was planning to monetise the land to fund metro projects. The land is under the state government's department of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries. About 10,000 sqm of the dairy land (2.5 acres) was surrendered to MMRDA for a viaduct and station of the upcoming Metro 2B line. The dairy, shut down a few decades back, will be revived and revamped by MMRDA. A residential building for dairy staff will be built by MMRDA. The Worli Dairy was established in 1961 at a project cost of over Rs four crore, of which Rs 80 lakh was provided by UNICEF. The dairy was inaugurated by Vijayalaxmi Pandit, then governor of Maharashtra.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/15-acre-worli-dairy-to-make-way-for-marine-research-centre-aquarium/articleshow/86630053.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Kolkata||From today, you cannot use plastic thinner than 75 microns in West Bengal||KOLKATA: From Thursday, the plastic bags below the thickness of 75 microns are banned across the city and rest of the state. Its effective implementation, environmentalists said, holds the key to fight waterlogging in the city, which will increase both in terms of frequency and intensity, thanks to climate changes. The plastic wastes are ubiquitous. As the city this time sees back-to-back heavy rains, the civic authorities across the Kolkata Metropolitan areas found drains choked, canals clogged, pumping stations frequently going out of order because of plastics. “Once it rains, it is taking almost thrice more time to recede the water than what it used to be even 10 years ago. Thin plastic is the single biggest threat to the city’s drainage system,” said a senior drainage department engineer of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. “We have circulated the notification across the departments and enforcing agencies. We need a people’s movement on the use and disposal of plastics. The vagaries of climates will be far more drastic with the rising surface temperatures. Each drainage pumping station has heaps of plastic waste this monsoon. A regulation is welcome, but it has always a limited outcome, if it is entirely left to enforcement,” said Kalyan Rudra, chairman, Bengal’s pollution control board. “We are facing an existential crisis because of plastic waste. It is a now-or-never kind of situation. The smaller and thinner the size of the packet or pouch, the graver is the threat,” said Profesor Sadhan Ghosh of Jadavpur University, a waste-management expert. Thicker bags of more than 75 micron will be costlier. A consumer needs to pay extra for a bag. Moreover, it will be recycled, added Prof Ghosh. The notification issued by the environment ministry said that the manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of polythene bags below 75 microns, including polystyrene and expanded polystyrene, commodities will be prohibited with effect from September 30. Currently, polythene bags of less than 50 microns are banned in the country. From December 31, 2022, bags of less than 120 microns will be banned. “The plastic bags of more than 75 microns will be at least five to seven times costlier. So, it will not be given free along with the commodity that you purchase,” said Vikash Kandoi, a plastic manufacturer. Environment activist S M Ghosh said, “We welcome the move. The state must give utmost importance to its implementation.” Study shows that more than 40% of total plastic waste remains uncollected in the city daily.||https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/from-today-you-cannot-use-plastic-thinner-than-75-microns/articleshow/86625377.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
