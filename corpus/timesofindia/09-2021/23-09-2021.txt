The incident came to light after carcass of 10 stray dogs were found in Shankarpur village near Choudwar on Wednesday. The stall owner has been identified as Arakhita Sahu, a resident of Shankarpur area, who runs a stall at Shankarpur village of Choudwar. Arakhita is said to have punished the dogs that had allegedly dirtied his stall. In order to get rid of the dogs, who frequently barged into his stall, he made a local sweetbread known as ‘Gulgula’, added poison to it and fed it to the dogs. Locals lodged an FIR against Arakhita in connection with the death of the dogs. The carcass of the dogs have been sent for autopsy. “We have received a complaint and probe has been initiated in the matter,” DCP Prateek Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/cops-to-probe-poisoning-of-street-dogs/articleshow/86437081.cms||---

"If they do not include all the factions, sooner or later they will have a civil war," he told the BBC in an interview aired on Tuesday. Khan said Pakistan was primarily concerned about the possibility of a humanitarian and refugee crisis if a civil war breaks out, as well as the possibility of Afghan soil being used by armed groups that are fighting the Pakistani government. "That would mean an unstable, chaotic Afghanistan," Khan said. "That (Afghanistan) is an ideal place for terrorists, if there is no control or if there is fighting going on. And this is our worry. So terrorism from Afghan soil, and secondly, if there is a humanitarian crisis or a civil war, a refugee issue for us," Khan said.

"We (Pakistan) were like a hired gun," Khan said in an interview with CNN. "We were supposedThe Pakistan PM laid out three conditions to formally recognise the new Taliban government: the new leadership should be inclusive, it must respect human rights, and Afghanistan should not be used to house terrorists who could threaten Pakistan’s security. When asked if the Taliban accepted the conditions, would Pakistan formally recognise the Taliban government, Imran replied that Pakistan would take a decision to formally recognise the Taliban government together with neighbouring countries. "All neighbours will get together and see how they progress," he said, adding whether to recognise them or not will be a collective decision. Pakistan, however, was a key ally of the previous Taliban government in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Imran described the act of preventing girls from attending school as un-Islamic. Last week, the Taliban excluded girls from secondary schools, with only boys and male teachers allowed back. But Pakistan's leader said he believed girls would soon be able to attend.

Ahead of talks on Afghanistan at the UN General Assembly, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood"I think they will allow women to go to school," he said. "It’s just too early to say anything," he continued, adding that he expected Afghan women would eventually "assert their rights". The PM urged the international community to be patient with the latest change on the Afghan landscape. After 20 years of civil war, Imran said, the Taliban have come to power. Time and again, Khan and his ministers have called for the world to engage with the Taliban’s interim government to stave off the possibility of a collapse of Afghan structures in the absence of central bank funds. An estimated $10 billion in Afghan central bank funds remain frozen in foreign bank accounts, notably with the US Federal Reserve, following the Taliban’s takeover of the country a month ago.

---||World||Pakistan claims threat to New Zealand team sent from India-linked device; Delhi terms charges 'frivolous'||ISLAMABAD/ NEW DELHI: Indian government sources on Wednesday termed as “frivolous” allegations by the Pakistani establishment that a threatening email was sent to the New Zealand cricket squad from a device associated with India and this prompted the Kiwis to call off their tour of the country last week, citing security reasons. Pakistan's information minister Fawad Chaudhry and interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told a joint press conference in Islamabad that in August, a fake social media post was created under the name of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militant Ehsanullah Ehsan, which threatened the New Zealand cricket board and government and asked them not to send their team to Pakistan as it would be ‘targeted’. Subsequently, a threatening email was sent to the New Zealand team using the ID ‘Hamza Afridi’, the minister added, claiming that investigating authorities discovered that the email was sent from a device associated with India. “It was sent using a virtual private network (VPN) so the location was shown as Singapore.” While there was no official reaction from India, government sources said these are frivolous allegations which should not be taken seriously. Chaudhry said that soon after the threatening mail, The Sunday Guardian bureau chief Abhinandan Mishra published an article claiming that the New Zealand cricket team may face a terrorist attack in Pakistan. The minister claimed that Mishra has strong links with former Afghan vice-president Amrullah Saleh. Mishra stood by his report and claimed in a statement that after the Pakistani ministers’ press conference in Islamabad, Ehsanullah Ehsan released an audio recording “reiterating that he had made the statement through his Facebook profile and that he did this for the 'protection of New Zealand cricketers'.” Mishra said his report was based on the statement made by Ehsan, “who by multiple independent, local, published accounts has been very close to the Pakistan army and its intelligence agency, the ISI”. “He (Ehsan) had shared the statement regarding a possible attack on the New Zealand team publicly on his Facebook profile. I also verified through independent sources that Ehsan has indeed written about an imminent ISIS attack on the New Zealand team. I also confirmed the possibility of an ISIS-planned attack on the cricket team through sources in Pakistan and in Afghanistan,” Mishra said. The journalist added that he had reached out to ICC and New Zealand Cricket for their response on Ehsan’s claims, which were duly incorporated in the story. On Chaudhry’s allegations that the journalist had strong links with the former Afghan vice-president, Mishra said: “All I can say is that I know him in a professional capacity, just like any other journalist would know him.” Chaudhry also claimed in the press conference that New Zealand cricketer Martin Guptill’s wife had received an email threatening her husband. He said the email ID used ‘Tehreek-i-Labbaik’ as the username. The email claimed that the cricketer would be killed in Pakistan. The minister added that the email was sent via ProtonMail, a secure service. Chaudhry said on the day of the first match New Zealand officials said that their government had concerns of a credible threat and cancelled the tour. “Pakistan Cricket Board officials, the interior ministry security team, everyone went to them and asked them to share the threat ... but they were as clueless as us.” Chaudhry said the device used for sending emails had 13 other IDs, nearly all of which were Indian names. All IDs were made using the names of Indian actors and celebrities. Only the name ‘Hamza Afridi’ is different to show that this email was generated from Pakistan. He claimed the user of the particular device has been identified as Omprakash Mishra from Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-claims-threat-to-new-zealand-team-sent-from-india-linked-device-delhi-terms-charges-frivolous/articleshow/86437619.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||India extradition case against three British Sikh men collapses||LONDON: Three British Sikhs walked free from Westminster magistrates’ court on Wednesday to chants of "the Khalsa will prevail" after an extradition case brought by India collapsed. Gursharanvir Singh Wahiwala and his brother Amritivir Singh Wahiwala from Coventry, and Piara Singh Gill, from Wolverhampton, raised their fists as they were mobbed by a jubilant crowd of around 1,000 British Sikhs who had been protesting outside the court building. The three men, dressed in suits, had earlier sat in the dock and watched as the case against them was dropped. Daniel Sternberg, representing the Indian government, told the judge: "We accept the court is not going to be satisfied to a criminal standard that this extradition request has a case to answer and it is accepted the court will discharge each of the men, without prejudice to the fact India may in future seek the extradition of these requested persons for these offences or other matters. The totality of evidence served is not sufficient to make a case requiring a case to answer to any of the charges in the extradition request. There would need to be new or further evidence in order for that position to be reconsidered." The men, all born and raised in the UK, all married with children, had been arrested at their homes in December 2020 based on extradition warrants following an extradition request from India accusing them of conspiracy to murder Rashtriya Sikh Sangat leader Rulda Singh in India in 2009. Mark Summers QC, representing Piara and Gursharanvir, told the court: "This vindicates the defendants who have been pursued for 11 years without evidence." He said the "threat in the note" that India may want to start again is "frankly disturbing". "Not only does it involve the prospect this 11-year ordeal may not be at an end for my clients, but it may be abusive," he said. Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing Amritivir, said the extradition request was "made on the basis of wholly unsubstantiated allegations", that his client was not even in India at the time of Rulda’s murder, and that he "has always maintained his innocence right from the start". District judge Michael Snow said: "I discharge all of you. Nothing has been proved against you and you remain innocent of the charges." He said any further extradition request would need to come back before him so he could see if there was further evidence before any warrant was issued. Outside court a representative of the family read out a statement hailing it as a "victory for the Khalsa Panth" and called for an independent inquiry "into why the home office accepted India’s extradition request into a case which the UK authorities already investigated 10 years ago and concluded no further action was required". "It is a disgrace to the British judicial system that the home office allowed this fabricated case to reach this stage. We never thought an extradition request against British-born Sikhs would be accepted — but it was. It is shocking that our extradition papers were signed a day after Dominic Raab returned from India after securing a trade deal with India," the representative of the family said. Dabinderjit Singh, principal adviser to the Sikh Federation (UK), questioned why home secretary Priti Patel had certified the extradition request. He called for her resignation. Sukhjeevan Singh, senior adviser to the Sikh Council UK, said: "This is something for our community to celebrate as UK-born Sikhs have faith in the judicial system in the UK. Today is a really a test of that faith and we are glad that this case, which did not have significant merit, was dropped."

---||India||Centre files plea against allowing second dose of Covishield earlier, says it will derail policy||KOCHI: The Centre on Wednesday filed an appeal in the Kerala high court against its order allowing the second Covishield dose after four weeks from the first for those who want to take it earlier than the present suggested gap of 84 days by saying if the decision is not set aside it could derail the vaccination policy of the country. The Centre, in its appeal, contends that the September 3 judgement of a single judge of the high court if not set aside would result in disorder in the implementation of the strategy of the Union government to fight Covid-19. The September 3 decision by Justice P B Suresh Kumar had come on a plea by Kitex Garments Ltd, represented by advocate Blaze K Jose, seeking permission to administer the second dose of the vaccine to its workers without having to wait for 84 days. Kitex, in its plea, had said it has vaccinated more than 5,000 of its workers with the first dose and has arranged for the second dose at a cost of nearly Rs 93 lakh, but was unable to administer the same due to the prevailing restrictions. Challenging the September 3 judgement, the Centre said it was an attempt to evaluate the issue on the basis of the right to equality provided in the Constitution instead of viewing it from a scientific angle and if allowed, would result in social disaster which should not be allowed to happen. "The judgement of the Single Judge will derail the vaccination policy throughout the country," it said. The petition further said,"The Single Judge ought to have seen that if the government is forced to honour the claims of other groups or industrial units like the petitioners (Kitex Garments), the same would have a cascading adverse effects on the organised and regulated pattern of vaccine administration." It said, "The Single Judge's decision would militate against the settled position that in matters related to government policy supported by scientific study, the court shall not meddle with nor substitute its view with the view of the administration." "Therefore, the judgement is illegal, erroneous, unjustifiable and unsustainable," the petition said. The petition contended that the national vaccine policy is formulated based on the opinion and advice of experts in the field and also based on clinical trials and hence, any change in the policy can only be carried out based on the necessary approvals and clinical trials. The Union Health Ministry officials said the decision to increase the gap between two doses of Covishield from four-six weeks to 12-16 weeks was taken by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI) based on scientific data and for providing optimal protection from the infectious disease. "Vaccines are provided in an uniform manner for the population and are not being offered on the basis of one's paying capacity," an official said. The Single Judge, on September 3, directed the Centre to allow scheduling, on the CoWIN portal, of the second Covishield dose after four weeks from the first for those who want to take it earlier than the present suggested gap of 84 days. Justice P B Suresh Kumar had said that if the Central and State governments can permit persons travelling abroad to choose between early and better protection from COVID-19, there is no reason why the same privilege cannot be extended to those here who want early protection in connection with their employment or education. On this, the Centre, in its appeal, said it had offered relaxations in favour of certain persons who were a separate class by themselves and for valid reasons and Kitex cannot claim parity with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-files-plea-against-allowing-second-dose-of-covishield-earlier-says-it-will-derail-policy/articleshow/86438137.cms||---
---||Business||Fed policymakers see upward march in interest rates starting next year||NEW YORK: Half of Federal Reserve policymakers now expect to start raising interest rates next year and think rates should rise to at least 1% by the end of 2023, reflecting a growing consensus that gradually tighter policy will be needed to keep inflation in check. The swifter pace of interest rate hikes from policymakers' last set of projections in June comes amid the fastest economic recovery in US history after a brief recession last year and robust debate at the Fed about balancing its maximum employment and 2% average inflation goals. The Fed on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight lending rate in the current target range of 0% to 0.25%, where it has remained since March 2020 when the US economy was buffeted by the onset of the pandemic. The new economic projections released alongside the policy statement showed nine of 18 Fed policymakers now foresee a liftoff in interest rates next year, compared to seven in June. All but one saw at least one interest rate needed by the end of 2023, and nine saw the need to target rates at least as high as between 1% and 1.25% by then. By 2024, the median rate forecast was for 1.8% - still below the 2.5% level they estimate neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth over the long run and therefore broadly accommodative of further job gains. That's despite policymakers' forecast for inflation to remain above the Fed's 2% target through 2024. Combined, it's new fodder for understanding how the Fed intends to carry out its new policy framework, under which it will aim for inflation to remain moderately above its 2% target for "some time." US gross domestic product at the median is projected to grow 5.9% this year and 3.8% in 2022, compared to forecasts in June of 7.0% in 2021 and 3.3% next year. The unemployment rate is seen falling to 4.8% this year and to 3.8% in 2022. The pace of price increases is expected to rise to 4.2% this year, higher than forecast in June, although Fed policymakers see it declining to 2.2% in 2022 and 2.1% by 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/fed-policymakers-see-upward-march-in-interest-rates-starting-next-year/articleshow/86438518.cms||---
---||Delhi||Most diners now prefer ‘vaccinated restaurants’||Looking at a restaurant’s ratings or location before choosing to dine out has been a common practice with diners, but now there’s a new criterion that’s been added to the list – adherence to safety norms and a fully vaccinated staff. A recent report by a dining out and restaurant tech platform, Dineout, states that consumer now prefer ‘vaccinated restaurants’. The report added that out of 50,000 outlets across 20 cities listed on the platform, around 67% outlets have fully vaccinated staff. These outlets have contributed to 72% of the total business in August, with Ludhiana, Kolkata, Jaipur, Lucknow, Delhi and Bangalore boasting of the highest percentage of dining out at vaccinated outlets. ‘As compared to February, people are more confident about stepping out for dining now’According to the report, Delhi, Kolkata and Hyderabad have shown the maximum recovery among metros, with Delhi and Kolkata outlets doing two times the business as compared to February (before restaurants were shut during the COVID second wave). The average order value at restaurants (ATV) in July-August has also increased by as much as 20% since February. Restaurants say that when they reopened after the COVID second wave, the footfall has been consistent with hours of waiting on weekends. “Last time, there was a lot of fear in the market and it took a while for people to start stepping out. However, this time we saw that as soon as restaurants reopened, customers were eager to step out. Also, this time guests and staff are vaccinated which makes it a safer experience for all,” says Avantika Sinha Bahl, founder Kampai and Mai Bao. Amit Bagga, co-founder, Daryaganj, adds, “There is a difference in business and footfall as people are getting out much more than earlier and are also more confident to go to places which have vaccinated staff.” “It’s hard to gauge in terms of numbers but the steady rise of footfall over last month is indicative of the fact that both patrons and staff being vaccinated creates a safe environment for all. We’ve seen a marked difference. It’s probably a combination of vaccinated staff, impeccable safety protocol, hygiene measures, and more confidence in people about how to keep themselves safe,” says Amit Rekhi, partner, Music & Mountains. Read Also‘Lifting deadline restriction will help speed up revival of the beleaguered restaurant industry’, say Delhi restaurateursAfter Gurgaon, Delhi restaurants and bars can now remain open without any closing time restrictions.‘We make our staff wear a badge that says ‘I am vaccinated’’Restaurateurs agree that ‘vaccinated staff’ and other safety norms are as much a priority for guests as the food quality. “Vaccinated staff has definitely helped in improving consumer sentiment and in making consumers feel safer. This is also one of the key reasons behind such a strong recovery for the industry this time around,” says Zorawar Kalra, director, Massive Restaurants. “Our staff wears a badge which says ‘I’m vaccinated’. Once the guest notices that they immediately feel more relaxed and safer. We got our entire staff vaccinated the moment we reopened for the safety of our guests as well as our staff,” adds Avantika Sinha Bahl, founder Kampai and Mai Bao. Having a vaccinated staff is now a pre-requisite to sustain business, say restaurant owners. “Guests are more conscious and aware than before and the focus on safety is more than ever, even while more people are stepping out. In present situation, any restaurant has to have a vaccinated staff to have a steady footfall and sustain business,” says Naresh Madan, one of the directors of Imperfecto.

---||Delhi||A five-star hotel chef by day and criminal by night||Take a five-star hotel chef, add a tadka of trained athlete-level running skills and a dash of chain-snatching, mix the three together and what you get... is a pretty bizarre crime case. For the last two months, police stations in south Delhi have been receiving complaints of snatching from women who were commuting or walking alone in the evening. They described the perpetrator as a “5’5’’- 5’6’’-tall, lean-built, fair man in sneakers, who ran like a trained athlete” – a profile that doesn’t match that of conventional chain-snatchers in the city, who operate in gangs and on bikes. It left the authorities thinking daal mein definitely kuch kaala hai, but what followed was even weirder. After scanning footage of snatching incidents from over 200 footages of CCTV cameras, police officials of the south district noticed that in multiple such cases, the snatcher was wearing a neon-green T-shirt. That’s what led them to the 35-year-old Harish Chauhan – chef of a five-star hotel at IGI airport. Atul Thakur, DCP South, says, “The chef worked during the afternoon shift and after it got over, he’d scout for targets. He mostly targeted single women in dimly lit areas and in parks. In some cases, women were with their husbands, but were not walking together. After snatching gold chains or phones, he’d run and start shouting ‘pakdo pakdo’, so that onlookers would assume that he is a samaritan going after a snatcher. In psychology, it is called projection.” From kitchen to crimeAuthorities said the chef used to operate alone in areas like Saket Metro Station and the adjoining park, the Ambedkar Nagar bus stand on MB Road, and Mehrauli. The DCP says, “Our special team got leads after scanning footage of CCTV cameras and laid a trap. He was carrying a pistol with him and tried to whip out his pistol when police captured him.” After graduating from DU in 2006, Chauhan did a three-year hotel management course from Pusa. So, how did he end up with this unlikely criminal side gig? The DCP tells us, “For the last two years, he started online betting and gambling through apps and was in huge debt. He told us that he started snatching in the last two-three months to pay off these debts. He has never been caught before. Further investigation is on.” The police have also arrested a jeweller, Rajender Aggarwal, 60, from Neb Sarai, who allegedly purchased the gold chains from the chef.

---||World||Explained: Why the debt limit is again roiling Washington||WASHINGTON: The idea of the United States government breaching its "debt limit" sounds scary. But what, exactly, are lawmakers in Washington fighting about?  The debt limit is a nearly century-old artificial cap that Congress placed on the US government's ability to borrow. Lawmakers have raised or suspended it nearly 80 times since 1960, but there is a deepening partisan standoff this time, underscoring how the debt limit has evolved into a political weapon.  House Democrats voted Tuesday to suspend the debt limit through the end of 2022. That proposal is likely to meet fierce resistance in the evenly-split Senate, where Republican lawmakers say President Joe Biden and the Democrats in power should go it alone as they also try to move on a multitrillion-dollar package of tax increases on the wealthy and new spending on children, health care, infrastructure and the environment.  The Biden administration insists on bipartisanship on the issue.  "It is not a partisan issue to want to protect the full faith and credit of the United States," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday aboard Air Force One.  The issue is time-sensitive because the extraordinary measures used by the Treasury Department to keep the government running would be exhausted in October. If Congress fails to act, it creates the possibility of a default that could send financial markets crashing and the economy plunging into a recession. The House-passed bill also ties the suspension to a measure that would continue to fund the federal government through Dec. 3.  Republicans, despite their refusal to help, agree with Democrats that a default must be avoided.  "America must never default - we never have and we never will," Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell declared Wednesday as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase.  Here is an explainer on the problem: Why is there a debt limit? Before World War I, Congress needed to approve each bond issuance. The debt limit was created as a workaround to finance the war effort without needing a constant series of votes.  Since then, a tool created to make it easier for the government to function has become a source of dysfunction, stoking partisan warfare and creating economic risk as the debt has increased in size over the past 20 years.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that annual budget deficits of $1 trillion or more will be routine for the next decade, so the issue will be recurring. The debt rose in large part to fund the recoveries from the Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic. The imbalance over the coming years increasingly reflects government expenses for programs such as Medicare and Social Security that are outstripping tax revenues. How big is the limit? The cap is now $28.4 trillion. During the Trump administration, the debt limit was suspended three times. The last suspension - passed on a bipartisan basis in 2019, when the debt stood at $22 trillion - ended in July.  The Treasury Department has since been engaging in what it calls extraordinary measures to keep the government operating.  The $28.4 trillion debt is bigger than the yearly U.S. gross domestic product. The Biden administration and congressional Democrats say the next debt limit suspension should be bipartisan because it applies to previous spending approved by the government. It's akin to paying a credit card bill, and a signal to the financial markets that the United States will be fiscally responsible.  Estimates from Moody's Analytics say that a potential recession from government cuts if the cap stays in place could lead to 6 million job losses and stock market declines that could eliminate $15 trillion of household wealth. Why do republicans oppose an increase? Put simply, they're out of power and they dislike Biden's policy agenda.  While the administration notes that the debt ceiling reflects prior spending choices, McConnell and the Republicans are linking any increase to Biden's multitrillion-dollar plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations in order to fund programmes and tax breaks that could aid the middle class. McConnell has said the tax hikes would ultimately hurt the middle class and lead to a "socialist" transformation of the country.  "Democrats control the Senate, the House, and the White House," McConnell said Wednesday. "If they want to ram through another reckless taxing and spending spree that hurts working families and helps China without any Republican input, they will need to raise the debt limit on their own".  Democrats helped Republicans suspend the debt limit when Republicans controlled Congress. After Democrats retook the House in 2019, Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated a broader spending package with the Trump administration that included a debt-ceiling hike. Who to blame for the rising debt? Everyone.  The debt limit was suspended three times under Trump, who used debt to fund his 2017 tax cuts and then needed to borrow even more when the economy tanked last year with the Covid-19. Both Biden and Obama took office amid weakened economies and passed ambitious aid packages that required the government to borrow more.  Investors enabled Congress to run higher deficits because low interest rates made it easier to fund the government through debt. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes are lower now than in fiscal 2001, when the government last ran an annual surplus.  Polling by the Pew Research Center suggests voters became less concerned about the debt as the pandemic raged. Just 47% last year said the deficit was a "very big problem," down from 55% in 2018. Why not just get rid of the limit? One easy fix would be to completely repeal the debt limit so that it can no longer be used as leverage in congressional fights.  That step would allow the spending and taxes approved by Congress and the president to determine how much debt the government issues, instead of a legally binding but otherwise superfluous cap. A Biden administration official, insisting on anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the White House would only weigh in on the elimination if Congress showed there was support for the idea.  There is some bipartisan backing among those who have previously dealt with this challenge. Harvard University professor Jason Furman, formerly the top economist in Obama's White House, and Rohit Kumar, a former aide to McConnell, advocated for removing the cap in a 2017 Wall Street Journal op-ed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explained-why-the-debt-limit-is-again-roiling-washington/articleshow/86440068.cms||---

---||India||Admit women to NDA from this year itself: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday made it clear that a beginning, even though small, has to be made this year itself for the induction of female candidates into the National Defence Academy (NDA), and this could not be postponed till next year as sought by the Centre, which said it needed time till May 2022 to set up infrastructure and formulate a training module for female cadets. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai agreed with the Centre that making arrangements for female cadets needs time but said that it was not so complex that it could not be done. The bench said it cannot vacate its order for allowing female aspirants to take the entrance examination scheduled for November after giving them hope to get into the NDA and said that at least a few of them should be selected this year after qualifying the exam and fulfilling all the criteria. The bench left it for the Centre and the defence forces to take a call on how many women should be inducted in the first batch and whether they need an additional campus for separate training or could work along with their male counterparts. Pinning hope on the defence forces to do the needful expeditiously, the bench said the forces were the country's best response team to deal with any emergency situation and they could easily meet expectations in this case too. "We appreciate your problem but you are capable of finding a solution. We fully appreciate your endeavour but what we are finding difficult to understand is to postpone (the induction process). Let them take the exam this year itself. We do not want to deny them (female aspirants) once we have given them hope," the bench said. The court said that not many women would apply for the examination and may be very few would finally qualify for the admission and it would not be difficult to make arrangements for them this year. "Let the process begin. This is a transition phase and the best arrangements are not possible this year and it will get better next year. It is a big decision taken by the defence forces and a beginning must be made this year itself. You can start with a few seats for women and you can increase the intake from next year… let’s make a small beginning," it said. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, sought time till May next year and assured that the system could be put in place before the UPSC issues notification for the NDA entrance examination in May 2022. But the bench turned down her plea and asked her to make efforts to induct female candidates from this year's exam itself. Seeking more time, the Centre contended that medical standards for male cadets are in place but appropriate standards for women are in the process of formulation and it had to be done before the induction starts. It said one of the key facets of accommodation of female cadets had to be a robust physical separation between male and female residential areas. Arrangements had to made to accommodate women within the campus and additional infrastructure had to be built. It said that deliberate planning and meticulous preparation was needed to ensure smooth induction and seamless training of such female candidates. The Centre and the defence forces had earlier agreed to open the doors of the NDA, which has been a male bastion since its inception, for female aspirants, bringing to an end another gender wall within the defence establishment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/admit-women-to-nda-from-this-year-itself-supreme-court/articleshow/86440439.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Amarinder, who had stepped down as CM four days ago citing repeated humiliation by the party, reiterated that he was keeping his “options open” about his political future. He said his objective was to prevent Sidhu from becoming chief minister at the cost of his own career, including “any sacrifice to save the country from such a dangerous man”.

On allegations of inaccessibility when he was chief minister, Amarinder said he had been elected to the assembly seven times and twice to Parliament. “There must be something right with me,” he said, adding that the Congress leadership had evidently decided on making the change (in Punjab) and were trying to build a case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/captain-amarinder-singh-will-sacrifice-anything-to-stop-sidhu-from-becoming-cm/articleshow/86441184.cms||---
---||India||Government fixes Rs 50,000 ex- gratia for kin of Covid victims||NEW DELHI: Months after states took the lead in announcing financial assistance for the kin of Covid victims, and after being prodded by the Supreme Court, the Centre on Wednesday informed the SC that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has fixed an ex gratia of Rs 50,000 to be paid by the states from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). On June 30, the SC had ruled that the Centre cannot shy away from its responsibility under the Disaster Management Act to fix a compensation amount payable to the kin of those who succumbed to Covid, which was declared a national disaster under the Act. While rejecting petitioners’ demand for Rs 4 lakh ex gratia, it had asked the NDMA to determine the quantum within six weeks and said that the amounts to be paid from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and SDRF would be over and above the ex gratia paid by states. The six-week deadline got extended to months and after seeking time several times, the Centre on Wednesday informed that the NDMA has fixed Rs 50,000 ex gratia. Claimants have to submit an application to receive the relief, it said, adding that those eligible would get the amount through the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). With the country recording nearly 4.5 lakh Covid deaths, the financial burden of this will add up to Rs 2,250 crore for states, though funds for the SDRF are largely released by the Centre. The top 10 states reporting the most Covid deaths are Maharashtra (1.38 lakh), Karnataka (37,000), Tamil Nadu (35,000), Delhi (25,000), UP (23,000), Kerala (22,500), West Bengal (19,000), Punjab (16,000), Andhra Pradesh (14,000) and Chhattisgarh (13,500). Justifying the modest amount fixed by the NDMA, the Centre said, "Covid-19 is a disaster that has not abated. The number of deaths continues to rise. There is uncertainty about the new variants of the virus and likely future waves. Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain the total final financial burden emanating from the ex gratia. Financial prudence demands that we plan in a manner that assistance can be provided to a larger number of people should the number of deaths rise." "The state governments have already been incurring large expenditure from the SDRF on various aspects of Covid-19 prevention, management and response. In addition, the central government, from the national Budget, has announced several measures to prevent Covid-19 (nationwide vaccination drive) as well as to provide relief assistance to those affected by Covid-19. State governments have also announced welfare measures from state budgets. So, in effect, some financial and material assistance has already been provided in different forms to some of the most vulnerable sections," it said, adding that money has to be kept aside for assistance to people suffering from other natural disasters. States had taken the lead in providing ex gratia to the kin of Covid victims, not from the SDRF but from other sources like the chief minister’s relief fund. Those providing ex gratia are Andhra Pradesh (Rs 10 lakh to orphaned children, Rs 5 lakh in case of death of one parent), Bihar (Rs 4 lakh), Haryana (Rs 2 lakh only to BPL families), Karnataka and Assam (Rs 1 lakh), Tamil Nadu (Rs 5 lakh to orphaned children and Rs 3 lakh in case of death of single parent), Tripura (Rs 10 lakh in three instalments) and Nagaland (Rs 10 lakh only to the kin of working journalists). The Centre had on June 30 informed the court that Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and J&K were not providing any ex gratia. It said the Delhi government’s Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Arthik Sahayata Yojna has promised Rs 50,000 to kin of Covid victims. "The scheme will be executed through the digital mode only and an online platform in this regard is being developed. Till June 22 no compensation has been paid under this scheme," it said. The scheme also envisaged an additional monthly pension of Rs 2,500 if the deceased was the sole bread-earner of the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-fixes-rs-50000-ex-gratia-for-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/86441526.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Biden tries to heal Democrats' divide on his spending plans||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden met on Wednesday with the warring wings of his Democratic Party in an effort to save his troubled economic plans.  The White House said Biden is holding three meetings with two dozen members of Congress as he dives in to try and settle an internal party squabble threatening to sink his ambitious social spending and infrastructure agenda.  One meeting featured the two most powerful Democrats, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Both are close Biden allies but are struggling to get their ranks in line behind the economic plans.  Biden was then scheduled to meet with a group of moderate Democrats, including senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema who have got cold feet about the huge price tag.  Pointedly, the president was then to meet separately with Congress members on the left of the party, such as Senator Bernie Sanders. There was apparently no plan to bring the two sides around the same table.  "This is an important moment. We're in a pivotal period of our negotiations and discussions," Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters. "He sees his role as uniting and bringing people together."  Biden and the leftist legislators back quick passage of a $3.5 trillion package addressing climate change, child care and education. The vast proposals would fundamentally improve the lives of ordinary Americans left behind in an increasingly unequal economy, Biden says.  However, Manchin is among those calling the price too high, instead backing something far less than half the total.  Republicans are in no mood to help on the social spending plan, although they could vote for a separate smaller bill funding transport and other traditional infrastructure.  With the Democrats having only a razor-thin majority in Congress, the disunity threatens to bring down the entire agenda, sucking the energy out of Biden's presidency.  Biden is "encouraged" that the pace of talks is picking up and ready to compromise, Psaki said.  He has "always been open to negotiations and discussions and knew he was not going to be able to wave a magic wand."  Pelosi, speaking after her meeting with the president, said the bill was "on schedule."  "We are calm and everybody's good and our work is almost done," she told reporters.  However, the clock is also running out as Congress simultaneously squabbles on a vote to increase the government's borrowing limit, an impasse that could trigger a US debt default and deliver a bad shock to markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-tries-to-heal-democrats-divide-on-his-spending-plans/articleshow/86441710.cms||---
---||Business||Facebook's technology head Mike Schroepfer to step down||Longtime Facebook executive Mike Schroepfer said on Wednesday that he was stepping down as the company's chief technology officer.  Schroepfer said in a Facebook post that veteran leader Andrew Bosworth, who heads up the social media company's augmented reality and virtual reality efforts, including products like its Oculus Quest VR headset, will take over the role in 2022.  Schroepfer, who is known as "Schrep" and spent 13 years at Facebook, said he would transition to a part-time role as the company's first Senior Fellow sometime next year.  Bosworth, or "Boz," created Facebook's AR/VR organization, which was renamed Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) in 2020.  "As our next CTO, Boz will continue leading Facebook Reality Labs and overseeing our work in augmented reality, virtual reality and more, and as part of this transition a few other groups will join Boz's team as well," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a message to employees that was posted on Facebook's blog.  "This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I'm excited about the future of this work under Boz's leadership," he said, referring to the Silicon Valley idea of shared spaces that merge the digital and physical worlds and can be accessed through different devices.  Facebook is under pressure from global regulators, lawmakers and civil society groups who have criticized it over abuses on its platform such as extremism and misinformation and want it to improve on a slew of issues including transparency, its content moderation and recommendation systems, and its approaches to user privacy and safety.  The company has been pushing its role in building an embodied internet, or "metaverse," which Zuckerberg is betting will be the next big computing platform.  In July, the company said it was creating a new product team to work on these ambitions, as part of Facebook Reality Labs.  Zuckerberg said Schroepfer's new role would include helping the company recruit and develop technical talent and foster investments in artificial intelligence.  Other central leaders who have left the company in recent months include the head of Facebook's main app, Fidji Simo, who left to become Instacart CEO, and global ads chief Carolyn Everson, who was hired as the start-up's president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebooks-technology-head-mike-schroepfer-to-step-down/articleshow/86441982.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Narendra Giri died of asphyxia, says autopsy||The post-mortem examination report of Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Narendra Giri on Wednesday revealed that the seer had died of “asphyxia due to hanging” – a conclusion that adds weight to the theory that the mahant died by suicide. His disciple Anand Giri and Bade Hanuman temple priest Adya Prasad Tiwari were formally arrested on charges of abetment to suicide and produced before a Prayagraj court, which sent them to 14-day judicial custody. Both Anand Giri and Tiwari were taken into custody within hours of the seer’s death and were questioned after the 14-page suicide note held them responsible for “compelling” Narendra Giri to take the drastic step. Body of Narendra Giri was found hanging from the ceiling of his room at Shri Math Baghambari Gaddi in Prayagraj on Monday evening. On the basis of the suicide note, Uttar Pradesh police sought help of their Uttarakhand counterpart to detain Anand Giri in Haridwar and brought him to Prayagraj while Tiwari was also picked up along with his son. Sources privy to the findings of the autopsy report, that was conducted by a panel of five doctors at Prayagraj’s SRN hospital and the entire exercise videographed, said no external injury marks were found on the body of Narendra Giri, which further strengthened the suicide theory. “The post-mortem examination report has confirmed a V mark on the neck of the Mahant, which is caused by hanging,” sources said. The doctors who conducted the post-mortem have directed for the viscera to be preserved for chemical analysis – something that is done routinely to rule out other possibilities. Police sources said the fact that the preliminary examination of the scene of crime did not lead the investigators to any signs of struggle or resistance put up by Narendra Giri only reduces possibilities of any foul play. “In such a situation, the only possibility of foul play would be that the victim is forced to hang himself or sedated and then hanged. The condition of the room in which the body was found hanging did not show signs of struggle,” said a senior police officer in the know of investigations into the mahant’s death. Investigators believe that forensic analysis of the suicide note will further clear the air over the circumstances that led to the ABAP chief’s death. “If handwriting of the suicide note matches with that of Narendra Giri, it will further consolidate the suicide theory,” the officer said. He, however, refused to conclusively declare the death as a suicide on grounds that investigations were still underway. The SIT had also sent the nylon string which was used by the seer to allegedly hang himself in the room for a forensic examination. Guards of the seer in his Y-security were also questioned in connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/narendra-giri-died-of-asphyxia-says-autopsy/articleshow/86441922.cms||Kapil Dixit

Stalin also set a target of $100 billion in exports by 2030 from the present $26 billion. “We literally need to quadruple growth on all fronts to achieve the $1 trillion target. The state needs to grow at around 14% y-o-y to make it a reality,” a senior state government official said. Besides the thrust on exports for which a state export promotion committee will soon be formed, TN is focusing on emerging sectors as well as core strengths. “Services sector will be a major focus area. Everything connected with FinTech (financial technology), including a FinTech policy and a FinTech city, will receive our focus. On the IT and ITeS front, we will push it in a much bigger way in Tier 2 & Tier 3 as well as rural areas,” the official said. Emerging sectors such as aerospace and defence, e-vehicles, electronic manufacturing and petrochemicals, and traditional sectors such as textiles and leather will get a thrust. Non-leather footwear is another emerging area for the state. “The MoU we signed with Mohib group, which has tied up with a Taiwanese group, alone will generate employment for 23,000 people, mostly women, with an investment of just Rs 225 crore. Women employment will get a boost through textiles and footwear sectors. We have to do a lot more on the training front, besides polytechnics and ITIs,” the official added. MSMEs contribute about 30% of the country’s GDP, and could do the same, if not more, in the state. “MSMEs can grow better only through cluster approach. We have recently announced five mega industrial clusters for MSMEs in select sectors such as aerospace & defence, pharmaceutical, petrochemical, precision manufacturing and e-vehicle manufacturing. Each cluster will be developed with an investment of Rs 100 crore and will surely emerge as growth centres in a few years,” state MSME secretary Arun Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-inks-2200cr-worth-24-mous-targets-100bn-export-by-2030/articleshow/86442052.cms||D Govardan
---||Kolkata||PM2.5 in Kolkata air 9.4 times new WHO limit||KOLKATA: The challenge to meet permissible air quality standards in Kolkata got tougher on Wednesday with World Health Organisation (WHO) making the guidelines more stringent, claiming it had evidence that air pollution damaged human health at lower concentrations than previously understood. The last guideline was set in 2005. On Wednesday, WHO lowered all permissible standards, including annual mean of PM2.5 from 10µg/m3 to 5µg/m3, 24-hour average from 25µg/m3 to 15µg/m3, annual PM10 from 20µg/m3 to 15µg/m3 and 24-hour average from 50µg/m3 to 45µg/m3. Annual mean of NO2 was lowered from 40µg/m3 to 10µg/m3. The only exception was SO2 — its 24-hour average was increased from 20µg/m3 to 40µg/m3. Kolkata’s annual mean PM2.5 level in 2020 at 47µg/m3 was 9.4 times the new permissible limit. Kolkata, which features among 100 most polluted cities in the world, ranks only below Delhi among Indian metros. Track the pollution level in your cityGlobal environment action group Greenpeace observed that the Indian national standard remains far more relaxed, allowing release of higher pollutants. Annual average of PM2.5 at 40µg/m3 is eight times less stringent than WHO’s and the 24-hour average standard is four times less stringent. “Human health is not determined by the variation in permissible standards between WHO and India. As a medical practitioner, I should go by the WHO standard, which is scientifically calibrated and evidence-based,” said pulmonologist Arup Haldar. According to the ‘December 2020 Lancet Planetary Health Report’, pollution claimed 1.2 lakh lives in 2019 and caused an economic loss of around Rs 15,516 crore. In South Asia, where air pollution levels are consistently high, these new guidelines will bring renewed interest in the topic and create an opportunity to push for stronger action. Over 90% of the world’s population lives in areas that exceed the limits for key air pollutants set by WHO. Unfortunately for South Asia, this is approximately 100%. “There are no two ways about the need to revise India’s air quality standards to make them more stringent. Even at the current relaxed standard of 40µg/m3 for annual PM2.5 average in India vs WHO’s 2005 annual limit of 10µg/m3, most Indian cities failed to meet the requirement. We also have to strengthen health data and revise the National Clean Air Programme. Raw health data is required to conduct a large range of health studies vis-a-vis air pollution impacts for India’s varied demography, exposure and differing PM2.5 composition. A single exposure prevention response will not suit the Indian population.” said S N Tripathi, professor, IIT-Kanpur and Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, India. “Fossil fuels are the root cause of both air pollution and the climate crisis. Governments across South Asian countries need to urgently align their national air quality standards with the latest WHO guidelines and take a regional approach, keeping health at the heart of actions to tackle the crisis. The time to act was yesterday, but we missed it. For the sake of future generations, we need to commit to do everything it takes to solve this as early as possible,” said Arvind Kumar, founder, Lung Care Foundation & Chairman, Institute of Chest Surgery, Chest Onco Surgery and Lung Transplantation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pm2-5-in-city-air-9-4-times-new-who-limit/articleshow/86436831.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Speaking after the RCD’s presentation on some of its flagship projects, Nitish said the state government has taken up several major projects for development of road infrastructure in the state. Construction works on most of the projects are going on, while some of them are pending. “The road projects which are pending for different reasons should be expedited and completed. All the departments concerned should work in proper coordination to complete the projects,” Nitish told the officials. He also asked them to work on a priority basis on the ‘Sulabh Samparkta’ component of the ‘Saat Nischay Part-2’ programme to increase road connectivity in different areas and regions of the state. The CM further asked the officials to ensure proper maintenance of old roads, besides construction of new ones. Earlier, RCD’s additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit made a detailed presentation on some flagship road projects, including the Munger rail-cum-road bridge project, Mithapur-Mahuli elevated road project and the Atal Path phase-2. Pratyaya was recently given charge of the RCD after his predecessor Amrit Lal Meena went on the central deputation. When contacted, Pratyaya on Wednesday told TOI that he made a presentation before the CM on the current status of some flagship road projects before beginning his new innings in the RCD. Earlier also, Pratyaya had worked as secretary in the RCD. “Tomorrow, I am going to Munger to make an on-the-spot review of the Munger rail-cum-road bridge over Ganga river. It is one of the flagship projects of the RCD. During the review, we will find out the bottlenecks (if any) and make sure the project is completed within the shortest possible time,” Pratyaya said over phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-work-on-all-flagship-road-projects-nitish/articleshow/86434366.cms||Madan Kumar

Pre-Covid, his salary was Rs 30,000 per month, which now stands at Rs 25,000 per month. He doesn't complain, not only because he knows the market situation, but also because for almost a year, he was without a job when his company decided to downsize the team during the Corona lockdown. But, what he does complain about is the situation he is in, with his income considerably down and expenses surging by the day. “At one point of time, in this small salary I was able to manage my routine expenses, Rs 3000 installment against the loan for a two-wheeler, my two children’s school fee (which is not much) and house rent of Rs 9,000. My wife used to take tuitions for school children and she also contributed in keeping things smooth. Now, my salary has come down, tuition classes of my wife are off and prices of fuel and essential goods are constantly rising. I don't know what to do? And, as it happens when you are living in such conditions, my wife and I fight over issues, which never cropped up earlier", said Rishi. He lamented that routine expense on fuel, grocery, vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs and medicines has also increased drastically."In the last two years, there has been an overall increase of 25 to 30 percent of these products. One litre edible oil, which we sold at Rs 85 per litre is now selling at Rs 150 per litre. Sugar prices have gone up by Rs 300 per quintal in the wholesale market in just one month. Sugar, which was selling for Rs 3650 per quintal last month is now Rs 3950 per quintal.

A 280 litres per minute oxygen plant has been set up at the Commonwealth Games Covid Care Centre in east Delhi. Students of SRCC’s Enactus Society collected funds by reaching out to their alumni and other DU colleges and collaborated with Doctors for You for the oxygen plant. The students raised Rs 35 lakh within just 20 days. This plant, which can cater to 30-40 patients at a time, would be installed at a permanent government healthcare facility post the pandemic. SRCC alumnus and former Union minister of youth affairs and sports, Vijay Goel, was a part of the inauguration. Simrit Kaur, SRCC principal, said, “My gratitude towards the contribution of one Rupee or a lakh is equal. It’s the thought that counts, not the amount. Sunil Kumar, nodal officer, CWG Covid Care Centre, explained the journey of converting the place into a healthcare facility. “The efforts of the students bear testimony to our collective spirit and their work shall act as a source of inspiration for many others,” he added. “The values, ethics and life skills of students is what makes a premier institution and it has been proved by the students of SRCC,” said Rajat Jain from Doctors For You. Arushi Mahajan, Enactus president, said, “Our college administration was very supportive and reached out to the alumni. We also campaigned in other DU colleges.” During the lockdown, the students had also distributed rations in a few slums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/srcc-students-set-up-o2-plant-at-cwg-covid-care-centre-in-e-delhi/articleshow/86438931.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Two, including a TTE, held for conning 57 people of Rs 8 crore||VIJAYAWADA: Two persons, one of them working as a TTE with Indian railways, were arrested by Suryaraopet police on Wednesday for allegedly cheating 57 people to the tune of Rs 8 crore. The accused were identified as K Simhadri Nagamani, alias Mounika (46) from Tuni town in East Godavari district, and Sandrana Venkateswara Rao, who works as a travelling ticket examiner with Indian railways. Additional DCP Babu Rao said main accused Nagamani and her partner Rao lured and cheated several persons by promising them gold at a cheaper rate. Nagamani, who got estranged from her husband in 2006, met Rao in Vijayawada and they have been living together in an apartment in Suryaraopet for the past 13 years. The couple thought of targeting gullible people to earn quick money. “Their first target was a security guard working in Kanaka Durga temple. The woman introduced Rao as a customs officer and told the victim they belong to a zamindar family which owned a lot of gold. The duo offered to sell gold at a much cheaper rate compared to market price. The man handed over Rs 1.32 lakh, a bulk of his savings, to Nagamani and they asked him to refer others to earn a commission. A number of colleagues of Rao too fell victim to the scam,” the DCP said. When cops checked the bank accounts of the accused, it was found that they transacted around Rs 14.2 crore across six bank accounts since 2014. Rao also lost Rs 1.32 crore to gambling on an online rummy platform. Cops suspect they earned over Rs 8 crore from the gold scam alone. Nagamani was found to be a habitual offender and had earlier cheated people in East Godavari in a chit fund scam. A total of seven cases was found to have been registered against them in the past. A fresh case has been registered at Suryaraopet police station. The couple targeted gullible people to earn quick money. They lured their victims by promising them gold at a cheaper rate.

Vikash Ranjan (36) was shot dead outside his office at Rosera in Samastipur on November 25, 2008. “Ranjan was killed over property dispute with his relatives and exposing irregularities committed by his relatives in their wholesale medicine business,” additional public prosecutor Ram Kumar told TOI over the phone. He said the hearing on a title suit between Ranjan and his uncle over ancestral property had begun just four days before his murder. Kumar also said irregularities had been found in the raids conducted on the wholesale medicine shop owned by Ranjan’s relatives following his news item published in the daily. Altogether 14 persons, including the LJP leader Swayamwar Yadav and one Mohan Yadav, were pronounced guilty by the court of ADJ Rajiv Ranjan Sahay on September 15. However, Mohan evaded arrest after the court verdict. Swayamwar is a local LJP leader. His wife is a former mukhiya. The court sentenced rigorous life imprisonment to rest 13 on Wednesday. The APP said besides Swayamwar, Ranjan’s uncle Umakant Choudhary, Vidhan Chandra Rai, Rajiv Ranjan alias Guddu, Priyaranjan alias Tinnu, Manoj Kumar Choudhary, Manendra Kumar Choudhary, Ram Uday Rai, Rajiv Rai, Sanjeev Rai, Krishna Kumar Yadav alias Barku Yadav, Bablu Singh and Santosh Anand Singh have been convicted. Rajiv Rai and his brother Sanjeev Rai owned the medicine shop, which had been raided. The court also imposed a fine of Rs20,000 on each of the convicts. In case of failure to pay the fine, they will have to undergo six more months of simple imprisonment. “One of the accused, Lalit Yadav, died in the course of trial. The court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Mohan. Trial against two more accused are still going on. Krishna is already serving life imprisonment in another murder case,” Kumar said. He said Ranjan’s diary seized by the police and his call detail record were crucial exhibits in the case. “Ranjan used to write a diary. Police found the names of people who had threatened him and the reason mentioned in the diary. Besides Krishna, Santosh, Mohan and Lalit also gave confessional statements on the basis of which police had gathered further evidence and made arrests,” he said. The APP said 15 prosecution witnesses were examined in the course of trial. “All had deposed favouring the prosecution case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/13-get-life-sentence-in-journo-murder-case/articleshow/86434527.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Just like SP (Samajwadi Party in UP) has red cap, RJD should have a green cap. Wherever you people go, put it on,” Lalu said while virtually addressing from Delhi the party’s district and block presidents, secretary generals of South Bihar on the second day of their training camp. Lalu’s wife and RJD vice-president Rabri Devi also advised her party workers to put the party flag at their homes. The RJD chief was all praise for his younger son and leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Lalu said people of Bihar as well as the members of RJD have accepted Tejashwi’s leadership. “People who come to meet me also praise Tejashwi’s progress,” he said. Lalu also commended the work and dedication of RJD state president Jagadanand Singh and recalled their old association. However, he never mentioned his elder son Tej Pratap, who had recently made vitriolic attack on Singh and the party. Tej was absent from this training camp. Imparting political skills to the RJD members, Lalu asked booth level agents to remain vigilant, check the EVMs and keep a track of them. He advised the RJD workers to remain loyal and said how few people switch sides when they are denied the ticket. They even start campaigning against their own party candidates. “That’s not good,” he said. Appreciating the idea of organizing such training camps, Lalu cited the examples of Left parties like CPI and CPM, which hold training camps for their cadres every year. He asked his own party men to continue with such practice. He also talked about the importance of caste census, inflation and problems faced by the people due to Covid-19. He promised party workers to visit each district of Bihar once his health improves. The party workers present in the two-day camp were told about the importance of social media and asked to connect to the people. They were also given books, including Lalu’s biography ‘Gopalganj To Raisina’ and another on Ram Manohar Lohia’s ideology. Another two-day training camp will be held before Navaratra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-asks-rjd-workers-to-be-loyal/articleshow/86434624.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The other named accused are Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore, former Speaker late Sandanand Singh and his son Subhanand Mukesh. Kotwali police station SHO Sunil Kumar Singh said the FIR has been registered under Sections 420, 466, 468, 471, 120B and 34 of IPC on the direction of the CJM court. “Further necessary action would be taken as per law and the court’s direction,” he said. Sanjiv, an advocate by profession, had lodged a case before the CJM court in Patna against the six persons alleging that they cheated him of Rs5 crore after he had proposed to contest the Lok Sabha election. The complainant also mentioned in his petition that he is an observer in-charge of AICC for Bihar and Jharkhand with office at room number 11-C on 24, Akbar Road in New Delhi. He also alleged that Tejashwi and Jha had taken Rs5 crore in cash from him on January 15, 2019 at the RJD office on Beerchand Patel Marg in Patna. He further alleged that Tejashwi and his PA had later communicated to him that they will field him and his brother Rajeev Kumar Singh in the assembly election (held last year) in the same amount to contest from Gopalpur and Rupauli seats, but didn’t. Sanjiv also alleged that he was later threatened with a firearm at the RJD office. The advocate had also alleged that he contacted the accused persons several times to get his money returned which they denied, finally, on February 10 this year. Sanjiv also alleged that he had submitted several written complaints to Kotwali police station and other senior police officers, including the DGP, but no action was taken against the accused and he was forced to move the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fir-lodged-against-tejas-congress-leaders/articleshow/86434581.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vadodara||Claim amount for cataract operation cannot be fixed: Vadodara court||VADODARA: A uniform amount for cataract surgeries cannot be assumed or fixed by insurance companies while dealing with claims of insured persons, a court here ruled last week. The Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum turned down the claim of Oriental Insurance Company Ltd and third-party administrator MD India Health Insurance TPA Pvt Ltd’s claim that Rs 24,000 is a reasonable amount for cataract surgery on one eye. The forum was hearing a complaint filed by a resident of Harni Warasia Ring Road, Dr T J Prajapati, who had undergone cataract surgery for his left eye in November 2019. Prajapati incurred an expense of Rs 42,000 for the surgery, but the insurance company and the TPA paid just Rs 24,000. Court stated that ophthalmologists use imported lenses and expensive materials to ensure that cataract surgery is done properly so that the patient’s eye and vision remain healthy. “In such circumstances, the operation expenses may be more. It all depends on which expert is doing the surgery and is using which type of lens and there is no condition in the policy that a specific type of lens can only be used,” the forum stated in the judgment. During the hearing, the opponents’ lawyer submitted that the remaining amount of Rs 18,000 was deducted as per the cataract limit of the policy. It was argued that as per the policy of the insurance company Rs 24,000 can only be considered as reasonable and customary expense for cataract surgery and the expense of Rs 42,000 incurred by Prajapati is excessive. Opposing the insurance company and TPA’s argument, Prajapati’s lawyer told the court that the money was deducted wrongly because Prajapati was never told under which clause of the policy it was done nor any such clause is stated in the policy which he had bought in 2010. The court’s attention was also drawn to the fact that the TPA had deducted the amount and the insurance company did not write any letter to Prajapati informing him that money has been deducted and under which clause. The court upheld the arguments and also went on to note that the insurance company and TPA could not support its claim that Rs 24,000 is a reasonable amount by submitting any expert doctor’s opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/claim-amount-for-cataract-op-cannot-be-fixed-court/articleshow/86434122.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Vijayawada||Rs 1,100 crore NREGS payments already made, govt tells HC||Vijayawada: The state government on Wednesday told the high court that it has made payments to the tune of Rs 1,100 crore towards works done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The government further said it is yet to make payments of Rs 400 crore for the remaining works and is awaiting funds from the Union government. The high court had earlier taken serious note on the issue of non-payment of bills for works done under MGNREGS during the previous government and had summoned panchayatraj principal secretary Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, commissioner Girija Shankar and finance secretary S S Rawat to the court. The officials attended court on Wednesday too. Arguing on behalf of the state government, special government pleader C Sumon told the bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that payments of Rs 415 crore have been made for works worth less than Rs 5 lakh, and Rs 716 crore has been paid for works worth over Rs 5 lakh. Out of the total pendency of around Rs 1,500 crore, payments of over Rs 1,100 crore have already been cleared. However, advocate Narra Srinivas, arguing on behalf of one of the petitioners, said though the government is claiming it has made the payments, his client is yet to receive the money. Clarifying the contention, Sumon told the bench that the money has been credited to the accounts of panchayats and categorical direction has been issued to respective sarpanches to make payments within one week sans which action will be initiated against them. When the court asked additional solicitor general N Haranath on the funds being given to Andhra Pradesh, Haranath told the bench that as per the utilisation certificates submitted, the state is likely to receive Rs 1,100 crore by the month-end. Considering the arguments, the court asked the government to file an affidavit with all details pertaining to funds received and payments made. The court posted the next hearing to October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rs-1100-crore-nregs-payments-already-made-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/86437544.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Chinese master of the ship, MT Qian Tai 1, has been refusing to let the Indian crew board the ship which led to the stalemate. The vessel reached Kakinada on July 8 to discharge 4,000 tons of crude palm oil of and was towed to the anchorage port on July 12 for crew change. However, the ship’s Chinese captain refused to allow the new Indian crew consisting of captain, chief officer, chief engineer, second officer and cook to board the vessel. Sources said after several rounds of consultations, the Chinese captain has agreed to allow the Indian crew. Efforts are on to bring an end to the stalemate by the end of this month. After payment of salary arrears to the Chinese crew by their contractor, the Indian crew will take charge of the vessel. The Chinese crew will leave the vessel at the next foreign port. Port authorities have refuted the allegations made by the Chinese captain that no provisions, water and bunker were provided to the crew. They said all provisions were provided to the crew on board since the vessel’s arrival at Kakinada anchorage port on July 12. One of the shipping contractors later approached the high court seeking a direction to the Hong Kong-based shipping company, which employed the Chinese crew, to allow the Indian crew to board. The contractor based in Singapore also sought arrest of the vessel. The case is pending in the high court and is likely to be heard this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/stranded-cargo-vessel-likely-to-leave-kakinada-port-soon/articleshow/86437822.cms||Samson Raj

Immediately, she alerted her daughter suspecting that something is wrong and came out of their house in search of Jeelani to see a large number of people gathered near their residence where she found Jeelani’s body lying in a pool of blood. Farzana was suspicious of Sheikh Imran, since Jeelani was one of the accused in the murder of his brother. “Imran bore a grudge against my husband.

This will address the issue of US immigrants not being able to get a credit card for months or not being able to open a bank account with a social security number. Zolve is founded by Raghunandan G, founder of TaxiForSure, which was sold to Ola cabs in 2015 for $200 million. In February this year, Zolve raised $15 million in a round led by Accel and Lightspeed along with several high-profile investors including Cred founder Kunal Shah. “Indians who migrate to the US are mostly super-prime, going by their credit scores here. In the US, they are treated as sub-prime customers because they do not have a credit history and they would have to wait for a while to build up a credit score,” said Raghunandan. The neobank launched its pilot project earlier this year where it got 43,000 customers as against the 500 it was expecting. “Our expectation was that customers would maintain a balance of around $1,000, while we have seen customers deposit all the way up to $40,000 (Rs 30 lakh) as well,” said Raghunandan. Zolve offers banking services, but it is not a bank and has partnered with Community Federal Savings Bank (CFSB) for the savings account at the back end. As the bank’s deposits are insured with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, all deposits are covered for up to $2,50,000. Besides the bank account and credit cards, customers also get the mobile banking app which is already integrated with Apple Pay, Google Pay and Venmo. “Another challenge that Indians face is the requirement of a social security number by banks. We have worked with the banks to accept a US visa, which is also a government-issued document. With us, one can open US bank accounts and get access to US credit cards, while they are still in India,” said Raghunandan. In future, the bank will also tie up with partners to provide investment services on its platform. “Our aim is to be present in every cross-border service requirement of the customer. When it comes to remittances, we are faster as we provide banking services at both ends and there is no additional requirement for KYC. It is cheaper because we do the exchange closer to the wholesale exchange rate,” said Raghunandan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indians-can-get-us-credit-cards-fresh-off-the-boat/articleshow/86438399.cms||Mayur Shetty

Like his “manaseega Guru”, Mathrubootham too is a superstar for every SaaS startup founder in India, and has brought the X factor into the B2B software industry at a time when e-commerce founders often figured as heroes of the Indian startup ecosystem. He has not just managed to create a $10 billion+ company in just 10 years and has also inspired product builders to dream big and put the country on the global SaaS map. While no startup success can be a one-man show, Mathrubootham as a leader has successfully rallied a talented team around his vision. “Girish is a dreamer and the team is making it a reality, beautifully executing on it with him,” Chargebee founder Krish Subramanian said. “The Freshworks journey is a story of belief for other SaaS entrepreneurs competing on a global stage.” A former employee says the company’s greatest strength is its distribution prowess. “They didn't just have a great product, but knew how to sell it to international customers from day 1,” the person said. “One of the most important decisions that G (Girish to his team) made is leveraging AdWords to get customers to the door early on.” Another Freshworks employee said Mathrubootham’s ability to match employee roles to what they enjoyed doing helped “everyone discover true happiness in the company” and as a multiplier effect, this culture accelerated growth. As a completely self-taught founder who learnt to build and run his startup with resources on the web, Mathrubootham is a big proponent of paying it forward and continues to support Indian founders even after moving to the Valley.  Thiyagarajan M, partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha, says that in taking Freshworks public, Mathrubootham has also unleashed the floodgates for India SaaS IPOs, and established that India is for SaaS what Israel is for security. “Like his idol Rajnikanth, Girish has overcome incredible odds to reach great heights just like him. And now he serves as a Manaseega guru for 100s of Saas founders in India,” he added.

He said railways has also cautioned the newly constituted RPF women team, ‘Meri Saheli’, to provide all possible assistance to single woman or group of women travelling by trains from Bihar to far-off places. The ‘Meri Saheli’ team has been working round the clock at 20 major stations under ECR and escorting six long-distance passenger trains originating from Patna Junction, Danapur and Patliputra Junction, he said. Mayank said in addition to providing security, the ‘Meri Saheli’ team was instrumental in providing medical assistance to women passengers in emergency during the Covid pandemic and rescued three minor girls from the clutches of human traffickers at Patna Junction last week. According to the IG, the RPF team has rescued 352 boys and 244 girls from the human traffickers at different places under the ECR since January this year and prosecuted 35 human traffickers so far. The RPF men also seized banned contraband valued at Rs9.91 crore during the past three months, he said, adding that a gang of criminals involved in this clandestine business was thus unearthed and brought to book. During the ongoing drive against criminals involved in pilferage of railway property, the RPF men recovered stolen railway property valued at Rs13.36 lakh from different places in the ECR last month. The RPF men on train escort duty have arrested 2941 people involved in alarm chain pulling (ACP) incidents and realized fine of Rs 76.84 lakh from them during the past three months, he said. Mayank has warned passengers not to obtain journey tickets from touts. Most of these tickets were booked in the name of fake persons and false identities. RPF men have arrested 246 touts at Patna and other places in the state in the last two to three months, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railways-to-beef-up-security-on-trains-during-festive-season/articleshow/86434736.cms||Kumod Verma

These tickets, the number of which has been capped at 8,000 a day, will be released for online booking at 9 am on September 25. TTD chairman Y V Subba Reddy said the decision to move the slotted sarva darshan tickets online was taken in view of the health security of visiting devotees as well as locals. “From the day the TTD started issuing free darshan tokens under current booking quota, an unprecedented number of devotees was queuing up at the booking counters and the crowding had become a cause of concern, which is why we are now moving the darshan booking to the online mode,” added the chairman. The offline counters at Srinivasam where free darshan tickets are issued to devotees under the current booking mode will be closed from September 26 as the quota for darshan tickets will be released online. Y V Subba Reddy appealed to the devotees to carry either a negative Covid-19 test report or a final vaccination report while coming to Tirumala for darshan. Meanwhile, TTD EO Dr K S Jawahar Reddy who inspected the Sapthagiri Gau Pradakshina shala at Alipiri on Wednesday told reporters that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will inaugurate the first of its kind centre for cow worship on the eve of the annual Brahmotsavams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/sale-of-free-darshan-tickets-to-go-online/articleshow/86437729.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Business||Legitimate tax planning not illegal: ITAT||MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has held that minimisation of tax liability through legitimate tax planning is not illegal. In the case of Michael E Desa, a US-based non-resident, it upheld in a recent order the set-off of loss arising on sale of shares of a private company against the profits made on sale of property in India. During the financial year 2009-10, Desa had set off the long-term capital loss of Rs 1.1 crore against long-term capital gains of Rs 95 lakh from the property sale. In other words, owing to such a set-off, there was no taxable long-term capital gains in the hands of the non-resident taxpayer. The income tax (I-T) officer denied such a set-off by holding that the transaction of sale of shares was a sham to generate artificial and incorrect long-term capital loss in the hands of Desa. The buyer of these shares was a director in this private company with whom Desa had a business relationship for over 10 years. After the sale of the shares, no business was carried on by the company. “Under sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, when the object is to defeat any provisions of law, and when consideration is of such nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law, the contract will be void. It was noted that the transaction is only to nullify the levy of long-term capital gains. It was thus observed that the sale contract for the sale of shares is vitiated in law,” held the I-T officer. However, the ITAT bench of vice-president Pramod Kumar and judicial member Ravish Sood pointed out that commercial decisions such as sale and purchase of shares of a private company must be best left to the persons concerned. “What the buyer of these shares does to the company is the business of the buyer of the shares.” The bench pointed out that it is a common practice to find such companies changing hands. The ITAT concluded its order with strong words, saying that the I-T officer cannot disregard a transaction just because it results in a tax advantage to the taxpayer. “Just as much as we cannot legitimise and glorify tax evasion through colourable devices and tax shelters, we cannot also deprecate and disapprove genuine tax planning within the framework of law. The line of demarcation between what is permissible tax planning and what turns into impermissible tax avoidance may be somewhat thin, but that cannot be an excuse enough for the tax authorities to err on the side of excessive caution,” stated the order. The ITAT bench relied on earlier judicial decisions, including that of the Supreme Court in the case of Mc Dowell and Company, where it was held that that tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/tax-planning/legitimate-tax-planning-not-illegal-itat/articleshow/86438747.cms||---

In 2019, HMWS&SB had taken over the civic body’s periphery sewerage network, but after few months, it was handed over to GHMC. However, now the MA&UD has asked the water board to maintain sewerage network, by issuing a GO on September 18. Currently, HMWS&SB is spending nearly Rs 50 to Rs 70 crore per month for its existing sewerage network. It has asked the GHMC to pay Rs 12 crore per month towards maintenance costs to the existing periphery sewerage system. Over 24 air-tech machines and another 66 ‘mini air-tech’ machines used by GHMC are now being handed over to the water board. “A mega plan to tackle around 10,000 kilometres length of sewerage network is underway.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Accounting fraud: Rs 26L goes missing from corp’s records||Thiruvananthapuram: An amount of Rs 26 lakh received as remittance for various purposes has gone missing at Nemom zonal office, an inquiry by the accounts wing of city corporation has revealed. The amount remitted at the zonal office in 25 working days from February 2020-June 2021 has not been deposited in the corporation’s bank account, according to sources. It all started with an innocuous query regarding a transaction made at Sreekaryam zonal office as the staff found something amiss about the seal on the counterfoil slip. When the officials cross checked with the bank, it was confirmed that the money was never deposited in the bank account. Further inquiry in 11 zonal offices led to the revelation of a similar fraud in Attipra, Ulloor and Nemom zonal offices. Nemom reported the biggest fraud so far with an amount of Rs 26 lakh missing from corporation accounts. The modus operandi was similar to what happened in Sreekaryam. In some cases, even the counter slips were missing but still, the entry was made in the collection register and the money never made it to the account. The local fund audit has reported that many counter foil slips inspected by the team did not have the branch code or the bank seal, indicating a clear case of forgery. The audit report says that the zonal office did not possess any document to identify the staff who carries the daily cash from zonal offices to the bank. The officials with civic body are at a loss to find out whether this was the handiwork of a single individual or a group of people. The corporation has pressed for charges of theft, conspiracy, misappropriation of government funds and cheating in a complaint filed against corporation staff at Sreekaryam zonal office. The civic body will file a new complaint with the police against the staff of Nemom zonal office on Thursday. The officials said technical deficiencies in IKM accounting software and laxity during Covid lockdown months provided a conducive environment for fraud. “One issue with the present software is that the daily collection records at zonal offices cannot be monitored centrally. It will take 15 days to reflect. While it is possible to track a particular transaction for a day in a zonal office, it is still a herculean task to cross check it with the bank statement because records from 11 zonal offices come as bulk documents,” an official said. The civic body has already communicated to IKM to effect relevant updates in the software so that daily remittances in zonal offices can be monitored real time. While it has thought about the option to open multiple accounts in zonal offices, procedural norms do not allow such an operation of separate accounts for each zonal office. Now, remittances are being tracked manually and directions have been issued to maintain the reconciliation register and confirm all transactions within 10th of every month. A special team from main office will visit each zonal office to ensure that reconciliation register is promptly maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/accounting-fraud-rs-26l-goes-missing-from-corps-records/articleshow/86436936.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Rai is also the non-executive chairman of IDFC, the holding company of IDFC First Bank. According to a filing, 62% of the votes cast at the annual general meeting were against item number 5, an ordinary resolution to appoint Rai as a non-independent director up to May 2023. Shares of IDFC closed 2% higher at Rs 56. Shareholders, however, gave their nod to the resolutions approving the financial statements of the company and the appointment of two other independent directors — Jaimini Bhagwati and Anil Singhvi. IDFC has 4.5 lakh investors holding 159 crore shares. Of these only 1,247 shareholders holding 91 crore shares had voted. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) hold around 24% of IDFC shares. Rai was earlier the independent director of IDFC for two terms. As it was not possible to get a third term as an independent director, Rai had resigned before the second term could end in July. However, he was reappointed as a non-independent, non-executive director and shareholder approval was sought to ratify the same. In a pre-AGM investor call, shareholders had questioned why Rai’s resignation had not been made public. Responding to the queries, Ajay Sondhi, a director, had said that as Rai’s second term as an independent director was coming to an end, IDFC’s board and the nomination & remunerations committee (NRC) felt that it is in the best interest of the company and shareholders to ensure continuity of Rai’s tenure as chairman especially in IDFC’s critical final phase in terms of unlocking shareholder value. “Therefore, the board and the NRC requested Rai to continue. The exact technical process of Rai’s resignation and his appointment was discussed extensively and consulted with legal counsel and was conducted fully in accordance with all extant regulations and corporate governance processes. And finally, Rai’s appointment that was made by the board, as chairman, as a non-executive director,” he said. The management had also faced flak for no clarity on divestment of subsidiaries and possibility of reverse merger with IDFC First Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idfc-shareholders-deny-board-seat-to-vinod-rai/articleshow/86438467.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mother attacks sleeping youth with chopper in dead of night in Bansdroni||KOLKATA: An argument between an elderly woman — a former tutor whose husband served in the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) — and her eldest son reached such a level at Bansdroni Place that she attacked him with a chopper when he was sleeping and dragged him out of his room and towards the road in an effort to get him to leave the house. The victim’s screams woke neighbours around 1.30am on Wednesday and they informed police. The 30-year-old victim, Surajit Das, is the only earning member of the family. According to cops, they have arrested Surajit’s mother Kaberi (58) and are questioning her on what provoked her to allegedly take such a violent step. “Surajit was sleeping when his mother assaulted him with a chopper. She hit him on his head as the result of an internal family dispute. Surajit sustained severe injuries. Kaberi has been charged with attempt to murder of her own son,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. Sources said Surajit had returned from Mumbai less than a week ago where he studied music and reportedly wanted to make a career in it. “The victim’s brother is mentally disabled. Prima facie, we believe the dispute between mother and son revolved around Surajit’s brother. Kaberi, it appears, was upset over how she and her younger son were being treated,” said an officer. Neighbours said they had heard the accused and her eldest son argue multiple times from Tuesday evening. “We knew they were not on the best of terms. Apparently, Kaberi believed she and her younger son were being tortured. However, no one really interacted with them as they avoided social interaction. The house is in a shambles, though it is located at a prime location, barely a few minutes from the Rifle Club at Bansdroni,” said Tarit Samanta, a neighbour. “They lived by themselves, but it was obvious they were having financial trouble. We could hear arguments for the past 72 hours. We didn’t interfere thinking it would be wrong to speak about personal issues. But we never thought the result could be so violent. I went to pick flowers in the morning and saw cops outside their house. Later, I came to know the mother had attacked her son. I have heard that the eldest son was abusing his mother,” said a neighbour. The police said they might take the help of counsellors to get a version of events from the victim’s brother. Locals, though, have requested cops to ensure that he is protected and provided a safe shelter while the elder brother recuperates in hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mother-attacks-sleeping-youth-with-chopper-in-dead-of-night/articleshow/86436860.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Depositors of PMC Bank, 20 co-operatives to get up to Rs 5 lakh||MUMBAI: Customers of 21 failed cooperative banks, including the infamous Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, will get back up to Rs 5 lakh of their deposits. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC) has said that, following the amendment of the DICGC Act, it will make payments to depositors within 90 days. Besides PMC, the large banks include Rupee Coop Bank, Kapol Cooperative Bank, Maratha Coop Bank, and City Coop Bank — all from Maharashtra. Depositors in these banks have been waiting for years for their money. Traditionally the RBI placed troubled banks under an ‘all-inclusive direction’, meaning they could not deal with any of their assets or liabilities without the central bank’s permission. This was done after the bank turned unviable. In the normal course, depositors would have been paid if all options failed and the bank was liquidated. The payout will pave the way for the resolution plan of PMC Bank submitted by Centrum and Bharat Pe. With bulk of the retail deposits out of the way, the new promoters can get a better idea of the balance liabilities on larger deposits and submit their plan. With bulk of the liabilities out of the way, rival cooperatives might find it easier to merge some of the failed banks. The DICGC (Amendment) Act — which was notified on August 27 and came into force on September 1 — allowed the deposit insurance money to be paid upfront. Depositors have to submit their willingness to claim insurance. The banks have to submit a claim list by October 15 and update the position as of November 29 with principal and interest in a final updated list. Only those depositors who have expressed their willingness to claim insurance will get their money. Depositors in Maharashtra will be the biggest beneficiaries with 11 of the failed banks based here. The eight other banks are Hindu Coop Bank, Needs of Life Coop Bank, Padmashree Vithal Rao Vikhe Patil Coop Bank, Shri Anand Coop Bank, Mantha Urban Coop Bank, Sarjeraodada Naik Shirala Coop Bank and Independence Coop Bank. There are five cooperative banks from Karnataka — Bidar Mahila Urban Coop Bank, Millath Coop Bank, Gururaghavendra Coop Bank, Mudhol Coop Bank, and Deccan Urban Cooperative Bank. The remaining five are Adoor Coop Bank from Kerala, Hindu Coop Bank (Punjab), Peoples Cooperative Bank (UP), Sikar Urban Cooperative Bank (Rajasthan) and Garha Cooperative Bank (MP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/depositors-of-pmc-bank-20-coops-to-get-up-to-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/86438579.cms||---

At the same time, it has unleashed “creative destruction”, which will boost productivity and can alter the course of development. The governor pointed out that the fillip to automation and digital during the pandemic would improve productivity, but it would provide challenges to inclusiveness and slack in the labour market. “Such a scenario calls for significant skilling/training of our workforce. We also need to guard against any emergence of ‘digital divide’ as digitisation gains speed after the pandemic,” said Das. According to Das, the government needs to provide a big push to investment in health, education, low-carbon and digital economy in addition to transport and communications. In addition, the warehousing and supply chain infrastructure will be critical to bolstering value addition and productivity in the agriculture and horticulture sectors. “This will create employment opportunities in semi-urban and rural areas and promote inclusive growth,” said Das, delivering the keynote address at the 48th National Management Convention of the All India Management Association. Das noted that the pandemic has affected the poor and vulnerable more, especially in emerging and developing economies. “The lasting damage inflicted by the pandemic on these segments is of serious concern for inclusive growth. In the medium to long run, both efficiency and equity will greatly matter for sustainable growth and macroeconomic performance,” said Das. The RBI governor said that the government’s measures to boost manufacturing in the country has yielded results. “The pandemic has brought to focus what India can achieve in the area of manufacturing. In the pharmaceutical sector for the first time in history, vaccines were developed and administered within a year with India remaining a forerunner and a global leader in vaccine manufacturing,” said Das. He noted that the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme introduced by the government has resulted in India being home to almost all the leading global mobile phone manufacturers and turning from being an importer to an exporter of mobile phones. “This trend is likely to spill over to other sectors also. The presence of global players would help in enhancing India’s share in global value chain (GVC) and building up a resilient supply chain network,” said Das. He added that sustainable growth should entail building on macro fundamentals via medium-term investments, sound financial systems and structural reforms. “Towards this objective, a big push to investments in healthcare, education, innovation, physical and digital infrastructure will be required,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/creative-destruction-dents-inclusion-ups-output-das/articleshow/86438641.cms||---

The police said they will understand the modus operandi of those persons by coordinating with other departments and keeping a regular watch on them.

One of the accused is an NRI residing in the USA. City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said the creation of fake documents of lands is a criminal offence and victims need to report to the local police in such cases.

Men apply for cosmetic trainer posts, Gujarat govt scraps hiring||AHMEDABAD: A bevy of men responded to the call to become trainers of beauticians and makeup professionals, which made the government see rouge and cancel the recruitment process. But the Gujarat high court was irked by the government’s cosmetic response to men applying for the jobs at Industrial Training Institutes (ITI). During a hearing on September 17, the court took the government to task and directed it to “come up with a formula as to how they want to resolve the issue.” It seems to have occurred to the government a good two years after all the tests were conducted that only women should be hired for the posts. When the recruitments were scrapped, the candidates who had cleared the tests were awaiting appointments. The government had initiated the recruitment process in 2019 for instructors for fields such as beauty and hairdressing. It appears that the government was expecting most applicants to be women. But faced with a rush of men, the government nixed recruitments to amend the rules. Seventeen candidates, including 15 women, approached the court to contest the government’s decision. The petitioners’ advocate, Jigar Gadhavi, argued that the abrupt decision was in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. Find solution, court to govt The government defended its decision by submitting that it has changed the recruitment rules. The government said that since the recruitment process has been annulled, the matter is no longer within the remit of the court. On hearing this, Justice Nikhil Kariel said: “Prima facie, in the considered opinion of this court, the state cannot be heard to say that since the advertisement is cancelled, their action is beyond the scrutiny.” The court asked the government to find a solution to the problem after the petitioners’ advocate cited the reasons for the cancellation. He placed the government’s reply to a query made under the RTI provisions. The government said it aims to popularize the course for beauticians among rural women. It said the women may feel hesitant to get trained if men are the instructors. Also, the government said, because physical touch is part of the process, there are chances of sexual harassment. The court criticized the authorities for their belated realization of the situation and for taking the issue “very casually”. The court observed: “The respondents have not considered the pain and agony which would be undergone by the candidates who have been waiting for almost two years.” The court added: “Merely because at the relevant point of time the aspect [of] male candidates applying for selection had not occurred to the authorities, the persons like the petitioners should not be made sufferers.” The court has posted further hearing on this issue on October 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gender-bias-men-apply-for-cosmetic-trainer-posts-govt-scraps-hiring/articleshow/86437296.cms||Saeed Khan

These fresh cases were registered in Gaya (2), Darbhanga (2), Begusarai (1), Bhojpur (1), East Champaran (1), Khagaria (1), Saharsa (1), and Muzaffarpur (1). Altogether 11 people also recuperated from Covid on Wednesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 7,16,199 and active cases to 59 in Bihar. Besides, as many as 2,25,041 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered to the beneficiaries in the state. Meanwhile, none of the samples collected from Madhubani was found positive in the RT-PCR test. Altogether 67 people at the Madhubani railway station were found positive in a random test done after the arrival of trains on Sunday and Monday from outside Bihar. This news had created fear among the residents. “However, in the RT-PCR test, none of the samples tested positive,” health department’s special secretary, Sanjay Kumar Singh, told TOI on Wednesday. Officials of the health department said there could be some error with the batch of antigen kit used for the test. “This cannot be confirmed, but we expect that something was wrong with the kit otherwise other districts would have also reported an increase in the number of cases,” claimed an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-samples-taken-at-madhubani-railway-station-test-covid-negative/articleshow/86434447.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Opposition demands probe against deputy CM for favouring kin||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday demanded an investigation into alleged favour done to deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad’s near and dear ones in awarding contracts worth crores of rupees for ‘Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal’ projects to bring tap water to every household in the state. The reports said contracts worth Rs53 crore were awarded to the beneficiaries known to be close to Prasad in Katihar district. Prasad, a senior BJP leader, has been representing Katihar in the assembly for several terms. “This needs to be investigated. Even his (Prasad) ministry needs to be investigated. I challenge many people associated with JD(U) have got contracts in various schemes under Saat Nishchay,” Tejashwi said. Prasad had earlier told the media that doing business was not wrong, if it was done diligently and work is delivered. Even BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said there was no harm in doing business. “What is wrong if his relatives are doing business? One has to earn for his livelihood. But the deputy CM himself is not involved in any contract and opposition is uselessly raising this issue. If his direct involvement is found, then the party will take action,” said Patel. He further said if anyone is found not completing the work under contract, then the department concerned will take action. Meanwhile, Congress also lashed out at the NDA government in Bihar for showing favouritism in giving government contracts. Bihar Congress spokesperson Asit Nath Tiwari alleged that Prasad through wrong means had given contracts to his daughter-in-law and close aides. “His daughter-in-law is a registered contractor under PHED and her address is the same as that of the deputy CM. The biggest contact under the scheme in Katihar had been given to Jeevan Shri Infrastructure. Prasad’s brother-in-law and sister-in-law are the directors of this company. Till now contracts worth Rs53 crore have been discovered and many more such contracts have been given to his closed ones,” Tiwari alleged. According to a PTI report, RJD leader from Katihar, Ram Krishan Mahto, who claims to have provided Tejashwi with all the relevant documents, said he came to know of the alleged favouritism in awarding the contracts a year ago. “I had provided these to the leader of the opposition with the request that he flag the matter on the floor of the assembly. Though he has not been able to do so till now, he intends to raise the issue in the next session,” said Mahto, who represented Katihar in the assembly before losing the seat to Prasad in 2005. “There are many irregularities. In some instances, payments have been made even though the work was not complete. I demand that the chief minister drop Prasad and get the matter investigated by a sitting judge of the Patna high court,” Mahto added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-demands-probe-against-deputy-cm-for-favouring-kin/articleshow/86434709.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Hearing a PIL filed by one Gaurav Kumar Singh for protecting and preserving the Jalla Hanuman temple and free the area from encroachment, the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar directed the DM to furnish detail about the action taken so far to remove the encroachments. Earlier, while hearing this PIL, the high court had come to know that 15 bigha government land had been allegedly grabbed by two persons, Vasudev Sahay Verma and Ranjeet Kumar Sinha, who had got its mutation done in their names and even built houses over it. The administration then took action to cancel both mutations and remove encroachments before reclaiming the land. The court was apprised in a counter affidavit filed on behalf of the DM that notices were issued to the two persons and their mutations had been cancelled. Another counter affidavit was submitted by the Patna Sadar circle officer, apprising the court about fencing work on the vacant land and action taken against those who had encroached it. However, the court was not satisfied and sought a detailed reply while fixing October 27 as the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-asks-dm-to-submit-details-of-encroachment-near-jalla-temple/articleshow/86437480.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The deceased was identified as Pondugala Venkateswara Reddy, an employee with a gas agency from the Gandhinagar area in Narasaraopet town. According to police, the incident took place when Venkateswara Reddy and his colleague Mekala Venkata Kotireddy went to the bar to have a drink. As the liquor bill came up to Rs 600, Kotireddy asked Venkateswara Reddy to contribute Rs 300 towards his share. Venkateswara Reddy confessed that he did not have any money and had assumed that the drinks were Kotireddy’s treat. Angered by his response, Kotireddy assaulted his colleague with a stone, causing him critical head injuries. Locals immediately rushed him to a private hospital where he was pronounced as brought dead. Cops reached the spot and shifted Venkateswara Reddy’s body to a government hospital for postmortem. A case was registered under section 302 of IPC (murder) at Narasaraopet Two Town police station.

As per a decent survey conducted by the department of industries and commerce (DIC), over 125 entrepreneurs are eager to start industries near the district headquarter and they have demanded over 800 acres of land for setting up an industrial corridor. Meanwhile, the KFCCI has also placed a demand for land. The DIC has identified land near Ganajur and Kolur villages. The district administration is negotiating with farmers for land. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will hold a meeting next week in Bengaluru regarding Haveri industrial corridor and industrialists and traders are hoping that their long pending demand will come true soon. Ramesh Ballari, an entrepreneur said that currently Haveri city has three acres of the industrial area. This is not sufficient for anyone to extend the business activities. “Many are willing to set up industries in Haveri because it is well connected by road and railway and the city is located in the centre of the Karnataka. We hope CM Basavaraj Bommai will meet this long-pending of Haverians,” he said. “We have only 400 acres of government land near Ganajur, but since the demand is high, more than 800 acres are required for the industrial corridor in Haveri. More than 125 entrepreneurs have applied for land to set up industries. Farmers are ready to give land for the purpose, but they are seeking high prices for that. The district administration is negotiating with farmers to purchase land and we hope it will solve soon,” said Vinayak Joshi, deputy director for the department of industry and commerce. “I will call a meeting to discuss regarding Haveri industrial corridor next week and will finalise it soon. The government is encouraging industries to create jobs for locals,” said Basavaraj Bommai, chief minister, Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/industrialists-demand-800-acres-in-haveri-for-corridor/articleshow/86434628.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

After the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Patel called all the secretaries and asked them to give a detailed list of their goals to be achieved in next three months. Patel has specifically directed the rural development, urban development and health departments to proactively pursue the directions. Patel took oath as the 17th CM of Gujarat on 13th September. A key source close to the development said, “The CM has directed all the secretaries to prepare and submit list of all the tangible goals which mainly cover individual beneficiary schemes of the state and central government, major public works which can be expedited and dedicated to masses in next three months’ period. All the department secretaries have to prepare list which includes all their subordinate authorities also. All the secretaries are supposed to prepare a presentation and submit it to the general administration department (GAD) and to the chief secretary at the earliest. CM Patel is once again likely to review the department wise goals in the next cabinet meeting and finalise department wise goals.” The source said, “The government has planned a celebration to mark completion of 100 days with events planned across the state.” Along with the government, the state BJP is also likely to celebrate the first 100 days of Bhupendra Patel government’s achievements among masses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/present-tangible-work-targets/articleshow/86438929.cms||Kapil Dave

The CBI had filed the plea after getting no material evidence in the 13-year-old case. Hearing the petition, the magistrate questioned the need for conducting a scientific narco analysis test on the suspects and dismissed the plea citing it would violate the right of the individuals enshrined in the Constitution and Code of Criminal Procedure. The suspects had earlier expressed their fear of undergoing the test citing it might have an adverse effect on their health. The counsel representing the CBI said the seven suspects — Inampudi Padma, warden of the hostel where the young woman was found murdered, her husband Inampudi Siva Ramakrishna, the victim’s roommates Sowmya and Preethi, prime accused Koneru Satish Babu, grandson of former minister Koneru Ranga Rao, Abburi Ganesh and Chintha Pawan Kumar — were crucial in bringing out what happened on the day of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/special-court-dismisses-cbis-narco-analysis-plea/articleshow/86437767.cms||---
---||Patna||University teachers up in arms against Bihar govt’s directive||PATNA: The teachers in Bihar are up in arms against the recent government directive to the universities to postpone the ongoing process of their promotions under the Career Advancement Scheme (CAS) in view of the proposed amendment in the statutes. The agitating teachers apprehend that hundreds of them, who have already been promoted or are likely to be promoted as associate professors and professors as per the existing statutes, will be hit by the directive. Expressing grave concern over the government’s recent directive for postponement of promotions, the Federation of University Teachers’ Association of Bihar (FUTAB) observed that it was a cardinal principle of law that benefits granted to somebody may not be taken back with retrospective effect. Withholding long-due promotions before promulgation of any new statute or any amendment in the statute would be a gross injustice to the university teachers, it said. Referring to a UGC letter issued to the universities in February last year, FUTAB’s working president, Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, and general secretary, Sanjay Kumar Singh, pointed out that the universities had been asked to complete all the pending cases of promotions at the earliest. “Consequently, the universities initiated the process of according promotions in the right earnest, but due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the process could not be completed. In many cases, the reports of the referees were received late and the meeting of the screening committees could not be held in time,” they said. They further pointed out that in March 2020, the Patna high court had directed that the universities cannot keep cases of promotions pending for more than six months. They urged the chancellor and the state government not to overlook the directive of the UGC and the high court and award genuine promotions to all the deserving teachers. A three-member committee constituted by the chancellor to redraft promotion statutes in light of the UGC regulations, 2018 has reportedly completed its job and the new promotion statute is likely to be approved soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/university-teachers-up-in-arms-against-bihar-govts-directive/articleshow/86434585.cms||B K Mishra
---||Surat||Gujarat: Couple rescued from Islet in Auranga river after 4 hours||SURAT: A couple that had gone to offer prayers at a temple and spend some moments together on an islet had a scare of their life following sudden rise in water level of river Auranga in Valsad on Wednesday. After being stranded for nearly four hours, the couple was rescued by a team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel. The couple had walked up to the islet on river Auranga near Ghadoi village to offer prayer at a temple on Wednesday afternoon. Nilesh (21) and his friend Snehal (18) had gone to the islet in the afternoon and offered prayer at a temple there. Later they were sitting and chatting when the water level suddenly started rising. Before they could walk back to the river bank the water level rose dangerously. As the couple got stranded on the islet, a huge crowd gathered there with villagers and fire teams trying to rescue them. But due to heavy current in the river they could not rescue the couple. Ultimately, the NDRF team was called in which rescued the couple using a boat after a two-hour-long operation. “It seems they did not get time to return due to the sudden rise in water level. It was challenging for us to keep the boat steady in such strong water current,” said Vijaysingh Sondaliya, sub-inspector of 6th NDRF battalion, Jarod, Vadodara. At around 3.50 pm NDRF team was called for the rescue operation. About 22 jawans arrived at the spot and examined the situation and found that it would be impossible to directly enter by boat. Hence, first expert divers went up to the islet holding a rope and tied it’s one end to a tree there. Later, a boat was brought to the islet using a rope. The couple was rescued using the boat. The couple had two mobile phones and they were making panic calls to friends and family for rescue. “We advised them to save the battery and we used their phones to give instructions to them and communicate with our team that went on the islet,” said a NDRF official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/couple-rescued-from-islet-in-auranga-river-after-four-hours/articleshow/86434785.cms||---

Five empty cartridges were recovered from the spot in front of his residence. City SP (central) Ambrish Rahul on Wednesday said the arrested youths have been identified as Prince Pandey (19), Raushan Kumar Pandey (19) and Atul Kumar Singh (18). He said Prince was arrested from flat number 501 of Vaishnavi Plaza in S K Puri, Roushan from Motihari and Atul from West Boring Canal road area. Prince's father Manoj Pandey is a police constable posted in another district. “All three are Class XII students. They wanted to make quick money by committing crime. Atul’s father owns a general store,” he said. Rahul said the builder had a land dispute with one Amit Yadav, who had hatched the conspiracy to threaten Singh. “Amit had promised to pay Rs1.5 lakh to the trio for firing and abusing the builder. He had already paid Rs68,000 to Atul. It was Prince who had first come in touch with Amit,” the SP said. He said Amit was accused in another firing case registered with Danapur police station earlier. But no evidence had surfaced against him in that case. “The arrested trio even had recorded a video of their firing as evidence for Amit. The video and the cellphone used for recording the incident have been seized. The bikes of Roushan and Atul, used in the crime, have also been recovered,” the SP said. Rahul said raids are on to arrest Amit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-arrested-for-firing-outside-builders-house-in-patna/articleshow/86434517.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The building’s security guard was traced, from whom cops learned about a broken door with a plywood keeping the pieces together. A policeman crawled into the building through it and rescued the dog. Animal lover Debabrata heard the dog’s desperate barks and alerted police on Wednesday. “He first heard the dog on Sunday. On Wednesday, he heard the barks again and looked around for the dog. Realising it was trapped in the building — a hotel that has been shut for a while due to the pandemic and whose owner lives elsewhere — he approached DC Arijit Singh, who asked Purba Jadavpur traffic guard OC Sanjay Singh to look into it. When Singh arrived at the spot with other cops, he too heard the dog’s groans. The main entrance was found locked. “A piece of paper was pasted on it with someone’s phone number. Singh called it and spoke to the building’s former security guard. He provided the number of the current security guard to the cops. However, when cops called him, the guard said he was at home on a holiday and had no inkling when the stray had entered the hotel. By this time, the stray, possibly sensing a rescue attempt, started barking excitedly. As Singh walked around the building, he noticed a narrow opening. “A cop entered through the broken plywood. At first, the dog looked frightened, but minutes later, it relaxed and agreed to be led outside. The biggest compliment was when it wagged its tail in front of us before scampering away,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-break-open-door-to-rescue-stranded-dog/articleshow/86436933.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Consider setting up NGT bench in Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has asked the Centre and the chairperson of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to consider setting up a circuit bench of NGT in Ahmedabad for Gujarat state. It has requested so in the larger public interest so that people are not forced to travel 700 km to the Pune bench, which has jurisdiction over Gujarat. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said, “We may only observe that it will be in the fitness of things if a circuit bench is established in Ahmedabad, State of Gujarat.” The HC observation came in response to a PIL filed six years ago by an NGO, Consumer Protection and Analytic Committee, seeking direction to quash the 2011 notification empowering the tribunal in Pune to hear cases from Gujarat. The PIL sought direction to the Centre to establish NGT bench at the seat of the Gujarat HC in Ahmedabad to deal with environmental issues of Gujarat. The NGO’s advocate Masoom Shah submitted that NGT has its circuit benches in Jodhpur, Shimla and Shillong. One such circuit bench can be established in Ahmedabad because people, especially the poor and tribals, find it very difficult and cumbersome to travel all the way to Pune and engage lawyers of a different state. Advocate Shah cited a Supreme Court judgment in the Swiss Ribbons vs Union of India case and insisted that permanent benches are required to be established at the sitting of every jurisdictional high court and, if that is not possible, at least a circuit bench should be established within Gujarat, preferably in Ahmedabad, so that an aggrieved party can avail of his remedy without undergoing any hardships or difficulties. After hearing the case, the HC requested the concerned authorities to consider the issue in the larger public interest and take an appropriate decision on setting up a circuit bench of NGT in Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/consider-setting-up-ngt-bench-in-abad-hc/articleshow/86436974.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||LDF corners opposition over choice of words||Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition BJP played into the hands of the LDF in the special council meeting held here on Wednesday as the ruling council cornered the BJP over lack of clarity in the agenda for the meeting. The whole debate was centred over the subject ‘revenue decision’. However, minutes after BJP parliamentary party leader M R Gopan started presenting the topic, CPI councillor Rakhi Ravikumar demanded that the councillor need to be specific. “Why are you talking about the revenue income, when the special council is about revenue decision? You should be talking about decision,” she said. The BJP which had wanted to expose lapses in revenue income collection and asset management soon found itself in a hapless position. A rattled M R Gopan tried to defend himself, saying that what the party meant was the decision regarding revenue income and not revenue decision alone. Ruling councillors then picked on this remark and LDF parliamentary party leader D R Anil added insult to the injury by saying that the BJP should learn how to place a demand for special council. When the debate heated up, Mayor Arya Rajendran read out the letter presented by the opposition demanding special council in which it was said that the council should discuss revenue decision and asset management. The BJP which lost the plot could never get past the objections raised by the LDF councillors. Mayor said that the opposition shall not misuse the forum to distort facts. D R Anil demanded that action shall be taken against M R Gopan for violating the code of the council. The council then witnessed unruly scenes with councillors from both fronts heading to the well and getting into verbal exchanges. Even when they returned to their seats, the debate regained momentum around the fact that the BJP was not specific in its demand for special council. LDF councillors said if the discussion goes beyond the agenda, special sanction has to be taken from the Mayor. Although BJP councillors retorted that revenue income was included in the agenda and hence discussion shall be allowed, the LDF did not relent. Later Mayor declared that the council meeting was over. BJP councillors handed over another letter in the evening specifying discussion on revenue income to Mayor Arya Rajendran, demanding for yet another special council meeting. Meanwhile, UDF councillors boycotted the council session midway. The BJP councillors who failed to corner the ruling party at the special council had to resort to raising slogans in the council hall and later in front of the corporation premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ldf-corners-opposition-over-choice-of-words/articleshow/86436985.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan Kumartuli||Kolkata: The police have decided to enforce the same Covid specific regulations in Kumartuli for the lifting of Durga idols that was in place last year during the Covid pandemic. Idol lifting is set to begin from 4 pm on October 3, two days prior to Mahalaya. The decision was taken in the coordination meetings held between the Kumartuli artisans and Lalbazar on Tuesday and Wednesday. In the meeting on Tuesday the artisans were told to ideally allot a specific time slot to each puja committee for collection of idols. “While we cannot stop multiple puja committees coming here at the same time, at least the same artisan can stagger the timings of delivery to control the crowd,” said an officer. Strict Covid protocol will be followed and no more than four to five organizers will be allowed entry from the truck to the artisan’s studio. Those involved in lifting can avail of a vaccination camp that cops have requested KMC to hold at the spot. “We will set up one ways and the restrictions will have to be followed in letter and spirit. This year, we have increased parking areas so that each truck can stand by maintaining social distancing. We will be coordinating with the artisans to ensure physical distancing. Those organizers not wearing masks will be asked to return,” said an officer from Jorabagan traffic guard. Ranjit Sarkar, joint secretary of Kumartuli Pottery Cultural Association, said, “Last year, everyone entered Kumartuli Patua Para through the two sanitizing channels set up. This year, we are not keeping the same since most artisans are now double vaccinated. We are now waiting for the labourers who will lift the idols to arrive and we get to know how many of them needs to be vaccinated. We have set up Whatsapp groups with organizers and assigned them timings,” said Sarkar, adding that these steps were necessary to ensure safety for both idol makers and organizers before the festival. Police said they would have wanted labourers, mostly from South 24 Parganas, to get tested for Covid. “But this might not be possible due to the time frame. But anyone not following the rules will be debarred from work,” said the officer. “It is usually an elaborate affair to bring Maa here and at least 60 of us are in attendance. This year, we are not even getting willing volunteers,” said the puja organizer of a housing project in Behala. The Covid situation, said Sarkar, has also forced them to stop people from coming and taking photographs. There will be no procession and no night-long wait on the road to take idols to pandals from artisans’ studios. Rather, puja organizers will be allotted specific time slots and not more than three (for smaller organizers) to six (for bigger organizers) people per puja committee will be allowed entry inside the Kumartuli studios. Instead, these organizers will have to wait in their respective trucks maintaining Covid protocols. Besides, several organizers may be forced to bring the idols during the day once the process begins on October 3 due to varied time slots. “With no big idol ordered this year (all range between 6 metre to 10 metre), lifting should be a major challenge provided the rains hold up,” said an officer from Jorabagan Traffic Guard who will coordinate the entire process along with Shyampukur police. BOX: Rules for Kumartuli idol lifting * Strict time slots to be followed by each puja organizers, not everyone can reach there at the same time * Restrict those who are going to the studios on behalf of organizers between three to six people * There will be strict one way rule in and around Kumartuli that cannot be violated * There has to be distanced parking of trucks to maintain social distancing * No photography allowed during loading of maa Durga * No photographers allowed without permission inside the workshops||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-kumartuli/articleshow/86437051.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||BMC data shows only 51% health workers vaccinated!||MUMBAI: Nearly nine months after healthcare workers were prioritised for immunisation against Covid-19, it remains unclear exactly what proportion of this group have been fully vaccinated in Mumbai.  Unvaccinated health workers not just stand the danger of exposing themselves to the infection, they could also pose a risk to vulnerable patients. Civic records show that of the 2,73,249 people registered as ‘healthcare workers’ in Mumbai, barely 1,40,802 (51.2%) have taken both shots while 1.89lakh (70%) have received at least one dose. This data, however, is flawed by BMC’s own account. It doesn’t include health workers who took a second shot in a private centre. There is also the possibility of multiple registrations inflating workforce numbers. So there is no data to say what percentage of doctors and nurses are vaccinated and whether there’s hidden hesitancy that needs to be tackled. At the civic-run medical colleges that employ thousands, there’s been no exercise to assess immunisation coverage. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, believes more than 90% have got both shots. “There will be a miniscule number who haven’t taken the vaccine, but we don’t know exactly how many,” he said. He said there are people with underlying health conditions who may have not taken the vaccine. Health workers were the first to get vaccinated when the drive started in January. Mumbai started with a preliminary registration of 1.3lakh, the number gradually rising to 2.7lakh by September 16. Bharmal said there was hesitancy at the beginning, but it fizzled out during the second wave. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, said they don’t have an exact count of unvaccinated employees. “We did have discussions if we should only allow vaccinated health workers to enter ICUs and operation theatres, but we didn’t take it further,” he said. A professor from the community medicine wing guesstimated health workers awaiting full vaccination at KEM to be 1-3%. A small percentage of non-doctors may be hesitant due to underlying conditions, he said. “We also had fresh medical students joining us later, so they may be awaiting second shots,” he said. Dean of Sion Hospital Dr Mohan Joshi said it was the duty of every health worker to get vaccinated. “What is the need to keep such data,” he questioned. Dr Sheela Jagtap, BMC’s immunisation in-charge, said health staff at private centres had to be given second shots under general categories as Co-Win doesn’t allow vaccination of special groups such as health workers outside of public centres. “We also don’t think Mumbai has 2.71lakh health workers, this inflated number has come due to duplicate or multiple registrations,” she said. Private hospitals with smaller workforce have a better grip on numbers. Hospitals that TOI spoke to said the majority of their employees were vaccinated. “Almost 99% of Masina Hospital's staff is fully vaccinated, the other 1% are due for medical reasons,” said CEO Dr Vispi Jokhi.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel wants govt-citizen meets twice a week||GANDHINAGAR: Presiding over the cabinet meeting in Gandhinagar on Wednesday, new Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel asked ministers and government officials to be present in their offices on Mondays and Tuesdays to meet people, as well as elected representatives coming with their grievances and public issues. Patel’s predecessor Vijay Rupani had also issued similar instructions to his ministers and officials when he took over in 2016 and had also passed a GR (government resolution) in this regard. Patel made it clear that ministers as well as officials of various departments must be available, except in unavoidable circumstances, in their offices on these two days so that people coming to Gandhinagar from far-flung areas as well as MLAs and MPs can easily meet them and make representation about local issues and their grievances. The new chief minister assumed office last week. “The CM told ministers and officials not to arrange any meeting or events on Mondays and Tuesdays so that they can attend MPs, MLAs and people, several of whom come from far flung areas to make a representation. This pro-people decision by our CM will ensure that visitors don’t return without getting their work done,” said revenue minister and state government spokesperson Rajendra Trivedi. In another decision, Patel asked government officials to attend visiting MLAs on a priority basis on Mondays and Tuesdays, Trivedi told reporters after the cabinet meeting. In the past, it was noticed that officials used to ask visiting MLAs to wait outside their cabin instead of giving them priority, said Trivedi. “Now, MLAs will not wait outside. Officials will have to let them in and do the needful after understanding the issue. This is applicable for only Mondays and Tuesdays. On remaining days, MLAs should take prior appointment with officials concerned. The CM has asked all officials to follow these instructions,” he said. Several MLAs, including those of the ruling BJP, had complained in the past that government officials do not listen to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cm-wants-govt-citizen-meets-twice-a-week/articleshow/86439010.cms||---

The meeting attended by representatives of 13 organizations also demanded that the government should take legal action against those who are spreading hatred through terms like ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’. The meeting noted that the chief minister was resorting to double standards on the issue and added that Kerala society, which is committed to upholding brotherhood, will reject any act that amounts to denigrating other religions. Briefing the media after the meeting, IUML high power committee member Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal, who chaired the meeting, said that the meeting took serious note that the remarks made by Pala bishop could exacerbate polarisation in the society. He added that such remarks should not come from leaders of any religion. "The communal harmony and brotherhood which exists in state should continue and prevail. Nobody should make any moves which would disrupt it. The statement by Pala bishop had given rise to several opinions following the realization that he had targeted Muslim community through his statement. All Muslim organizations strongly protests against it and the meeting has unanimously demanded that he should withdraw the statement," he said. Responding to a question, he said that it would be welcome to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. IUML leader ET Mohammed Basheer said the meeting expressed its protest against the indifferent attitude shown by the state government on the issue. However, he added that the Muslim community has responded to the statement in a very mature manner without getting provoked. "It is a matter of relief that Kerala society, including many Christian religious leaders, has expressed their objection to the statement," he said. All major Muslim organizations, except the AP Sunni faction, attended the meeting. The meeting was attended by leaders of Samastha, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen, Jamaat-e-Islami, Dakshina Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema, Wisdom, Markassudava, MES, Kerala Muslim Jamaat Council, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/pala-bishop-should-withdraw-remark-13-muslim-orgs/articleshow/86442724.cms||---

Almost 200 stockists across India had Remdesivir stocks worth a month, which have now expired,” said Jagannath Shinde, president of the All-India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists Associations (AlOCDA). Read AlsoMumbai's active Covid cases below 40k, doctors say 2nd wave decliningThe number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dropped below 40,000 on Wednesday, edging closer to the pre-second wave days of February.Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19, also the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI: “The drop in demand for Remdesivir has been due to twin reasons: its limited use and drop in Covid cases. During the initial days of the second wave, Remdesivir was being used frequently. Studies later showed that it was only beneficial to a niche group of patients.” Barring Ahmednagar, Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara, the other districts in Maharashtra were showing a significant drop (90%) in sale of all products and drugs related to Covid, said Shinde. “There is no market for vitamin C, sanitisers and masks with stocks for almost two months lying unsold with retailers and wholesalers currently,” he said. Barring Ahmednagar, Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara, the other districts in Maharashtra were showing a significant drop (90%) in sale of all products and drugs related to Covid, said Shinde. “There is no market for vitamin C, sanitisers and masks with stocks for almost two months lying unsold with retailers and wholesalers currently,” he said. Alarmingly, the All-India Mask Manufacturers’ Association president Anshumali Jain quoted a 90% drop in sales of masks since the second wave waned. Maharashtra Chemists & Druggists Association secretary Anil Navandar said mask and sanitiser sales were now almost nil. On the increasing number of people flouting Covid-appropriate behaviour, Pujari said it might have to do with aspects like “pandemic fatigue”, drop in Covid cases and increase in vaccination rates. “Still, people must not let their guard down and continue to follow all the necessary norms,” he said. Anil Belkar, secretary of the Chemists’ Association of Pune District, said: “Currently, we are seeing no demand for masks, sanitizers or pulse oximeters. Of the 100% of entire store sales, these products would earlier contribute to almost 70% of sales. It has now come down to 5%. Immunity boosters like Vitamin C tablets have also seen a drastic drop in buyers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sale-of-covid-drugs-devices-and-even-masks-down-90/articleshow/86438993.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||DGP bins reports of spl team-drug mafia nexus||Thiruvananthapuram: Casting a shadow of doubt over the reputation of the anti-narcotics operations of the city police, reports emerged that police authorities suspect that members of DANSAF (district anti-narcotics special action force) here might have formed a nexus with members of narcotics mafia. The allegations were rubbished by the state police chief on Wednesday. DGP Anil Kant also told the media that the department would in fact take measures to strengthen the DANSAF team. It was reported that the intelligence wing took notice of some discrepancies in a few major ganja catches recorded in the city and a probe into these cases led to downsizing of the DANSAF team in the city. The intelligence officials noticed that even though large quantities of ganja were seized in those cases, there was no trace of vehicles that were used to smuggle the contraband into the state. They suspect that the absence of vehicles in those cases might be due to the possibility that the DANSAF team could have acted in collusion with members of the mafia to plant the ganja in the city and then fake the operations so as to meet targets. However, DGP Anil Kant said that no such report was filed by the intelligence wing. Meanwhile, sources within the police department revealed that the higher ups in the department mistook the intentions of the DANSAF members and have taken such an action. “The investigators often lay traps to nab bigger culprits like wholesalers using small time peddlers who are caught. For such operations the cops often maintain close contacts with the smaller links of the rackets,” said a cop who was a former member of anti-narcotics operations. He added that such operations have helped them catch enormous amounts of ganja that would have otherwise gotten sold among the youths here. A senior police officer said the downsizing happened over three months ago. The team was expanded prior to the assembly elections under the instructions of the election commission by mobilizing cops from other wings. Team was disbanded after the election results were announced, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dgp-bins-reports-of-spl-team-drug-mafia-nexus/articleshow/86437013.cms||---

Nathsagar, the dam’s reservoir, was getting inflow of 13,793 cusec till 6pm on Wednesday. The flood control room of the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) said an increase in the inflow towards Jayakwadi dam was observed from upstream areas located in Nashik and Ahmednagar following heavy rainfall in catchment of the upstream dams. “Major group of dams in upstream areas, including Darna (2,708 cusec), Gangapur (8,129 cusec), Kadwa (424 cusec) and Valdevi (183 cusec) were releasing water into Jayakwadi on Wednesday evening. The discharge from Nandur-Madhyameshwar weir towards Nathsagar was around 32,692 cusec and it will result in marked rise in the storage of Jayakwadi dam,” authorities attached with the flood control room said. While Jayakwadi dam was already filled to the brim during the corresponding period last year, the current boost in its storage will ensure sufficient availability of water to cater to the needs of agricultural sector and industries besides drinking water needs. The left bank canal system of Jayakwadi dam has irrigable command area of around 1,41,640 hectare spread over Aurangabad , Jalna and Parbhani districts. The irrigable command area of right bank canal system is nearly 41,682 hectare — spread over Aurangabad and Beed districts in Marathwada besides the Ahmednagar district. Rainfall activity observed in Marathwada for two consecutive days has caused further discharge of water from eight major irrigation projects , including Manjra and Majlgaon dams in Beed. The collective storage in different major, medium and minor irrigation projects in Marathwada has increased to 161.5 TMC as against the combined capacity of 260 TMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jayakwadi-storage-in-mwada-crosses-75-mark-due-to-increased-inflow/articleshow/86432664.cms||---
---||Kochi||Delhi HC flays Centre for delay in transfer of unutilised fund||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has expressed displeasure that despite its directions, the Centre has not yet transferred the unutilised amount of over Rs 63 crore, crowdfunded from the general public for treating an individual suffering from a rare disease, to the central rare diseases fund. Till now, the unused amount was lying with the Kerala high court which was dealing with the original crowdfunding effort. HC noted that the “Union of India has filed an affidavit, stating therein that as it is not a party to the said petition (in Kerala), it has not been able to take steps for the transfer of the said amount to the Rare Diseases Fund. This stand is wholly unacceptable,” Justice Rekha Palli observed, while reiterating the direction to use the funds for the benefit of rare disease patients. HC was dealing with problems being faced by persons, mostly children suffering from rare diseases, who are unable to receive expensive medical treatment. The petitioners include children suffering from rare diseases such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II (Hunter Syndrome), seeking direction to the Centre to provide them uninterrupted and free treatment. “It appears that even after a period of six months some of the directions issued by this Court are yet to be complied with by the respondents/Union of India,” HC observed, pointing out that even if the Centre was not a party, it was expected to take steps to ensure that the “amount does not remain unutilised and is forthwith transferred to the rare diseases fund.” It asked both the Centre and AIIMS to file a comprehensive status report. on how they have complied with the orders passed by the court earlier. Last month HC had asked the Centre to obtain instructions on the utilisation of the amount of Rs 63 crore for the treatment of other similarly placed patients under the National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021. On January 28, the court had passed an order directing the central government to make the digital crowd-funding platform operational for medicines and treatment for rare illnesses. It had subsequently passed a slew of directions in connection with the treatment of persons with rare diseases, including a direction to notify the National Health Policy for Rare Diseases by March 31 and to set up a National Consortium for Research, Development and Therapeutics, a rare diseases committee at AIIMS, and a fund for such ailments. It had directed that the entire unspent budget allocated for rare diseases for the past three years shall be immediately moved into the rare diseases fund, which shall be managed, supervised and utilised by nodal agency AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/delhi-hc-flays-centre-for-delay-in-transfer-of-unutilised-fund/articleshow/86437036.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||Barred from Delhi eatery for wearing saree, says woman; staff denies||NEW DELHI: The video of an employee of a restaurant, Aquila, at Ansal Plaza telling a customer that the saree was not allowed because it was not a “smart casual” dress went viral on Wednesday. This led to outrage on social media with people berating the restaurant which affected its ratings on a food app. Most people on social media platforms questioned the restaurant for barring the most popular Indian garment. The video posted by the customer garnered over a lakh views and netizens widely ridiculed the restaurant for a dress code that does not recognise saree as either smart or casual or both. The restaurant later defended itself, saying they have allowed the saree in the past and that the customer was being rude. They released video footage suggesting that Anita Choudhary, a journalist, misbehaved with the staff, seemed tipsy and had tried to slap the attendant for which they had to call in their security and stop her from creating a ruckus. Choudhary rubbished Aquila's claims. She said she had booked a table for her daughter’s birthday and had reached the restaurant around 6 pm on Sunday. After being let in, they were asked to wait in the lobby, she said. The restaurant staff took her daughter to a corner and informed her that their family won’t be allowed as their mother was not dressed according to their policy, she claimed. She said this led to an argument as she wanted the staff to show her the rule book and spell out where it stated that the saree was not permitted. Mukesh Singh Bisht of Aquila alleged that the customer had posted just 10 seconds of a clip of an altercation she continued for close to an hour. Bisht said the restaurant staff had asked her to wait with her family as she did not have a reservation in her name and requested for some time to sort it out. Rather than wait, Bisht alleged, Choudhary barged in with her family and started abusing the staff. When she “slapped the staff”, Bisht decided not to let her in. He said that he rues his staff saying in the heat of the moment that the “saree is not smart casuals”. Throughout the ruckus, Bisht said, the restaurant staff kept apologising for no fault of theirs. Choudhary, however, accused the restaurant staff of abusing her. She said she then asked them to take off their mask and say what they had to say on her face rather than abuse from behind the mask. She asked the restaurant staff to say it on camera what they had been saying multiple times in a condescending tone and she captured the woman staffer spelling it out clearly. Choudhary said the family later left for dinner at another restaurant. “What is a smart outfit and who decides is the question I had asked in my social media post. This was an attire decided for me by my daughter whose birthday we had gone to celebrate. I don’t drink, so the restaurant’s claim that I was tipsy is just poor defence. I kept asking for the rule book and they had none to show. This was an insult to the saree, a garment I dearly love,” she said. Restaurateur Priyank Sukhija, who is also the Delhi chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India, said the restaurant staff should always be polite and have a printed rule book in case they want to exercise their right of admission. He said he has a dress code, such as no shorts, open footwear or vest, at some high-end places of his, just as some places reserve the right to not admit children below a certain age. But most of these places, Sukhija says, have a well-defined and printed admission policy. He says communication could have been better. Bisht claimed the restaurant regularly gives admission to people in sarees, suits and kurtas but had to stop Choudhary due to misbehaviour which she countered by saying the restaurant has no proof of this.

Confirming this, the chief medical officer of Morbi, Jayesh Katira, said, “Along with entire health department staff, teachers and other government staff too were engaged in the mega vaccination drive.

---||Chennai||500 employees of this company founded in Chennai turn crorepatis||CHENNAI: Founded in Chennai and now headquartered in California, customer service software maker Freshworks got listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange on Wednesday raising more than $1billion from the public and markets valuing the company roughly at more than $10 billion. In the process, 500 of its employees have become millionaires. The stock traded at a high of $46.67 per share on opening trade on Wednesday, almost 30% up from the listing price of $36. Freshworks’ IPO involves issue of 28.5 million shares (Class A stock) at $36 per share. Owing to positive sentiment, the IPO price was fixed above the expected price range of $32 to $34 per share earlier on Wednesday. In addition, Freshworks has granted underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional of 2.85 million shares of Class A common stock at the IPO price minus underwriting discounts and commissions.  “When we started in Chennai in 2011, we didn’t dream of this…We have increased the audacity of our dreams over time. I am excited about what this means for Indian SaaS and I believe we are going to see more global product companies from India after this,” Freshworks founder Girish Mathrubootham said in a press conference on Wednesday. He added that the IPO gives him a great sense of fulfilment as more than 76% of Freshworks’ employees hold shares in the company and they have earned it. “More than 500 of our employees in India are crorepathis now, and 70 of them are under 30 years of age,” he said. Mathrubootham along with his family and a large “kudumba” of employees and investors of Freshworks rang the bell at the Nasdaq trading floor on Wednesday. Freshworks intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including working capital, operating expenses, and capex, and to scout for inorganic opportunities. As a founder-led business that is free cash flow positive, shrinking its losses and is known for having a great corporate culture, the SaaS firm has received the thumbs up from most SaaS and market analysts. Snowflake, Asana and Zoom are some of the recent SaaS biggies that have had a good run in the US markets. Interestingly, the dollar-based net revenue retention of Freshworks, a measure of customer stickiness, stands at 118% which is a big plus for a company that counts small and mid-size businesses as its largest customer category. Among Freshworks’ key shareholders are Tiger Global and Accel India that own around 26% and 25% respectively. Accel was the first investor to back Freshworks and has consistently backed the company in successive rounds. VC firm Sequoia Capital has a 12% stake in Freshworks, founder Mathrubootham holds around 7%, and Google owns 8% stake in it. Freshworks CFO Tyler Sloat said that while it is natural for VCs to exit over time, the current set of VC investors are extremely bullish on what Freshworks can do in the future. “[It’s an] amazing day for all the founders across the globe in dreaming big and executing towards that dream. Congrats FRSH. Great to have partnered with @mrgirish from day 1 of this company. Go @Accel_India,” Shekhar Kirani of Accel India, the first institutional backer of Freshworks, tweeted. “We are fortunate to be partners in this industry-defining company, along with Accel, Tiger Global and CapitalG. Having led or co-led three financing rounds, our investment in Freshworks represents Sequoia India’s single largest investment from its India/SEA funds,” Mohit Bhatnagar and Carl Eschenbach of Sequoia said in a note. Freshworks is headquartered in San Mateo, California, but majority of its product and engineering staff are based in Chennai. Cognizant and Sify Technologies are the other tech companies with large presence in Chennai and listed on Nasdaq.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/freshworks-raises-1-billion-on-nasdaq-debut-500-employees-turn-millionaires/articleshow/86439001.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai's active Covid cases below 40k, doctors say 2nd wave declining||MUMBAI: The number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dropped below 40,000 on Wednesday, edging closer to the pre-second wave days of February. “The second wave seems to have declined,” said state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. Based on the snapshot of the 18 months of the pandemic in Maharashtra, experts such as Joshi expect the third wave, if it occurs at all, to peak in mid- to late-December. On Wednesday, the daily Covid cases in the state rose to a seven-day high (3,608) even as the total active cases dropped to 39,984. Active cases were lowest this year on February 11 at 30,265. Detailed data released by the state government on Wednesday showed active cases now are about a tenth of that (3.01 lakh) during the first wave’s peak on September 17, 2020. A state government doctor, however, pointed out that last year’s peak followed Ganpati visarjan on September 1, 2020. “If people don’t observe Covid-appropriate behavior right now and if a variant emerges, cases could start rising again,” he said. According to the Covid graph so far, the lull in cases lasts for about three months. After the peak in September 2020, cases continued to drop till February 2021 before rising again. The second wave’s peak was on April 22, with 6.99 lakh active cases. “We have noticed a roughly 100-day gap between the decline of the last wave and the peak of the second wave,” said Joshi. As the second wave has now declined, the next peak could emerge between December and January, he said. Covid cases in Mumbai seem to have plateaued between 350 and 500, with 486 cases registered on Wednesday. Deaths rose to four after a single death registered on Tuesday. The daily positivity rate dropped to 1.2% as the number of tests again increased to 40,484. The state weekly Covid report showed that Pune, Thane, Ahmednagar, Mumbai and Satara accounted for 70% of the cases. “The state health machinery is focused on conducting the ‘tracing, testing and treating’ strategy aggressively in these five districts,” said a state official. The total caseload since March 2020 in Maharashtra stands at 65.3 lakh, including 7.4 lakh in Mumbai. The toll in the same period is 1.4 lakh, including 16,063 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-active-cases-below-40k-docs-say-2nd-wave-declining/articleshow/86439034.cms||---

Writhing in pain she called for help and somehow managed to reach the community health centre. From there she was referred to the district hospital Panna. Both the accused are on the run. The incident came to light when the victim along with her family members rushed to a Community Health Centre (CHC) for treatment.

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Zambian woman held with heroin worth Rs 30 crore at Calicut International Airport||KOZHIKODE: In a major drug bust, directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) officials seized around 5kg of heroin from a Zambian woman who arrived at the Calicut International Airport from Qatar on Wednesday morning. The narcotic drug is estimated to be worth around Rs 30 crore and is the biggest drug haul from the airport in recent years. Based on specific intelligence, office of DRI intercepted Bishala Soko, 40, who had arrived in Qatar Airways flight at 2:25am. It was found during examination that she had stashed three packets of heroin in her check-in baggage. According to officials, Soko, who had an Indian visa for business visit, had reached Doha from Cape Town, South Africa. She told investigators that she had been told to deliver the package brought from Africa to an agent in Kozhikode. Soko was charged under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. She was produced before court and remanded in custody and further investigations were on in connection with the seizure. There have been a series of major drug seizures made by DRI during the last three months from south Indian airports. In July, DRI had nabbed a Tanzanian national with 4.6kg of heroin when he landed at Kochi airport from Dubai. The drug cartels who had been traditionally using the land borders in north India are suspected to have also opened new routes from African countries to South India following disruption of their traditional supply chains due to the mobility restrictions caused by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/zambian-woman-held-with-heroin-worth-rs-30cr/articleshow/86437079.cms||---

Nandlal Kesarsingh, the company chairman, has been brought to Aurangabad on transit remand by the city police. On Wednesday, the police requested the duped investors to come forward to lodge complaints. Earlier, acting on a complaint of one investor, the Osmanapura police had booked Kesarsingh and five others for cheating and violation of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act among other charges. All the accused are from Mumbai “Some of the investors had opted for policies of the company — named Phenomenal Healthcare — since 2005. The firm used to ask the investors to deposit Rs 350 each month for a period of 20 months, on assurance of guaranteed attractive returns. Many investors claim they did not receive the money after maturity of their policies,” police said. Besides Aurangabad, Latur and Osmanabad among other places in Maharashtra have witnessed registration of offence against Kesarsingh and his aides, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/eow-nabs-head-of-company-that-duped-investors-of-crores/articleshow/86432676.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Court discharges IPL betting accused||Ahmedabad: A special CBI court here discharged an accused, Chandresh Patel, from the IPL betting racket case, in which suspended joint director of the Enforcement Directorate, J P Singh, along with other officials and middlemen were accused of corruption while probing the money-laundering charges against Afroz Fatta and cricket bookies. Advocate Rohit Verma, appearing for the accused, submitted that even if the entire chargesheet is perused, there is no evidence much less prima facie evidence that frames charges of corruption and conspiracy against Patel. The chargesheet only attributes that Patel had a knowledge about the alleged offence, but it does not assign any role to him. He questioned the credibility of statements made by one Anil Naukar, a bookie who has given two versions. The CBI opposed Patel’s discharge application, submitting that the probe had revealed that Patel had entered into criminal conspiracy with co-accused and collected Rs 1.5 crore from Naukar for settlement of his dispute through Singh. After hearing the case, special judge V R Raval noted that the statement of witnesses were recorded after a year, and there was no document to suggest that the accused had accepted and delivered money. The court concluded that there was no prima facie case against Patel that he acted as a middleman for the bookie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-discharges-ipl-betting-accused/articleshow/86439496.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Saw IAS officer handle Lalu Yadav’s spittoon in Bihar, says BJP leader Uma Bharti||BHOPAL: BJP leader Uma Bharti’s ‘bureaucracy carries our slippers’ remark was still triggering shockwaves, despite her expression of “anguish at her own words”, when she came up with another controversial statement on Tuesday, saying she had seen an IAS officer pick up Lalu Prasad’s spittoon. In 25 staccato tweets, Bharti sought to remind bureaucrats that they “weren’t domestic servants” of any political party, and advised officialdom to stay away from the “nexus of corrupt officials and inefficient netas in power”. In one of her tweets, she said she wanted to carry forward a “meaningful debate” on bureaucracy. Then, she brought up Lalu’s spittoon. 8-B)लालू यादव जी ने मेरे ही सामने अपने पीकदान में ही थूका एवं उस वरिष्ठ आईएएस अधिकारी के हाथ में थमाकर उसको खिड़की… https://t.co/s5YtvSz81G— Uma Bharti (@umasribharti) 1632228078000Bharti said that in year 2000, when she was Union minister for tourism, she had travelled in a chopper with the then Bihar CM Rabri Devi and her husband Lalu Prasad. “A senior IAS officer was in the front seat when Lalu spit into a spittoon and passed it on to him to place it under the seat. The IAS officer obliged,” she said. Bharti added that in the 2005-06 polls, when she was in charge of Bihar, she made the spittoon an election issue, and told administrative officials, “today they handle his spittoon and tomorrow they would have to handle ours”. “I asked them to keep in mind their pride and focus on pen stands and files instead of spittoons,” she tweeted. 9-A) इसलिये 2005-06 में जब मुझे बिहार का प्रभारी बनाया गया और बिहार के पिछड़ेपन के साथ मैंने पीकदान को भी मुद्दा ब… https://t.co/h36QMmNEC5— Uma Bharti (@umasribharti) 1632228079000Bharti went on to narrate her experiences with the “changing colours of bureaucracy”. “When I returned from Bihar, Babulal Gaur was the chief minister and the bureaucrats would still hang around her house. But soon, I was removed from the party and Gaur too was displaced as CM. The bureaucracy started running away from my shadow. The changing colours of the bureaucracy left me wondering and amused,” she tweeted. This is dangerous for democracy, she cautioned, reminding officers that they are “bound by rules and regulations and only have to implement policies”. “You don’t have to become a political tool,” she remarked. “Bureaucrats of all states must resolve that they are officers and are here to serve people, they aren’t domestic servants of some political party,” the former CM said. “Afsar shahi desh nahi chalne deti (bureaucracy doesn’t allow the country to run) has often become a security ring for inefficient politicians in power. But have you ever heard this from PM Narendra Modi,” she said. On Monday, a video of Bharti had gone viral where she was heard saying that bureaucracy has no “aukat” and that it “picks up politicians’ slippers”. She expressed regret the same evening, tweeting: “I am anguished that I used ‘ansanyat’ (intemperate) language when my intentions were good. I have learnt a lesson that one should talk properly even while talking informally in public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/saw-ias-officer-handle-lalu-yadavs-spittoon-in-bihar-says-uma-bharti/articleshow/86437054.cms||---

---||Bhopal||BJP misleads people on the basis of religion, says Diggy||Bhopal: Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Wednesday claimed the Union home ministry, while replying to an RTI query, said the concept of a “threat to Hinduism” is imaginary. “The ministry has no information on such a threat in the country” -- this was revealed by Digvijaya, while he was addressing the Congress party’s ‘kisan kranti padhyatra’ in Sehore, which marched through 100 villages in the district. The former chief minister also tweeted the same claim about the Union home ministry’s reply on his Twitter account. Addressing the congregation of Congress workers and farmers of Sehore, Digvijaya said, “I have a friend Manish Jabalpura who lives in Nagpur. And through an RTI, he asked Union home minister Amit Shah’s department if there is a threat to Hindu religion. The ministry said it is imaginary and it has no information about such a threat.” Digvijaya argued that BJP has been misleading people on the basis of religion to garner votes. “I have not made the comment on the threat to Hindu religion, it is Amit Shah’s department that replied to the RTI,” he said. He also asserted that BJP insists Muslims have four wives and give birth to dozens of children. “They keep reiterating that in 10 or 20 years, Hindus will become a minority and Muslims will be the majority in the country. I challenge BJP to a debate on this. A report has come on the Census, which says that since 1951, the birth rate of Muslims has been steadily decreasing in the country. At present, the birth rate in the Muslim community is 2.7% while in Hindus it is 2.3%,” he said.  Digvijaya said by 2028, the birth rates of Hindus and Muslims will be equal and thereafter the demographic structure and population will stabilise in India. “BJP says there is a threat to Hindus and Owaisi says there is a threat to Muslims. Truth is, the threat is only to Narendra Modi and Asaduddin Owaisi. No one else is under threat,” Digvijaya added. He further said, “We are suppressed even as BJP tells lies. Congress workers cannot speak the truth. Those who want to be afraid, stay at home. Those who want to put up a fight, come to the field.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-misleads-people-on-the-basis-of-religion-says-diggy/articleshow/86437085.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Marathwada this year surpasses 2005’s record rainfall tally||AURANGABAD: The latest showers have taken the average rainfall count in Marathwada to 864 mm by Wednesday, which is more than the recent record rainfall of 836 mm observed in 2005. While the region has been witnessing one of the wettest monsoons this time, the official forecast of more rain in at least the next couple of days is expected to further increase the rainfall tally of the region. Amid widespread rainfall across eight districts of the region over the 24-hour period ending by Wednesday morning, Aurangabad city and many other parts of the region reported occasional spells of moderate to heavy showers over next 12 hours. As per official data, Nanded district has registered the highest rainfall in Marathwada since June 1 (1,023 mm), which accounts for 133% of expected showers, followed by Jalna district (958 mm, 169%), Parbhani district (945mm, 132%), Hingoli (919 mm, 122%), Beed (814 mm, 156%), Aurangabad (783 mm, 145%), Latur (760mm, 116%) and Osmanabad (652 mm, 118%), show official data. Marathwada, as a whole, has received 864 mm rainfall so far since the beginning of the monsoon, which accounts for 136% of expected showers. Shriniwas Aundhkar, the director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, here, said the likelihood of an extended rainy season could produce record showers for the region in recent times. “Amid fears of deficient monsoon due to lull in rainfall during August, Marathwada has received surplus showers across the region, because of the low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal in the recent past. The extended run of monsoon together with its withdrawal phase is likely to make Marathwada wetter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mwada-this-year-surpasses-2005s-record-rainfall-tally/articleshow/86432710.cms||---

It registered an overall decrease in consumer anxiety to 34% in India, while it saw heightened levels in anxiety in US, Australia and UK. “With the festive season around the corner and lower Covid-19 cases, Indian consumers are showing lower levels of anxiety, resulting in their willingness to increase spending on more discretionary items,” said the survey adding that consumers are seen actively spending on cable TV, clothing and footwear apart from items like electronics, furnishings, alcohol and restaurants. Only 30% respondents were concerned about physically interacting with a salesperson, which showed increasing customer confidence, the report said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Army doctors use novel technique to mend jaw of 26-yr-old youth||NEW DELHI: Doctors at Army Dental Centre Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi recently performed reconstruction of the jaw bone of a 26-year-old man, son of a serving Army personnel posted in Jammu and Kashmir, using a custom-made titanium implant. Colonel Vivek Saxena, head of the maxillofacial surgery unit, said the technique was new in India. “It involves implanting a 3D printed, customised titanium bone replacement where mirroring of the opposite normal bone/mandible is done and, hence, the fit, comfort and provision of giving dentures is available, which no other technique offers,” said Saxena, who was part of the operating team. “First, there is no donor site morbidity as no bone is taken out from the patient’s body. Second, recovery is faster, which is important for soldiers, and third, the cosmetic and functional output is unmatched to earlier procedures,” he said. Conventionally, this surgery involves using a segment of bone from the hip or the leg, which leads to morbidity in terms of walking problems, he said. Army Dental Centre, the doctor said, gets 20-25 patients annually who require reconstructive surgeries in the jaw bone and the face. A tumour had destroyed the patient’s lower jaw, which was removed a year ago. He has been discharged, a doctor said. The team of surgeons was headed by the director general of Army Dental Corps, lieutenant general N K Sahoo. He said the technique might be used for some similar cases caused by mucormycosis post-Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/army-docs-use-novel-technique-to-mend-jaw-of-26-yr-old-youth/articleshow/86439156.cms||---

She dialled the number not realising that it belonged to a fraudster. The man who took her order over the phone told her to pay Rs2,000 through a digital payment wallet to an account number that he sent on WhatsApp. When she tried to make the payment, her wallet showed the transaction had failed. The money was debited from her bank account though and she told the man about it. He told her to try again and provided another account number. This time the transaction succeeded. The fraudster said it it was necessary to “register” her transaction on the digital wallet for generating a bill. He told her to enter an amount of Rs19,236 into the wallet and send it with a note “Register payment for Sona Wines”. The amount was debited. On inquiry with the fraudster, the woman was told to repeat the payment with the note “Repeat payment Sona Wines to my account”. Again, the amount was debited. She was then told to send double the amount (Rs38,472), which she did, and lost her money again. “By now, the doctor was livid at losing the money and yelled at the fraudster. He promised to initiate a refund and sent Rs10 to her bank account. This transfer came from a digital wallet registered in the name of a cake shop,” said a police officer. The fraudster pretended he was trying to refund the balance and asked for her credit card details. He shared his card details so that she would trust him. “He repeatedly asked for OTPs while trying to use her card online. She shared one OTP and lost Rs62,138,” said the officer. The doctor approached Malad police with her bank statement and WhatsApp chats, following which a case of cheating was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doc-loses-rs-1-4l-to-cyber-fraudster-on-wine-bottle-order/articleshow/86439214.cms||---

While one trader, a resident of Vastrapur, was conned out of Rs 49.9 lakh, the other, a resident of Bapunagar, was duped of Rs 11.2 lakh. Registering a complaint with Kagdapith police, Surendra Agarwal, a 56-year-old from Vastrapur, said that Ravindra Kathewa, a resident of Maninagar who runs Rajani textile shop in New Cloth Market, had purchased various cloth material from him between January 2019 and February 2021, and failed to pay Rs 49.9 lakh. In the second complaint, Manu Savaliya, 31, told police that he produced and supplied masks. While looking for material supplier, he contacted Fiberwebindia Limited on July 15. He stated that he contacted the company by email and received a quotation of Rs 1,000 per kg and 12% GST extra. “He called the company and the person who received the call identified himself as Mukesh Pandya and sought 100% advance. I ordered 1 tonne material and asked him to email the bank details to me. On July 16, I got the performa invoice and the account details. I transferred Rs 11.20 lakh through NEFT. However, Pandya claimed that the money had been sent sent to an ICICI account while the company had an account with the Bank of Baroda,” he told police. Savaliya said that Pandya had cheated him by giving wrong information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traders-duped-in-two-separate-incidents/articleshow/86437158.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After Giri’s death, demand for probe into akhara land deals, property disputes||Haridwar: Days after the death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief Narendra Giri following a longstanding property dispute with his disciple, many associated with the multiple asharms and akharas in Haridwar have demanded that all land deals made by akharas and their seers should be investigated. TOI had earlier reported that Giri and his disciple, Anand Giri — named in the former’s suicide note and now under arrest for abetment to suicide — were embroiled in a bitter property dispute, with Anand opposing Giri’s decision to sell land of Baghambari mutt in UP to individuals. Most of the land owned by akharas — there are 13 of them in the country, with ABAP as their apex body — is either acquired at highly concessional prices or gifted for social and religious causes by patrons. Temples are often built on these donated lands. In the recent past, there have been allegations in Haridwar that akharas are illegally selling their land for commercial use. Social activist J P Badoni told TOI that he has filed several Right to Information (RTI) applications over the years on sale of land and property by the akharas. “I have evidence of wrongdoing and I have written several letters to the authorities. Akharas have sold land for personal purposes. A high level inquiry should be initiated by the government in this matter.” Property disputes have often been at the centre of several controversies surrounding the akharas and their seers. Many of the akharas have been involved in using their land for commercial use with the help of property dealers. Niranjani akhara in which Mahant Narendra Giri held key posts had faced allegations of selling its land after making flats. TOI had reported earlier that Nirmal akhara, a prominent akhara situated in the Kankhal area of Haridwar, had facilitated construction of almost 150 flats on an area of around 12 bigha on its property through a builder. This was done even though the akhara, as per records available with the Haridwar Roorkee Development Authority (HRDA), was only given permission to construct dwellings for housing its seers. According to sources, the land was handed over to a builder who constructed 2, 3 and 4 BHK flats on the land. These flats were later sold for amounts ranging from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 45 lakh. The distribution of the money that is earned through such deals often becomes a source of dispute between the akhara seers. “Even though many social activists have raised this issue, no conclusive action has been taken so far by the authorities concerned. Over the years, many seers have been murdered over property disputes,” said activist Ratan Mani Dobhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-giris-death-demand-for-probe-into-akhara-land-deals-property-disputes/articleshow/86434848.cms||MS Nawaz

In this case, Parthiji Chavda, resident of Bilodara village in Mansa, was a monk turned drug mule and peddler. Chavda was just 18 when he renounced the world and became a monk. “After he became a monk, he was surrounded by other monks and used to prepare ganja chillums (pipes) for his gurus. He too began smoking ganja and got addicted,” said an officer of the special operations group (SOG) of Gandhinagar police, who caught Chavda with 256g of ganja from his one-room house near Vihar Crossroads in Mansa. He was a monk for around 40 years and later returned to his village and gave up his monastic life. He then began begging for alms but it was hard for him to satisfy his urge for ganja. He met some drug peddlers two months ago and was hired as a drug mule for which they would to give him some money and ganja as payment. Police officers said that they got an input that Chavda was selling ganja to some truck drivers passing through Vihar crossroads. “He was given a room near a hotel in Mansa on the Mehsana-Himmatnagar highway where he used to sell ganja to people,” said an officer.

Hospitals across the city are already seeing patients being admitted with dengue and malaria. Now that water puddles have been created everywhere after the torrential rain over the past few days, doctors have warned that there might be a rise in the number of the vector-borne diseases in the days ahead as accumulated water served as the breeding ground for mosquitoes. Abhirup Saha, a resident of James Long Sarani in Behala, had been down with fever three days before he was hospitalized. When the fever did not subside despite medication and his condition kept deteriorating, he was admitted to Peerless Hospital on Monday. On testing, the teenager was found to be dengue positive and his platelet count revealed to be dangerously low. “Platelet was transfused to the patient but he died on Tuesday, barely 14 hours after being hospitalized. We have a few more dengue and malaria cases. Last year, we did not get a single case of dengue,” said Sudipta Mitra CEO Peerless Hospital. According to a source, Abhirup was admitted with a Baranagar address. “This kind of rain that allows water accumulation provides for the ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. We might witness a spurt in the number of dengue and malaria patients in the next couple of weeks. Dengue particularly starts rearing its head by September and cases peak in October. But hopefully, the number should not reach an alarming proportion, like the outbreaks we saw in pre-Covid times,” said Institute of Child Health (ICH) associate professor of paediatrics Prabhas Prasun Giri. “As far as children are concerned, only a handful of dengue cases have been reported at our hospital so far. One child was admitted to PICU.” Internal medicine and critical care specialist Sujoy Mukherjee of CMRI pointed out that due to the Covid scene last year, not many other infectious or topical diseases had been reported. “But now, we have started getting not only dengue and malaria patients but also those diagnosed with scrub typhus. We should be seeing more of these cases till October, but the number is likely to decline from November,” said Mukherjee. Almost all hospitals across the city currently have a few malaria and dengue patients under treatment. “We need to keep our surroundings clean and not allow water to stagnate. Even a small quantity of stagnant water in a broken piece of pot can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” added Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/19-year-old-boy-citys-first-dengue-victim-this-year/articleshow/86437262.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MVA plans to reply to graft charges with action against ex-BJP ministers||MUMBAI: Alarmed by the damage caused to the Maha Vikas Aghadi’s image by allegations of corruption, senior MVA leaders had a meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar following Wednesday’s cabinet meet for drafting a strategy to take on the BJP. The strategy that has emerged is to initiate action against BJP’s cabinet ministers from the erstwhile state government led by Devendra Fadnavis, a senior minister told TOI. “We met after the weekly cabinet meeting. The general view was that a section of BJP leaders was making baseless allegations against cabinet members, and the MVA had been unable to give a fitting reply. As a result, the image of the MVA government has been adversely affected. Thackeray and Pawar have granted the green signal to initiate action against former BJP cabinet members. The responsibility of drafting the strategy has been entrusted to three cabinet members,” the minister said. The minister said the strategy team will have one member each from Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. “The team has swung into action, and results will be visible in a day or two. In the past too, attempts were made to expose BJP’s ex-cabinet members, but in the absence of approval from the political leadership, no decision was taken,” the minister said. BJP leaders have made corruption charges against transport minister Anil Parab, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif and former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Elaborating on the strategy, the minister said the Anti-Corruption Bureau has already launched a probe into Fadnavis’s dream project, the Jalyukta Shivar scheme, while a committee has been set up to probe the then forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar’s massive tree plantation programme. In addition, the minister alleged several irregularities had been found in the employment guarantee scheme and in the medical education department earlier led by BJP leader Girish Mahajan. “The probe against two BJP leaders is in its final stages, and we are sure law-enforcing agencies will soon initiate criminal proceedings,” the minister said, adding major projects have been identified for investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-plans-to-reply-to-graft-charges-with-action-against-ex-bjp-ministers/articleshow/86439343.cms||---

In a recent circular, the state primary education department said it aims to open English medium schools for students who have dropped out of self-financed schools due to Covid-19. “Presently, about 98% of government-run schools are Gujarati-medium ones. Many English-medium students had to quit their studies in private schools due to financial reasons and join Gujarati medium school or drop out of schooling. These new schools are aimed at giving a breather to these children,” said sources in the state education department. Like other government-run schools, education will be free of cost in these schools too, he added. From the time Covid-19 struck the state in March 2020, about 5 lakh schoolchildren in Gujarat have left private schools. According to data maintained by the state education department, 2.82 lakh students left private schools in 2020-21 academic year. The government is presently collecting data at the district level to find out the number of students in the area who have dropped out of studies. “Based on this data, the government will find out how many schools are to be set up and the number of teaching staff required,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/english-medium-lifeline-in-offing/articleshow/86437267.cms||---

The school education department is also conducting special camps at institutes to vaccinate more than 3,000 teachers and staffers of city private schools who are yet to get their second dose. The drive is likely to be over by the weekend. Of the 3.5 lakh teachers in Bengal, around 50,000 are yet to get their second dose. Amid talks of possible reopening of educational institutes after the festival season provided Covid numbers remain low, the school education department has set a target to completely vaccinate all its teachers. In June, the Bengal government had notified the vaccination drive for schoolteachers and staffers for government, government-aided as well as private schools in Kolkata and Bengal. “We had sought details from schools on the vaccination requirements. The details have been submitted,” an official said. A senior official pointed out that inoculation programmes for administering the first dose on teaching and non-teaching staff in Kolkata as well as the districts were taken up in June. The school education department recently prepared a complete database of teachers who are yet to get their second shot. “Before bringing students back to campuses, we aim to vaccinate all teachers and non-teaching staff at schools,” he said. Sougata Basu, general secretary, West Bengal Government Schoolteachers’ Association, said, “This could have been completed earlier had the gap between two Covishield not been revised to 84 days. Now, when the Centre is talking about vaccine for children, we hope that secondary and upper-secondary students can also be inoculated before reopening.” At DPS Ruby Park, a vaccination drive has been conducted for the past three days. “We thank the state government for their initiative to vaccinate all private school teaching and non-teaching staff free of cost. In spite of the inclement weather, the beneficiaries came for their second dose. Our school was a centre for the past three days,” an official said. Jadavpur Vidyapith headmaster Parimal Bhattacharya said, “All teaching and non-teaching staff of our school have been vaccinated. Very few are waiting for their second dose but they were administered the vaccine by the department in the first week of September. We are waiting for the government notice for reopening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/spl-vax-drive-on-for-school-teachers-staff/articleshow/86437273.cms||---

They were instructed to share their location using their Thuraya satellite phone once they entered the Sri Lankan waters. “They were using a Thuraya phone and were told to share their location once they entered Sri Lankan waters using a VHF channel. Their bosses, who they know as Imam Bakhsh, Khan Sahab and Ghulam, did not tell them who they had to deliver the consignment to,” said an ATS officer. The ATS officer said Imam Bakhsh and Khan are citizens of Iran and Ghulam is from Pakistan. “Before starting their journey, all seven crew members had met the three at Imam Bakhsh’ residence in Konarak city, Iran,” said the officer. He said the three men had promised them around 200,000 Saudi riyals for a successful trip. “They had reached south of Mumbai and were waiting for instruction. When they were heading towards Sri Lanka, they got a signal to stay in Indian waters till further instructions. Their bosses then told them that they would have to deliver the consignment to Punjab after landing either in Maharashtra or Gujarat,” the officer said. While waiting for the signal from their bosses, they stayed in Indian waters for around four days, during which the ATS got an input about the ship and the accused were caught in an operation by the Indian Coast Guard (ICG), said the officer. ATS officers said the crew members had smuggled heroin to various countries earlier as well, regarding which an investigation is under way. The seven accused were produced before a local court by ATS, which sought custodial interrogation of 14 days.

Police said that despite a decent income, the man had taken to crime to pay off gambling debts. The cops also arrested a jeweller who was purchasing the stolen items from Harish. Police said that Harish alias Monu, a graduate in hotel management, was debt-ridden following losses in online gambling. They recovered four gold chains, some other jewellery items and four phones along with a country-made pistol with which Harish threatened his targets. Police said Harish’s modus operandi was to snatch valuables and then run shouting, "Chor! chor!", misleading the people around. During interrogation, Harish disclosed that he had fenced three gold chains to a goldsmith in Neb Sarai. Based on this information, Rajender Agarwal, the receiver of stolen property, was also arrested, police said. Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said the criminal went for his forays usually in Saket, Ambedkar Nagar and near MB Road. “He mostly targeted women out on morning or evening walks or someone going to office at odd hours,” said Thakur. “We gathered information about Harish for more than one month and scanned hundreds of clips from CCTV cameras. The investigators finally learnt that Harish would come to the City Forest at MB Road on another snatching adventure. Accordingly, we made plans to intercept him. At around 7.30pm that day, after spotting him, our teams swung into action and nabbed him. We recovered a country-made pistol from him.” The DCP said that at least 14 cases of theft and snatchings and some related to the Arms Act had been solved with the arrest. The cops learnt that Harish had completed his graduation from Delhi University through distance education in 2006. He also completed a three-year degree course in hotel management from a renowned institute in Delhi the same year. After his studies, he began working at a luxury hotel. Explaining why he had indulged in crime even when he had a job with a good salary, Harish told the cops that around two years ago he began gambling on an online app. He lost money and soon ran up a huge debt. “To pay his debts, he opted for the easy way by snatching the gold chain and mobile phones,” Thakur said. Harish had also taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh from a private bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hotel-staffer-by-day-snatcher-at-night-/articleshow/86439415.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, disciples and political leaders join nagar yatra of Mahant Narendra Giri at Prayagraj’s Bagambari Math||PRAYAGRAJ: The last journey of Mahant Narendra Giri, president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad who died by suicide on Tuesday, was taken out in the city from Bagambari Gaddi Math to Sangam and back on Wednesday morning. After the body’s postmortem was conducted by a team of five experts at SRN hospital, his mortal remains were handed over to the office bearers of the Niranjani Akhara. They were then transferred into an open vehicle decorated with flowers. Thereafter, the nagar yatra (procession) proceeded to Sangam, and later in the day, Giri was given bhoo samadhi on the premises of Bagambari Gaddi Math. A large number of his disciples, locals and several political leaders, including deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, joined the procession. At Sangam, his body was bathed in Ganga before being taken to the Math. On the way, the procession took a brief halt at Bade Hanuman Temple where Giri had served as the chief mahant. After returning to the Math, Giri was given bhoo samadhi in a huge pit dug near a lemon tree in the open garden of the Math. This was a wish mentioned by Giri in his long suicide note. His body was kept in a square-shaped cave which was prepared at one side of the huge pit. As soon as his mortal remains reached the Math, members of the Niranjani Akhara, his disciples, including his close aide Balbeer Giri whom Giri has named as his successor in his suicide note, placed it inside the cave. The entire area was covered by a large saffron cloth which was later removed. Several ceremonious items like honey, sandalwood paste, Tulsi leaves, Ganga jal (placed inside the mouth), religious books and kamandal were kept next to him. Thereafter, several layers of salt and sweets were also placed. The entire ceremony, which lasted for around half-an-hour, was held amid chanting of vedic mantras, keeping with the traditions of the Akhara. Although several seers and members of the Akhara were present at the ceremony, it was Balbeer Giri who performed the rituals. After this, several seers present at the site offered their homage by offering a handful of soil on the mortal remains. The pit was then fully filled with soil. Earlier in the day, saints and seers had reached Sangam city from various corners of the country for the last darshan of Mahant Narendra Giri and to participate in the ceremonies. These included seers and mahamandaleshwars of the 13 akharas who are part of the ABAP. Schools upto class 12th were closed in the district on Wednesday in view of the huge turnout of locals for the ceremony. Secretary of Panchayati Akhara Shri Niranjani, Shri Mahant Ravindra Puri told TOI, “The saint can be given samadhi by two forms, either jal (water) samadhi or bhoo (land) samadhi. As it is the moral duty of us to protect the river from any kind of pollution, and since it was the wish of Mahant Giri, we decided to give him bhoo samadhi. The body was kept in a sitting posture, as if he is meditating, and all the offerings, including gems, flowers, honey, milk, sugar and salt, were offered to the body before the same was fully covered by soil.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dy-cm-disciples-and-political-leaders-join-nagar-yatra-of-mahant-narendra-giri/articleshow/86436646.cms||Rajeev Mani

Going by this rate, health officials are confident of vaccinating one crore more people in the next 10 days if vaccine supply continues to be regular and in adequate quantity. In such a case, around 65% of the eligible population are expected to be covered by at least one dose before the Durga Puja and the state might complete vaccinating its eligible population of seven crore people with both the doses by December. “We could administer around 33 lakh jabs in three days despite the relentless rain. So, we hope to cover one crore more people in 10 days. To complete full vaccination of the seven crore eligible people in Bengal, we need two to three months and sufficient doses of vaccine in hand. We have already administered more than 5 crore doses and the remaining 9 crore doses will require three months. Now let us see how steady the supply of vaccine doses is in the days to come,” said Bengal director health services Ajay Chakraborty. Bengal has about seven crore people above 18 years of age who are eligible to take the anti-Covid jab. Altogether about 14 crore doses have to be administered as each recipient has to be administered two doses for complete vaccination. However, a section of health officials felt achieving the full-vaccination target by December could be a little ambitious. “No doubt we should be close to 100% vaccination by December if the doses keep arriving on regular basis and also in good quantity. But it could take as long as February or March to cover the entire eligible population as we will still have some people trickling in for their second dose at later dates,” said a Swasthya Bhawan health official. With the supply of vaccine doses regularizing, both in terms of quantity and frequency, health officials have also stepped up the inoculation drive since the beginning of this month. In the first 18 days, one crore jabs were administered. Despite the downpour and flooding on Tuesday, over 11 lakh vaccine doses were administered from 4,387 centres across the state, making Bengal the best performer of the day, followed by UP in the second spot with about 10 lakh doses. On Wednesday, too, Bengal inched towards 6 lakh doses. The state got a fresh supply of 14 lakh vaccine doses on Wednesday evening. “We had 25 lakh doses on Wednesday morning. Because of better stock in our hand, we could allow districts to expand the inoculation drives there. How we step up our inoculation drive will depended on the interval and quantum of vaccine supply. But we should be able to go steady with about 6 lakh doses a day on an average for now,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-targets-1-cr-more-cov-jabs-in-next-10-days/articleshow/86437287.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chennai||29-year-old dies in Tamil Nadu, Dalit wife suspects caste killing||CHENNAI: The Arani police have filed a case of supected death after S Amlu, 29, a dalit woman, filed a complaint saying that her husband who was visiting his family had died at Karani village in Tiruvallur district last Friday and his body was cremated by his family without informing her.  A Gowthaman, 29, who hails from the vanniyar community, married the woman last year against the wishes of his family. In a complaint lodged with the Arani police on Wednesday, the woman said her husband received a call from his sister last Friday (September 17) about the death of a relative. Gowthaman, who immediately left for his village, didn’t return till Monday. After her efforts to contact him failed, Amlu sent her brother Praveen to the village to look for her husband. Upon reaching the village, Praveen saw Gowthaman’s obituary posters pasted in the village which said that he had died on Friday.  Enquiries with the villagers revealed that the family had cremated his body on the same day without informing police and Amlu. After the Arani police booked a case under CrPC 174 (suspicious death) and IPC 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence committed), five of Gowthaman’s family members father Annamalai, mother Akila, brother Srinivasan, and sisters, Gomathi and Manimegalai, have gone missing. According to police, Amlu, a nurse at a city hospital and a resident of Ponneri, fell in love with Gowthaman after they met in a train. Since she was a dalit, Gowthaman's family objected to their wedding. But the couple went ahead and got married on September 4, 2019. They stayed at a rented house in Teynampet. Every Sunday, Gowthaman used to visit his village to meet his family. But after his family started pestering him to abandon Amlu and marry another girl from vanniyar community, he stopped visiting them. Amlu delivered a baby girl on August 18, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/29-yr-old-dies-in-tn-dalit-wife-suspects-caste-killing/articleshow/86439395.cms||Sindhu Kannan

The bomb disposal squad opened the object through a controlled blast they undertook near the island suspecting it to be containing explosives. Superintendent of police Kutch (west) Saurabh Singh said, “It was low grade explosive, which we believe had come here unintentionally and could have separated during naval exercise from Pakistan side.” Singh further stated that there was no detonator and hence could not explode on its own. “There is no logic to send such kind of explosive near Jakhau island. If there was high tide, the object would have gone back into the sea. DNT is also used for blasting in industry,” he added. Earlier, fishermen found a suspected box and an object and informed marine police. A team of intelligence bureau and border security force also joined the investigation. The empty box was used to keep ammunition, said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/suspect-object-contained-low-grade-explosive-police/articleshow/86435086.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Sandalwood aroma fills Saurashtra||RAJKOT: Soon, the globe will bask in the fragrance of Saurashtra’s sandalwood. While it may still take sometime for the region to compete with the sandalwood basket down South, but promises of its popularity already wafts in the efforts. In the past years, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Devbhumi Dwarka district farmers started to experiment with sandalwood farming. While they will have to wait for a decade more to smell success, the efforts seem to be going in the right direction. And going by nursery peoples’ claims, at least 2,000 farmers in Saurashtra region are expecting to fill their coffers will sweet fragrances. Madhu Changani has been running a nursery of sandalwood in Dhutarpar village of Jamnagar district for the past few years. He brings seeds from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and nurtures these in a greenhouse within controlled environment. The saplings are transplanted later in the field. “Nearly 2,000 farmers in Saurashtra who brought saplings from me and are successfully cultivating sandalwood are connected with me. In forests, sandalwood tree takes 30 years to mature, but if it is cultivated in a planned manner, the tree matures in half the time in 15 years,” Changani told TOI. Sandalwood occupies a premium place in Indian culture and has wide usage in various rituals. Not only the wood, but oil extracted from it too enjoys a huge market in cosmetic, pharmaceutical, aromatherapy and perfumery industry. According to farmers, there are special market yards in Karnataka for the sale of sandalwood. One kilo wood fetches anything between Rs 5,000 and 7,000 price while its oil sells for Rs 1.5 lakh per kg. Dandalwood cultivation cost is, however, very high. Gordhan Lakkad, farmer of Dhoraji taluka who was honoured by the social forestry circle of forest department said, “Once sowing is completed, it requires only Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 every year for maintenance.” Suresh Moradiya, a farmer of Patanvav village of Dhoraji taluka in Rajkot district has cultivated 600 sandalwood trees in the past five years. “It’s a one-time cultivation investment that costs around Rs 20,000 per acre — from digging pits to providing fertilizer. However, farmers who have proper irrigation facility can only take up sandalwood farming, not those who are dependent on monsoon,” said Moradiya, Farmer Bhogabhai Dharevada of Lalpur taluka in Jamnagar district has planted 700 sandalwood trees. He said, “For farmers who have vast barren land, this tree comes as a blessing. Even horticulture farmers can cultivate it provided they can spare a few acres for this tree.” Deputy conservator of forest, Rajkot Ravi Prasad Radhakrishna told TOI, “This tree needs special care because it’s prone to environmental fluctuation. Even if a few trees don’t develop the heartwood, the normal wood too has a good market as it’s used in rituals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sandalwood-aroma-fills-saurashtra/articleshow/86435123.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Nagpur||Forged attendance, wage bills to fore in running rooms at Ballarshah||Nagpur: Even as a vigilance raid exposed bunglings at two running rooms – Godavari and Tapti – operated by Nagpur division of Central Railway at Ballarshah, more irregularities, like claiming wages by forging attendance, have come to fore. On September 6, 2021, a five-member vigilance team from Mumbai raided the two running rooms and seized many documents. Papers with TOI show several workers (bearers) engaged by Ambika Caterers & Decorators, Danapur (Bihar), in these running rooms claimed full wages even after remaining absent. Moreover, some workers are never seen on duty but marked present, and claim full wages, allegedly with the blessings of contractor’s man and supervisor A Parmeshwar, who was caught red-handed accepting a bribe of Rs3,500 from a worker during vigilance raid. Take the case of bearer Sumed Taksande. Papers show he was on leave from April 9-19, 2021, to work for a firm in Hyderabad. He returned after 11 days but was marked present in the muster book and was paid wages for entire month. Taksande was unavailable for comments. In another case, a worker Yona Boli was abruptly removed from the job by supervisor A Parmeshwar in early April. However, his name remained on the muster rolls and wages were paid for entire April and also May. His name appears on rolls even in June. Boli’s wages are deposited in the account of one Yash Lokalwar, who is engaged in neighboring TTE room at Ballarshah. “How is Lokalwar paid wages when his name doesn’t figure in the list of employees at the two running rooms?” said sources. “I’m really surprised that my name is still on rolls. I was removed from service and did not work from April 1. We bearers are asked to work for 8 hours and paid a paltry wage of Rs183 per day, which comes to Rs5,500 per month. Though the wage slip mentioned an amount of Rs7,900-8,000, we had to return the remaining amount by 3rd of every month in cash to Parmeshwar,” said Boli. Workers told TOI there were several workers who never attended duty but were paid wages regularly. Apart from the contractor’s muster book, the railway caretakers also maintain a register of these employees. However, there is complete mismatch in attendance in both books. Caretakers register shows manager of contractor B Shayamsundar did not visit the running room for a year but got regular wages. One Yogesh Butala was never seen for the past eight months yet got payment. Parmeshwar himself visits irregularly. Yet their attendance is marked present in the muster book. The Central Railway has posted Annam Venkateshwarlu, a chief loco inspector (safety category staff), who should work on field but he is doing administrative work. Under alleged pressure, there is complete failure of railway staff in controlling irregularities. This is despite the contractor’s muster book being verified by the chief loco inspector (CLI). Venkateshwarlu runs a LIC agency in his wife’s name and pays more attention to getting policies of the staff. Venkateshwarlu refuted the charge. Sources said SECR has 4 crew controllers of Rs4,200-grade pay and one in charge with Rs4,800-grade pay for 70-bedded running room near Nagpur station, but at Ballarshah, which has over 240 beds, incompetent staff has been posted for supervision. “This has worked to the advantage of the contractor,” they said. Central Railway spokesperson & ACM SG Rao’s comments were not forthcoming on these irregularities. Rao only said, “Any action will depend on the report submitted by vigilance department. We are yet to receive the report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forged-attendance-wage-bills-to-fore-in-running-rooms-at-ballarshah/articleshow/86437297.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Thane||Just 25% colleges, 50% universities in Maharashtra are NAAC accredited||MUMBAI: A comprehensive analysis of accredited institutions in the state by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has revealed that public universities and affiliated colleges in the state are lagging on several counts—from not aligning courses with market and industry needs to not filling vacant teaching positions, and an average performance in research and innovations—despite showing remarkable improvement in performance in the current cycle. While the report mentioned 50% universities and only about 25% colleges in the state have a valid NAAC accreditation, Maharashtra still leads the country in total number of accredited institutions. TimesViewIt is high time universities’ academic boards focus on developing market-oriented courses and upgrading their curriculum to increase the employability of graduating students. Universities need not bring down the education standards to the lowest common denominator to make it more accessible, but must allow students flexibility to pick and choose as per their needs.The report was released by governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Tuesday. In their report, NAAC peer teams have recommended adopting a ‘cafeteria’ approach to allow students to choose from a range of courses, bringing in a regulation to direct industries’ CSR funds to colleges and universities. The report puts the performance of deemed universities in the state, both government and private, ahead of public universities, in terms of curriculum, innovations and infrastructure. In fact, government-funded TISS, Institute of Chemical Technology and TIFR are among the top three universities in the state. The NAAC report reveals 85% of deemed universities are accredited against 50% public ones. Of the total 7,172 colleges in the state (affiliated plus standalone) only 1,711 have a valid NAAC accreditation. The peer teams analysed the performance of 30 universities and 1,367 of accredited colleges for the report. Of these, 43% are from Savitribai Phule Pune University and Mumbai University alone. It was observed the source of funding (government, aided or self-financed) and location of colleges (urban or rural) also attribute to the performance of colleges. Autonomous and minority colleges— with special status—also performed better than general. In the qualitative analysis, the peer teams, while lauding state universities’ performance in developing infrastructure and learning resources and improvement in research awareness, have criticised the weak interface between universities and poor engagement with foreign universities. In comparison with other state universities, Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur have a locational advantage and are doing better in recognition and government funding, stated the report. Funding is a major concern, it said. Educationist R S Mali, former vice-chancellor, North Maharashtra University, said that fewer colleges opting for accreditation is a problem in the country. Only 20% of the colleges in the country are accredited and of the total, Maharashtra has 20%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-just-25-colleges-50-univs-in-state-are-naac-accredited/articleshow/86446386.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Terror planners had a budget, outsourced operation to locals’||Mumbai: In the city terror conspiracy case, the state anti-terrorism squad (ATS) has prima facie found some incriminating documents which indicate the alleged planners had allotted a budget for executing their conspiracy. Moreover, it has reportedly come to light that most people involved in the plot were not known to one another and the operation was outsourced to local suspects. Last week, ATS arrested two persons—Zakir Shaikh from Jogeshwari and Rizwan Momin from Mumbra. Shaikh, a Class IX dropout, is a taxi driver while Momin is a tuition teacher. On September 17, the ATS registered an FIR under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)’s Section 18 for criminal conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against Shaikh and his alleged foreign handler Anthony alias Anas alias Anwar alias Annu. ATS officials said those arrested in Mumbai were in contact with Anthony who received instructions from elsewhere. The officials said during the probe, they prima facie found allocation of a budget by the engineers of the terror module. “We are trying to get exact details about budgeting in this conspiracy case,” said Vineet Agarwal, additional director-general of police and the state ATS chief. Another official said the accused undertook orders for money. “It is like ‘A’ outsourced the terror job for execution to ‘B’ who in turn contacted C (a group of local suspects) to get the job done. Hence, C doesn’t know A. The local accused were told that they would be paid,” the official said, adding, “Outsourcing of the terror task has also come to our knowledge and we are verifying the details available with us.” When asked how much money was paid to the local suspects, the officer said the probe was at a crucial stage and they could not divulge the details. Special cell sleuths from Delhi police’s anti-terror wing had visited the ATS office and questioned Shaikh and Momin. While Shaikh allegedly had been in touch with Anthony for some time, he gave his mobile phone to Momin to destroy, sensing police could reach him. Momin allegedly broke the phone and threw it in a drain near his house. “Not only Shaikh but also Momin was in touch with Anthony. We are waiting for the cyber forensic report and retrieval of data from the broken phone to get more details,” said an official. With ATS focusing on certain documents, the probe is widening to two other states. “Shaikh was to visit Lucknow, so we are collecting information about the trip and whom he was to meet. Moreover, an important document, sent from another state to Shaikh, has been recovered. We got crucial information from it,” said an official. After arresting the duo, the ATS has so far questioned around 15 youths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-terror-planners-had-a-budget-outsourced-operation-to-locals/articleshow/86439407.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Barrackpore DI Shantanu Kr Sinha, along with Krishnakali Chanda, headmistress of Khardah Priyanath Girls’ High School where Basu taught, and some officers of Barrackpore treasury office visited her rented home at Paschimpara near Rahara and handed her the pension payment order. Sources said the order was passed within 12 days of Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee assuring Basu of addressing her monthly pension issues. “We submitted her documents to the DI office. But earlier, she had been asked by former headmistress to submit her documents to get her pension, but she didn’t. We are happy she finally received the pension order. She will also get all the arrears of 12 years,” said Chanda. Basu, a former life science teacher, had been living on the pavement under the Dunlop flyover for several years. Retiring on June 28, 2009, she is entitled to a monthly pension, which she never claimed. “There was some negligence on my part. But Abhishek Banerjee sent some people to me and assured me of looking into the pension issues. I am grateful to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and MP Abhishek Banerjee for taking an initiative for my pension. I have received the order,” she said. Bhattacharjee’s daughter Suchetana said Ira had nominated her as successor of her pension but she was reluctant to accept her properties. “My parents and I are disgusted with her behaviour. I wish her a long and healthy life. But I request her not to associate me and my parents with her activities,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ira-basu-gets-pension-order/articleshow/86437305.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

In a communique issued by City Police Commissionerate, it was stated, “Prateek Vaish has confessed to his crime, wherein he said that in order to get physical with her, first he tried to lure his PA with money, but when she refused, he forcibly raped her and then pushed her to death from the balcony of his 10th floor flat. Primary cause of death is injuries all over her body," The charge sheet in the case would be filed soon, said a police official further.

Retired marketing manager of Parag dairy SK Vaish, his wife Durga Vaish and their son Prateek Vaish live in flat number 1104 of 11th floor of the Gulmohar Apartment in Indira nagar area of Kalyanpur. In the flat number 1006 of the 10th floor, Prateek runs his dairy office.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari returns ordinance for OBC quota in rural bodies||MUMBAI: In a new twist in the feud between Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari and the MVA government, the former has returned the state’s ordinance to provide for OBC quota in rural local bodies after raising queries. “The governor asked for the Supreme Court to be informed before sending the ordinance to him,” rural development minister Hasan Mushrif said. The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to re-submit an amended ordinance to Koshyari. It also decided to issue another ordinance on the same lines for urban local bodies to provide for OBC quota, apart from reservations for SCs and STs within the 50% reservation limit for local bodies. The next hearing of the OBC reservation case in the Supreme Court is on Thursday. The state is likely to mention the two ordinances in the court. MVA slams Guv on ordinance, BJP says he’s acting on law dept viewMVA ministers have hit out at Koshyari for not signing the OBC quota ordinance. “Ever since this governor has come, he has been under influence of the BJP. He should act like the head of the state. If the ordinance had gone through, it would have helped in the upcoming zilla parishad bypolls,” said Mushrif, who belongs to the NCP. “If he does not sign the amended ordinance, it will send the message that the BJP is not allowing OBC reservations,” Mushrif added. OBC affairs minister Vijay Wadettiwar said Koshyari’s decision to return the ordinance was akin to sprinkling salt in the wound of OBCs. “The governor’s advisers seem to want to keep the OBC reservation issue hanging and blame the government,” Congressman Wadettiwar said. The Sena also attacked the governor. “How long does it take for the governor to get legal advice? The BJP should tell us why he has still not approved the 12 nominees the cabinet had sent for the legislative council. According to the law, the governor has to act on recommendations of the state cabinet,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut. The BJP said the governor was merely acting on the view taken by the state’s law and judiciary department on the OBC ordinance. “The law and judiciary department had opined SC permission should be taken before issuing the ordinance so that it would not be rejected in the court. The state should have got an opinion from the state advocate general to overrule this view. Without doing this, they sent the ordinance to the governor,” said BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. “The governor raised the same query and asked for the solution. The way the government has reacted shows it is fooling OBCs. It doesn’t want the OBC reservation to stand in court.” In March, the apex court had quashed the 27% reservation for OBCs in Maharashtra’s local bodies on the grounds that the reservations, combined with those for SCs and STs, exceeded the 50% quota limit. The OBC quota could only be permitted after empirical data on the community was collected and if the 50% quota limit was not crossed, the SC had said. On September 15, the state cabinet had decided to promulgate the ordinance to restore the OBC quota which was quashed by Supreme Court, by amending the state’s gram panchayat law. The ordinance would allow for OBC quota in rural bodies with the rider that once combined with the SC and ST reservations, the combined quota will not cross the 50% limit. Also, the OBC quota will not cross 27% of the seats, in keeping with the existing state legislation. In response to the decision on the ordinance, the State Election Commission had said it would have no impact on upcoming zilla parishad bypolls since the nominations had been filed. The SEC also said SC permission would need to be taken before making changes regarding bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-slams-guv-on-ordinance-bjp-says-hes-acting-on-law-dept-view/articleshow/86442848.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Nagpur||Expert panel calls for removing tigers from WCL, CSTPS areas||Nagpur: The 11-member technical study group constituted by the state board for wildlife (SBWL) and headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has recommended removal of tigers from Wester Coalfields Ltd (WCL) and Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) areas. These tigers should not be released into the wild as they will increase conflict near the site of release and should be transferred into zoos or tiger safaris. The committee has also suggested conservation translocation on a case-by-case basis of young tigers that disperse into areas with smaller patches of forests (interspersed with villages) where tiger density is low, human-tiger interactions are low but crop depredation is high. It has also called for a separate wildlife management plan for Gadchiroli forests to improve the habitat. The group was formed during the 15th SBWL meeting held on August 7, 2020, to suggest mitigation plans to reduce human-tiger conflict in Chandrapur district. The report submitted to the government has broadly divided the areas into four zones and suggested separate measures for each zone for management purposes. Zone-I includes contiguous forest patches with an area of co-existence, eco-development, and wildlife management. Zone-II has been classified as degraded and smaller forest patches for safe passage for non-breeding tigers and no habitat enrichment. Zone-III includes small patches interspersed with villages where tiger density is low. Zone-IV has areas like WCL and CSTPS where tiger presence has to be discouraged. The committee mapped spatial hotspots of human-tiger conflict in the form of livestock depredation annually from 2014-2020 and said this complex situation demands differential management approach on different types of habitats without which swift and proactive management of the conflict situations cannot be carried out effectively. Thus, zonation was done purely to provide clarity to the field staff about the process they will have to follow to diffuse the situation and provide timely solutions. Chandrapur district is home to over 200 individual tigers, a sizeable portion of which inhabits areas outside the PAs in the human-dominated landscapes in the territorial forest divisions of Bramhapuri, Chandrapur, and Central Chanda. The close proximity between tigers and humans has led to the district becoming a virtual hotspot for human-tiger conflict in the country in recent times. Total 9,442 conflict incidents were reported from 2005-2020 from the Vidarbha landscape. Of these, 5,477 incidents (58%) involved tigers. The report, which will be tabled before the SBWL meeting slated to be held soon, has recommended information, education, and communication material to be displayed in all schools and community halls in all villages. It calls for a massive awareness campaign in a project mode with the publicity department and NGOs. “Lok Samwad needs to be started to entail regular interactions between forest department and villagers and all the government departments,” it states. The report suggested strengthening and re-orienting joint forest management committees (JFMCs) and EDCs to devolve powers to village committees so that decisions on utilization of funds can be taken at the local level. It calls for the formation of primary response teams (PRTs). Regular monitoring of tigers with special focus on breeding tigresses must be carried out by all wildlife, territorial and FDCM divisions in collaboration with local NGOs to have a good understanding of the movement pattern of individual tigers. During a conflict situation, this knowledge will help in accurate identification of the problem animal. The panel has recommended increase in compensation and said advance part payment of Rs25,000 should be given to the family in case of grievous injury due to a wild animal attack. Compensation in case of permanent disability to a human should be increased to Rs7.5 lakh and should be commensurate at 50% of the human death amount. It is Rs5 lakh at present. It has also called for a larger share of state resources for long-term conservation of tigers in Chandrapur while implementing resource-intensive co-existence strategies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/expert-panel-calls-for-removing-tigers-from-wcl-cstps-areas/articleshow/86437328.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The state government had on March 31 appointed Justice Chandiwal under the Commission of Inquiry Act to probe Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray against Deshmukh. The term of the commission ends on September 30, but it was extended by three months till December 31. The commission had on September 7 issued a bailable warrant against Singh, but as the police failed to serve the warrant as he was not at his known addresses, the commission decided to give him another chance to appear before it. The warrant issued on September 7 was extended/reissued, to be executed on or before October 6, 2021. When the commission asked Singh’s lawyer Anukul Seth as to how he would deal with the report of non-execution of warrant, he submitted that it is for the commission to decide due course and he had no instructions directly from his client, following which Castellino criticized the conduct of Singh, saying the commission should invoke powers under the civil procedure code and issue an arrest warrant against the former police chief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-issue-warrant-or-attach-params-properties-says-ex-mins-counsel/articleshow/86439522.cms||---

The district, which had administered more than 83,000 doses on a single day recently, had only vaccinated 58,000 beneficiaries on Wednesday. “The number of vaccinations dropped a bit because of heavy rainfall across the district. The beneficiary turnout in the first half of the day was comparatively low when compared to the turnout during the same period in the past couple of days,” said Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector of Nashik who is also the coordinator for the vaccination across the district. “We did not close any of our vaccination centres in the district. However, the footfall was low in the early hours. When the rain stopped by afternoon, more people did turn up at the vaccination centres,” said Dr Shailesh Nikam, the taluka health officer for Nashik. Nashik district had received a fresh stock of 85,680 vaccine doses — including 11,680 Covaxin doses — on Tuesday, and the same had been distributed among the various talukas. The health authorities said the centres would continue to vaccinate the people on Thursday as there is no dearth of the vaccines and they want to ensure every citizen at least gets one dose before the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rain-hits-vaccination-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/86433162.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It commented that nobody is safe in these times without rule of law. The high court was hearing a petition filed by one Vasantbhai Joshi, a member of Satlasana taluka panchayat in Mehsana district. On the day of elections for panchayat president and vice-president posts, Joshi, who is a Congress member, was arrested 15 minutes before polling was to commence. He was detained for an alleged offence committed in 2012. The FIR was lodged a day ahead of the election in 2021. Joshi could not vote in the election, which was fiercely contested with eight Congress members, seven BJP members and one independent. On the way to the polling booth, Joshi was detained and deprived of participation in the election, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala in the division bench told the lawyers appearing in the case, “There is something like rule of law. We are now living in times without rule of law, where you are not safe, I am not safe, sister (pointing at Justice V D Nanavati, is not safe. Nobody is safe. So this (matter) has to be taken carefully.” After his detention, Joshi raised the issue before the police authorities and the State Election Commission (SEC), but to no effect. On this, the court said, “There appears a conspiracy here in which everybody is involved. The police is main conspirator.” The judges also remarked that when a taluka panchayat member was not allowed to vote, the election should have been cancelled and held again. “But in the last election, he was picked up for an eight-year-old offence. If elections are held again, he might be picked up again for some offence of 2015,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/living-in-times-without-rule-of-law-hc/articleshow/86437323.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gold-plated spire: Somnath temple trust invites EOI||AHMEDABAD: As plans have been chalked out to restore the glory of Somnath Temple at Veraval by covering it with gold, the temple trust authority is now ensuring that the precious metal does not face the risk of corrosion given its close proximity to the sea. While gold is regarded as one of the noble metals where the risk of oxidation is very low, the temple authority seems to be leaving nothing to chance to ensure its durability. The Somnath Temple Trust has invited expression of interest (EOI) from interested participants to embellish the main Shikhar (spire) of the temple with gold-clad copper by fixing it appropriately and ensuring that the work is durable in nature. P K Laheri, secretary of Somnath Temple Trust said that the height of the Shikhar will be about 110 feet and the amount of gold required will be known once the EOIs have been submitted. “We have invited participation from across the country for the project. Given the proximity of the temple to the sea, we are extra careful,” said Laheri. The party executing the work will also be responsible for maintaining the same for a period of 10 years as a part of this contract, according to the bid invitation document.  “About 145 kilograms of gold will be required to goldplate the sanctum sanctorum, pillars and the door leading to the sanctum sanctorum in the Somnath temple. The total height of the Shikhar to be gold-plated will be about 61 feet. It will take two years to complete. The temple is located very close to the sea and hence we want to ensure that it doesn’t face corrosion issues in the long run,” said a source in Somnath Temple Trust. The temple’s interior already has 130 kgs of gold plates. After golden pillars, the ambitious task of gold plating 1,450 Kalash or stone spires atop Somnath temple is undertaken by the trust. The interested parties for submitting EOI are required to obtain the documents online from the website before September 20 and fill up the prescribed form and submit the same by September 30 online and deliver the same physically at Shree Somnath Temple Trust office, according to the document. Somnath Temple is first among the twelve Jyotirlingas of India. In recent times, the trend of golden temples in Gujarat started with Swaminarayan Temple at Gadhada, a major pilgrimage spot for the followers of the Swaminarayan sect, when the temple spires were covered in 70kg gold in 2012. The temple so far has been covered in about 90kg of the yellow metal. Also, the Swaminarayan temple in Vadtal was covered in 115kg gold by 2015. It took about four years for a team of 50 to cover all the spires, gates and the sanctum sanctorum in gold. About three years ago, the Shikhar of the famed Ambaji Temple, one of the 52 Shaktipeeths of India associated with Shakti worship, was completely covered in about 140kg of gold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/somnath-temple-trust-invites-eoi-for-durability-of-gold-plated-spire/articleshow/86437413.cms||Bharat Yagnik

On the night of September 7, the taluka had received 123 mm rain. Two weeks ago, the rainfall had inundated large parts of the Nandgaon town, had caused flooding at the Nandgaon railway station as well as farmlands and a bridge in the taluka was also swept away. “This is the first time in our lifetime that we are witnessing heavy rainfall in such a short period,” said Shankar Kande, an 82-year-old resident of Nandgaon town. Local MLA Suhas Kande said the rainfall caused less damage to crops now as there was nothing in the farms after the last spell 15 days ago. “Some farmers, who were not affected by that spell of rains, were affected this time. We have asked the local administration to carry out assessment (panchanama) of the damage to crops, houses, etc,” Kande said. Vivek Dhande, chief officer of Nandgaon municipal council said that though water receded fast, the underpass at the railway crossing was waterlogged. “Waterlogging in the underpass is creating a problem for motorists to cross the railway lines as there is no alternative route in the vicinity,” Dhande said. Rain lashed other parts of the district, including Peth, Trimbakeshwar and Igatpuri. Peth taluka received 98 mm rain, while Trimbakeshwar received 40 mm rain. The rainfall continued in talukas until Wednesday afternoon. “The rainfall continued mostly in Trimbakeshwar and Igatpuri talukas resulting in more water being added to dams.

The hefty 33-year-old batsman hits it to point and scampers for a single and the game ends in an exciting tie. Soon, 22 players in whites line up for the customary pleasantries. It’s not an IPL match, but one of the countless semi-professional games played across Chennai and its suburbs every weekend, with the ‘cricketers’ reliving childhood dreams or trying to emulate their favourite stars. During the week, they are employees of IT firms or consultancies, musicians, college students or even government staff. While league cricket in Chennai draws cricketers from across the country, weekend cricket is a thriving ecosystem of activity in around 75 grounds, with hundreds of people travelling up to 100 km to catch up on the game. Even umpires, who earn as little as Rs 1,000 a day, go long distances to indulge in their passion; one comes from Kalpakkam. Their passion matching that of professionals, the number of such weekend cricketers has steadily risen. Every ground hosts at least two games ‒ a T20 match, a 25-over game or 30-over match ‒ a day. Some organisers conduct 50-over games on government holidays. Games are largely on matting pitches, international rules are followed, while scoring is online and can be followed live. Organisers begin discussions from Monday morning on rates, schedules and match-ups. Playing on a ground in the city can cost a player up to Rs 650, while it is half that rate on the outskirts. S Jagannathan, who runs an IPL-style tournament for alumni of premier business schools at the CCA ground in Sithalapakkam, feels such games are money spinners. “Having a ground can be lucrative, as many corporates even book it on lump sum basis,” says the senior citizen. While organisers can net up to Rs 15,000 a month from each ground, for players, each match helps them de-stress and rev up their competitive juices. “I travel 40km-50 km to play in different grounds. Many people play for different reasons, but they are extremely passionate. For me, it helps get to the next level,” says Slizzy J Stott, a 28-year-old IT professional trying to play league cricket. For many others, says writer-cum-entrepreneur Vikram Mankal, 36, it is the first chance of playing with a leather ball. “People work their leisure times based on cricket schedules. Many practice in indoor nets on weekdays.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cricket-on-weekends-is-serious-business/articleshow/86427224.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Surat||1.76 lakh cusec released from Madhuban dam||SURAT: Due to heavy inflow of fresh water, discharge from Madhuban dam on Daman Ganga River was increased up to 1.8 lakh cusecs downstream on Wednesday. However, with a drop in the inflow of rain water, the outflow has also been reduced later in the day. The outflow at 6pm was 1.76 lakh cusecs against inflow of 83,610 cusecs. Water level in the dam is 79.2 metres against the full reservoir level of 79.86m. On Wednesday morning, Valsad district collector Kshipra Agre sounded an alert on Twitter about heavy discharge from the dam warning residents in Valsad to stay away from causeways and riverbanks. “There is no forecast of heavy rainfall in the next 24 hours in the catchment area of Madhuban dam. Though we are closely monitoring the situation. The discharge has been reduced after the drop in inflow but it will be increased further if we receive more water in the dam,” an officer said. Meanwhile, no additional water is being released from Ukai dam as the inflow has reduced to 18,561 cusecs on Wednesday. At present 11,000 cusecs of water is being released through canals. The water level is 341.59 feet which is almost three feet below the rule level and FRL of 345 ft. “We are storing the water up to the rule level and the dam will be filled up to its maximum level. There is no heavy rainfall in the catchment area but the dam will continue to receive fresh water,” said a Ukai dam official. Due to storing of water the release of water is discontinued in hydro power units as well. In upstream of Ukai Hatnur dam is releasing around 16,000 cusecs of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1-76l-cusec-released-from-madhuban-dam/articleshow/86434808.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs Customs to auction Thai idol to know its true value||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has directed the Customs to auction a metal idol confiscated from a businessman who brought it from Bangkok in 2002. While Adi Dubash, now 75, said he bought it then from the Sunday street market for Rs 1,250, the Customs claimed it was an antique valued at Rs 5 lakh. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard Dubash’s 2019 petition challenging the Customs orders of July 2014 and September 2018 in appeal against confiscation and levy of duty and penalty for not declaring the imported idol with four heads and eight arm as an antique piece. He said the Fine Arts & Ancient Department, Thailand, had certified that it was not an article of antiquity. The petition by Dubash, a resident of Napean Sea Road and an OCI, said Customs demanded an import license saying the Archaeological Survey of India has confirmed it to be an antique. Following a September 14 order of another bench, Dubash’s advocate Gautam Ankhad on Tuesday submitted that the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is not the appropriate authority to declare the age of the idol. Advocate Pradeep Jetly, for the Customs, said it was on ASI information that the idol value was fixed at Rs 5 lakh for purposes of duty and penalty. Ankhad thereafter said that to put an end to the litigation, Dubash would like to donate the idol to the Customs Department as it was a fake. The judges then suggested that the idol be auctioned, observing that bidders would know its real value. “Considering the fair gesture of the petitioner, we are of the opinion that in the peculiar facts of the case, it would be appropriate that the revenue auctions the subject idol/statue, by appointing an appropriate agency for such purpose and sell the idol/statue in a public auction,” said their order. Noting that Dubash has no objection to the auction, the judges permitted the Customs “to take appropriate steps to auction the subject idol/statue” and complete all formalities within three months. “The revenue would be free to arrive at an appropriate reserve price,” the court added, directing that the auction result be placed on record before the next hearing after three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-directs-customs-to-auction-thai-idol-to-know-its-true-value/articleshow/86439553.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The Vaccharaj Beyt is around 25 km from the last village Zinzuvada in Patdi taluka. The place houses the Vachhraj Dada temple, a popular pilgrim centre. The temple also runs a gaushala that has around 6,000 cows. Out of a staff of 54 people, 33 are stationed at the centre throughout the year for maintaining the cow shed. Ruturaj Jadhav, prant officer of Patdi, said that the vaccination staff reached the pilgrim centre with the help of the villagers. “These 33 people were left out of the vaccination drive, so we contacted them. We went there with the support of villagers. The staff used a tractor to reach the pilgrim centre,” Jadhav said. The tractor took two and half hours to complete the 25 km journey. Devotees visit the temple throughout the year except the monsoon when the area turns into an island. Even the salt pan workers leave the place for around six months as the adjoining areas get submerged in rains. Surendrangar district has administered ten lakh first doses and around 3.60 lakh people have got both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/jab-team-travels-an-extra-mile-to-vaccinate-33-on-island/articleshow/86435271.cms||---

TOI reporters checking the ground reality found a major loophole in the system of inspecting vaccine certificates — they are not matched with identity cards. During this five-destination surveillance, it was found that while security guards at various AMC-run facilities ask for the vaccine certificate, at most places they do not seek the photo identity of the person. As the vaccine certificate does not feature a photograph, a person can slip in with somebody else’s certificate! AMTS: Too lazy to check A trip was taken from Ashram Road to Ellisbridge on an AMTS bus. AMTS has deputed a person on every bus to check vaccine certificates. On this bus though he never left his seat. The conductor asked for vaccine certificates but did not verify identity proof. Many passengers who showed their vaccine certificates were not wearing masks and received no rebuke. MJ Library: System works At the entrance, two security guards asked for vaccine certificates. Then the photo identity proof was demanded. The TOI reporter who had furnished the colleague’s vaccine certificate told the guards that he did not have identity proof. The guards pointed to the notice board which said that to gain entry the visitor must furnish identity proof along with the vaccine certificate. Entry was denied. BRTS: Slackness shows At the BRTS ticket window at Ellisbridge, vaccine certificates were sought but not the ID. The security guard at the access-control gate did not ask for certificates but allowed entry on the basis of the tickets. Many commuters at the BRTS stand were not wearing masks. AMC HQ: Policymakers fail At the main gate, security guards were busy on their phones and did not stop any visitor. At the main entrance, security guards did not ask for vaccine certificates. Across the reception area, security guards at the second entrance did not demand vaccine certificates either. Strict checking was carried out here on the first day of the ‘no vaccine, no entry’ regimen. The steam has been evidently lost. Flower Garden: Patchy scan During the long walk on the riverfront to the garden, no check was conducted anywhere. At the ticket window, the vendor turned away a group of young tourists from another state because they did not have vaccine certificates. The ticket vendor asked for vaccine certificates but not for identity proof. The security guard at the garden entrance asked for vaccine certificates but did not crosscheck identities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/laxity-infiltrates-amcs-no-vax-no-entry-policy/articleshow/86439551.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

The Godavari river, which flows through the city, was in spate as the water resources department had started discharge from the Gangapur dam. Police and the Nashik Municipal Corporation’s fire brigade department had deployed personnel at Ramkund as the low-lying area near the river bank was inundated. The small temples on the banks of the river at Ramkund were almost submerged. According to the IMD, the city received more than 16.4mm of rain between 8.30am and 2.30pm on Wednesday. Although the rain stopped after 3pm, the skies remained overcast. The Met department expects more rain in the city and elsewhere in the district. Bhagwat Doifode, the resident deputy collector of Nashik district, said the administration is monitoring the situation closely. NMC’s fire brigade department said there was one incident of a tree falling in the Satpur area at 12.45 pm and blocking traffic movement. A team was sent to the spot to clear the road. “There was also an incident of a stationary private car, parked near the river bank at Ramkund, being washed away. But a police team, with the help of the locals, managed to retrieve the vehicle,” added officials. According to the city traffic police, vehicular movement was slow. The Dwarka chowk area saw traffic jams as one part of the road was shut due to the accumulation of slush and vehicles were diverted via the service road. Water resources department officials said with the Gangapur dam being 100% full, water was released at the rate of 1,000 cusec at 8.30am. Later, by 1pm, the discharge was increased to over 6,200. “If there is more rainfall in the catchment area, we will have to increase the discharge,” said the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-rainfall-in-nashik-gangapur-starts-discharge/articleshow/86433196.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Five other children, all residents of a rehabilitation centre run by the Narayan Seva Sansthan, are being treated. The incident came to light after the differently-abled children fell sick and were admitted to the hospital. One child who was admitted on Monday died on Tuesday, while another child, who was admitted on Tuesday, died on Wednesday while undergoing treatment. The condition of other children is improving and they are said to be out of danger. Udaipur district collector Chetan Devda went to the hospital and instructed related departments to investigate the matter. A team of specialist doctors from the RNT Medical College has been sent to the rehabilitation centre to find out the cause. Food samples have been collected for investigation and doctors are monitoring the condition of other Children. "It is too early to comment on the cause of the incident," Devda said. Chief medical health officer (CMHO) Dr Dinesh Kharadi visited the rehabilitation centre and took stock of the situation. According to Kharadi, out of 49 children residing in the centre, six children were admitted to the hospital after complaining of food poisoning. Two children aged 16 and 17 years died during treatment. One child is admitted to the ICU and the remaining four are being treated in the ward. According to the management of Narayan Seva Sansthan, the charity centre normally provides food cooked in the institution’s kitchen for all inmates. Sometimes, donors provide cooked meals to children. The possibility of contaminated food in such a case cannot be ruled out. The post-mortems of both the children who died have been conducted and the viscera taken. Final report is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/two-kids-withdisabilities-diein-udaipur-fromfood-poisoning/articleshow/86439584.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Soyabean rates crash in two days, farmers’ hopes shaken||Nagpur: After a poor yield and low returns last year, rates of soyabean the second major crop of Vidarbha had touched a record high of over Rs10,000. Farmers hoped to gain from the trend finally in this kharif season. Now as the harvest season is round the corner their hopes have been shaken. In mere two days of trading, soyabean prices have crashed to as low as Rs4,000 a quintal as against Rs10,000 to Rs9,000 a quintal. The current price is in the range of Rs4,000 to Rs6,000 as against this the minimum support price (MPS) is at Rs3,950/quintal. “Less than a week ago the rate were over Rs 10,000 and it suddenly crashed to Rs4,100 to Rs4,400,” in the Kalamana market,” said Atul Senad of the Adatiya (brokers’) Association here. The Adatiyas will be opposing the move as rates have fallen due to government’s decision to import soyameal. A further fall cannot be ruled out. Farmers had increased area under the crop and the demand took the price of soyabean seeds to nearly double in the sowing season. The sudden crash in the prices has left the observers surprised. “There is a general perception that the rates have fallen because of recent decision to allow import of 12 lakh tonne of soyameal which is used as fodder and in poultry industry. However, there is a much higher demand of the commodity. This is a month old decision and the impact was seen in the market at that time itself when prices came below the Rs10,000 level. The sudden fall in two days is surprising indeed” says Anil Ghanawat the president of Shetkari Sanghatana. This indicates of another likely decision by the government of which a section of traders may have got an inkling, based of which they may have cut purchases bringing down the rates, he said. The present quality of soyabean arriving in the markets is also inferior as seeds have caught moisture due to rains. This also is a reason for rates coming down, said sources. “Moisture often hampers the quality and brings down the rates. However, this is a regular feature and import is a main factor for the current crash,” said Sudhir Kothari a director of an agricultural produce marketing committee in Hinghanghat Tehsil of Wardha. Kishore Tiwari the chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said there remains a shortfall in supply of soyabean, yet it appears that the rates have artificially pulled down. In some of the centres soyabean was trading even below the MSP. Vallabh Deshmukh a director of Mahabeej — the state government seed corporation said the rates are down because of moisture in the grains and also that the consignment of imports have lately reached India. Farmers should not panic and hold on to the stock. There are chances that the prices may improve to around Rs7,000 a quintal by November. However, further rains can hamper the crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soyabean-rates-crash-in-two-days-farmers-hopes-shaken/articleshow/86437352.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||BMC floats tender to appoint agency for ‘reputation management’||MUMBAI: After facing flak for incurring a cost of nearly Rs 2 crore annually for managing its social media accounts, BMC on Tuesday floated tenders to appoint an agency for ‘reputation management’. BMC has said it will scrap its existing social media management contract and appoint a new agency through the tenders. It intends to spend around Rs 1.3 crore per year on this agency that will be tasked with managing its public image. TimesViewThe BMC’s efforts to reach out to citizens and address their grievances via social media platforms has been welcomed. However, creating over 30 handles and then hiring an agency to manage them is not the way to go about it. BMC must have a cohesive social media presence and there must be a detailed audit of its online performance.The move has, however, met with criticism: BJP has slammed BMC for spending on an external agency for “reputation management” and alleged that this was a ploy to promote the ruling Shiv Sena ahead of next year’s BMC elections. For more than three years now, the civic body has been spending funds on boosting popular perceptions about itself. Despite dwindling revenues, the civic body awarded a contract worth Rs 5.9 crore to S2 Infotech to manage its 34 Twitter handles from July 2019 to July 2022. The contract was awarded without inviting tenders. MLAs and corporators across parties had slammed the decision to spend around Rs 2 crore on tweets and alleged there was no analysis to gauge the reach and impact of @mybmc and the 34 other official twitter handles. In comparison, Mumbai police has only two Twitter accounts to manage citizen grievances. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the BMC must have only one Twitter handle and not dozens. “There is no mechanism to gauge the performance of the agency that is being paid Rs 1.81 crore per year. The BMC must get an audit done…BMC’s reputation has already been washed away by the monsoon. Having an agency for reputation management is nothing but a factory to spread lies and make false promises before the BMC polls,” Mishra said. Citizens groups have also said that having close to 30 unverified handles creates confusion and even poses a security threat as many fake handles masquerading as genuine ones have been set up in the process. “The process to float a new e-tender has already begun,” deputy municipal commissioner Prabhat Rahangdale, Disaster Management, had said in a written reply to MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh last month. Shaikh said the BMC must fast-track the appointment of the new agency. “But BMC must understand that reputation has to be built, not managed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-floats-tender-to-appoint-agency-for-reputation-mgmt/articleshow/86439593.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Even a couple of years ago, scorers kept track of a match manually. But mobile applications such as Stumps and CricHeroes have changed the game. Even if an umpire or scorer is late for a game, the mobile app helps those on the ground keep track of the score. And, even better, you get to impress family and friends who can catch your match scores live. Of course, the flip side is that you can’t fib about your exploits. Anybody can download this application, register a tournament and start scoring for games. L Pandian, one of the two co-founders of Chennai-based Stumps, which has more than 1 lakh downloads, told TOI that they first studied the cricket matches in Tiruvallur district. “We wanted to create a database for domestic cricketers so that they could get identified once they reached the next level,” he said. For example, a prodigy in a remote corner of the city can show his scores and wickets to selectors while coming up the ranks. Both these apps provide detailed analytics for performances as well; they are in use in different countries including South Africa, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. “We realised this as we started getting feedback from these countries,” Pandian said. Stumps alone is used for at least 1,500 matches a day on weekends, Pandian said. The popularity of such weekend matches has also helped sports gear shops scale up. M Darshan (22), a cricketer who started a cricketing equipment shop recently, said many buy from shops like his that sell quality non-branded equipment at reasonable prices. “Nobody plays these cricket leagues for time-pass, everybody is very serious and wants to do well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-scoring-apps-a-game-changer/articleshow/86427253.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar
---||Goa||Keeping player safety in mind, FC Goa may pull out of Durand Cup||Panaji: FC Goa are still unsure about taking the field for their Durand Cup quarterfinal clash against Delhi FC at the Kalyani Stadium in Kolkata on Friday. Goa were initially scheduled to play at the Mohun Bagan ground, but the organisers were forced to change the venue after it was deemed unplayable, following incessant rains in the city. Army Red and Bengaluru United were scheduled to play the other quarterfinal in Kalyani on the same day. But with Army withdrawing from the tournament due to Covid-19 positive cases in the team, the venue is now available. Organisers have rescheduled Goa’s quarterfinal clash at Kalyani, but the venue is not to Goa’s liking, particularly since Kerala Blasters coach Ivan Vukomanovic was scathing in his criticism of the ground following their loss against Delhi. According to sources, Delhi have also told the organisers that they must provide a better venue, ideally the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan where Goa played and won all three group games. Sources said the authorities do not allow matches on consecutive days at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan to protect the turf. “Goa have serious reservations about its players’ safety. We will wait to hear the final word from organisers before taking a call,” a senior club official told TOI late on Thursday. Earlier during the pre-match press conference, Goa’s director of football, Ravi Puskur, said there were lots of uncertainty regarding Kalyani. “It doesn’t give you confidence when another coach (Ivan) himself had raised doubts about the state of the pitch,” said Puskur. Goa have already lost the services of Spanish midfielder Jorge Ortiz during their second group game against Sudeva Delhi FC after a reckless challenge. Head coach Juan Ferrando was upset over the incident and threatened to pull out, if the officiating did not improve. Moreover, the long journey to Kalyani from the team hotel and the 2pm kick off doesn’t make things any easier. “The ground is two and a half hours away from us and we need to leave at six in the morning to play a game that’s at 2 in the afternoon. It’s not ideal for the players or any professional football team. So, they (organisers) have to make a very important decision,” said Puskur. Goa have assembled a strong squad and are the favourites to emerge champions. Ferrando has balanced the side with newcomers and experienced players as they prepare for the Indian Super League (ISL). Forwards Devendra Murgaokar and Muhammed Nemil have proved their worth by scoring three goals each. On the other hand, Delhi have relied heavily on Willis Plaza as the Trinidad and Tobago forward has scored four goals, including the winner against Kerala Blasters that sealed their place in the quarterfinals. “For us it’s the time of pre-season and we are working on different plans. We are working with the foreign players as well as young players and this is our target. Of course, we need to improve a lot of points,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/keeping-player-safety-in-mind-fc-goa-may-pull-out-of-durand-cup/articleshow/86466286.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt’s pension move to benefit employees||JAIPUR: In a move that will benefit government employees, the state cabinet decided on Wednesday to provide pensions as per norms under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Act, 2013 and issue a notification for the same. The employees are currently receiving pension as per the Rajasthan Civil Services (Contributory Pension) Rules, 2005. The long-pending move is considered safe and rewarding for pensioners. The decision was taken at CM Ashok Gehlot’s first cabinet meeting after undergoing angioplasty at the SMS Hospital here last month. The cabinet also decided to extend the scope of compassionate appointment in government service to dependents of employees suffering from diseases by amending the Rajasthan Compassionate Appointment Rules, 1996. Divorced daughters and, in case of unmarried government employees, mother, father or unmarried brother, sister or, if none of them are available, married sister could be considered for appointment, as per the new rules proposed. At present, only husband, wife, son or unmarried or widowed daughter, adopted son or unmarried adopted daughter are eligible for appointment. The cabinet also gave its approval for an additional long-term loan of Rs 500 crore from the Bank of India for the Farmers' Welfare Fund, constituted for various schemes. It decided to amend the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (Amendment) Rules, 2021, adopting new standards and procedures for the appointment of chairman and members of the commission as well as to make investigations more transparent and efficient. The meeting gave its nod to issue caste certificates to children of single women belonging to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes, and income and property certificates in the name of the mother. The Mukhyamantri Paryatan Udyog Sambal Yojana to provide relief to entrepreneurs in the tourism and hospitality sector was also approved. Under the scheme, a total interest subsidy of 9% per annum will be given to entrepreneurs by giving an additional interest subsidy of 1% on interest of loans of up to Rs 25 lakh for three years. The state GST payable and deposited by hotel and tour operators will be 50% from October 1 to March 31 this year, and 75% from April 1 to June 30. The cabinet also gave its nod to upgrade the cell for peace and non-violence and establish it as a directorate to promote the principles of Mahatma Gandhi at grass-roots level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-govts-pension-moveto-benefit-employees/articleshow/86439638.cms||---

The girls had left their home with their mother in Belahi village of Halia area in Mirzapur district a month ago and were missing since then. The mother is absconding after the recovery of skeletons. Police have launched a search for her after sending the skeletons for postmortem examination. SO Halia Rajkumar Singh said that some local shepherds spotted skeletons in the jungles of Harra and alerted the husband and brother of the absconding mother. They reached the spot and ascertained their identity with the help of clothes lying there after which the matter was reported to the police. Police are waiting for postmortem report before lodging a case in this connection, said the SO adding that efforts were being made to trace the absconding mother. Initial investigation revealed that one Devidas Kole of Belahi village had three sons and a daughter from his first wife Falguni, who died few years back. He had then married Sima, a native of Belgava. Sima had two daughters from her first husband who had died sometime back. After marriage, Sima’s daughters also started dwelling with Kole’s family. SO Halia said that on August 16 Sima left home with her three daughters- Golu (12), Munni (10) and Mamta (8) without informing Kole. He contacted his in-laws to get their whereabouts but failed. On August 21, Sima contacted her brother Ramakant over phone and informed him that she was in Indore with her daughters. She expressed her wish to come to Ramakant’s place on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. She reached Ramakant’s place alone.

Contestants in the poll fray don’t get to canvas for the local body polls in some apartment complexes and gated communities. This leads to some friction post election when the communities approach elected local body representatives and the panchayat over civic issues or when getting the required infrastructure and basic amenities. For instance, the absence of piped water connections to households along OMR is a major issue. While old habitations in these villages have piped water lines, the new communities don’t have basic amenities, a problem that echoes all along the arterial road. These communities, hence, largely depend on private water tankers. However, their issue goes unnoticed during the election frenzy as candidates confine their campaigns to places they have free access to such as localities with independent houses. So, candidates can’t engage with voters in several gated communities. Harsha Koda, co-founder of Federation of OMR Resident Associations (FOMRRA), said candidates should be allowed to campaign on premises of gated communities and the Resident Welfare Association (RWA) must ensure that Covid SOPs are followed. “We are planning for a webinar with local body candidates and RWAs so the two can interact on civic issues during the first week of October,” he said. FOMRRA had conducted similar interactions during the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in 2019 and 2021, he added. Padur resident and founder of a waste management firm I Priyadharshini emphasised the importance of those in gated communities voting in rural local body elections. “The elected local body has more powers in resolving civic issues and it is the responsibility of residents to exercise their franchise,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gated-communities-shoot-self-in-foot-by-closing-to-campaigns/articleshow/86437439.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Plan for Khar subway ROB on since ’16, but no space: BMC||Mumbai: A day after TOI reported on locals displaying banners outside their residential buildings to demand a rail over bridge (ROB) over the Khar subway, the BMC said such a plan has been in place since 2016. BMC officials, though, pointed out on Wednesday the plan has not taken off so far due to unavailability of space needed to construct a slip road (for entry to and exit from the ROB). A local corporator said widening the subway or clearing the area below the proposed flyover on the eastern side of the subway, which is currently encroached upon, could help ease traffic movement. As the eastern side is encroached upon, officials said widening of storm water drains has been long pending too, thereby leading to local flooding on heavy rain days. Satish Thosar, BMC chief engineer of the bridges department, said: “A consultant was appointed by the BMC and plans for an ROB were drawn out in 2016 itself. However, owing to unavailability of land for construction of a slip road, the ROB works could not be initiated.” Locals also spoke to the civic authorities about the issue on Wednesday. Trivankumar S Karnani who raised the issue on Twitter handle @MNCDFbombay said they had a positive discussion with the BMC bridges department. “The officer briefed us about plans for the ROB which reflects under the development plan (DP) 2034. MNCDF and Santacruz East Residents Association (SERA) Mumbai will hold joint meetings with the administration and plan to thereafter follow up and fast-track the process of improving the situation,” said Karnani. Meanwhile, local BJP corporator Alka Kerkar too said some land on the eastern side of the subway is encroached. “That needs to be cleared. Another reason to clear the encroachment is to ensure storm water drain lines can be widened to prevent flooding,” said Kerkar. Fed up with the condition of the Khar subway, many locals had started placing banners outside their buildings with messages like ‘Why nobody wants to improve Khar subway’, ‘We want a permanent solution to Khar subway’ and ‘We have been complaining but no results’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/plan-for-khar-subway-rob-on-since-16-but-no-space-in-mumbai-bmc/articleshow/86441424.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||Ex-CMs built personal palaces, BJP giving houses to poor: CM||Lucknow: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday assured sugarcane farmers that no sugar mill will be sold in the state and payment of cane dues will be made at the earliest. Speaking at an event to launch development projects worth Rs 433 crore in Amroha district, the CM spoke about the sugarcane dues which his government has already cleared and said even during the Covid-19 pandemic, when sugar mills across the country were shutting down, the government ensured that all units remained functional. “I gave directions that till there is cane in the fields, mills have to function. Between 2007 and 2017, payment of Rs 95,000 crore was made to cane farmers. Since 2017, when we came to power, dues worth Rs 1.45 lakh crore have already been cleared,” he said. He also appealed people to elect responsible public representatives. Giving the example of BJP legislators who “are working hard and concerned about development”, Yogi said under the previous Samajwadi Party government, MLAs were busy building their own wealth rather than helping people. “Earlier, CMs used to make their palaces but our government is giving houses to the poor. Under previous governments, people saw the state’s anti-development face and a corruption-ridden regime. No riot has been reported ever since we came to power. Rioters have been warned that if they damage a poor person’s home or a commercial establishment, even their generations will not be able to pay the fine,” he said, adding that due to the government’s zero tolerance policy towards anti-social activities, people were feeling safe in the state and could celebrate festivals. The CM also remembered former minister Chetan Chauhan who died of Covid in 2020 and thanked the people of Amroha for electing his wife in the bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ex-cms-built-personal-palaces-bjp-giving-houses-to-poor-cm/articleshow/86439678.cms||---

Cancer treatment and total hip replacements follow next. In all, over 8.46 lakh peple have made use of the Pradhan Mantri and Mukhya Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana since its launch in 2018. The total worth of the treatment extended is pegged to be Rs 886 crore. The facts came to the fore on the eve of the scheme’s third anniversary. “Medical treatment is known to trigger a decline in the socio-financial standing of people with limited means. Those in villages often sell their assets or take loan to save a dear one. The scheme has saved many families from suffering besides turning the dream of universal healthcare into a reality,” said Sangeeta Singh, chief executive officer of State Agency for Comprehensive Health Insurance and Integrated Services, the implementing agency for Ayushman Bharat. Data from the state government showed that the scheme which began with a target of 1.18 crore possible beneficiary families has been able to extend the benefits to an additional 60 lakh families over three years. The poorest of the poor—antyodaya card holders—have recently benefited from it. Singh said that the card comes handy for people coming with common problems too such as cataract surgery, kidney stone removal or Csection childbirth. She added that the Covid-19 package was added to help people avail medical facility at private hospitals during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayushman-bharat-benefit-for-8-4l-in-up/articleshow/86439725.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Meerut||UP cleric held for ‘running India’s biggest conversion syndicate for over 30 years’||MEERUT/LUCKNOW: A prominent Meerut cleric, Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui, who shot to social media fame last year for solemnising the wedding of actor Sana Khan, has been arrested by UP Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) for allegedly running the “country’s biggest illegal conversion syndicate” for over 30 years. ATS sources said Siddiqui “received funds from abroad, particularly Gulf nations, through hawala transactions”. The 64-year-old Islamic scholar was arrested on Tuesday night, days after he attended an event in Mumbai on September 7, named ‘Rashtra Pratham Rashtra Sarvopari’, organised by a think-tank Global Strategic Policy Foundation where Mohan Bhagwat was the key speaker. Siddiqui had showered praise on the RSS chief. “Bhagwat works for all and has the power to change things for Muslims in India,” the cleric had said, adding that he had “personally interacted with Bhagwat” after the event where he had gone on the invitation of Bhagwat’s cousin, Anand Bhagwat. The ATS is investigating a case against the head of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam, both of whom were arrested in June on charges of using IDC for “mass religious conversions”. The ATS has said that over 1,000 “vulnerable” people have been converted by the two with “promise of jobs” or by “inciting hatred” against Hinduism. According to the ATS, Siddiqui worked closely with the duo. “We unearthed over Rs 1.5 crore illegally routed through Bahrain and Rs 3 crore from other Gulf nations. These transactions were in violation of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act,” said additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar. An ATS statement said six teams have been formed to investigate the case in which 10 arrests have been made. The sleuths said that Siddiqui ran multiple Islamic trusts and used these as a “garb to operate the illegal conversion syndicate”. The IDC in Jamia Nagar, Delhi, was the nerve centre, where the cleric would “steer his illegal missionary work” while his Shah Waliullah Trust in Delhi was the “key front for routing hawala money”, it has been alleged. Siddiqui’s other trusts in Delhi and Haryana included Global Peace Centre and Peace Mission (Mustafabad), Madrassa Sabeel-us-Salam (Jamia Nagar), Dawat-e-Islam Trust (DEIT), Mewat, and World Peace Organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cleric-held-for-running-indias-biggest-conversion-syndicate-for-over-30-years/articleshow/86435489.cms||Ishita Mishra

The incident came to light on Tuesday night. The deceased was identified as Kondamma (31). The woman ended her life after her husband Penchalaiah (38) accused her of having an extramarital affair. Police have arrested Penchalaiah, who works as a security guard at an ATM. In the video, the accused can be seen asking his wife to go ahead with her decision to hang herself saying he won’t stop her. “I won’t stop you if you end your life. I’ll show this video to your brother,” Penchalaiah is heard saying in the background in the video clip. After Kondamma ended her life, he even sent the video to her parents, who were shocked to see their daughter hanging herself to death and immediately informed the police. Cops said the woman even hoped for a moment that her husband would stop her from ending her life, as could be seen in the video, but instead he continued to instigate her and kept recording the video as she choked to death. Even after that, instead of trying to save her, he sent the video to her parents. Based on the complaint filed by her family members, Penchalaiah was arrested on charges of abetment to suicide. Cops have also recovered the video as evidence. The couple has two children from their 13 years of marriage.

---||Chennai||Garbage and untreated sewage turns Buckingham canal into sewer||Chennai: In the thick of civic poll preparations, officials seem to be too busy to tackle highly polluted water bodies near villages along Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR). Residential complexes and colonies of independent houses take advantage of the lack of elected local bodies and are letting out untreated waste and sedimentary dregs from on-campus sewage treatment facilities into Buckingham Canal and the Muttukadu backwaters. And on the other end, congested canals result in flooding of Thazhambur off OMR. These long pending woes of residents of the IT highway have not been addressed for years. However, the upcoming rural local body elections for village panchayats in Chengalpet district has brought these issues back to the forefront. The urbanised villages between Navalur and Kelambakkam are dotted with skyscrapers and gated communities. More families moved to the city’s peripheries for a quieter life resulting in a spike in population, currently at 2.5 lakh. This migration, however, has taken a massive toll on OMR’s ecology given the absence of basic amenities and infrastructure, including a sewerage system and segregated garbage collection. The pristine Muttukadu backwaters in Navalur’s backyard has been reduced to a stinky sewer. Not a surprising development as a dump yard is found adjacent to the massive water body. Sewage let out by independent houses reaches the backwaters through a dedicated channel and in addition, several gated communities release waste water from the STP into the water body. A board erected by the local body warning criminal and penal action against those dumping garbage and letting sewage into the Buckingham Canal is clearly not viewed as a threat by violators who continue with the indiscriminate pollution. “Just 15 years ago, Navalur used to depend on fish sourced from the backwaters with boats navigating the canal. But, now frogs cannot survive as the water body is polluted due to untreated sewage and garbage,” said retired Major General Jose Manavalan, who is part of the Save Muttukadu Backwaters Campaign. Locals are rightly annoyed especially since their neighbours in Greater Chennai Corporation areas have a robust system of solid waste segregation at source. Gated communities can afford services of private waste management companies. But for other residents, waste is collected by respective local bodies and brought to landfills on tractors. Meanwhile, overgrown vegetation is choking 26 canals that divert excess rainwater from Siruseri to Muttukadu backwaters. As a result, areas like Thazambur frequently grapple with excessive flooding that forced people during the monsoon in 2020 to commute by tractors just to reach the arterial roads. Those in high rises and gated communities were marooned for a few days. B V Pradeep, a resident of Thazhambur for seven years, called for the linking of channels to allow free flow of rainwater. “This would prevent a repeat of 2020 when the locals suffered due to inundation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/garbage-and-untreated-sewage-turns-buckingham-canal-into-sewer/articleshow/86437483.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

However, the monthly exports showed a growth of 56% on the year-on-year basis, said sources in the know. Total exports — both merchandise and services — from the 20 functional SEZs in the state dropped to Rs 16,498 crore in August as against Rs 18,446 crore in July 2021. The reduction in overall exports was due to lower exports of petroleum and chemical products, added sources. On the month-on-month basis, the exports from Reliance SEZ in Jamnagar came down 12% to Rs 11,629 crore in August 2021 from Rs 13,263 crore in the preceding month. Similarly, Dahej SEZ’s exports eased 13% to Rs 706 crore from Rs 800 crore during the same period. The exports from GIFT SEZ in Gandhinagar plummeted 59% to Rs 161 crore in August from Rs 391 crore in July 2021, said sources citing official data. The exports were 56% more when compared with exports worth Rs 10,591 crore registered in August 2020. The exports showed growth due to the low base of the previous year, when SEZ exports were down in the wake of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, said sources. Most of the operational SEZs saw their exports grow in August on the year-on-year basis. Surat SEZ, Reliance SEZ, and Adani Ports and SEZ in Mundra registered a growth of 115%, 61%, and 132% respectively. However, exports from GIFT SEZ, Zydus SEZ, and Surat Apparel Park SEZ remained lower than in August last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-sez-exports-down-11-in-august/articleshow/86437491.cms||---

The rating given by the latest Global Startup Ecosystem Report (GSER) has also put Telangana among the ‘Top 20 Asian Ecosystems’ in funding and among ‘Top 15 Regional Ecosystems’ when it comes to affordable talent. Not surprisingly, Bengaluru continued its dominance in India’s startup space as it was the sole Indian city to make it to the ‘Top 30 Global Startup Ecosystem’ at 23rd rank. While Mumbai raced to numero uno spot in the ‘Top 100 Emerging Startup Ecosystems’ list this year, Hyderabad shared its rank with Pune and Chennai. The three cities – Hyderabad, Chennai and Pune -- were designated between 61-70 ranks without any specific rank being mentioned for each city. Last year, Hyderabad was placed among the 71-80 rank band. This year, Hyderabad scored higher than Pune and Chennai in funding, but it trailed behind these two cities in the areas of performance and talent. When it comes to Asia, the report cited Telangana government’s recruitment assistance and performance grants as the key reasons why a startup should move to Telangana.As per the report, the Telangana government offers a recruitment assistance of Rs 10,000 per employee for the first year of operation. Besides, Telangana-based startups that record a Y-o-Y growth rate of 15%, as per their audited accounts, during their first three years since incorporation are eligible for a grant of 5% on turnover, subject to a limit of $13,600. Telangana was also deemed strong in the life sciences sector as well as emerging technologies like AI, Big Data and Analytics. The report evaluated over 280 ecosystems globally and ranked leading 140 ecosystems. Overall, despite a turbulent year, the same five global startup ecosystems that stood among the top 5 in 2020 remained at the top of GSER rankings this year as well. Silicon Valley, followed by New York City and London (tied at second rank for two consecutive years), Beijing and Boston held the top ranks in the top ‘30 Global Startup Ecosystem’. North America continued to dominate the global rankings with 50% of the top 30 ecosystems in this region. Asia accounted for 27%, whereas Europe had 17% of the top 30 ecosystems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-in-top-emerging-startup-ecosystems/articleshow/86441435.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Pune||Maharashtra: E-registration of first-sale properties likely from October 2||PUNE: The phase-wise roll-out of online registration of first-sale properties is likely to commence from October 2 and software needed for the process is in the final stages of development. The e-registration of such projects will start with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA)-registered developers with above 50 tenements, followed by the rest of the builders. The e-registration process enables the builders and buyers to register the property document from the developers’ office by using a software provided by the state registration department. State Inspector General of Registration and Stamps Shravan Hardikar on Wednesday said all work associated with the software was on track. “The process is voluntary for the developers. We are expecting more developers to avail of this software,” he told TOI. Revenue minister Baasaheb Thorat had said the online registration of the first-sale projects was likely to start from October 2,“All developers registered with MahaRERA can approach the department for the software. They will be provided with the software after due diligence. The citizens willing to get their properties registered at the sub-registrar’s office can go ahead with the traditional process,” a registration department official said. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) members were planning to have their offices as a point of registration, while a common place could be finalized to help the small-time builders proceed with the process.

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Minor from Etah jailed as adult in ‘drugs case’ kills self||AGRA: A boy from Etah, 15, who was arrested on drug possession charges, produced in court as an adult and sent to the district jail instead of a juvenile detention centre for three months killed himself at home on Tuesday. Four policemen have been booked for abetment of suicide. “On March 9 (this year), my son had stepped out to buy pizza. He was arrested,” said his father, a farmer. Police said they found 500g diazepam on him. “He was kept in lockup and beaten up for four days. Cops demanded Rs 2 lakh to release him.” The boy was eventually produced in court, as an adult, and sent to jail under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on March 12. Had he been tried at a juvenile court, he could have got bail right then. He spent three months in jail while his parents tried to get him out. On July 25, he finally got out. “Police had not been able to file a chargesheet,” the boy’s counsel Yaduveer Singh Chauhan said. After he came home, things were different. “He had changed. He was always a cheerful teenager. He went into depression,” his father said. The Class XII commerce student had been a diligent student, scoring the first division in his Class X boards, and wanted to get an MBA. He would have turned 16 in November. “He lost interest in everything. Those three months had broken him. He killed himself in his room on Tuesday afternoon … I have no trust in Etah police officials. I hope CM Yogi Adityanath intervenes to get me justice.” The father filed a complaint against four cops — sub-inspectors Mohit Rana and Shiv Kumar, head constable Upendra Kumar and constable Ravish Kumar. “On the basis of the complaint, an FIR has been registered against the four policemen under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC. Earlier this year, an FIR was registered against the boy under the NDPS Act and he was sent to jail on court orders. The entire matter is being investigated,” Etah SSP Udai Shanker Singh said. Sub-inspector Mohit Rana was at the centre of another probe last month when it was alleged that he had arrested a father and son who had filed a dowry complaint. The father and son had said that they were dragged out of their shops, and beaten up in public and at the police station before being arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/minor-jailed-as-adult-in-drugs-case-kills-self-4-cops-booked-for-suicide-abetment/articleshow/86435531.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Vijayawada||Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams jumbo board runs into Andhra Pradesh HC bump||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday suspended two orders of the state government appointing 52 special invitees to the board of the country’s richest temple trust - Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). The court suspended the orders after three public interest litigations (PIL) challenged the appointments. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya issued notices to the state government and TTD observing that prima facie the government orders were not in consonance with section 96 of the Endowments Act. Suspending the operation of both orders, the judges posted the case for hearing after four weeks. The state government had on September 15 issued two orders appointing 52 members as special invitees to the trust board apart from order 245 appointing 28 persons as the members of the board. With one ex-officio member, the strength of the board for the first time ever reached 81. The previous board had 37 members. Kalyanadurgam unit TDP incharge M Umamaheswara Naidu and Hindu Jana Shakti Sangh had moved separate PILs challenging the appointment of special invitees and BJP functionary and former member of TTD board G Bhanuprakash Reddy moved another PIL. Arguing on behalf of Naidu, advocate Y Balaji said that according to section 96 of Endowments Act, the TTD board members should not exceed 29. He argued that there was no provision for appointing special invitees in the Act. He said appointment of special invitees and extending special privileges will compromise the independence of the board. Advocate general S Sriram told the bench that the legislation put no bar on appointing special invitees and that there were legal precedents. Special invitees promoted TTD and tourism across the country as the members were experts from various walks of life, he said. As they were not given any power in decision-making, there could not be any opposition to the government decision, he added. Arguing on behalf of TTD, senior counsel S S Prasad said that the PILs were not maintainable as the petitioners directly approached the court without giving any representation to get clarifications and redress their grievances. Representing Bhanuprakash Reddy, advocate N Ashwani Kumar said some of the members had criminal cases against them. However, the bench asked as to why the members against whom the allegations are made were not included as respondents, Ashwani Kumar sought time for impleading them as respondents. Allowing his request, the high court posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-jumbo-board-runs-into-hc-bump/articleshow/86441445.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has around 1,500 active cases, while the tally in rural areas has reduced to 4253. The Covid caseload in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits dropped to 1,106 on September 21, a report released by the district health office stated. The active cases in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) were around 10,000 at the beginning of September. It dropped below 9,000 around September 7 and declined below 8,000 on September 12. A source in the administration said while the cases in the urban pockets of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad were already on the decline, the rural parts of the district recorded a similar trend, where the active caseload dropped from 5,500 to 4,253 since the beginning of the month. The health officials in PMC stated that they had been monitoring the daily cases and the number of discharges to analyse the trend. An official said, “We are maintaining ward-wise statistics. None of the civic ward has reported any significant rise in daily cases. The drop in active cases happened because of the decline in daily cases.” Sanjeev Wavre, the assistant medical chief at PMC, said, “The swab collection centres are functioning in civic wards despite a drop in daily cases. We urge the residents to visit the swab centres to undergo tests in case of onset of symptoms. The daily testing in the city limits has been ranging between 5,000 and 10,000. Adequate arrangements are in place to tackle any surge in cases.” An official from the district administration said sustained efforts led to the drop in active cases in the rural areas. “Daily testing has been maintained around 10,000, which helped in early detection and contain further spread. We shall continue with the ongoing efforts. Daily cases have been ranging around 500 now,” the official added. The region continued to check over 20,000 samples for the Covid infection on Wednesday. A total of 25,417 samples were checked in PMR. These included 10,000 tests conducted in the rural parts of te district, as many as 8,458 in PMC limits and 6,864 in Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrs-active-caseload-down-to-seven-month-low-of-7003/articleshow/86437496.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Delhi: Debts, drugs driving many to life of crime||NEW DELHI: In the recent past, several people with stable jobs have been arrested for various crimes, mostly petty and white-collar ones. According to police, earlier most people who were caught for street crimes came from underprivileged or criminal backgrounds. But in many of the recent cases, the accused took to crime after incurring debts in gambling or to consume high-end drugs, the cops said. A senior officer said several people from stable families and with decent jobs had taken to various crimes in the past few months. In some cases, they have turned criminals after themselves falling prey to such acts. In south Delhi, a 47-year-old man from Nepal who worked as a peon at an office for the past 26 years ended up stealing his employer’s cash and jewellery worth Rs 40 lakh for a comfortable life with his family. Police said he was a first-time criminal. Similarly in outer Delhi, a Bhojpuri singer who was duped through social media on the pretext of a movie offer duped a senior citizen in April in the similar manner as he felt that it was a quick way of earning money. Jitender Kumar Mishra (36) moved back to his village after his factory was shut down. After working as a customer service agent with a few companies, he joined an acting course and uploaded his resume on Facebook. He then got duped by some conmen in Mumbai while looking for a role. He noticed the interest of the senior citizen in getting a role in a television series and duped him, the officer said. In another case in Dwarka, the son of a government official was caught for a robbery. “His wife had a stable job, but the man got into bad company,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-debts-drugs-driving-many-to-life-of-crime/articleshow/86439871.cms||Sakshi Chand

A total of 62,593 vaccine doses were administered across the Pune district on Wednesday, taking the total cumulative vaccination figure to 99,65,336. Confirming the development, Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune, said, “We are only short of administering 34,664 doses to achieve the one-crore dose milestone. On an average 35,000 doses are being daily administered to citizens, receiving either the first or the second dose. By that logic, we should achieve the target on Thursday.” According to the CoWIN dashboard, around 69.12 lakh people have received their first jab. Around 30.52 lakh people have received their second jab. The district’s total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, 87.42 lakh residents are above 18 years and eligible to get the Covid vaccine. So far, 79% of the eligible 18-plus population have received the first dose of the Covid vaccine. The vaccination percentage comes to 35% when the completion of the second dose is taken into consideration in the population. “Going by the current speed, we would be able to vaccinate the entire eligible population with the first dose in another month,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-likely-to-surpass-1cr-vax-doses-milestone-today/articleshow/86437513.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Lucknow||Downpour added sting to dengue in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: The spurt in dengue cases due to water stagnation in many areas after last week’s heavy rainfall continued on Wednesday with two confirmed and 13 suspected patients reporting at city hospitals in the past 24 hours. The extensive water-logging after the downpour subsided in six days, but left behind puddles at construction sites, vacant plots, in abandoned objects. This stagnant water has not yet been cleaned and is serving as breeding haven for mosquitoes including dengue carrier Aedes aegypti, said experts. Of 177 confirmed dengue cases in September so far, almost one third have come in the past six days. Though Covid-19 has subsided, the city is already witnessing a spike in viral fever cases. Experts warn if cleaning exercise is not taken up by civic agencies on war footing, there could be an outbreak of mosquito and water-borne diseases Among new cases, two serious patients admitted to emergency ward of Lokbandhu hospital were diagnosed with dengue through the ELISA test. Besides, 13 patients who visited OPDs of Lokbandhu Hospital, SPM Civil Hospital and Balrampur hospital tested positive through card method. Their samples have been sent for the confirmatory tests. Health officials said most of the cases are coming from Vipul Khand, Vivek Khand, Vijay Khand, Indiranagar, Telibagh, LDA colony, Kanpur road and Rajajipuram as well. A few cases have been reported from the Old City areas, including Faizullaganj, Balaganj, Para. In many areas, heavy waterlogging was reported following Thursday’s rains. “Aedes aegypti lays eggs in fresh stagnant water which is in abundance At times, these eggs remain dormant for long and hatch when the atmosphere is conducive. Hence, all efforts should be made to keep the environment clean,” said Dr Rahul Gam, expert in vector-borne disease and consultant with National Health Authority. Prof Vineeta Mittal, faculty at Community Medicine Department, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “To check dengue, people should make sure that fresh water doesn’t get accumulated anywhere inside or near the house. Civic authorities should also take responsibility to remove breeding grounds in the open areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/downpour-added-sting-to-dengue/articleshow/86439863.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Pune||Handwriting goes awry, Pune ZP plans 40-min sessions to restore it||Pune: Handwriting has been one of the biggest casualties of online education reported across classes by teachers, prompting the Pune zilla parishad to introduce a 40-minute session every week for students from Stds I to X on how to write. The Pune ZP will also implement a ten-point programme in all its schools for improvement in education. This includes enhancing general knowledge, elocution and solving worksheets immediately for students. Teachers will be trained for conducting these sessions online. Chief executive officer of Pune ZP Ayush Prasad said online education has ruined the writing practices of children and the handwriting of a majority of students had become very poor. He said a meeting of all the block education officers was held on July 3 and a 10-point quality development programme was decided to be implemented across all schools in Pune district. “The report and output of this programme needs to be submitted by the teachers and principals regarding the progress of implementation of this programme from time to time,” he added. Prasad said an inspection by education officers, centre heads and also block development officers must be conducted to ensure that schools are implementing this programme. A mindfulness session for minutes before the start of school and after the school session ends every day should be conducted to inculcate and practice better concentration and focus among students. The programme will also include a basic assessment of the students’ level of learning and based on the outcome activity sheets for improvement shall be given. A separate activity programme will be conducted for students based on every individual’s shortcomings, Prasad added. The education office of the Pune ZP will prepare activity books for self-study which will be distributed in the form of booklets to the students. The 10-point programme includes preparing students for the scholarship exams conducted by the education department for standards V and VIII. A general knowledge quiz competition will be organised for students to enhance their personality and awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/handwriting-goes-awry-pune-zp-plans-40-min-sessions-to-restore-it/articleshow/86437522.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Agra||Two men thrashed by cow vigilantes in Mathura||AGRA: Two men, identified as Ayub and Mausim, were intercepted and beaten up brutally by a mob in Mathura on Wednesday for carrying meat through an area where a ban on the food item is in place now after an announcement earlier by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath. For 16 minutes, the right-wing outfit went live on Facebook, recording their assault — the men were kicked and slapped repeatedly — and asking viewers to share the video. At least 15 people had gathered to beat up the men. Ayub, 40, and Mausim, 23, were crouching on the ground as the mob rained blows on them. “Ayub runs a licensed meat shop at Raya town and was taking meat there,” said a Muslim leader who didn’t want to be named. Ayub, Mausim and the driver of the vehicle they were in, Bahadur, have been arrested for "defiling place of worship and cow slaughter".  At least 15 people had gathered to beat up the men. On Wednesday, cow vigilante outfit Gau Rakshak Dal mobilised locals in Mathura to attack the men — claiming that besides the “violation” of the ban, the meat was beef, which is banned in UP. “I got information that two men were transporting beef even though there is a ban enforced in Mathura,” the complainant, Gau Raksha Dal Mathura district president Sitaram Sharma, told the police. He did not name the driver. “He was not at fault,” he later told TOI. “He is Hindu.” Bahadur was, however, arrested later. Ayub, 40, and Mausim, 23, were crouching on the ground as the mob rained blows on them.“Our informer had told us that meat was being transported from Agra to Mathura, which is illegal,” said Gau Rakshak Dal president Ravi Kant Sharma. “After following them from the Yamuna Expressway exit, we stopped them at Mahavir Colony and handed them over to the police.” Ayub and Mausim were arrested under sections 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship) and 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of the IPC, and under the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act. “About 160 kg meat has been seized and its samples sent for testing,” a police officer said. Mathura SP (city) MP Singh said the accused have been sent to judicial custody. He added, “The accused didn’t have a transit permit nor a refrigerator for transporting perishables — both of which are mandatory."

In a matter like this, the state government should support the petition and tell the court to do what is right...not come and oppose it,” senior advocate Iqbal Chagla argued for the daughters before a bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar. The daughters urged the HC to appoint them legal guardians and managers of their mother’s person and property and to operate her bank accounts. The octogenarian has been in a Navi Mumbai care facility since 2019. The JJ Hospital panel certified that her dementia has advanced, she is hard of hearing, and has incoherent speech and impaired judgement. State advocate, Geeta Sh-astri, said the petitioners have an alternate remedy to go before the authority/comm-ittee under the Mental Hea-lth Care Act, Rights of Perso-ns with Disabilities Act and National Trust Act. But Ch-agla said these laws limit the powers of a legal guardian only to treatment. They will not provide for care of the mother’s affairs, including operating her bank accounts and renting her flat. “Alternate remedy must be equally efficacious remedy,” he said. Urging the HC to intervene saying it is a matter of justice, Chagla said: “The court cannot be a spectator. Here is an 84-year-old who has funds, but she cannot access it. We are not asking the state to pay...we’ll do it.” He said the care facility has paid her hospital bills and the daughters have offered to maintain accounts to show the money will be us-ed for their mother’s benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-must-show-humanity-in-pleas-for-legal-guardians/articleshow/86441461.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The state police had issued orders to its forces not to participate in processions in violation of Covid-19 rules. Director general of police Damodar Gautam Sawang, who took the incident seriously, has moved out the entire unit members to their parent departments. Charge memos were also issued to two senior officials of the Octopus unit at Tirumala. Ahead of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, the Andhra Pradesh police department had issued restrictions on processions across the state citing Covid-19 guidelines. But after videos of the Octopus elite forces stationed at Tirumala carrying out Vinayaka Chavithi procession on the hill town went viral on the social media recently, the police top boss cracked the whip. As many as 15 members of the Octopus unit have been moved out. A senior police official, who did not want to be named, told TOI that the Octopus unit at Tirumala should remain on a high alert 24/7 owing to the importance of the sacred hill town. “The Octopus unit has to remain on standby at all times as you never know when a potential threat situation may arise. But as the entire unit was seen celebrating and taking part in the Vinayaka Chavithi procession in deviation from their line of duty, the whole unit has been moved out and replaced with a new unit”, the official added. The disciplinary action was necessary because while prohibitory curbs were imposed on Vinayaka Chavithi processions across the state due to Covid-19 and celebration in public places was called off, the action of the Octopus unit was totally unwarranted, another police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/octopus-jawans-join-ganesh-fete-shifted/articleshow/86441463.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The police have established the identity of the fraudster and are on his trail. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake told TOI, “The suspect bought the phones from electronic shops in Delhi after making a duplicate card using the Pune victim’s details. He sold them to some small shopkeepers in Delhi. They, in turn, sold the cellphones to customers. We have now seized six of these phones.” The Pune company professional, whose card details were misused, had lodged a complaint with the cyber police in January last year soon after the fraud. The police were investigating the matter. Inspector Kumar Ghadge of the cyber police said, “The suspect is a criminal on Delhi police record. He has borrowed money from many people.

---||Delhi||East Delhi civic body’s spa policy bars cross-gender massage||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday received anticipatory approval from the mayor to implement new guidelines for running spa centres in its areas. “A draft proposal with detailed guidelines, which primarily focussed on restricting cross-gender massage in spa centres, was earlier verified by the Delhi government’s law department and approved by the LG. Now that we have managed to get the anticipatory approval from the mayor, the implementation process can start with immediate effect,” said a senior EDMC official. He added that the east corporation would now start serving copies of the guidelines to all the spa centres. “We will ask them to follow the norms strictly. After waiting for a certain time, we may take action against the defaulters as well. The guidelines are on the lines of the policies notified in Goa and Tamil Nadu for running spa centres,” said the official. The development happened as the Delhi government, in response to a petition challenging the new guidelines prohibiting cross-gender massage in spas, told Delhi High Court on Tuesday that these were yet to be notified and were not being enforced at the moment. The government counsel added that till September 20, existing guidelines were enforced to issue licences. EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Agarwal said that he had given anticipatory approval to the proposal and the new rules would be applicable to all the spa centres. According to the new guidelines, cross-gender massages will not be allowed in spa centres and facilities will not be provided behind closed doors.

Rakesh Tikait, the national spokesperson of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, addressed the rally. In his address, he slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government for “anti-farmer policies”. Tikait said, “In his last seven years, Modi has divided us on the lines of caste and religion and ruined the future of our youths and farmers. If he doesn’t roll back the farm laws, we will continue our dharna till 2024 Lok Sabha elections.” Notably, September 27 marks ten months of the farmers’ protest at the Delhi border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-continue-to-protest-till-2024-if-farm-laws-arent-rolled-back-tikait/articleshow/86435582.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Pune||Bharat Biotech’s Manjari plant licence expected soon||PUNE: District collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Wednesday told TOI that the test and commercial licence for Bharat Biotech’s Manjari plant was expected soon and a trial run is likely to take place in October. “The company applied for a test and commercial licence from the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday. Machinery and manpower of about 100 people is already in place,” said the collector, who spoke to company officials regarding the production of Covaxin doses in Pune. Company officials told the collector that they are awaiting validation so that they can begin operations in October. The unit was scheduled to commence operations in mid-October. While Bharat Biotech has not given its comments on the developments to TOI, sources said production takes three months so the actual roll out of the vaccines is expected only in December. Pune is among the four units of Bharat Biotech that is expected to scale up production of Covaxin doses. State health officials said that once the plant starts functioning, production of vaccine doses will be ramped up in the state. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has asked the local administration to extend all help. The state government is hoping that the new unit will help improve vaccine supplies. Maharashtra has been seeking three crore doses per month to vaccinate 10-15 lakh people daily. “If we have a production unit in the state, it will help us procure doses easily,” said an official from the public health department. Company officials declined to speak about their plans despite repeated requests. Bharat Biotech, in an earlier release, said the timeline for manufacturing, testing and release of a batch of Covaxin doses takes approximately 120 days, depending on the technology framework and regulatory guidelines to be met. In May, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and collector Deshmukh had visited the plant at Manjari and held detailed discussions with officials of Bharat Biotech. The administration was banking on the Manjari plant to produce at least 15-20 million doses per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bharat-biotechs-manjari-plant-licence-expected-soon/articleshow/86437533.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Dehradun||As Char Dham Yatra begins, traders & hotel owners seek further relaxation to Covid Curfew restrictions||Dehradun: In the wake of the Char Dham Yatra being opened for pilgrims, traders and hoteliers have asked for further relaxation to Covid Curfew restrictions. While the shopkeepers have asked the state government to remove the mandatory weekly closure order, the hoteliers say that the cap on occupancy in bars and eateries should be lifted. Pankaj Mason, who heads the Doon Valley Mahanagar Udyog Vyapar Mandal, told TOI, “Traders have faced heavy losses in the Covid phase. Now, business prospects are finally looking bright due to large-scale vaccination and the upcoming festive season. As most of the people go shopping on Sunday, there should be no weekly closure on the day.” A soft toy shop owner in Char Galli, Vikas Verma, has said that the traders are conscious of the Covid-19 threat and prevent consumers from gathering in their shops. “We take utmost precautions and thus, the government should allow markets to open on Sunday. If needed, personnel can be deployed to check overcrowding in markets. This would help us tide over losses.” Meanwhile, Sandeep Sahni, president of the Uttarakhand hotel association, has pointed out that not many tourists are coming for the Char Dham Yatra, which has recently started, this season. “Under such scenario, we request the government to provide us soft loans. The interest can be subsidised by the government. We also need an exemption from water and electricity charges. We have been suffering losses for 18 months now. Thus, state aid would be crucial for several hoteliers,” Sahni added. When asked about the issue, Subodh Uniyal, agriculture minister and state government spokesperson, told TOI, “Hotels have operated for the most part of this year and no major restrictions were imposed. A number of trader delegations have met me and we have accepted most of their demands. However, we should keep in mind that the Covid-19 threat has not subsided yet. We will look into the issues of traders and take a call accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-char-dham-yatra-begins-traders-hotel-owners-seek-further-relaxation-to-covid-curfew-restrictions/articleshow/86435615.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Sale of Covid mitigation drugs & products declines by 90%||PUNE: The sale of Covid-19 mitigation products and drugs like sanitizers, masks, immunity booster Vitamin C, pulse oximeters and even Remdesivir has plunged by about 90% across India, including Maharashtra, with the second wave waning. Till June this year, the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists Associations (AlOCDA) had pegged the decline in sale of masks and sanitizers by about 40%. Jagannath Shinde, the president of AlOCDA, said, “Over 1.5 lakh Remdesivir vials have expired with stockists in Maharashtra as there have been few takers and its manufacturers are not accepting the expired stocks despite several letters to them. Almost 200 stockists across India had Remdesivir stocks worth a month, which have now expired. Some stockists had 100-500 vials.” Shinde said there was still some demand for Remdesivir in states like Kerala. But most other states, including Maharashtra, recorded a major drop, he said. He pegged the number of expired vials of Remdesivir at about 1-1.5 lakh in Maharashtra. Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19, also the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI, “The drop in demand for Remdesivir has been due to twin reasons: its limited use and drop in Covid cases. During the initial days of the second wave, Remdesivir was being used frequently. Studies later showed that it was only beneficial to a niche group of patients,” he said. A senior official from the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told TOI, “There is a possibility of unsold Remdesivir vials with some stockists expiring. When there was a huge demand for it in the past, manufacturers might have given those stocks to suppliers on a no-return basis. As the demand for the drug fell, some of the stock may have now crossed the expiry date.” Barring Ahmednagar, Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara, the other districts in Maharashtra were showing a significant drop (90%) in sale of all products and drugs related to Covid, said Shinde. “There is no market of vitamin C, sanitizers and masks with stocks for almost two months lying unsold with retailers and wholesalers currently,” he said. All India Mask Manufacturers’ Association president Anshumali Jain quoted a 90% drop in sales of masks since the second wave waned. Maharashtra Chemists & Druggists Association secretary Anil Navandar said mask and sanitizer sales were now almost nil. On the increasing number of people flouting Covid appropriate behaviour, Dr Pujari, the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, said it might have to do with aspects like “pandemic fatigue”, drop in Covid cases and increase in vaccination rates. “Still, people must not let their guard down and continue to follow all the necessary norms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sale-of-covid-mitigation-drugs-products-declines-by-90/articleshow/86437573.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Doctors remove 3.5kg tumour from senior citizen’s chest cavity||Pune: Surgeons at a city hospital have operated upon a 70-year-old farmer from Uttar Pradesh and removed a 3.5kg cancerous tumour from his chest cavity. The farmer was admitted to DY Patil Medical College and Hospital with acute breathing difficulty last month. A slew of tests revealed a giant cancerous tumour had occupied his chest cavity, completely compressing the left lung. The tumour was attached to the blood vessels of the heart and lungs on the left. Due to the tumour’s size and weight, the function of the heart and lungs was compromised. The surgery on August 24 had lasted for around six hours and the surgeons could remove the 3.5kg tumour by opening the patient’s chest and then separating it from the vital organs. Solitary fibrous tumours (SFT) are rare growths of soft tissue cells that can form nearly anywhere in the body. They tend to grow slowly and may not cause signs and symptoms until they become very large. “Chemotherapy and radiation have no role in such cases. Surgery was the only option,” the hospital’s chief cancer surgeon, Samir Gupta, said. The other doctors in the team who performed the challenging surgery along with Gupta on August 24 were cancer surgeons Sanket Banker, Suyash Agrawal and Pankaj Kshirsagar. The patient had come to his daughter’s house in Pune for treatment. “I would get breathless after walking a few steps. It worsened in the past eight months,” he said. He would also feel light-headed or giddy in the early mornings. "The tumor occupied at least three-quarters of the left side of the chest causing an extreme shift of windpipe onto the opposite side. Thus, giving anesthesia was a challenge," said the hospital's chief anaesthesiologist Bhavini Shah. The patient’s post-operative recovery was smooth. “Since surgery is the only treatment for SFT, no further treatment is required. Besides, there is no chance of recurrence as well,” Gupta said. The patient was discharged a week ago and is doing well. “The hospital’s state-of-the-art equipment, specialist doctors have made managing high-risk and complex surgeries possible,” said the hospital's medical superintendent, HH Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctors-remove-3-5kg-tumour-from-senior-citizens-chest-cavity/articleshow/86437579.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Vingada has been appointed as Egypt’s strategic advisor and technical director, and he wants Francisco, the coach who assisted him during spells at NorthEast United FC, Kerala Blasters FC and the Malaysian national team. Francisco, 39, is expected to travel to Egypt next week. “His appointment is already confirmed,” a source told TOI on Thursday. “In Egypt, he will assist Vingada, so he will have to take up whatever is assigned to him. It could be youth development, junior teams or even the seniors.” Last season, Francisco was named coach at East Bengal but before he could take charge, the Kolkata giants – with backing from Shree Cement – made it to the Indian Super League (ISL) where Robbie Fowler was appointed as coach. The Goan coach has previously worked in Malaysia and Bangladesh. In Egypt, he will get to work with another famous manager, Carlos Queiroz. The former Portugal coach, who has worked in Africa, Asia, Europe and South America, has joined Mohamed Salah’s team after most recently being in charge of the Colombia national team. Meanwhile, Vingada returns to Egypt after making a name for himself with Zamalek SC when he led them to Egyptian Premier League titles unbeaten. He was also formerly in-charge of the Egyptian under-23 national team, but was sacked after they failed to qualify for the Olympics in 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-coach-francisco-bruto-da-costa-to-work-with-egypt-fa/articleshow/86466508.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The BJP called the allegations “baseless”. Bharadwaj alleged in a press conference on Wednesday that the quality of education at municipal corporation schools was “terrible” and so was the state of buildings, infrastructure, and system of distributing uniforms, books and midday meals. “Students studying in MCD schools have reduced from 3 lakh to 2.3 lakh in the last few years,” he said, adding that there are schools with only 30-40 students and 36 such schools have been merged. “Out of these 36 schools, BJP-led MCD has released tenders for 14 schools. Now, these government school buildings will be sold to private coaching centres and institutes,” he alleged. “MCD’s budget is of Rs 6,872 crore and only 1.5% of it is given to education, while Delhi government gives 25% to education.” Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that the north corporation was not leasing or selling any of its schools to private coaching centres. He said the north corporation had many school buildings lying empty as certain areas especially in the City Zone had gone commercial with very little population left. “Across the country, municipal primary schools run on funds given by the central and state governments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bharadwaj-claims-corpn-schools-are-being-sold-to-coaching-institutes/articleshow/86439980.cms||---

The standing committee will take a decision on the proposal in the meeting on September 24. As per the proposal tabled before standing committee, NMC health department sought 5.39 crore for recruiting back 611 healthcare workers for three months. Also, 527 healthcare workers will be continued for vaccination duties at a cost of 4.46 crore, 58 healthcare workers for Covid Hospital at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya at a cost of 75.96 lakh, and 26 at Covid Hospital at Isolation Hospital at a cost of 17.19 lakh. NMC officials told TOI, “NMC used to get 3 crore per month as salaries of healthcare workers for its five Covid Hospitals and majority of staff on vaccination duty from the central government. The Centre stopped paying it from August 1. NMC continued 527 healthcare workers for vaccination at its own cost and closed down five Covid Hospitals. As cases are on rise, we need to restart Covid Hospitals. Plan is to start Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya first followed by others subject to number of patients. Proposal will be sent to the Centre seeking salaries. But NMC will have to bear it in case the Centre refuses to pay salaries. Therefore, proposal has been submitted before the standing committee.” Positive cases were in single digits for majority of days in August in the district. In last 10 days, cases have been in double digit on seven days. There were 16 cases on Wednesday in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-restart-covid-hospitals-at-own-expense/articleshow/86435641.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||After festival duties, 8,500 Nagpur cops undergoing RT-PCR tests||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the city police have started compulsory RT-PCR testing of all the 8,500 cops as an additional preventive measure following the just-concluded festivities. As on Wednesday, over 3,830 cops have been tested while remaining would be covered in the coming days. None of them has tested positive since the start of the drive from September second week. CP Amitesh Kumar said that the plan to test all the cops stemmed from the fact that they could be potentially asymptomatic carriers and, hence, proactive precautionary measures were required. “The drive was launched after a cop’s father, who had never stepped out, and 12 cops who returned from Pune tested positive,” said the CP. The CP said that the cops also got substantially exposed during Ganeshotsav bandobast and immersion, which “warranted a round of testing to find out any one positive among them, followed by isolation at the earliest”. Though all the cops are fully vaccinated, the city brass wanted to ensure they don’t become carriers. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said that the civic body is ready to perform as many daily tests as possible. “We are leaving nothing to chance. We need such measure to keep the cases low,” said the civic chief. Dr Sandeep Shinde, medical officer at Police Headquarters hospital, said the drive is in continuation of the testing started since the detection of 12 positive cops. The 11 cops were among the 33 personnel who had returned from a training in Pune. All of them have been discharged from the MLA Hostel Covid Care centre. The NMC has formed 14 teams for spot testing. Of these, 10 teams are visiting police stations in the proximity of their zones during morning and evening shifts. Dr Shinde said the drive is being undertaken as per CP’s instructions. “A 24x7 unit is set up at the police hospital on Katol Road for any cop who needs to be tested. Additional staff too has been shortlisted for setting up five more units in every DCP zone offices,” he said. The medical officer said that during second wave, 630 cops had tested positive while three had died. One the three deceased cops had tested positive after an accident while the other two had comorbidities. He said that 98% cops and their families have been vaccinated and only 2% breastfeeding mothers or allergic persons are remaining. The city police has formed three teams. “One is for contact tracing, one to manage quarantine process and another just to look into the needs of cops and their families testing positive,” said Shinde. While rest of the citizens can get jabbed between 11am and 5pm, vaccination centre is open 24x7 for cops and families. Dr Shinde further said that 107 recruits at RPTS had been deployed on bandobast duties at various places across the state. “Of the 40 recruits deployed at Malegaon, one has tested positive. He has been shifted to MLA CCC,” said Dr Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-festival-duties-8500-city-cops-undergoing-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/86435664.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Pune||PUNE: Amid opposition, civic body puts amenity space plan on hold for now||PUNE: The general body meeting of the civic body on Wednesday did not approve the controversial proposal to lease out amenity spaces despite it being on the agenda. “We have decided to keep the proposal on hold for some time. Unless and until there is consensus, the proposal will not be tabled,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol. Opposition parties in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have termed the change in stance by the BJP-ruled civic body as a victory of the people. The PMC’s general body had postponed taking a decision on the proposal to the second week of September. The proposal was again listed on Wednesday’s agenda. After changing its stance twice, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had finally decided to oppose the pan. City NCP president Prashant Jagtap said the BJP was planning to clear the proposal based on its majority in the civic body. “But opposition from the people and political leaders forced the BJP to put the decision on hold. Public properties were going to be handed over to private players to protect vested interests. This has been stopped now,” said Jagtap. Congress and the Shiv Sena had opposed the move and stuck to their stance. The PMC had decided to lease out 270 amenity spaces to private players. As per the plan, these spaces were to be developed through public private partnership (PPP) model. BJP had claimed that leasing out the amenity spaces would have led to development and also generated Rs1,753 crore in revenue for the PMC. Earlier, at the end of August, NCP had first opposed the proposal and then later decided to support it. Later, the party withdrew support at the last minute before the proposal was tabled before the general body meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/amid-opposition-civic-body-puts-amenity-space-plan-on-hold-for-now/articleshow/86437633.cms||---

Talking to reporters outside the ED headquarters, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that the party was unfazed and would fully cooperate in the process. The summons were issued by the ED to Gupta on September 13 in connection with its investigation in money laundering cases. “In an unending quest to persecute Aam Aadmi Party, every agency of PM Modi’s government has been unleashed against us. This time, in a first, the party has received a summons from the Enforcement Directorate,” Chadha said. “All these agencies, for the last eight years, have looked into every book of accounts of AAP. Not even a single assessment year has passed by when we have not received these assessment notices,” he said. “These political revenge-seeking departments will not be successful in their attempts. We are here to fully cooperate with them, but we also must understand that this is not a legal notice but a political move,” he said. “These summons are the consequences of the growing popularity of Arvind Kejriwal and AAP throughout the country,” he claimed. “These notices are not going to deter us. Try to win the hearts of the people, like Kejriwal has done. Don’t try to intimidate us using these agencies and sending us these notices,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/money-laundering-case-aap-says-centre-using-ed-to-target-partys-govt/articleshow/86439948.cms||---

In a new twist to the ongoing battle for M P Birla group assets between Lodhas and Birlas, a host of new nominees had sought induction in the boards of Birla Corporation, Universal Cable, Birla Cables and Vidhya Telelink. The applications were made through Punjab Produce and Trading Company, an investment firm of M P Birla group arguably under control of Harsh Lodha. The operating companies, in separate regulatory filings, said Punjab Produce & Trading Co has ongoing litigations with the companies and entities belonging to M P Birla Group, and therefore, inductions of its nominees on the boards of directors of the companies could be detrimental to the interest of the companies and other stakeholders as there is a possibility of conflict of interest. Punjab Produce & Trading Co has earlier sent notices to the group's operating companies, proposing board seats for its nominees on the companies' board of directors. “The boards of the operating companies have reviewed the nominations suggested by two members of the APL Committee in spite of opposition from the third member, and have strongly recommended that shareholders vote against the resolutions appointing these persons as directors because it could lead to serious conflict of interest. We have faith in the wisdom of shareholders that these resolutions will be defeated," said Debanjan Mandal, partner, Fox & Mandal. Birla Corporation, in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday, said subsequent to the issuance of the AGM Notice, it received a notice in writing from The Punjab Produce & Trading Co, proposing the candidature of Rameshwar Singh Thakur for the office of director of the company. Accordingly, the proposal for the appointment of Thakur shall be an additional agenda as special business in addendum to Notice of the annual general meeting, which is scheduled on September 29. The company, in the stock exchange filing, said its nomination and remuneration committee and the board of directors at their respective meetings have strongly recommended "against" the appointment of Thakur as a director of the company after careful evaluation of his candidature. "Even though the Notice under Section 160 of the Act is issued by the Punjab Produce, it is at the dictates of Justice Mohit S. Shah (Retired) and Mr. A. C. Chakrabortti, two of the three joint Administrator Pendente Lite (APLs) to the Estate of Late Priyamvada Devi Birla, the other joint APLs being Mr. Mahendra Kumar Sharma being totally opposed to them," Birla Corporation said. Birla Cable, in a stock exchange filing on September 15, said it received two notices from Punjab Produce & Trading Co, signifying candidatures of Dhanpat Ram Agarwal for office of director of the company and Satish Pradhan for the office of the director of the company in place of Harsh V. Lodha, director retiring by rotation at the forthcoming AGM of the company. Interestingly, AGMs of Birla Cable, Universal Cables and Vindhya Telelinks are scheduled on September 23. Notably, the genesis of over 17-year-old legal row between the Birlas and the Lodhas over controlling the Birla Estate lies in the contested will of late Priyamvada Devi Birla, which was executed in July 1982 after the purported will allegedly transferred the shares of the MP Birla Group, collectively called as the Birla Estate, in favour of Rajendra Singh Lodha. The legal tussle began after the July, 1982 wills that gave away all the assets to charities but another will of April 18, 1999 gave them to Rajendra Singh Lodha, now being pursued by his son Harsh Vardhan Lodha, and other heirs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mp-birla-cos-oppose-induction-of-new-nominees-from-investment-arm/articleshow/86437629.cms||---

---||Nagpur||HC seeks status report on Amravati-Jalgaon highway works||NAGPUR: Censuring the authorities for worsening conditions of a national highway passing from Amravati to Jalgaon via Akola, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday sought a status report on its repair and widening works. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor also demanded a progress report on National Highway Authority of India’s (NHAI) claims on making the stretch between Nagpur and Amravati, smooth and strong for vehicular traffic, with the photographic evidence. “We direct the respondents to submit to their road map giving details of plan and the time within which, the entire work would be completed and NH-53 from Nagpur to Malkapur is made worthy of vehicular traffic,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing till September 29. The directives came while hearing a PIL (No 22/2019) by lawyer Arun Patil through counsel Firdos Mirza highlighting the pathetic conditions of Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon road and Wardha-Sindhkhed Raja road which led to many fatal mishaps and loss of precious lives. “It appears that NH-53 (Earlier NH-6) has been under repairs and widening process for over five to six years. But, instead of seeing any improvement in the condition, there is a deterioration,” the bench said. Earlier, Mirza pointed out that the stretch between Nagpur and Amravati is in bad condition as no repairs are being carried out. He contended that there are big potholes at many places and the possibility of accidents leading to loss of precious human lives and property is grave. He said while the toll is religiously collected by the contractor, the duty to keep the road well maintained and user friendly is regularly breached. NHAI counsel Aneesh Kathane then sought a week’s time, stating that he was not keeping well. In the last hearing, on September 18, 2019, the HC had made it clear that it would appoint court commissioners to supervise the repair process, after the authorities failed to improve the poor conditions of the highway. The judges had asked Mirza to name persons who would be in the team of court commissioners after which he suggested inclusion of PWD chief engineer, a judicial officer and a lawyer. TOI, on January 19, 2019, had exposed NHAI’s tall claims of building highways at the speed of 25km per day by highlighting dangerous conditions of the 485km Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon-Fagane highway. Travellers go through a harrowing time as expansion has come to a grinding halt for over two years after NHAI concessionaire went bankrupt owing to a financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-seeks-status-report-on-amravati-jalgaon-highway-works/articleshow/86435682.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Subhash sought to know from the MP on his contribution to the development of the nation. “You are always provoking people against the BJP — be it the welfare of people or security of the nation.

---||Delhi||Give compensation to farmers whose crops destroyed by flooding: Delhi BJP||NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP on Wednesday demanded Rs 5,000-per-acre compensation from Delhi government for the farmers whose land has got flooded and standing crops have been destroyed. The demand was made after Delhi BJP functionaries visited several villages on the outskirts of the city. “Paddy crop has been destroyed on 50 thousand bighas in 70 villages under four assembly constituencies — Bawana, Narela, Mundka and Matiala. There is water all around and farmers have suffered huge financial losses,” said leader of opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri. He demanded that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should immediately visit these areas and suitably compensate the farmers. Delhi BJP farmers’ cell president Vinod Sehrawat demanded that the government should make immediate arrangements for drainage of water from the land. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and general secretary Dinesh Pratap Singh, along with other party functionaries, protested near the chief minister’s residence and demanded unemployment allowance in Delhi. Gupta said Kejriwal had promised unemployment allowance in Uttarakhand and other election-bound states, but Delhi government wasn’t doing anything similar. “If the Kejriwal government does not pay unemployment allowance to the registered and non-registered 25 lakh youths, Delhi BJP will launch a mass movement against it,” Gupta said. Delhi government said it had done more than any other state to help the poor and unemployed deal with Covid-19. One such scheme is Rojgar Bazaar, under which 17,000 employers have posted over 10 lakh jobs in the last one year while over 13,000 youths have been deployed as bus marshals, it said. Thousands have been employed through civil defence and doorstep delivery initiatives, it added. In all, over 1.5 million jobs have been provided during the AAP government’s tenure, it stated. The government has also given grants to help auto and e-rickshaw drivers as well as construction workers deal with loss of livelihood due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-give-compensation-to-farmers-whose-crops-destroyed-by-flooding/articleshow/86440009.cms||---
---||Dehradun||People affected due to Tehri Dam construction yet to be rehabilitated, alleges PIL in U’khand HC||Nainital: A public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) has alleged that people affected by the construction of the Tehri dam are yet to be rehabilitated and that despite 14 years of its operationalisation, it is yet to function at its full capacity. The PIL, filed by Dehradun-resident Abhinav Thapar, argues that several villages of the erstwhile Tehri Riyasat (kingdom) were submerged for building the dam. Additionally, hundreds of families had to migrate even after the dam construction due to collateral damage. These people are yet to be rehabilitated, added the petition. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma heard the matter and stated that it will not go into the optimal utilisation part of the dam since these are technical issues and not something for the judges to look into. Later, Justice Verma recused himself from the case. “We are not trained engineers, therefore, don't ask us to go into that arena… How to achieve optimal capacity is not for judges... We do not have a magic wand,” said Chief Justice Chauhan. Meanwhile, the counsel appearing for the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDC) informed the HC that every person affected by the project has been rehabilitated. He said that the dam has been in the works since the 1970s and it was only after the rehabilitation of locals that the project began. The Chief Justice has directed the case to be listed for further hearing before a bench where Justice Verma is not a member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/people-affected-due-to-tehri-dam-construction-yet-to-be-rehabilitated-alleges-pil-in-ukhand-hc/articleshow/86435712.cms||Prashant Jha

Petitioners Madhukar Gomkale, Babarao Runjhe and others have challenged rejection of their four applications in this regard by the special court hearing scam cases on August 28. They pointed out that poor and destitute depositors, a majority of whom are farmers, were cheated, looted, and defrauded by master minds like animal husbandry and dairy development minister Sunil Kedar, and other accused. While fixing the hearing for disposal at the admission stage, justice Rohit Deo issued notices to the respondent – Maharashtra government through Sadar police station – asking it to reply before Monday. The chief judicial magistrate (CJM) had rejected the four applications noting that these do not fall within provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Contending that they are victims of the criminal and illegal acts of the accused, the petitioners through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar stressed on allowing them to join the prosecution in trial to secure ends of justice. They said they find it necessary to bring their assistance to prosecution to enable the trial to be adjudicated in the most fair and comprehensive manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ndccb-scam-shareholders-move-hc-for-nod-to-assist-prosecution/articleshow/86435692.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Lucknow||Process to terminate girl’s pregnancy starts||Lucknow: The process to terminate the pregnancy of the 14-year-old Dalit rape survivor from Lakhimpur Kheri has begun at Queen Mary’s Hospital (QMH) of KGMU. The girl, raped by a relative who is now in jail, has been given oral medication to terminate the pregnancy of 22 weeks. Her pregnancy was discovered in August when she complained of stomach ache and was taken to hospital. On September 14, the minor, represented by her widowed mother in court, received court order for termination of the unwanted pregnancy to “save her from lifelong trauma and mental torture”. She was brought to the hospital on Tuesday night after a medical board constituted on perusal of the court order referred her because of complications in pregnancy. “The process of pregnancy termination has started. The required investigations were done on Wednesday and thereafter, medication was started. The process takes 24-48 hours to complete,” said QMH medical superintendent Dr SP Jaiswar. “Pregnancy termination in the second trimester is difficult. Besides, the girl here is very weak and young. We are following all due safety protocols,” she explained. The girl’s lawyer, however, said that the Lakhimpur medical team had not provided her medical reports to the doctors at QMH. “When doctors asked the Kheri medical board for reports, we contacted the CMO. Only then did he send the ultrasound report but nothing more. There were no blood test or other reports to ascertain complications,” said lawyer Haider Rizvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/process-to-terminate-girls-pregnancy-starts/articleshow/86439987.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

She is currently the VC of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Bihar. The letters were issued by Union ministry of education on Wednesday. Singh was serving his second term as DTU VC since April this year. He would be the 23rd DU VC succeeding professor Yogesh Tyagi, who was suspended last October over allegations of irregularities and dereliction of duty. Pro-VC PC Joshi was holding the charge since then. Before joining DTU in 2017, Singh served as director of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology from 2014-2017, VC of Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda between 2011 and 2014, and as dean of information technology at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University from 2001 to 2006.

Some of the big challenges to be faced by Singh include implementation of various schemes under National Education Policy, 2020, such as the four-year undergraduate with multiple entry-exit programme as well as completing teachers’ appointments. A section of teachers and students have been opposing the four-year programme as well as NEP. Speaking to TOI, Singh said, “It’s a matter of pride to be appointed the VC of such a great seat of learning. We will take all necessary steps required for the growth and development of such a big institution.” The President had in July approved the appointment of 12 vice-chancellors for central universities in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Hyderabad.

Party’s national general secretary B L Santosh evaluated the performance of all 71 MLAs and position of the party in remaining 129 seats is seen as party first step towards assembly polls which is touted as Mission 2023. “On the basis of the feedback, the senior leaders have prepared a strategy for the party workers and leaders to work till the elections in the state. It was decided that prime focus has to be on promoting the social welfare schemes of Modi government,” said a party source. Also, instructions have been given to the state leaders by B L Santosh and BJP national in charge in Rajasthan Arun Singh that they should develop statewide campaigns on multiple subjects highlighting the failures of the Gehlot government. “The party workers have to be kept in action mode till the elections approach. Also, keeping the failures of the state government remained in the memory of the state is very important as these will going to be real issues in the elections,” said a party source. Indicating the two-day meet directed for mission 2023, BJP state president Satish Poonia tweeted a picture of praying in a local temple in Kumbhalgarh for the success of the party in 2023. The absence of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje was discussed in the meetings held on both days. “The absence of Raje at a time when she is projecting herself as the tallest leader in the state is very damaging. This is the first meeting in which all the 200 seats, 25 Lok Sabha seats and party’s grip in seven divisions was discussed in great detail under the leadership of Santosh, who is considered a master strategist in the party,” said a top-level source. Replying to media on a question of Janta Sena’s and former BJP leader Randeer Singh Bhinder’s giving party’s ticket from Vallabhnagar assembly seat, Poonia said, “The parliamentary board of the party will decide the candidate after through feedback from the ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-holds-meet-to-discuss-partys-position-in-all-200-assembly-seats/articleshow/86440037.cms||---
---||Pune||Section of corporators opposes penalty relief for property tax dues||PUNE: A group of elected members of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has raised objection to using the arbitration route for giving penalty waiver and resolving the long pending property tax dues. The opposing corporators claimed that the scheme has been introduced to benefit a few big tax defaulters and the ruling party leaders. The BJP, which is ruling the PMC, has refuted the charge, saying that all the legal formalities have been followed before introducing the initiative. The move aims at increasing the revenue of the civic administration, it said. The PMC has organised a Lok Adalat on September 25, where 500 cases of tax defaulters would be amicably resolved. A 50% waiver in penalty would be given if the defaulters agree to clear the dues and the case is disposed of in the Lok Adalat. The opposing corporators said that the proposal has been approved at the standing committee meeting in a wrongful manner. The penalty waiver is likely to cause a loss of around Rs150crore to the civic body, they said. “New revenue sources should be found, but such waivers are wrong,” said Deepali Dhumal, leader of the opposition in the PMC. “Why only 500 cases have been selected? Does the civic administration want to favour some private individuals or firms?” said Aba Bagul, Congress leader in the PMC. “The civic administration is going to face heavy losses due to tax waiver,” said Prithviraj Sutar, leader of the Shiv Sena in the PMC. “The Supreme Court has given directives that the long pending cases should be resolved via Lok Adalat. If they are resolved under this system, it will have a legal binding,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/section-of-corporators-opposes-penalty-relief-for-property-tax-dues/articleshow/86437737.cms||---

This year, the transport commissioner’s office had made it mandatory for applicants to submit medical fitness certificates online. During verification of documents by transport department officials, especially motor vehicle inspectors and assistant motor vehicle inspectors, it was found that many applicants had submitted fake medical certificate. Following this, the department has decided to empanel MBBS doctors only who will be authorized to issue medical certificates. Deputy RTO Khanderao Deshmukh, who is currently holding the charge of Nagpur city office, said, “The transport department has already approached the Indian Medical Association for the purpose. But we are yet to get any response from local doctors.” As per the decision, the doctors willing to get empanelled will have to visit the RTO offices and have their medical qualifications verified. Following this, they will be given a login ID to upload the medical certificates on RTO website. A few general practitioners said that uploading certificates is very time-consuming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rto-yet-to-find-mbbs-doctors-to-issue-med-cert/articleshow/86435718.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The two had jumped off the road to make way for a car coming from the opposite direction when they accidentally touched live wires sticking out of a roadside decorative street light. The duo was rushed to a hospital where they were declared dead. Sreya Banik (12) and Anushka Nandi (13) were returning home around 4pm after attending tuition when the incident happened. The moment they touched the pole, they fell down unconscious. “As soon as I learnt about the incident, an ambulance was arranged. But unfortunately, the girls could not be saved,” said South Dum Dum Municipality ward coordinator Surajit Roychowdhury. Investigation into the incident revealed that the junction box of the municipal street light was open and live wires were sticking out without even insulated tapes covering them. A CESC team later covered the junction box with tape. Tea stall owner Samir Adak, who knew the kids, said they were wading through the waterlogged street when they stepped aside on seeing a car coming from the opposite direction. “When a vehicle passes, it generates a wave that can drench the dress of a passer-by. I guess that is why the girls tried to jump out of the way. Unfortunately, they touched the pole that was live and got electrocuted,” he recounted. Locals said that both the kids were from financially stressed families but they were very serious about studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/live-wire-kills-2-kids-on-waterlogged-road/articleshow/86437741.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

In a letter written to the president of the cantonment board, the residents have appealed to the authorities not to auction the bank branch, which caters to residents of Landour and those living in nearby Tehri district. “The bank branch has been here since 1977,” Devendra Singh Kunwar, manager of the SBI branch. said. TOI spoke to CEO of Landour cantonment, Abhishek Rathore, who said an alternative site was being provided for the bank in the cantonment office. “Once the lease expires, an auction has to be done. But we will provide adequate space for the bank in our office,” Rathore said. Also, the premises would fetch much higher rent, he said. Upset over the move, the residents accused the authorities of focusing only on generating revenue. “The bank branch has been there for 40 years. Landour residents and nearby villagers benefit hugely from it. Building a restaurant or shop in its place will only put the residents to inconvenience,” Pramod Kapoor, a resident, rued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/locals-ruskin-bond-oppose-auction-of-local-bank-branch/articleshow/86435754.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Opposition dubs dharna as people’s movement to take on BJP, TRS||HYDERABAD: Communist Party of India (Marxist) national general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday said “desh bhakti” in the present day demands that the patriots take it up as their responsibility to save the country, its constitution and democracy from the misrule of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the centre. “Modi is demolishing all the four pillars of democracy and it is the duty of every patriot to save the constitution, democratic rights of the citizens and the country by joining the “mass movement” launched by the 20-opposition parties at the national level with the objective of saving the country by bringing down the Modi-government,” Yechury said. Addressing a maha dharna of opposition parties organised against the anti-people and anti-farmer policies of BJP and TRS governments at Indira Park in Hyderabad, Yechury likened the launch of 20 opposition parties agitational programmes against the Modi-government at the national level as the second round of “people’s movement” after the Indian independence struggle to save the country. “The Modi-government is targeting the opposition leaders by misusing central investigating agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against them. The BJP is trying to impress upon the people that ultimately BJP will come to power even if they give their electoral mandate to other parties. The saffron party is either intimidating the opposition leaders to join its ranks or is buying them out,” he said. He underlined the importance of a mass movement on the lines of freedom struggle to save the country and said that patriotism demands all those who love their country to come together to save its Constitution and democracy. Make Bharat Bandh on September 27 a grand success to send a clear message to the central government that people, farmers and other sections of people are rejecting this anti-farmer and anti-people Modi government, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/oppn-dubs-dharna-as-peoples-movement-to-take-on-bjp-trs/articleshow/86440040.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Nagpur||All parties claim advantage in three-member ward system||Nagpur: After state cabinet on Wednesday decided to revise existing one-member ward system to three-member for upcoming elections to municipal corporations, all major political parties claimed advantage in the new system. The decision has come 29 days after the state election commission (SEC) directed all municipal corporations to start the process of delimitation of wards as per single-member system. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had started the process.The NMC House has a strength of 151 members. Therefore, there will be 49 wards with three members each. As per cabinet’s decision, one ward can be of four members or two wards can be of two members each. Like in 2002, there is high possibility of having one ward with four members. Thus, the NMC is likely to have 50 wards. In NMC, the three-member system was earlier in place in 2002. At that time, there were 136 corporators — 44 wards had three members and one had four members.Guardian minister Nitin Raut had reportedly suggested two-member ward system in the cabinet meeting.West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, also president of City Congress Committee. told TOI that the party will come to power in NMC in three-member ward system. “People had voted for Congress in 2002. BJP has miserably failed to provide basic amenities in the last 15 years. BJP has no control over even the NMC administration,” he said.BJP city president and MLC Pravin Datke is confident that party will retain power in NMC due to “its good work and overall development of the city done by Union minister Nitin Gadkari and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis”. “We have nothing to think or worry about single or multi-member ward system. MVA government is afraid and revising ward system to confuse people,” he said.BSP corporator Jitendra Godeshwar said that BSP will win maximum seats in three-member ward system. “People from minority class, SC, ST and OBC support only BSP. BJP and Congress have failed to serve people,” he said.---------------------------Ward Systems2002 | 45 wards with three corporators in 44 wards and four corporators in one ward, for a total of 136 elected representatives. 5 coop corporators.

India are preparing for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 to be played at home early next year. The team assembled more than a month ago in Ranchi and has been training under coach Thomas Dennerby. Now, they will get a chance to put into action what they have learnt in training. According to sources, India will take on hosts United Arab Emirates (UAE) on October 2 before facing Tunisia in Dubai two days later. The team will then travel to Manama where they will play Bahrain (October 10) and Chinese Taipei (October13). “In times of Covid-19, it’s not easy to arrange friendlies,” said a senior AIFF official. “We have four international matches next month, and once we are done with these games, there are plans to play two top-tier clubs in Sweden. Coach Dennerby is in touch with his contacts for confirmations.” Dennerby coached Sweden to a third-place finish at the World Cup in 2011 and a quarterfinal spot in the 2012 London Olympics. He also coached Nigeria at the 2019 Women’s World Cup and has now taken up the responsibility of taking India to the knockout stage of the Asian Cup 2022. For India to have any chance, Dennerby feels they must play a minimum of 10 international matches. “Even if we prepare the team now with good endurance training and hard work, you need to put all this part of training into games,” said Dennerby. “We are working hard on that. We need to play not less than 10 games before the tournament starts. We need to play different types of opponents with different styles. “We need to play some teams that are maybe a little bit weaker to work with attacking ideas and some games against equal teams. We also need to try and find opponents who are a little bit better, who will help us to speed up the pace of the game, decision making, passing and receiving, all that you need to do when you play the best ones.” India will host the AFC Women's Asian Cup for the second time, after the 1979 edition. The tournament will be played in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune from January 20 to February 6, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-women-to-play-four-friendlies-next-month/articleshow/86466687.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Dual infections plague many already down with dengue||HYDERABAD: In several patients down with dengue and admitted to hospitals, doctors have found dual infections. While currently most private hospitals are reporting up to 50 cases of dengue in a week, the numbers in government-run centres are even higher. The state-run Niloufer Hospital has nearly 250 cases currently, while private and corporate hospitals have more than 50% of ICU patients suffering from dengue. “We are seeing many cases of dengue and post Covid-19 multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Also, dengue with rickettsial is being seen. These patients are requiring admissions due to complications arising from dual infections,” said Dr Satish Ghanta, neonatologist & paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital. MIS-C, which is a relatively new disease being seen in children, is similar to the rare Kawasaki disease. It can be fatal as it impacts multiple organs. Children from 0-15 years who have recovered from Covid or have come in contact with an infected elder are vulnerable to develop post-Covid MIS-C. Rickettsial on the other hand is spotted fever which occurs due to ticks, mites, lice and fleas, which usually increase during monsoon. While these cases are difficult to treat, the fact that dengue can easily become critical among children makes things worse. “Dengue can got from bad to worse within a matter of a few hours. We are seeing a lot of critical cases and even slight neglect can be dangerous, especially for children. We must remember that dengue claims more children than even Covid in India. Dengue is increasing and so are the complications arsing from it,” said Dr Sivaranjani Santosh, chief consultant paediatrician, Magna Centres.

---||Vadodara||Fortnight-long political drama at Baroda Dairy ends||Vadodara: The fortnight long political drama started by a BJP MLA over affairs of Baroda Dairy ended on Wednesday with the intervention of state BJP president C R Paatil. The truce was arrived at with an official announcement that Baroda Dairy will pay Rs 27 crore to milk producers as price difference in two instalments by March next year. Paatil had called Baroda Dairy’s chairman Dinesh Patel along with other board members for a meeting at Gandhinagar with the BJP MLAs who had threatened agitation alleging that milk producers were not being paid proper price difference by the dairy. Savli MLA Ketan Inamdar who led the group had even threatened to intensify his agitation from Thursday. Much to the embarrassment of the Vadodara district unit of BJP, three other BJP MLAs including Madhu Shrivastava from Waghodiya, Shaile0sh Mehta from Dabhoi and Akshay Patel from Karjan had extended support to Inamdar. Baroda Dairy’s board is also managed by BJP leaders. After Wednesday’s meeting at Gandhinagar, Inamdar told media persons that the dairy has agreed to pay Rs 27 crore as price difference to milk producers in two instalments. “The price difference of Rs 18 crore will be paid before Dussehra while another Rs 9 crore will be paid in the month of March,” he told media persons. On the face of it, the BJP MLAs are demanding proper milk rates for farmers, but political circles suggest that the MLAs are applying pressure tactics ahead of the state assembly elections. Two board members in Baroda Dairy are emerging as possible candidates in Savli and Karjan assembly constituencies. At the same time, some MLAs are wary about ‘no repeat theory’ being adopted during the forthcoming elections. It is worth mentioning here that at the end of the financial year all milk unions have to pay price difference to milk producers, who are its registered members. As an outcome of the political tussle, Baroda Dairy will now carry out an exercise to calculate the half yearly price difference which it will pay to farmers before the end of financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fortnight-long-political-drama-at-baroda-dairy-ends/articleshow/86434182.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused duo was caught while allegedly accepting the bribe of Rs 30,000 in a toilet at their office in Athwalines on Tuesday. The Anti-corruption bureau (ACB) sleuths nabbed the accused Sagar Bhesaniya, talati of Majura area, and his aid Hiren Patel on Tuesday for allegedly accepting bribe of Rs 30,000 to complete the process to declare a woman the legal heir of her parent’s property and issue original legal heir certificate. Bhesaniya accepted the bribe in the toilet at his office so that no one could see him accepting the money. Patel acted as tout for Bhesaniya and he used to demand bribes on behalf of the accused talati. The accused’s office is located in the vicinity of district collector office and district court. The complainant, a lawyer, had approached Bhesaniya to prepare government records for his wife to declare her legal heir of her father’s property. Bhesaniya kept the complainant waiting for a few weeks. Ultimately, he demanded a bribe of Rs 30,000. Unwilling to pay the bribe, the lawyer lodged a complaint in ACB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/talati-aid-remanded-to-two-day-police-custody/articleshow/86434885.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Hearing impaired fall further behind without vocab in technology||Pune: Two months ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the need to have standardised sign language in the country and the need to introduce it as a subject in schools. Earlier in the year, the third edition of the Indian Sign Language dictionary with 10,000 terms, including names of banks, political parties and fast food options, was released. Despite progress, the work for better education, skill development and employability of persons with hearing and speech impairment leave much to be desired, say NGOs and schools working for their welfare. September 23 is Sign Language Day. The lack of trained teachers or vocabulary for technical subjects limits their education and opportunities for building a career in a field of their choice, the experts said. Rajani Banerjee, a special educator, said parents need to be sensitised about their child's condition and adopt sign language as a means of communicating with them. “Like charity, education also begins at home. Instead of pushing the child into speech therapy, there should be awareness among parents to learn and teach their child sign language just like they do with their mother tongue,” she added. Without a standardized sign language it takes much longer for a student to learn through online classes. “It takes a hearing impaired student a month to cover what a regular student can learn in one day because of this gap in vocabulary,” she added. Yogesh Desai, CEO of Helen Keller Institute, said there are hardly any people with hearing and speech impairment qualified enough to teach students at a higher level. Regular teachers do not know sign language and hence cannot teach the subjects such as engineering or fashion technology., he said. “This leads to students not opting for such subjects. There is no dedicated university offering all courses. It will be a great step to include sign language in all schools. This will ensure everyone can communicate in it leading to a much inclusive society. It will open many avenues of employment for hearing and speech impaired children when they grow up,” Desai added. Arvind Meshramkar, director of Maharashtra Fellowship for the Deaf, an institute that provides education, vocational training to hearing impaired persons, highlights the conundrum. Those who can hear don’t want to pursue a career as a special educator for hearing impaired students as there is no financial incentive and fewer job opportunities. The hearing-impaired persons do not have the facilities to pursue higher education and qualify to be special educators, he added. “Of the 10, we have only one hearing-impaired teacher who is an ex-student. We helped him get the training after he showed interest. A few job opportunities for such teachers exist in private institutions. These students are given pre-primary and primary education, and basic mathematics and science. There is no scope as of now to teach them technical subjects at higher standards due to lack of vocabulary. So, they have to opt for subjects available to them such as arts and crafts, cookery,” he added. M D Singh, director of the State Council of Educational Research and Training that designs the curricula for class students from Stds I to XII in the state said that a team of 16 teachers has already been constituted to come up with e-learning material in sign language. Ekansh Trust offers free training to those willing to learn sign language . Its founder Anita Iyer said despite several efforts, they have not had people coming forward to learn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hearing-impaired-fall-further-behind-without-vocab-in-technology/articleshow/86437809.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Chandigarh||Farmers hold ‘mahapanchayat’ at Kurukshetra, discuss ways to ensure Bharat Bandh call a complete success||JK Singh | TNN Ismailabad, Kurukshetra: Scores of farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) held a ‘Kisan Bachao Desh Bachao’ mahapanchayat at the grain market in Kurukshetra district’s Ismailabad town on Wednesday. Hundreds of farmers from the region assembled at the market, where top leaders and social activists urged them to ensure that the Bharat Bandh call of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha is a complete success. Key personalities who attended the event included SKM leader Darshan Pal, BKU (Charuni) national president Gurnam Charuni, BKU Krantikar Punjab president Surjit Singh Phul, Punjabi language activist Lakha Sidhana, and Haryana activists Ravi Azad. Gurnam Singh Charuni, in his address to farmers, said, “In Haryana, over 200 cases have been registered against 40,000 persons during this andolan, and summons are being sent to several other farmers. I have also received a summon. Nobody should respond to the summons and go to the police or any court. We want the government to take back its summons. We are protesting peacefully for our rights and the government should not provoke us.” About opening the Delhi border, Charuni said, “We have not closed the border, the government has closed it. The government should come forward and open the borders now, then we will uproot our tents and install them in front of the Parliament. There is no question of Supreme Court orders as we have not closed the borders. We will continue our protest until we win.” Speaking in the Punjabi, SKM leader Darshan Pal said, “A call has been given by the SKM for a complete Bharat Bandh. All offices, markets, shops, national and state highways, and rail tracks will be closed from 6 am to 4 pm on September 27. All anti-BJP parties and other organisations are invited to support the bandh.” Pal also raised the slogan “27 tarik nu ki houga (what will happen on date 27)”, and farmers responded by shouting, “mukamal Bharat bandh houga (complete India will be closed)”. “On September 26, Kisan Andolan will complete 10 months. It will also mark one year on October 1 when we had given a call to shut all toll plazas to boycott the BJP leaders and corporate houses. I congratulate the people of Punjab and Haryana that today a car does not have to pay any toll tax in these states,” said Darshan Pal. Pal said that under the leadership of SKM, farmers will continue to sit on Delhi borders until the agri-marketing laws are repealed. Speaking at the event, activist Lakha Sidhana raised the slogan of Haryana Punjab ekta zindabad and said, “To defame this Andolan, the (BJP) governments in Haryana and Centre have made every possible effort and tried to create a rift between Haryana and Punjab. Today, this agitation is more fierce in Haryana than Punjab, despite the fact that it started in Punjab. It is a golden opportunity to bring a change as people have now awakened after a long sleep.” “||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-hold-mahapanchayat-at-kurukshetra-discuss-ways-to-ensure-bharat-bandh-call-a-complete-success/articleshow/86440103.cms||JK Singh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: East of EM Bypass, rain water reclaims former wetlands||KOLKATA: As darkness descended on Wednesday afternoon and it began to rain again, residents living between Ruby and Panchasayar cringed in horror. With the entire belt inundated since Monday’s showers, the prospect of more rain meant added miseries. Nayabad has been under knee-deep water since Monday with no signs of receding even after two relatively dry days. TCS associate consultant Sovanlal Das has not been able to step out to work since the weekend. On Tuesday, he could not even work from home as there was no power or internet connection at home. TimesViewConstruction on what once used to be wetlands and paddy fields may be responsible for the regular flooding that we see plaguing vast swathes east of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. We have just choked off the egress zones that used to take away the excess rainwater by simply building and living in this zone. Some measures, like having more pumps to flush out the flood water, may help temporarily. But long-term solutions may be difficult.“The stagnant water is beginning to stink. Dirty water from sewage lines have got mixed with the standing water. Till now, our water tank is a couple of centimeters above the water level. If it rains again, the tank will get inundated. Thereafter, even getting water to drink and other uses will become a challenge,” said Das. In nearby Panchasayar, among those stranded at home is KMC official Paritosh Bose. “Being a civic employee in a department that provides essential services, it is painful and embarrassing to be unable to step out for three days,” Bose said. One of the worst-affected areas is the Mukundapur Main Road that leads from the Rabindranath Tagore Institute of Cardiac Sciences to EM Bypass. “The sharp spell on Wednesday has added to our misery. I don’t know when the situation will improve,” said Narayana Health regional director (east) R Venkatesh. Town planners say the situation is a fallout of rampant filling up of ponds and wetlands in the belt, unplanned development and inadequate focus on infrastructure. According to a KMC sewerage department official, leave aside underground drainage, large parts of these areas even lack surface drains. “Water flows down and finds alow land and gets stagnant. There is no drainage network along this belt,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/east-of-em-bypass-rain-water-reclaims-former-wetlands/articleshow/86437780.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Hyderabad||Twin cities, two civic bodies, but a chasm in civic infra||Hyderabad: The tale of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and Greater Hyderabad municipal corporation (GHMC) is a classic case of twin civic bodies offering unequal infrastructure and services to citizens. While citizens in GHMC enjoy wide roads and better civic infrastructure, those in the SCB face a bumpy ride on both fronts. Though an elected body, the SCB is not as autonomous as the GHMC and this has put a constraint on construction. Even citizen services come a cropper in the SCB. The demand for merging the SCB with GHMC (formerly MCH) has been there for years and is growing by the day. It first cropped up three decades ago as new colonies emerged on the city periphery. Today, SCB’s location is peculiar as it is now almost surrounded by GHMC areas. The merger demand got a fresh lease of life a few years ago after Army authorities closed most roads connecting GHMC areas abutting the SCB. The constant friction between the Army authorities and civilians in the area over roads despite the Centre’s intervention has further strengthened the demand. Most SCB roads pass through Army areas and streetlights are switched off citing security causing, putting motorists in trouble. While roads in civilian areas lie in neglect, those in Army areas are well-paved and neatly maintained with reflectors. Drinking water supply is also a major problem and sanitation is often largely compromised. As has always been the case, The Times of India stands with the citizens. TOI has taken up the cause of people living in the SCB and parts of GHMC abutting the cantonment in the larger interests of the twin cities. This international metropolis can march further only if all areas are equally developed. The best way forward is to merge the SCB with GHMC for scientific urban planning, equitable development, seamless road connectivity and modern drinking water/drainage infrastructure. The merger demand is justified not only from the geographical and civic point of view, but also from historical perspective. Secunderabad cantonment is not a small area. It is spread over 40.17 sq km with a population upward of three lakh — too big for the SCB starved of funds. It is surrounded by GHMC circles such as Kukatpally, Kapra, Malkajgiri and Alwal. Moreover, there are large chunks of private properties under the SCB area. According to SCB’s own admission, “Secunderabad cantonment is unique in the country with the maximum acreage of private land situated within the limits of cantonment.” It also has 279 private housing colonies or layouts, 13 villages and 16 notified civil or bazaar areas. With so much private area in its jurisdiction it is imperative that the SCB be merged with GHMC for better civic infrastructure, services and facilities, claim SCB residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/twin-cities-two-civic-bodies-but-a-chasm-in-civic-infra/articleshow/86438036.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Cantonment was primarily setup for British army needs||Hyderabad: The history of Secunderabad cantonment is intertwined with civilians, though it was primarily set up for the army needs of the British. Hence, handing back the SCB to GHMC is justified. Secunderabad was formed in 1798 after Nizam Ali Khan, Nizam II, entered a subsidiary alliance with the British East India Company. His successor Sikandar Jah, Nizam III, completed the formalities and a new town of Secunderabad named after the Nizam was formed in 1806. A separate cantonment board for Secunderabad was created in 1924 by the British through the Cantonments Act, 1924, giving municipal powers to the SCB. The Act was last amended in 2006 to provide “greater democratisation and improve financial base of cantonments to make provision for developmental activities”. But 15 years later, the objective is yet to be achieved and the SCB continues to suffer for want of funds. This emphasises the need for the SCB’s merger with GHMC for a well-balanced and well-planned Hyderabad, with equal civic opportunities and services in the historic city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantonment-was-primarily-setup-for-british-army-needs/articleshow/86438071.cms||Syed Akbar

He was appointed in September 2015. Additional public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde sought an adjournment for a week, as she said that advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni would appear in the matter. To this, Begum’s counsel, Mihir Desai, said that in July 2018, the AG had made an oral statement that till the matter is heard, the process to appoint a new SPP would not progress. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/khwaja-yunus-case-no-new-spp-till-oct-14-in-mumbai/articleshow/86441486.cms||---
---||Jaipur||UDH introduces strict norms for contractors to ensure road quality||Jaipur: Contractors across the state will now have to deposit the work performance guarantee amount if the tender’s rate is quoted less than the basic schedule rate (BSR). After Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), the urban development and housing (UDH) has implemented the formula in all the urban local bodies to maintain the quality of civil works after selecting the contracted firm. A UDH official said, “In all the urban local bodies, strict rules are laid to maintain the quality of civil works. The selected firm will deposit the work performance guarantee amount if the tender’s rate is quoted less than the basic schedule rate.” It has been observed many a times tender rates are quoted less than 40 per cent less than the fixed basic schedule rate. This always raises a possibility in quality compromise. The new system will tighten the noose on contractors in all the local bodies . “The civic body would forfeit the guarantee amount, if the work done by the firm is found to be substandard.” In 2016, after demonetisation, contractors participating in tender process requested at civic bodies not to take work performance guarantee due to weak financial conditions. Following this, the UDH removed the clause to deposit the guarantee amount. However, now the guarantee amount will have to be deposited within 14 days after the letter of acceptance is issued from local body to start work. The civic body will forfeit the earnest money if the awardee fails to deposit the money within the stipulated time. Sources claimed the step was taken as officials have failed to carry out proper monitoring. In the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) engineers in the past were in the line of fire for constructing poor roads. The lokayukta had also issued a show-cause notice to the JDA seeking an explanation on damaged roads at JLN Marg and Tonk Road within the defect liability period. It was witnessed on both these roads that bituminous concrete was uprooted from the surface within three years, before the defect liability period could be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-introduces-strict-norms-for-contractors-to-ensure-road-quality/articleshow/86440078.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court slams Centre as Covid-19 drugs remain off essential list||HYDERABAD: Pulling up the Centre for inordinate delay in including drugs meant to treat Covid-19 in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), Telangana high court on Wednesday gave it time till October 31. The HC also hauled up the state government for not submitting details of paediatric doctors and sought the report by September 30. “Two waves of Covid-19 are over. Thousands have lost their lives. How many more deaths do you want for including these life-saving medicines in the essential list?” a furious HC bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar asked assistant solicitor general (ASG) Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao who was briefing the HC on the efforts of the Union health ministry. The NLEM has not been updated after 2015. “Some medicines were added and some deleted from the list. We will soon come out with a gazette notification. The under secretary attached to the drugs wing of the health ministry has informed me that there will be a virtual meeting soon to finalise NLEM 2021,” the ASG told the bench hearing two PILs filed by advocates Sameer Ahmed and P Thirumala Rao. While giving the Centre time till October 31, the bench cautioned that there was every likelihood of third wave and hence it was essential that drug manufacturers were given enough time to produce sufficient quantities of required medicines to avoid sparking panic due to shortages. The ASG also informed the court that the Centre has decided to add a separate annexure to NLEM list to explain ways to deal with Covid-19. “The recommendations made by the national standing committee on medicines have been furnished to the Union health ministry and it is under active consideration,” he said. The bench also expressed unhappiness with the affidavit filed by state public health director Dr G Srinivas Rao regarding paediatric infrastructure to deal with Covid-19 among children who are likely to be vulnerable in the third wave. The HC said the affidavit did not have any details of paediatric doctors available with the state, sanctioned posts and vacancies across all hospitals and ordered him to submit them by September 30. The case was posted to October 4 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slams-centre-as-covid-19-drugs-remain-off-essential-list/articleshow/86437656.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Parents in Hyderabad concerned as schools insist on physical classes||HYDERABAD: Amid an increase in dengue and mystery fever cases in the state, school managements’ decision to make physical classes mandatory, has left parents worried. Many who TOI spoke to said that the schools their children go to have either decided or are mulling discontinuing online classes soon. “As parents we know that class 9 and 10 are important, but nothing is more important than a child’s health. The school management should not have stopped online classes,” said the parent of a class 9 student enrolled in a private school in Tarnaka. The parent added: “We don’t mind paying the full fee even for online classes, but schools should not insist on physical attendance as the pandemic is not over yet.” Many parents said they have been receiving messages from schools stating plans to start classroom sessions and offline exams. Parents urged the state to ensure schools continue with the arrangement followed during the last academic year and make it mandatory for them to provide online or digital classes instead of insisting on physical attendance. School managements confirmed that except for classes 9 and 10, not many from primary and upper primary sections have been attending physical classes. “Up to class 5, attendance is hardly 15% in budget schools. In class 9 and class 10, it should be around 70%,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association adding that many parents are still hesitant to send their children to school. When contacted, an official from the school education department, maintained that cases of Covid-19 in the state are low and urged students to return to their schools. “The overall development of children is not happening through online classes. While there is a possibility, we must use it and encourage children to attend physical classes,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-concerned-as-schools-insist-on-physical-classes/articleshow/86437926.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Lucknow||Giri’s suicide note fake: Niranjani Akhara||Prayagraj: Rejecting the suicide note of Mahant Narendra Giri after terming it as fake, Acharya Maha Mandaleshwar (supreme head) of Shri Panchayti Akhara Niranjani, Acharya Kailashanand Giri on Wednesday said that “it is not a suicide note but a conspiracy note”. Talking to TOI at Bagambari Gaddi Math, Kailashanand Giri dismissed the purported suicide note allegedly written by Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president and secretary of Niranjani Akhara Mahant Narendra Giri. “This is not a letter written by maharaj (Mahant Narendra Giri) as he never used to pen anything so elaborate... he only used to put his signature while dictating the content of the letter to someone else. I have closely read the letter many times and it contains some words that seem to have been written by someone else having a good command over the Hindi language. Also, a character — ‘/’ — is used with some words in the letter which Maharaj didn’t even know how and when to use”. “I have been very close to him during his lifetime and knew him well. This letter is fake and part of a larger conspiracy to cover his murder which has been committed over greed of land,” he claimed. Kailashanand Giri said, “Mahant Narendra Giri could never commit suicide as he was a roaring saint, who took a tough stand against fake godmen in the country and stood up to the repercussions. If he was under any pressure or needed money or there was any other issue, he would have shared it with me and with Ravindra Puri, the secretary of Niranjani akhara.” “I have full faith in our Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who would probe the matter with full transparency. Names of several big-shots would be exposed,” he said, adding, “Once the guilty are found, they should be punished in a way that sets an example for the future.” On being asked if Balbeer Giri would be declared as the successor of Narendra Giri, Kailashanand Giri said, “He is my disciple and the mahant of the Akhara. The Akhara would soon hold a meeting and decide the issue as to who would succeed Narendra Giri.” On Anand Giri’s role in the conspiracy, he said, “This is for the SIT and police to probe, look into the call details, etc., and come out with the truth. However, I question the facts why Maharaj ji (Narendra Giri) did not choose his own room to take the extreme step, why was the door of the room where the body was found forcefully opened, why no one videographed the entire process of breaking the door and brining the body down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/giris-suicide-note-fake-niranjani-akhara/articleshow/86440085.cms||---

---||Delhi||Teachers hopeful Delhi University will move in ‘positive direction’||NEW DELHI: Welcoming the long-due appointment of a new vice-chancellor, teachers and principals at Delhi University on Wednesday hoped that Yogesh Singh would work with all stakeholders for DU’s growth and development. As Singh is the VC of Delhi Technological University, a state university, his joining may take some time. The tenure of the officiating VC, PC Joshi, had ended in March, but he was given an extension. Joshi took over the office in October 2020 after former VC Yogesh Tyagi was suspended by the education ministry. Speaking to TOI, Singh said, “I will now make an appeal to Delhi government and the lieutenant governor to relieve me.” He is one of the first DU VCs with an engineering background. He is taking over as the VC when the university will be celebrating its centenary next year. Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, a member of DU Principals’ Association, said, “DUPA welcomes the new VC. He has got vast experience and one is sure that with his experience the university will get enriched and move in a positive direction.” Stating that Singh was well known as an administrator, Rajib Ray, president of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), said, “He is welcome to the University of Delhi and we hope that he has a successful term that is pro-employee and pro-students. Hopefully, the vast and complex nature of DU will be handled smoothly by him.” Mentioning that educational reforms were expected during Singh’s tenure, AK Bhagi of National Democratic Teachers’ Front, said, “NDTF welcomes the new VC. We hope that he will carry out the good work and continue with promotions and regularisations. We expect educational reforms that are both pro-students and pro-teachers. We look forward to a fruitful tenure that can benefit all stakeholders.” Rajesh Jha, former DU executive council member, said, “After much delay and speculation, the appointment of Yogesh Singh is expected to settle the turmoil and upheavals, as witnessed since December 4, 2019. We hope he will ensure the dignity of statutory bodies like the academic council and executive council. He should take steps for absorption of ad hoc and temporary teachers urgently.” “The new VC should expedite pending issues like appointments and ensure that the university becomes a place for debates and discussions,” said Tanvir Aeijaz, professor at Ramjas College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teachers-hopeful-du-will-move-in-positive-direction/articleshow/86437855.cms||---

Police arrested the duo fand registered a case of attempt to murder and assault against them on Tuesday morning. Frightened by the firearm, autorickshaw driver Sameer Sanjay Dhume (28) of Kudje village near Khadakwasla away towards the Uttamnagar police station, barely 500m from the petrol pump. TimesViewThe spurt in brazen crimes across the city reflects the law enforcers’ failure to instil the fear for law in criminals’ minds. Police should launch a drive against anti-social elements and prepare watertight chargesheets against them to ensure that every case reaches its logical end. While the police personnel should step up patrolling on thoroughfares to make themselves visible, the civic body must focus on extending the network of CCTV cameras to help the law enforcers keep tabs on criminals and their activities.Someone from the pump had by then made a call and a police team rushed to the site and arreste Sandeep Mohan Sawant (26) and Swaroop Sangpal Awate (19), both residents of Uttamnagar.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai's PM 2.5 levels 8 times higher than new WHO norms||MUMBAI: Mumbai has a long way to go before it achieves Wednesday’s revised World Health Organisation (WHO) standards for better ambient air quality. Track the pollution level in your cityThe revised WHO standard for particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is now eight times more stringent than the national guideline, indicating a daunting task ahead for policy makers and pollution monitors. A recent study found the PM 2.5 level may have acted as a catalyst in intensifying Covid infections in some wards. Mumbai’s average concentration of PM 2.5 in the air during the restricted movement months of March to May this year was 40.3 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), slightly higher than the national standard of 40 µg/m3. The earlier WHO standard recommended 10 µg/m3, which was revised to 5 µg/m3 on Wednesday. The national PM 2.5 level set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was already four times higher than the previous WHO standards. That apart, a recent analysis by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has revealed the share of PM 2.5 emissions from vehicles, mainly trucks and buses, was 30.5% in 2019-20 compared with 16% in 2016-17. Dust from vehicles and construction sites and smoke from vehicles and garbage burning have been large contributors of PM 2.5 in Mumbai's air. The Economic Survey report 2020-21 for Maharashtra noted Mumbai accounted for 10.3% of the state’s vehicle registrations. Pollution in Mumbai is measured in terms of average PM 2.5 concentration in the air. These particles can enter the lungs easily and are carcinogenic. This concentration of an air pollutant is given in micrograms (one-millionth of a gram) per cubic metre of air or µg/m3. It is also measured in terms of PM 10, which is less harmful than PM 2.5 though. Scientists say Mumbai is lucky to be surrounded by sea which helps in swift dispersal of pollutants. A former senior Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) official said even during the lockdown last year, the city registered PM2.5 levels close to the CPCB standard. “To achieve the new range suggested by WHO, CPCB needs to amend the rules and bring in stringent legal enforcements,” he said, pointing out dust suppression measures such as sprinklers and dust curtains at construction sites and for trucks were a necessity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pm-2-5-levels-8-times-higher-than-new-who-norms/articleshow/86441496.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Nagpur||CBSE puts blockchain tech to use for academic document verification||Nagpur: Blockchain technology, made popular due to the cryptocurrency mania sweeping the world, is now being put to use for academic records verification by CBSE. Board exam marksheets of both Std X and XII will now be stored using blockchain technology with records being maintained by five separate digital registrars in three cities across the country. This project, called CBSE Academic BlockChain Documents (ABCD), has been developed in technical collaboration with Centre of Excellence for Block Chain Technology of National Informatics Centre (NIC) under ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY). Antriksh Johri, CBSE’s director of information and technology, said, “Blockchain technology ensures that academic documents are recorded in a secure and tamper proof manner. These academic documents can be accessed online in a trusted and verifiable manner. It also substantially cuts down the time for verification and results in transparent, tamper proof and paperless usage of certificate.” Blockchain technology records data in a distributed ledger with ownership of all participating stakeholders. The data is recorded in the chain based on the consensus among the stakeholders and simultaneously replicated at all the locations in the distributed network of blockchain nodes. This eliminates the dependency on a third party for verification. Johri said, “Data is linked and stored with cryptographic security so that it is immutable and traceable. The linking of the blocks in the blockchain ensures that they cannot be tampered with and the data is trustable as it can be verified across the participating stakeholders.” Upon issuance of new certificates by CBSE, the digitally signed certificates will be sent to the blockchain-based system creating an additional secure link. This network is established with nodes at Bengaluru, Pune and Jaipur. Presently, the certificate chain is managed by NIC at its data centres. CBSE started working on this project in September last year and was awaiting the 2021 exam results to launch. “As of now, we have put digital marksheets from 2019-21 and will continue to load previous years’ documents as well,” said Johri. The central board’s IT team has had their hands full this calendar year, with the biggest project being to develop a portal for schools to upload Std X and XII marks online as physical exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. Johri said, “Within three days, we were able to develop the software and put it online for schools to use.” How to use the portalAll users can verify academic documents by visiting https://cbse.certchain.nic.in or CBSE main website https://cbse.gov.in Click on “verify” menu option on top menu bar available on home page Select the class from the pop up.

The vaccination figures of the district have been the best in the region since the vaccination drive started earlier this year. Earlier, it also had the highest number of active cases as well as the highest positivity and mortality rates. Now, however, the number of daily cases and active patients are falling rapidly in Kolhapur when compared to Satara, Solapur and Sangli districts. The authorities said the early headstart in the vaccination process has helped in reducing the number of cases. “We have observed that the areas where the vaccination turnout was the highest now have no or very few Covid cases. It shows that increasing vaccine coverage helps bring down the Covid cases significantly. Almost 70% of the population here has received at least the first dose of the Covid vaccine. This figure is among the highest in the state in terms of percentage of the population covered,” said Yogesh Sale, the Kolhapur ZP health officer. Vaccination and active cases in four districts of MaharashtraSatara district, meanwhile, has the highest number of active cases in the region (6,621), followed by Solapur (2,347) and Sangli (1,054). All these districts have had their vaccination numbers picking up in recent days. Recently, the Sangli administration had administered almost 1.5 lakh doses in a day. The officials said that the effect of the expansion of vaccination coverage will be observed in the coming days. The local administrations are making it mandatory for the owners of all commercial establishments to have their employees and workers vaccinated to keep shops and other establishments open for business. Solapur district has the lowest vaccine coverage in the region with 5.13 lakh citizens being fully vaccinated here. “A single dose of the vaccine gives partial immunity, while both doses ensure near-total immunity. Our efforts are to fully vaccinate most of the beneficiaries as soon as possible. At the same time, we are carrying out the same number of RT-PCR tests as we used to during the peak of the pandemic. Therefore, it can be concluded that the vaccination coverage has helped us bring down positivity rate,” said Sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-has-fewest-active-cases-in-south-maha/articleshow/86431556.cms||---

While the cyclonic circulation has now weakened into a low-pressure system, which triggered a deluge in Kolkata on Monday, and moved away towards Jharkhand, it continued to attract moisture that led to thunderstorms, said the Met officials. Showers will continue in Kolkata till the weekend when another cyclonic circulation that has developed over Bay of Bengal near Myanmar is set to strike the region. “When a big system like the cyclonic circulation that had hit the city on Monday passes away, it keeps pulling in moisture from the sea. This led to the formation of local clouds that led to rain in south and central Kolkata on Wednesday. But the showers were more intense in south Kolkata than north,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. Thunderstorms, however, also struck Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas and Hooghly. Kolkata received 17mm rain till 5.30pm. South and central Kolkata received frequent and intense spells through the day even as the northern parts of the city received drizzles. Meanwhile, another cyclonic circulation has formed near the Myanmar coast and adjoining Gulf of Martaban. It will reach northeast and east-central Bay of Bengal as low-pressure by Friday evening. “It will head either towards the Odisha coast or the Bengal-Bangladesh coast over the subsequent 48 hours,” Das added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/17mm-rain-in-kol-met-spies-more-showers-till-weekend/articleshow/86437861.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Thirty-five devotees to Kedarnath, too, were turned away after they were found carrying fake e-permits. An e-pass is generated by the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board after a pilgrim registers on the smart city portal. It remains valid for two days and is part of the Covid protocol that the high court mandated while lifting its stay on the yatra. While 684 Kedarnath-bound pilgrims were returned by Rudraprayag police for travelling without e-passes, 35 pilgrims were caught at Sonprayag police barrier with fake e-passes, Rudraprayag superintendent of police (SP) Ayush Agarwal said. A police officer said it is possible that pilgrims were not aware of the permits being fake. “In majority of the cases, people said they got the passes printed from cyber cafes,” the officer said. At Badrinath shrine, 20 pilgrims travelling without e-passes were turned away, the state police headquarters said. No such case has been reported from the Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines in Uttarkashi district. The police department said strict checks are being imposed along the yatra route to make sure Covid protocol is followed. Those travelling to Kedarnath have to undergo scrutiny at five different checkpoints. Director general of police (DGP) Uttarakhand, Ashok Kumar, said, “We have been spreading awareness on the requirements for the yatra. Pilgrims coming to Uttarakhand for Char Dham yatra have also been told to register on the Dehradun Smart City portal and then apply for an e-pass from the Devasthanam Board.” Until now, 69,619 e-passes have been issued for the pilgrimage, while 9,135 pilgrims have visited the Himalayan shrines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-turns-away-700-char-dham-pilgrims-sans-e-pass-35-with-fake-permits/articleshow/86433702.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Kolkata||Golf Garden seniors under ‘house arrest’ with no power, potable water||Kolkata: Several pockets of Golf Green, Golf Club Road, Haripada Dutta Lane and Prince Ghulam Mohammad Shah Road have been flooded for over three days now, putting the elderly under “house arrest” and at the mercy of sun, which doesn’t seem to shine bright enough to help the water level recede. The rows of apartment houses are mostly inhabited by senior citizens, who can’t even get food delivered to their homes in the absence of support staff. Daily helps are not being able to report to work, risking wading the swamped streets, thus forcing some of these retired citizens to live on a measly diet. Those office-bound are wearing shorts, carrying their trousers in their bags along with an extra pair of shoes. According to Golf Green residents, the problem has compounded over the last 10 years and even a drizzle strikes fear of more misery. Carbolic acid to keep snakes at bay is a must in every household. The area falls under KMC’s ward 94 where a pumping station was inaugurated just before the May assembly elections. “At that time, we were promised that waterlogging would now be a thing of the past. But our plight has worsened this monsoon,” said Kalyan Roy, retired KMDA director and resident of PGMS Road for the last 21 years. One of his neighbours needed to visit EEDF Hospital, but the ambulance couldn’t reach his doorstep. Lift shafts, pump houses and caretaker quarters of several apartment houses are submerged. “I am buying water because the pump can’t function,” said 70-year-old Golf Garden resident Tarun Sen. Most of the elderly are stuck at home over the past three days, unable to use the lifts, because of prolonged power cuts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/golf-garden-seniors-under-house-arrest-with-no-power-potable-water/articleshow/86437820.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Funds for panchayati raj & urban local bodies chopped||JAIPUR: Development works undertaken by panchayat raj institutions (PRIs) and urban local bodies (ULBs) are likely to be pegged back with the Sixth State Finance Commission (SFC) recommending less funds compared to 2015-20 period. In the interim report, the finance panel has proposed 6.75% of the state government’s net own tax for the PRIs and ULBs against 7.18% during the 2015-20. The commission has cited the finance department’s concerns over decline in tax revenues due to the Covid pandemic and rising revenue expenditure on account of social security pensions, salaries and wages, increasing interest payout and higher subsidies and grant-in-aid. The interim report was for 2020-21 and 2021-22 as the commission could not consultations with with ministers of departments like rural development, panchayati raj, local self-government and finance. The government cannot release funds without the recommendations of the commission. As per the provisional data of 2020-21 and budget estimates for 2021-22, government’s own tax revenue is pegged at Rs 57611. 42 crore and Rs 87703.36 crore respectively. At 6.75% devolution of the taxes, PRIs and ULBs will get Rs 3,888.77 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 5919.98 crore in 2021-22. The funds are generally used for drinking water, creation of water reservoirs, providing services through e-governance, Indira Rasoi Yojana, LED lights, youth development, Pradhanmantri Awas Yojana-Gramin, carrying out initiatives for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, school sanitation, and plantation among others. This year, funds will also be used on measures for containing the spread of Covid. The finance department had communicated to the commission explaining the stress in tax revenue mobilization and fixing the rate of devolution of taxes to the PRIs and ULBs. The growth of revenue receipts of the state fell from 16.77% in 2017-19 to 1.68% in 2019-20. Due to the change in sharing pattern from 2015-16 of Centrally Sponsored Schemes from 100% or 75:25 to 60:40 or 50:50 between the centre and the state, there is a reduction in receipts to the state The interest burden of discoms debt liability costs the state Rs 5,000 crore annually. Because of the Covid, additional expenditure on medical and relief to th affected families has caused extra financial burden on the state finances. Due to the pandemic, the commission could not hold discussions with ministers of departments like Rural development, panchayati raj, local self-government and finance and also undertake assessment at various layers of these departments to present the five year plan. Since funds of the state government can be released after the recommendations of the commission, an interim report was sought by the government for two years (2020-21 and 2021-22).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/funds-for-panchayati-raj-urban-local-bodies-chopped/articleshow/86440105.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Superintendent of police (SP) of Moradabad, Amit Kumar Anand, said, “Cow carcass was found dumped in Mandi Samiti area under Majhola police station. An FIR has been registered against unknown persons under UP’s Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act and an investigation in the case has been ordered. Police teams have been deputed in the area to gather CCTV footage in order to ascertain the identities of the accused. Those responsible shall be apprehended at the earliest.” He added, “An inquiry has also been initiated against the policemen posted in the area.” Members of several saffron outfits and BJP workers gathered at the spot and raised slogans against police. A similar incident was reported from the same area around 15 days ago, Bajrang Dal activist Navneet Sharma claimed. “After we were informed that the cow carcasses were found dumped in the open here, we had gathered in the area to protest against it as a similar incident was reported a few days back also. Then, police had registered a case and assured that the culprits would be arrested but nothing has been done in the case yet. This is the reason that the incident has been repeated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fir-after-cow-carcass-found-dumped-in-moradabad-village/articleshow/86435891.cms||Maria Khan
---||Jaipur||Legal experts say amended bill will encourage child marriages in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by the state assembly has opened a can of worms with legal experts and activists claiming that it will promote child marriages. The state government has claimed that the amendment was brought to safeguard legal rights of children born out of child marriages. Legal experts, however, said the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, already has Section 5 for custody and maintenance of children born of child marriages and Section 6 for legitimacy of children born of child marriages, thereby rendering the state’s justification inappropriate. Law experts further added that annulment of child marriages would become more cumbersome as registration certificates would become a requirement to first prove that minors were married. Kriti Bharti, rehabilitation psychologist and managing trustee of Saarthi Trust who has been instrumental in getting 43 child marriages annulled said, “I have been working in this field for over 15 years and this proposal for amendment is bizarre. First, the Supreme Court’s 2006 judgment is for preventing child marriages and nowhere does it say that the same should be registered. Moreover, as compared to Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009, this amendment makes it clear that marriages of girls below 18 years can be registered, which is against the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act. I get child marriages annulled, but now the process will become more complicated if a certificate is required to prove that the minor or minors were married.” Bharti further said according to the law if a child marriage needs to be annulled, then the girl has time till she turns 20 years and the boy till he turns 23. “There are two situations — one in which the child marriage is not registered and second, the marriage is registered but do we expect that the parents who themselves got it solemnised to handover the document to the girl so she can get it annulled? It is unlikely and we would just force children to face further trauma. Plus it would create conflict amongst the departments as well,”she said. Once a child has been married, he/she would have to get the marriage annulled from the court. If the decree of nullity is not obtained by either of the marrying minors, the child marriage would remain as sacrosanct before the law as a marriage between two adults. There is a time limit also for getting the child marriage nullified. The decree of nullity can be obtained only up to two years after the married partners attain the age of majority. The government had clarified that registration of a minor’s marriage does not mean that it had become legal and it was for the officials to initiate action against violators. Ved Vishnoi, a high court lawyer who seemed to be perplexed about the proposed amendment added, “I am unable to understand the reasoning behind this action as the aim should be to prevent child marriage rather than facilitating annulment. If the parents/guardians willingly get the children married and then apply for registration of the same then technically FIR can be lodged against them under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act so why would they want to do that action?” Experts said if the government is giving the justification of SC’s judgment of 2006, then instead of interpreting it in this way, they should have asked court if child marriages should be registered. Also as per the SC’s judgment, the state should have taken the opinion of people before attempting to make the changes. The amendment is proposed as it is yet to be passed by the Governor of Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/legal-experts-say-amended-bill-will-encourage-child-marriages-in-state/articleshow/86440141.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

---||Dehradun||2 dozen seers murdered or missing in Haridwar in past two decades||Haridwar: The death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief Narendra Giri, who was found hanging in UP’s Prayagraj with a suicide note alleging blackmail by his former disciple, has once again put the spotlight on seers in Haridwar who were allegedly murdered or disappeared without a trace in the past two decades. According to the seer community in Haridwar, at least 24 seers have been allegedly murdered or have vanished in the past years. On September 16, 2017, a seer who had helped Narendra Giri come out with a list of fake ascetics had gone missing. Mahant Mohan Das from the Udaseen Panchayati Bada Akhara had boarded a train from Haridwar to Mumbai. He never arrived at his destination. An SIT set up to investigate the case was unable to find clues. “The list of fake sadhus had angered many people. Giri and those close to him had earned the ire of many after that. A week later, Mahant Mohan Das was gone. Can a person disappear from a train? Now, years later, people have exacted their revenge on Giri. This is why many of us find it hard to believe that Giri took his life. We have been saying that his death is the result of a conspiracy,” said a seer from the Niranjani akhara on Wednesday. Mohan Das is now presumed dead by the community. So is Ramdev’s guru Shankar Dev who mysteriously disappeared in July 2007 from Haridwar’s Kankhal while on a morning walk. In 2013, the Centre had handed over the investigation to the CBI. Then there were brazen murders that sent shockwaves through the seer community. Many of the alleged killings followed property disputes. “There were initial arrests made in some cases, but no long-term punishment meted out to the culprits. Many have been out on bail since,” said Swami Ravindra Puri from Mahanirwani akhara. On April 14, 2012, Sudhir Giri, a seer from the Mahanirwani Akhara, was killed when he was on his way to his ashram at Belada village near Haridwar. He was allegedly shot dead for opposing a land deal. In June 2001, Swami Vishnugiri and four seers were allegedly killed near Har-ki-Pauri. In the same month, another seer, Brahmanand, was found murdered. In August 2002, a seer Hariyanand was allegedly killed along with his disciple. On December 12, 2000, Sadhvi Premanand, an American, was found murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2-dozen-seers-murdered-or-missing-in-haridwar-in-past-two-decades/articleshow/86433708.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Vote wisely, good MLA crucial for proper development, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Appealing to a gathering in Hapur to vote wisely in the coming election as a ‘good public representative is crucial to proper development’, CM Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday that he had to intervene to allow the kanwar yatra to take place in 2017, after dispelling doubts in the administration that a real bhakt or believer could not be indisciplined. “I told them these the kanwars are devotees of Lord Shiv and they will follow all rules. No real devotee can be indisciplined and we should provide them with facilities accordingly,” he said. Saying that faith is the country’s biggest power, Yogi said there were restrictions on use of the bell, conch shell, DJs during the kanwar yatra but he gave permission to allow their use. “All festivals are now being held peacefully. However, we must remember that we cannot be bigger than the country. People can have their own faith, their caste but this should not be an obstacle in the way of rashtriya dharma. A good public representative will ensure security, proper development and a peaceful environment,” he said. Inaugurating 173 projects worth Rs 342 crore for Hapur district, the CM said that had the MLA of Dhaulana, one of the three assembly constituencies in the district, also been from BJP, then the area would not be getting only routine projects but the MLA could have ensured that some larger project was also set up there. He said that since Narendra Modi became the PM, the national agenda had changed and the government was working for farmers, women, poor, youth. Similarly, present UP was a part of new India where there was development and each citizen was safe and the government would not allow anyone to play with their security. “This is the same west UP where 4.5 years back people were asking whether women here will ever be safe. Who has forgotten the Muzaffarnagar riots? In the past 4.5 years, we have made UP riot free,” the CM said. Targetting the Opposition, the chief minister made a reference to an SP MP who has allegedly spoken in support of the Taliban, and said that such persons were hurdles in the way of development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vote-wisely-good-mla-crucial-for-proper-development-yogi/articleshow/86440163.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Wildlife activist Tapeshwar Singh Bhati filed a case in judicial magistrate court-5 (Kota north) in November 2017 alleging that tourist activities, such as boating, were taking place from Chambal Garden to Garadia Mahadev temple in the National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS) without approval from the authorities violating Section 28(D) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Bhati claimed that it was a punishable offence under Section 51 of the Act. A probe report submitted by Kota city superintendent of police in October 2018 confirmed that tourism activities between the places took place illegally from 2013-14. The activities continued in the following years. The court order on September 9, a copy of which was obtained on Tuesday, observed that the deputy conservator of forest (wildlife) of Mukundra National Park, had in May 2015, had allowed Ravindra Tomer, Maya and Banwari to conduct boating in the areas. Ravinder Tomer was not held guilty as he had complied by the forest official’s order.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Phoolan Devi’s sister joins Sher Singh Rana’s political party||HARIDWAR: When Phoolan Devi was shot dead in 2001, her younger sister Munni Devi was a key witness and said she saw Sher Singh Rana shoot her down. Rana was convicted and awarded life imprisonment by a Delhi court in 2014 and granted bail in 2016. However, in 2007, when the trial was ongoing, Munni Devi changed her story and came out in Rana’s support, saying he was framed for Phoolan’s murder. Subsequently, she claimed that the real murderer was the MP’s husband Umed Singh. On Wednesday, at a press conference in Haridwar, it was announced that Munni Devi will be vice-president of Rashtrawadi Janlok Party, formed by Rana. She was also named state co-in-charge of the party in Uttarakhand. Munni Devi was not present in the press brief herself but her statement was released by the party in which she expressed gratitude to Sher Singh Rana for giving her ‘a big responsibility’ and claimed that the party will soon launch a state-wide agitation over unemployment. Meanwhile, speaking to TOI over phone from Delhi, Munni Devi refused to elaborate on why she had joined Rana’s political party even though he had been convicted of the murder of her sister. “I joined the party willingly. I can’t say anything further. I have already spoken out about the truth behind my sister’s murder.” Sher Singh Rana, who hails from Roorkee, is currently trying to gain a foothold in Uttarakhand politics, especially in the Haridwar region. Some days ago, a massive agitation was staged by his political outfit in Haridwar. Rana has announced that his party will fight the upcoming assembly elections in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/phoolan-devis-sister-joins-political-party-of-sher-singh-rana-convicted-of-murder-of-dacoit-queen/articleshow/86433724.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Delhi||DU committee to oppose delinking of College of Art||New Delhi: The fight between Delhi University and Delhi government over the affiliation of College of Art (COA) is far from being over. DU has constituted a committee that will draft comments on behalf of the university and request the education department against the merger of COA with Ambedkar University. The admissions to COA for this session is yet to begin. This March, Delhi government announced that COA would now be affiliated to Ambedkar University as the college was facing various problems. After DU didn’t respond to a request to begin the de-affiliation process, Directorate of Training and Technical Education wrote to the registrar seeking a response on August 13. The matters were placed before DU’s executive council (EC), where most of the elected members opposed the move. COA, only such college under DU, was affiliated to the university’s Faculty of Music and Fine Arts in 1974. The members who are part of the current committee, which was set up on Tuesday, are also the elected EC members. The committee is chaired by EC member V S Negi. Seema Das, an EC member, said, “We will draft a response to the cabinet. As COA is an integral part of DU, the de-affiliation should not be undertaken.” Das said, “We need not take any cognisance of both the letters of Delhi government dated March 3 and 5, 2021, which are in violation of DU Act 1922 and Statue 30 of the ordinances.” The government had claimed COA was not getting any support from DU in the admission process and online and offline bachelor and master’s examinations, while its students, unlike other colleges, didn’t get any financial assistance. Even admissions/enrolment to PhD in fine arts, admissible since 1999, was stopped by the faculty in 2018-19, the government said. Earlier, Delhi College of Engineering and Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology were de-affiliated from DU and made separate universities. Along with COA, the committee will also draft recommendations regarding de-affiliation of Delhi Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research. It is now a university under Delhi government. Despite repeated attempts, no comment was available from Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-committee-to-oppose-delinking-of-college-of-art/articleshow/86437897.cms||Shradha Chettri

Owaisi was in the district to attend a public rally where some posters called Sambhal the "land of the ghazis", an apparent reference to "Muslim warriors". Taking strong objection, BJP's regional vice-president (western UP), Rajesh Singhal, said, “The district is associated with Hindu gods. The place has always been religious. No one has the power to change the history of the place and all these tactics won’t work.” The former district president of Sambhal added, “This is an election stunt by Owaisi. Sambhal is also a place of mythological importance." Owaisi, meanwhile, addressed a large gathering in the Sirsi area of Sambhal in the afternoon. Referring to chief minister Yogi Aditiyanath's recent "abba" remark, the AIMIM president said that he was the "abba of the state's poor and weak". "Owaisi is the father of the poor and weak in UP. Owaisi is the brother of women. I am your 'abba' (father) and 'chacha jaan' (uncle)," he said, adding that people of UP will not make Yogi Adityanath the CM for the second time. Owaisi further said, "In the Lok Sabha polls, we did not field a candidate here, yet we are blamed for SP-BSP's poor show, managing only 15 seats. They should come on stage and have a face-to-face debate (on this)." Wednesday's public rally witnessed a large turnout of locals and party workers. To make the event a success, AIMIM workers had visited urban and rural areas of the district to "connect with the people". They also put up several posters to welcome Owaisi with a few using the term "ghazis". The AIMIM had recently announced that it would contest at least 100 seats in the state assembly polls next year by tying up with Om Prakash Rajbhar's political outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/owaisi-calls-himself-abba-of-poor-bjp-objects-to-ghazi/articleshow/86435942.cms||Maria Khan
---||Lucknow||UP cleric held for ‘running India’s biggest conversion syndicate for over 30 years’||LUCKNOW: A prominent Meerut cleric, who ran multiple Islamic trusts across north India and used these as a garb to operate the country’s biggest illegal conversion syndicate for 30 years, was arrested by UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on Wednesday. The accused, Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui, 62, received mammoth funds from abroad, particularly Gulf nations, through hawala transactions, said ATS sources. Siddiqui worked closely with the kingpin Umar Gautam and his accomplice Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi, who were arrested in June. “We unearthed over Rs 1.5crore illegally routed through Bahrain and Rs 3crore from other Gulf nations. These transactions were in violation of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act,” said additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar. Followers of Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui giving memorandum to district administration demanding his release.The Islamic Dawah Centre in Jamia Nagar, Delhi, continued to be the nerve centre, where the cleric would steer his illegal missionary work with Umar and Mufti Qasmi. And his Shah Waliullah Trust in Delhi was the key front for routing hawala money. Siddiqui’s other trusts in Delhi and Haryana included Global Peace Centre and Peace Mission (Mustafabad), Madrassa Sabeel-us-Salam (Jamia Nagar), Dawat-e-Islam Trust (DEIT), Mewat, and World Peace Organisation. His illegal missionary activity straddled Rajasthan, MP, UP, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana and Orissa, ATS sources said. Inspector general of police, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, who has been leading the probe, said, “A UK-based organization, Al-Fala Trust, has been identified as another big source of funds. More than Rs 57 crore was received by the cleric’s Shah Waliullah Trust. And Umar Gautam’s Al-Hasan Educational and Welfare Foundation was similarly funded. The cleric ploughs in the ill-gotten money into madrasas across north India and motivates people to embrace Islam through monetary allurements and instilling fear of ‘jahannam’ or hellfire in afterlife if they didn’t follow Islam.” The family of Siddiqui, who originally hails from Phulat in Muzaffarnagar, also play a crucial role in the conversion racket. After completing his primary education from a madrasa in Phulat, he pursued intermediate studies in science from Pickett Inter College, Khatauli. Later, he graduated in science from Meerut College and cracked the PMT entrance exam. However, he gave up being a doctor and enrolled himself in Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow. The anti-terror squad busted the Nagpur syndicate and nabbed Rameshwar Kawre alias Adam, Kaushar Alam and Bhuriya Bando alias Arslan Mustafa. Others in the police net include kingpin Umar Gautam, his accomplice Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi, Noida sign language interpreter Irfan Sheikh, Munna Yadav and Rahul Bhola. Cleric in judicial custody till October 5:Special judge of NIA-ATS, Y R Gupta, on Wednesday sent Meerut cleric Kaleem Siddiqui in judicial custody till October 5 for his alleged role in running a religious conversion syndicate. The court summoned the accused from prison on Thursday on the ATS plea for his police remand. Till date, ATS has arrested 10 accused, including the kingpin Umar Gautam from different parts of the country and forwarded a chargesheet against six. The probe against four accused is pending. Sub-inspector Vinod Kumar had lodged an FIR in this case with ATS police station on June 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/meerut-cleric-ran-biggest-conversion-syndicate-held/articleshow/86440232.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Eight PSA plants commissioned in Nashik district in September||NASHIK: In total, 10 out of 23 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants have been commissioned in Nashik district, with eight of them being commissioned over the past ten days. The district administration and health authorities are carrying out the infrastructure development in the district to meet the challenges of the third Covid wave, if it strikes, and the infrastructure is being readied on a war footing. In rural areas of the district, the Civil Hospital has planned eight Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tanks that will be used to store oxygen as buffer stock during emergency. The tanks will have outlets enabling refilling of cylinders, if required. “In September itself, eight out of 10 ready PSA plants have been commissioned. The rest are in the final stage,” said civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat. The rest are likely to be available by the month-end. It may be noted that the rural areas only have dedicated Covid-19 health centres (DCHC), not hospitals hence only a few of them were equipped with oxygen supplies. “We are now having all rural hospitals (RH) and sub-district hospitals (SDH) that will have oxygen supplies by storage or generation,” Thorat added. The PSAs at rural set-ups at Ghoti, Lasalgaon, Satana Igatpuri, Pimpalgaon, SDHs Chandwad, Sinnar and Kalwan were commissioned in September. Similarly, LMO tanks will contribute 70% of total oxygen requirement estimated in the rural areas of the district. “Of the total, it is estimated that 145 metric ton (MT) oxygen will be required in the rural areas during the peak of the third wave, the authorities have planned for storage of 99 MT in the eight tanks,” the officer added. The LMO tanks with 20 kilo-liter (KL) capacity each have been installed at Civil Hospital, Nashik, and General Hospital, Malegaon, while two such tanks are being raised at SDH Kalwan and Chandwad. The civil and general hospital will also have 6 KL capacity LMO tanks each as stand-by arrangement. SDH Yeola will have 13 KL capacity LMO tank and RH Pimpalgaon will have 10 KL LMO tank. “This collectively will have 87 KL or 99.18 MT oxygen available in rural areas through the tanks,” the officer added. This will provide ample supply of oxygen in rural areas and will cut down the need for patients to be shifted to Nashik for want of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/eight-psa-plants-commissioned-in-nashik-district-in-sept/articleshow/86431631.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Even, the investigating officer could not produce evidence to show that on that date the licensed gun was in the custody of the applicant (Raj),” the court said. Raj was arrested in June. The court said the question about his likelihood of repeating the offence can be dealt with by imposing conditions and in case of breach, recourse to law can be taken. “As chargesheet has been filed, investigation is completed, and the weapon which the informant (wife) alleged was used for commission has not been seized, no purpose will be served in curtailing liberty of the applicant,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/intimidation-case-ex-cps-son-gets-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/86441498.cms||---

The incident occurred at Sudwadi village near Talegaon MIDC, when the victim, Mukesh Kumar, who was originally from Uttar Pradesh, was on his way to transfer the amount back home. Sub-inspector M L Madewad of the Bhosari MIDC police told TOI, “The trio travelling in a white colour SUV picked up a dispute with Kumar, claiming that he had touched the mirror of their vehicle and robbed him of the cellphone, worth Rs10,000, and cash.” Madewad said, “Kumar had moved to Pune three months ago and got a worker’s job at a private company in Talegaon MIDC. He is staying in a rented room at Sudwadi.” Around 7.45pm on Tuesday, Kumar was on his way to a private money transfer service station “While he was near the service station, the SUV stopped near him. The driver and two men got down and entered into a brawl with Kumar and robbed him,” Madewad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-in-suv-rob-pedestrian-of-phone-rs-20k-near-talegaon-midc/articleshow/86437955.cms||---

The petitioner stated that the area where the proposed community hall is to be constructed is ear-marked as a playground and if the construction is made there, then the children would not have any place to play.However, the authorities in their counter stated that the site has been specifically left vacant in the village with an objective to construct a community hall for the welfare of the people residing in the area. The tahsildar had also conducted a field inspection and had identified the place only after obtaining the opinion of the villagers.It was stated that all the people in the locality had agreed to the construction. However, the petitioner’s mother alone with a malafide intention has raised objections to shift the place of construction as she has a vacant site adjacent to the proposed site.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that from the counter affidavit filed by the authorities, it is clear that there is no public interest involved in the petition. When the petitioner has got personal interest in the adjoining site, the construction of a community hall for the benefit of villagers cannot be relocated at his whims and fancies.The judges further observed that the petitioner has also not produced any documents to show that the proposed site has been earmarked as a playground. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-community-hall-in-madurai/articleshow/86437957.cms||---

Since January 2021, police have arrested 220 smugglers with over 30-kg heroin, 50-kg opium and 101-kg charas worth over Rs 40 crore. District police seem to be going hammer and tongs at drug peddlers having links with the international drug mafia Taimur Khan, alias Bhola, from Bareilly, who recently surrendered in Delhi. He carried a bounty of Rs 2.5 lakh. Divulging details about the operation against drug smugglers, Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar told TOI, “Many smugglers were active in Bareilly and would smuggle drugs from Jharkhand to the city and then send it to various parts of the country post-refining. Several youths from Bareilly were used as carriers by them and many are behind bars now. Taimur was running a gang in UP while sitting in Delhi. But after we arrested most of his aides, increased bounty on him and issued an informal warning for him, he surrendered in Delhi. He has assets worth Rs 6 crore at his native place. Another gang was run by one Shaheed Khan, who was arrested with heroin worth Rs 20 crore. His entire family is indulged in smuggling and have properties worth Rs 15 crore. We have sealed their bank accounts. Another prominent drug smuggler arrested by us is Riyasat Ali, who had purchased many properties in Fatehganj West and is believed to have connections with Taimur and Shaheed.” The shopping complex owned by Usman, a history-sheeter, is being razed. There are 17 cases under the NDPS Act against him. His sons, Amaan and Faizaan, were also arrested while smuggling narcotic substances on multiple occasions. “We have shared their information with the income tax department and expecting stern action against the drug smugglers,” Agarwal added. SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “The structures were built without the BDA’s permission. We are still in the process of identifying properties of drug smugglers in Bareilly with the help of the district administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/crackdown-on-smugglers-220-held-with-drugs-worth-rs-40-cr-since-jan/articleshow/86436032.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Madurai||Campaign against co. an act of advocacy, not incitement: HC||Madurai: The Madras high court has quashed the final report filed by the Madurai railway police against two people who had distributed pamphlets against Sterlite copper plant to the passengers travelling in the Guruvayur- Chennai Express in 2018 by entering the Madurai station. Observing that the act of campaign by the two - Sivakumar and Murali - who filed a petition seeking to quash the report, can only be constructed as an act of advocacy and not as an incitement, justice G Illangovan said: “The infamous Sterlite issue has created trouble in the recent past and arguments have been advanced for and against the running of the plant and the Supreme Court ordered closure of the plant, considering the environmental issue that has been created. Now, the matter has been closed forever.”In the background of the latest developments, continuation of the criminal proceedings and prosecution against the petitioners will become an unnecessary exercise, wasting the time of the court, observed the judge.The judge observed that the petitioners have the freedom of expression to protest and campaign, however, they cannot enter any place at any time and issue pamphlets and indulge in protest and campaign. Even though such an act on part of the petitioners is not permissible, the question that arises for consideration is whether the offences against them are attracted.In order to attract offences under Section 153(B) of IPC, the act of campaign might have caused prejudice to the national integration. It is not known as to how the issuance of pamphlets will result in disruption of national integration, observed the judge.The judge said that no doubt, Section 137(i)(a) of the Railways Act is attracted against the petitioners because they entered into the compartments without proper permission. Even though they stated that they have purchased platform tickets, there is no materials to prove the same. However, offence under Railways Act is only punishable with six months imprisonment or fine upto Rs 1,000 or both. Taking into account that none of the major offences are attracted in this case, the judge quashed the final report filed before the Madurai judicial magistrate court VI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/campaign-against-co-an-act-of-advocacy-not-incitement-hc/articleshow/86437970.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Though the boy went missing on September 13, the authorities concerned lodged a complaint with City Chowk police only on September 21. Activists now are seeking a probe. Observation home superintendent Vijay Vighne on Wednesday said the boy was brought in following a recent drive to locate child beggars. “The boy is from the Lasur station and is an orphan. We checked the CCTV footage — he escaped by climbing over the wall. The boy is untraceable. We are yet to establish contact with his grandparents,” he said. Vighne said child beggars are kept in the open facility, unlike juveniles in conflict with the law who remain in confinement. “We have only one guard to look after 35-40 children in the open facility. We have now asked all employees to improve surveillance,” he said. Child rights activist Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, who is also the founder of Dnyana Devi Pune Childline, said: “The observation home authorities claim the boy ran away, yet they have lodged a complaint of kidnapping. It is worrying that a state-run home has such porous security.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/7-yr-old-goes-missing-from-observation-home/articleshow/86431661.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Property tax collection in Andhra Pradesh villages to go online||AMARAVATI: The state government has launched a mobile application for collection of property taxes in villages. Data of 86 lakh households in panchayats were synchronized with the app. Now the taxes collection will take place only through the app. Government sources said collections through app will prevent corrupt practices such as fake challans. “We have decided to collect property taxes in villages only online. The newly launched mobile application will help generate 100 per cent taxes,” said panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy. He said that manual tax collections will be scrapped with immediate effect. The mobile app-based tax collections will not only bring transparency to the system but also help field officials meet targets. Village panchayats are struggling to take up basic sanitation works due to poor tax collections. “While the finance commission grants will help the villages take up new developmental works, the property tax collections will make them self-sustain at least to manage drinking water schemes, electricity and sanitation. Tax collection is very crucial to bring villages into clean mode,” said Peddireddy. The bill collector will have to enter the One-Time-Password (OTP) sent to the mobile number of tax payer during the tax collection on the mobile application. The tax payer will get the digital receipt of the tax payment immediately after the amount collected by the respective bill collector. This will end delayed remittances or diversion of funds by staff. Mobile-based collections will also prevent the production of fake or bogus challans and receipt by a few errant staffers. “The mobile application will reflect the 100 percent tax collection instantaneously,” said Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, principal secretary, panchayat raj. He said the tax dues will be reflected in village panchayat dash boards prompting panchayat members and sarpanch to focus on tax collections. The state government is likely to ask panchayat boards to go for scientific assessment of taxes to bring more households into tax net. The government is also planning to ask panchayats to rationalize property taxes on par with growing market values of properties. Village panchayats where taxes have not been revised for several years will have to take up the task to improve their finances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/property-tax-collection-in-villages-to-go-online/articleshow/86436048.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||SRK, online banking make it to sign language lexicon||No. Don’t spread your hands wide or break into a dimply come-into-my-arms smile. Instead, simply hold the fingers of your right hand like a gun and tap above your heart twice. This may not be as romantic as Shah Rukh’s signature love gesture, but then it’s the official silent shorthand for King Khan as per the latest Indian Sign Language (ISL) dictionary launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month. Khan’s name is among 10,000 words, including ‘Deaflympics’, online banking’ and ‘carpooling’, that have been newly drafted into the digital dictionary of India’s non-voiced lexicon. Developed and released by the Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC) in DVD form along with corresponding videos of signs for each word, this new visual dictionary makes for interesting viewing, especially in light of the International Day of Sign Languages, which, too, has earned its own official sign this year. Among the delights offered by the non-verbal vocabulary that now spans the gamut from technical terms such as ‘quadrupedal robots’ to academic abstractions such as ‘anti-trust policy’ is watching the interpreter’s face crumple into a frown while conveying ‘tight-fitting clothes’ and puff up while showing an ‘air mattress’. When the gesture for ‘tax’ is accompanied by a morose expression, speech seems redundant as a communication device. It was to erase communication barriers between deaf people — 18 million according to estimates — and hearing communities that ISLRTC launched the first Indian Sign Language Dictionary of 3,000 terms in 2018. “When I was a deaf child, my special educators were not able to explain abstract philosophies because they never knew ISL. They used their spoken language to explain things that were abstract and they had found them challenging to teach,” recalls Sunil Sahasrabudhe, vice-president of the All-India Federation of the Deaf. Sahasrabuddhe finds the new ISL dictionary “long overdue” as someone who has taught English literacy to deaf kids in schools and to young deaf adults in NGOs, besides several ISL teachers (deaf) and ISL interpreters. “ISL vocabulary is not and never will be limited. It can keep growing when deaf people interact and engage with different concepts,” says Sahasrabudhe in an email interview. While the lockdown interfered with crucial vocabulary-building in-person meet-ups of deaf persons, the use of masks made navigating everyday tasks such as buying vegetables tricky for the deaf members who rely on lip-reading. “If hearing individuals would learn basic sign language, then such difficulties can be easily prevented,” feels Mansi Shah of Indian Signing Hands, which runs an online news channel for the deaf community. So far, 142 different sign languages have been studied around the world. The dictionary model to aspire to, according to city-based interpreter Neeta Mukherji, is the Finnish Sign Language Dictionary. Apart from a digital video version, it comes with a bulky print version where signs are explained with a lot of diagrams. Even as she waits for the print version of ISLRTC’s DVD dictionary, Mukherji, who interprets Marathi through sign language at a school for the deaf in Thane, uses an Indo-Pak Sign Language dictionary that had come out of Coimbatore a few years ago. Replete with economic and scientific terms, tenses and even some regional variations in dialect, this book tends to be her go-to recommendation for someone new to the mechanics of the non-voiced language.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-srk-online-banking-make-it-to-sign-language-lexicon/articleshow/86441518.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Ganja farms with crop worth Rs 1.7 crore busted in 3 districts||NASHIK: Police units from Ahmednagar, Dhule and Nandurbar have busted ganja plantations, with crop worth Rs 1.75 crore, in the past month. B G Shekhar Patil, the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) of the Nashik range, told TOI that the police of the three districts conducted raids and found four spots where the cultivation was taking place in a covert manner. Patil said farmers usually grow marijuana covertly in the hilly areas. Hilly areas are chosen for the illegal cultivation as they cannot be easily spotted by other villagers. Moreover, the ganja farmers can also keep an eye out for anyone approaching their ganja farms. Whenever they spot the police, the ganja growers flee the scene. “The superintendents of police (SP) of all the five units — Nashik Rural, Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar — in the range have been instructed to be vigilant of such illegal cultivation of narcotics in order to make the entire range drug-free,” said Patil. Over the past month, the police have reported two ganja cases in Ahmednagar and one each in Dhule and Nandurbar districts. The SPs of the districts concerned would step up intelligence in their respective jurisdictions to find out if the ganja was cultivated clandestinely. Last year, in June, Dhule police had raided a farm and found cultivation of ganja in the Shirpur taluka. The police had seized cannabis worth Rs 2.14 crore. The farmer concerned used to grow the ganja on his farm and stock the contraband there to sell to prospective buyers. Apart from the cultivation, the police have found that ganja has been transported through the district in large quantities in the past. Large loads of cannabis are transported on trucks. After getting information, the police had intercepted the trucks and recovered the ganja. Many people have also been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ganja-farms-with-crop-worth-rs-1-7cr-busted-in-3-districts/articleshow/86431695.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The summary revision of electors’ photo rolls is being carried out by the Election Commission of India. As part of the same, the district election office is carrying out the measures to clear the photo rolls of all the duplicate entries. Mandhare said that citizens have to ensure that their names are added to the electoral roll. At the same time, it is every citizen’s duty was to ensure that the duplicate names are deleted. “The industrial units should get a self-declaration from all employees stating that their names are not repeated in the electors photo roll. This declaration should be collected and deposited with the regional officer of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) at the earliest,” collector has said. A senior officer from the election office added that this exercise will also double up as awareness campaign among the masses. Since the employees have to give their self-declaration, they would automatically look into the names of their family members and inform relatives and friends about it as well. People can visit the website and check their names. Citizens can apply for introduction of the names that are missing, deletion of the double entries and corrections, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-admin-starts-clearing-duplicate-names-in-voters-list/articleshow/86431729.cms||---

The due was sentenced to undergo seven years and five years rigorous imprisonment respectively. A person named Duraipandi was married to Rajeswari in 2001. At the time of marriage, 13 sovereigns of gold jewellery, Rs 15,000 cash and other household articles were given to Rajeswari.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath wooing non-BJP seats with his development plank||LUCKNOW: With UP assembly elections just a few months away, Yogi Adityanath, the longest serving chief minister from the BJP in the state, has embarked on a politically significant tour of the constituencies which the party has never won or lost in 2017 polls. In most of these visits, the CM is being accompanied by UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh. According to sources close to the CM, the idea behind the tours is that if BJP is able to snatch at least 50-60% of these seats from the opposition, the party would comfortably cover the losses that it might incur due to anti-incumbency of BJP MLAs. The BJP think-tank is also planning not to repeat many of the MLAs, especially after conducting a few surveys, which revealed that such legislators are unlikely to win if fielded again. A senior BJP leader, who is likely to have a say in ticket distribution, told TOI that at least 60-70 sitting MLAs could be denied ticket to ward off anti-incumbency, if any. The CM is not only visiting such constituencies but is also using development plank to win over voters. On Tuesday, Yogi inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for 30 projects worth Rs 69 crore in Thakurdwara constituency in Moradabad. SP’s Nawab Jan was elected from Thakurdwara in 2017. “Had there been a BJP MLA in this constituency, many development projects would have come up here like the other constituencies of Moradabad district,” the CM said. He added that the BJP had vowed to construct Ram temple in Ayodhya and it fulfilled its promise. Similarly, during a rally in Dhaulana constituency of Hapur, Yogi inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for projects worth Rs 390 crore in the district. He said it was the BJP government at the Centre that did away with Article 370. Similarly, when BJP came to power in UP, it promised that there would be no riots, he said. “Now, people know that if they indulge in rioting, they and their coming generations will have to pay for the damages,” the CM added. Dhaulana constituency came into existence after delimitation. In the last two elections, BJP has not been able to win the seat. BSP’s Aslam Chaudhary was elected from here in 2017. The CM laid the foundation of a medical college and addressed the gathering at the Najibabad assembly constituency in Bijnor district. Barring 1991, BJP has never won the seat. SP’s Tasleem had bagged the seat in 2017 defeating BJP’s Rajeev Agrawal by a margin of over 10,000 votes. On September 20, Yogi visited Mungra Badshahpur in Jaunpur district, where Sushma Patel won the 2017 election on a BSP ticket but was suspended by her party in 2020 for hobnobbing with the Samajwadi Party. Addressing the gathering after inaugurating and laying the foundation stone for several projects, Yogi claimed that even when there was no pandemic, previous governments did not allow Durga puja. “However, permission for Durga puja will be given this time. People of this region have been ditched by the sitting MLA as she shifted loyalty to another party. Each voter of Mungra Badshahpur would have been a ‘Badshah’, had people not voted out the then sitting MLA of the BJP, Seema Dwivedi,” the CM said. The Chief Minister also visited Kushinagar’s Ramkola and Tamkuhi Raj constituencies on September 12 and inaugurated and laid foundation stone for projects worth Rs 421 crore. Ramanand Baudh of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (a BJP ally in 2017 elections) is the legislator from Ramkola. Tamkuhi Raj is represented by Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Singh Lallu. Yogi has also visited Chillupar constituency in Gorakhpur which is represented by BSP MLA Vinay Tiwari, son of mafia-turned-politician Harishankar Tiwari. According to political analysts, Yogi’s focused visits to non-BJP constituencies is a deft political move. It would be interesting to see how many seats BJP succeeds in capitalizing on Yogi’s move, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-wooing-non-bjp-seats-with-his-development-plank/articleshow/86440344.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Nashik||Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s attitude is anti- Marathwada: Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar||AURANGABAD: BJP leader and former Cabinet minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar on Wednesday accused the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of being “anti-Marathwada”. Addressing the media here, he criticised chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for allegedly failing to take note of the pressing issues in Marathwada during his recent official visit to Aurangabad on the occasion of Marathwada Liberation Day. “It was expected from CM to make district-wise announcements for the benefit of Marathwada. He, however, did not touch upon any of the major issues, including delay in the water grid project, release of compensation for rain-hit farmers and problems faced by industries from Marathwada,” he said. Referring to “future allies” comment made by Thackeray with reference to couple of BJP ministers present on the dais during the Marathwada Liberation Day event on September 17, Nilangekar said the CM simply chose to mislead people instead of offering any relief to the region. “The ruling MVA government in March had announced development plans worth Rs 2,011 crore for Marathwada. The amount of money was later slashed to Rs 600 crore, which is yet to get disbursed. The overall attitude and behaviour of the state government, therefore, shows that it is anti-Marathwada,” he said. Nilangekar also alleged that the CM and his deputy didn’t know about the world beyond their home-towns Mumbai and Pune, respectively. “The people of Marathwada will not forgive the ruling party leaders for step-motherly treatment to the region, which has huge developmental backlog,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mva-govts-attitude-is-anti-mwada-nilangekar/articleshow/86431790.cms||---

This is about 13% of the total estimated target of 4.79 crore for the age group. This is crucial considering that people in this category have been described as ‘vulnerable’ as more than 85% of the Covid-19 deaths took place in this age bracket. The findings were placed before chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently during the daily Covid-19 review who, sources said, directed health officials to take measures and get them vaccinated at the earliest. Alarmed over the situation, the state task force on Covid-19 vaccination has drafted the strategy to vaccinate the people through a dedicated sub-campaign at the earliest. “The line-listing of these people is done. The data obtained has been uploaded and merged with the CoWin portal. A mobilisation strategy is set for launch while the training for the same is underway,” sources said adding that district immunisation officers and support staff were briefed on Wednesday evening in this regard. Insiders revealed that the campaign strategy banks on cluster approach in which the target will be broken into small segments to simplify persuasion. The district Covid-19 control and command centres have also been asked to call up the persons and remind them of their due dose besides informing them about the risks of not getting vaccinated. Random follow up calls will also be made from the CM Helpline. Health officials believe that the goal will be achieved in a seven-day dedicated campaign. Meanwhile, the survey indicated that the number of unvaccinated 45 years plus persons was maximum in Saharanpur (2.25 lakh) while it was lowest in Gorakhpur (7,573). In all, 28 districts had more than one lakh unvaccinated persons in the category, including Saharanpur (2.25 lakh), Sultanpur (2.14 lakh), Agra (2.10 lakh) and Prayagraj (2.05 lakh) where the number of such persons was more than two lakh. Also, in six districts, the number of such persons was more than 1.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-plans-drive-to-vaccinate-all-beneficiaries-above-45yrs/articleshow/86440379.cms||Shailvee Sharda

She chose vocational stream with agriculture practices to try her luck on the 5% seats allocated in TNAU for students from vocational stream.But she could not make it to the 67 seats reserved for students from vocational stream in 18 constituent colleges under TNAU, Coimbatore. She opted for engineering in a college in Chennai, but she could have fulfilled her dream of studying agriculture if seats were reserved in 28 affiliated self-financing colleges too as it was in the past.TNAU was admitting students from vocational stream in affiliated colleges until 2019 before scrapping the practise. This has prevented students of over 300-odd government schools and many aided schools offering vocational stream with agriculture science as the main subject from joining these professional courses.The students who have passed Class XII under vocational stream are ineligible to join self-financing affiliated colleges of TNAU, Coimbatore, as per the admission notifications released early this month.Students from vocational stream are not eligible to join in B Sc. (Hons) Agriculture and B Sc (Hons) Horticulture courses oferedin 28 self-financing colleges of the TNAU.Former vice-chancellor of TNAU, Coimbatore, K Ramasamy said aspirants are free to move to the court to claim admission in private affiliated colleges as the decision to restrict students from vocational stream from joining private colleges appears recent. “The only issue may be the low marks of these students in Class XII who usually come far below in the rank list. These students prefer Coimbatore and Madurai which are also preferred by bright students and they find it difficult to manage,” he said.Coordinator of Forum for Education Development-Tamil Nadu S Moorthy said it is unfair to allot only 67 seats out of the total 1,280 seats in 18 constituent colleges for students from vocational stream. He said in the academic year 2019-2020, 140 seats were allotted to NRI quota. But only 103 students applied for it. Similarly, another 140 seats were allotted for industrial sponsorship quota. But only 96 students applied for it.“How can candidates from the vocational stream become eligible for government colleges but not private colleges,” questioned educationist Prince Gajendra Babu. The 7.5% reservation announced for government school students in professional courses is nullified in this case as TNAU deny admission to its private affiliated colleges for students who have studied vocational stream, he said. Asked if similar reservation for students from vocational stream in private colleges can be considered, TNAU vice-chancellor N Kumar said that poor academic performance of candidates from vocational stream was a matter of concern for private colleges. “However, decisions relating to the admission is that of the state government,” he saidSpeaking to TOI, agriculture minister M R K Paneerselvam assure to look into the issue and find an amicable solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/denial-of-admission-to-vocational-stream-students-questioned/articleshow/86438072.cms||Sampath Kumar

Agitated villagers who staged a protest blamed the blasts at the stone quarries close by as the cause of the incident that claimed the life of the toddler. The victim was identified as M Akash of Seelaathikulam in Radhapuram taluk.Preliminary inquiries revealed that the boy was sleeping in his house while his mother had gone to fetch water when the portion of the concrete house collapsed. Villagers who rushed to the spot and cleared the debris could only retrieve his body. The Radhapuram police and officials from the revenue department rushed to the spot for investigations. Agitated over the blasts in the quarries, the boy’s family and villagers vented their ire on the revenue officials and police personnel. Police had a tough time pacifying the villagers before they allowed them to take the body to the government hospital for post-mortem. The villagers said that there are more than a dozen stone quarries in the locality and the blasts that go uncontrolled have resulted in at least 10 houses in the village developing cracks. The boy’s father Murugan told reporters that there are nearly 20 unauthorised quarries in the region and that the powerful explosions have always been a cause of concern for them. He said that officials turned a deaf ear to representations of villagers to such violations and that his son would have been alive if officials had initiated timely action.Villagers asked officials to close down illegal quarrying and quarrying by violating the permissible limits and stop use of explosives to avert such incidents.

Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in the city has set up an exclusive ward with 40 beds for treating Dengue patients. Going by the data of the public health department, the district witnessed 101 cases of confirmed Dengue since January this year. The health department officials said that Trichy had 12 cases of confirmed Dengue in September. Deputy director of health services (DDHS), Trichy, Dr A Subramani said the intermittent rain the district has been receiving over the past few weeks is one of the major reasons for the spread of Dengue. “The incidence of Dengue is not alarming. Dengue cases usually appear during the rainy season. Preventive measures are in place as we have already deployed health workers in the field,” DDHS Subramani told ToI. Public health department officials said that the district witnessed Dengue cases not every month. There were no cases in May and June. With a mild rise in July, the cases slowly increased with rain. Lack of maintenance of flowerpots, rainwater stagnation on the terrace due to blockage in the city areas and the storage of water in unsafe containers due to the lack of water supply in rural areas trigger Dengue spread. A total of 700 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) are also deployed in the rural and city areas of the district. A senior doctor at MGMGH said that the hospital has no Dengue case as of Wednesday. But will keep the beds as reserve for Dengue patients, the doctor said. Meanwhile, public health officials said that the incidence of Dengue is negligible among the children in Trichy. Only a seven-year-old girl had contracted the infection so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-hospital-sets-up-ward-for-treating-dengue/articleshow/86438116.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The representatives of organisations from Kolhapur met on Wednesday to discuss the strategy for the ‘Bharat Bandh’ agitation. Several political parties such as Nationalist Congress Party and leaders such as Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana have extended their support to the Bharat Bandh call. Uday Narkar, convenor of Kisan Sabha, said, “We are against the three farm laws, which are against the interest of the farmers. Also we are against the Labour Code proposed by the central government, which will take away rights of the workers. We have decided to shut all markets from tehsil places, industries and agriculture operations.” Narkar said that large demonstrations would be held at Bindu Chowk and a protest rally would be taken out along major routes of the city. Veteran leader Sampat Pawar slammed the central government over its handling of the farmers agitations taking place at the borders of national capital. “The farmers are protesting for the last ten months. The government and its machinery are trying to defame the agitators by some way or the other. The entire nation is agitated against the injustice happening to the farmers. We, therefore, expect a large number of people to support our Bharat Bandh call,” Pawar said. The organisations are going to make joint appeal to the citizens on Thursday. The emergency services such as supply of milk and medicines will be kept out of the list of services to remain shut on the day of Bharat Bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/markets-biz-to-be-shut-on-sept-27/articleshow/86431859.cms||---

The members took loans from a bank to fund the project. While the private company provided technology support, the civic body provided space and water. The revenue generated from the project was shared among the members. Although the group made good revenue, the venture suffered a setback due to the pandemic and the lockdown.The SHG took Rs 9.5 lakh loan from Canara Bank, leader S Krishnaveni said. “Five of us also invested Rs 50,000 each. Apart from setting up machines, we had to buy water cans and a light commercial vehicle to supply water to residents. We made good business and repaid Rs 2 lakh of the loan amount. But the pandemic spoiled our plan,” she told TOI. “Now, we have received a notice from the bank’s advocate.”“We do not want to operate the unit anymore. We want the civic body to hand it over to some other SHG and relieve us. Given the circumstances, we don’t think we can run it. We are not in a position to bear the loan burden,” said a member of the SHG.The civic body is ready to provide whatever support required to sustain it, an official said. “We plan to shift the unit to some other place. The bank is ready to transfer the loan to the future operator,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shg-plans-to-abandon-water-kiosk-venture-as-psu-bank-flexes-muscle/articleshow/86438121.cms||V Devanathan

Jayankondam police arrested the baby’s father V Saravanan, 38, of Vadaveekkam and mother Meena, 29, as well as the Coimbatore couple. The baby was the fourth daughter of the couple. Brokers M Muthaiah, 52, of Trichy, P Rajendran, 56, and C Senthilkumar, 40, of Erode who facilitated the illegal activity were also arrested. “The Coimbatore couple were childless for seven years since marriage. The brokers misled them into involving in the illegal sale of the baby,” said inspector of police Jayankondam. The couple bought the baby for Rs 1.8 lakh by writing the process on a stamp paper as told by the brokers. He said the action was taken based on a complaint from the district child protection officer (DCPO) of Ariyalur S Duraimurugan. It was the baby’s mother Meena who exposed the sale by tipping the DCPO. The DCPO conducted preliminary inquiries and after confirming the incident filed a complaint with Jayankondam police. Duraimurugan said Saravanan sold the baby for Rs 1.8 lakh to a couple through three brokers a couple of days ago. “Police rescued the baby from a couple in Coimbatore and brought it to Ariyalur. Further investigation is on,” he said in the evening. The DCPO said Meena is the second wife of Saravanan and the couple already had three daughters. “Going by the statement of his wife, Saravanan decided to sell the baby and went ahead. Poverty does not seem to have been the reason for selling the baby,” he said. The baby’s custody will be given to the DCPO if the parents are unwilling to keep it with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/baby-sold-for-rs-1-8l-rescued-7-held/articleshow/86438102.cms||---

The corporation council meeting held on August 31 led by corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara approved the request.The civic body has handed over the stretch on Avinasi Road from Fun Mall to Trichy Road (3.2km), from Nava India Signal to Mettupalayam Road (via Chinnasamy Road, 100 Feet Road and Sivananda Colony) (4.70km), from Jenneys Residency (Ganapathy Road) to Sakthi Salai (6.6km), Thaneer Pandal Road from Avinashi Road to Vilangurichi Junction, from Trichy Road to Vellalore Noyyal Bridge, from the collectorate to Avaramapalayam (via the Government Polytechnic College For Women and Sathy Salai), from Ukkadam (Bypass Road) to Sivalaya Junction, from Ponnaiyarajapuram Ramamoorthy Road to Palakkad Road (Kuniyamuthur), Pollachi Road from Sidco to Sugunapuram in Pollachi Road), from Puttuvikki Road to Sundakkamuthur Road (Kovaipudur) and Sanganur Road from Sathy Road to Mettupalayam Road.It is the first such arrangement made by the corporation, an official said. Recently, the civic body had cancelled projects worth crores of rupees citing a financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/11-roads-handed-over-to-highways-dept/articleshow/86438098.cms||---
---||Delhi||Twice as bad: Delhi’s PM 2.5 now 17 times safe limit||NEW DELHI: After the World Health Organization revised its air quality guidelines on Wednesday for the first time in 16 years, the air safety standards have become stricter. Delhi’s annual PM 2.5 average for last year is around 17 times the new WHO-recommended safe annual limit. The revised WHO guidelines make it tougher for Delhi to meet global standards, and experts wish for a revision of the Indian standards for PM 2.5 too, which is currently eight times the annual WHO limit at 40 micrograms per cubic metre. Track the pollution level in your cityThe health body has updated the safe limit for PM 2.5 to 5mg per cubic metre from the 10mg and the annual mean for PM10 to 15mg per cubic metre against the earlier 20mg. The NO2 norm has seen the strictest reduction, dropping from the annual 40mg per cubic metre now to 10mg. An analysis by Greenpeace India of PM2.5 data aggregated by IQAir found that at least 79 of the world’s 100 most populous cities breached the outgoing WHO annual mean PM2.5 guideline in 2020. It will be even more difficult now to mee the new standards. While data wasn’t available for eight of the 100 cities, the remaining 13 cities met the safety limit, but hotspots within all 100 cities likely exceeded the guidelines locally, for example in areas close to busy roads or industry. The Greenpeace data puts Delhi’s mean average PM2.5 for 2020 at 87mg per cubic metre, which means it exceeded the earlier WHO guidelines by nearly eight times, the highest margin among the 100 countries considered. With the revised guidelines, Delhi’s figure becomes nearly 17 times the global standard. By the same calculation, Mumbai now exceeds the standard by eight times, Kolkata 9.4 times, Chennai 5.4, Hyderabad 7 and Ahmedabad 9.8 times. Globally, Dhaka’s average is 15 times higher than the new WHO norm and Lahore’s, 16 times. The Chinese cities of Shanghai and Beijing only exceed the norm, respectively, by six and eight times. Calculating premature deaths and financial losses due to air pollution for Tokyo, Delhi, Shanghai, Mexico City, Sao Paulo, New York, Istanbul, Bangkok, London and Johannesburg, the Indian capital had the maximum number of premature deaths in 2020 at 57,000, with Greenpeace India also finding a 14% loss in GDP due to air pollution. Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace India, said, “The new WHO air quality guidelines reestablish the fact that there is no ‘safe’ level of air pollution. It indicates the current national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are insufficient and need to be revised. All non-attaining cities should express an ambition to meet NAAQS in a time-bound manner first and then have a timeline to move towards the WHO guidelines,” he said. Sunil Dahiya, analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, agreed. He said India last revised its NAAQS in 2009. “The good thing is that India is already working on revising the standards,” Dahiya said. “We just need to make sure we make use of the evidence gathered by WHO and other organisations on the growing health impact of pollutants and aim to move closer to WHO-prescribed levels for pollutants.” Prof S N Tripathi of IIT Kanpur said. “Air pollution creates a severe health crisis and WHO’s revised guidelines bring back the focus on the problem. There are no two ways about the need to revise India's air quality standards to make them more stringent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/twice-as-bad-delhis-pm2-5-now-17-times-safe-limit/articleshow/86436368.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

A 70-year-old woman, Nirmala Devi, who is a fifth accused in the sensational murder of a Dalit outfit leader, C Pasupathy Pandian, in 2012, was beheaded by two bike-borne killers on Wednesday. The duo took the head to Pandian’s house in Nanthavanapatti village half a kilometre away and threw it below his poster. Her crime: She allegedly provided protection to the assailants of Pasupathy Pandian.The beheading of Nirmala Devi has several other gory elements woven into it. She is the first woman, and fifth in the series, to be killed by supporters of Pasupathy Pandian. Others who had fallen to retaliatory murders are Pura Madasamy, Muthupandi, Batcha alias Madasamy and Sami alias Arumugasamy.Pandian, founder-president of Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaipu, was hacked to death at his house on January 10, 2012. Police have arraigned a total of 18 people, including Subash Pannaiyar, as accused in the Pandian murder case. The trial is underway before a Special Court for SC/ST (POA) Act cases in Dindigul,On Wednesday morning, Nirmala Devi was walking towards her MNREGS work site from Valluvar Nagar, near Nanthavanapatti, when she was waylaid by the two men at David Nagar. After attacking her multiple times, they beheaded her, leaving the body in a pool of blood in front of a shop.Nirmala Devi’s body and head were taken to Dindigul medical college hospital for autopsy. Dindigul Range DIG B Vijayakumari and superintendent of police V R Srinivasan visited the scene of crime and conducted preliminary inquiries. Srinivasan told TOI that six special teams have been formed to nab the accused.Sources said that while fleeing on the bike after abandoning Nirmala Devi’s head, the assailants met with an accident about a kilometre away as they hit a pedestrian. An argument broke out and the duo abandoned their bike and fled the scene on bikes brought by their accomplices. The police said they traced the owner of the bike but he was unaware of his bike being used for the crime.This is the third beheading incident in the southern districts of the state in the last 10 days. Last Monday, K Sankarasubramanian, 37, was beheaded by a gang in Tirunelveli and his head abandoned near the grave of a dalit murdered in 2013. In retaliation, A Mariappan, 37, a dalit was murdred two days later and his head placed at the spot where Sankarasubramanian was killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/another-accused-in-pasupathy-pandian-murder-case-beheaded/articleshow/86438101.cms||M K Ananth
---||Lucknow||Zila and gram panchayats to operate farm machinery banks now: UP govt||Lucknow: Nearly a week after withdrawing 868 cases filed against farmers for stubble burning, the UP government has decided to give the responsibility of operating farm machinery banks for crop residue management to zila and gram panchayats. Stubble burning leaves plumes of smoke causing air pollution and endangers health of millions of people. The rural bodies will shoulder the responsibility in districts where cooperative, cane and industrial societies have expressed inability in purchasing the equipment. The agriculture department has issued the directions citing the recent Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders asking state government to ensure setting up of farm machinery banks in rural areas. Additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi told TOI that the measure would mainly help the marginal farmers who will be able to get farm equipments at a reasonable price. The move comes ahead of winters when air pollution in Delhi, NCR and neighbouring states like Punjab, Haryana and UP assumes grim proportions ostensibly due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP. In February, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to file an affidavit with details of steps taken to curb stubble burning. The SC was hearing a petition which said that the issue of air pollution because of stubble burning would again come to the fore in winters. Agriculture department officials said the state government has mandated setting up of farm machinery banks with funding up to Rs 5 lakh. Sources, however, said that some cooperative and cane societies expressed their inability to operate farm machinery banks, compelling the state government to rope in zila and gram panchayats for the task. The issue of air pollution due to rampant burning of crop residue has been bothering the state government for the past few years. In fact, the idea of setting up machinery bank was conceptualised by the UP government in August 2020 — provisioning a grant of 80% of the total amount required for setting up a farm equipment bank. In the case of individual farmers, the grant was restricted to 50%. Under the arrangement, a committee headed by the respective magistrate would select the cooperative /cane societies/gram panchayats which would inform the agricultural directorate about the requirements. The directorate would then transfer the grant of Rs 4 lakh to societies. The cases of stubble burning are largely registered in the west UP region. In 2019, the state government had constituted a cell in every district to keep an eye on stubble burning. The revenue department had also roped in gram pradhans and lekhpals to curb burning of crop residue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zila-and-gram-panchayats-to-operate-farm-machinery-banks-now-up-govt/articleshow/86440420.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Delhi||Punjab, Haryana, UP can use Pusa bio-decomposer solution too: Panel||New Delhi: Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Wednesday said Punjab and the states in the National Capital Region (NCR) had prepared detailed action plans to tackle stubble burning, with Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab likely to use the bio-decomposer solution developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa this winter. Delhi first used the solution last year.The commission said the detailed plans had been formulated based on a framework made by it for each state and directions had been issued for strict implementation of this plan. The bio-decomposer solution will be used over 6 lakh acres in Uttar Pradesh, 1 lakh acres in Haryana and 7,413 acres in Punjab, it added. Delhi will spray it over an area of 4,000 acres, the commission has been informed. Each state has also been asked to adopt a standard protocol developed by Indian Space Research Organisation to monitor farm fire counts this season.“The commission has directed the state governments of Punjab, NCR states and Delhi for implementation of the action plan, based on different components of the framework, which includes in situ and ex situ crop residue management, effective monitoring, and plans and schemes to reduce paddy generation,” CAQM said in a statement.For ex situ utilisation of crop residues, CAQM has issued directions to 11 thermal power plants within 300km of Delhi, asking them to look at utilising paddy straw pellets and briquettes for co-firing the plants.To tackle dust in NCR, road-owning agencies and civic bodies have been asked to use a dust control and management cell with activities such as mechanised sweeping of roads, scientific disposal of dust collected, use of dust suppressants and water on roads, proper maintenance, greening of non-paved roads and greening of central verges.The commission said that in regards to controlling air pollution from construction and demolition activities (C&D) activities, the states have been asked to enforce mitigating measures and carry out monitoring through a web portal.“Installation of anti-smog guns and screens at construction sites, dust suppressants and water mist, transportation of construction and demolition materials in covered vehicles, installation of air quality monitoring sensors in project sites, and self-audit and certification mechanism by the project agencies are the key steps towards management of dust from construction and demolition project activities,” CAQM said. Directions have also been issued to Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to prepare an action plan for industries to shift over to cleaner fuels, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/punjab-haryana-up-can-use-pusa-bio-decomposer-solution-too-panel/articleshow/86436358.cms||---

Kumar was adjudged fourth in achieving high yield and second in the volume of supplying canes to mills. He supplied 700 tonnes of canes to the mills in the last season, officials said. Kumar’s wife K Gayathri V Kanthavel and seven other farmers received the award from the mill authorities on Wednesday. Kumar, who is AIADMK’s Trichy rural south district secretary, is a native of Pudukottai district and is engaged in agriculture. The two-time Lok Sabha MP had raised sugarcane on his 10 acres of land at Punalkulam village in Pudukottai. “Unlike the traditional method of planting cutting seed cane, I sowed bud chip seedlings in my field. Moreover, I adopted drip irrigation for watering. These were the main reasons for my achievement,” Kumar told TOI. Normal yield per acre in sugarcane cultivation would come to about 40 to 50 tonnes. Moreover, adopting all modern techniques advocated by the agriculture officers was also a reason for his success, he added. Sugar mills chief executive S Selvasurabhi said four farmers had got higher yields than Kumar. However, in the case of canes supplied to the mill for crushing, the former MP came second, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/former-trichy-mp-makes-his-mark-in-sugarcane-cultivation-in-pudukottai/articleshow/86438133.cms||---

Speaking on the first day of the two-day training programme of the party’s district as well as block presidents of South Bihar, Tejashwi said the party workers will have to be mentally, physically and ideologically prepared to accomplish the daunting task. He said the support of the workers and functionaries was very important for any political organisation. He also assured the workers that their performance would be suitably rewarded by the party’s top leadership. Tejashwi claimed that the reservation system has already been put in place within the RJD to give due representation to all sections of the society. “The RJD is a party of all sections. It is not related to any particular caste, creed or religion,” he told the party functionaries. He called upon the workers to maintain discipline within the organisation. “If you maintain discipline and enjoy clean image, the party will automatically get benefited,” he said, adding that they should work to achieve their objective. The former deputy CM also discussed at length the political scenario in the country. “The country is passing through a critical phase. Those at the helm of affairs believe in divide and rule and also trying to spread hatred in the society,” he alleged without mentioning the BJP. RJD state president Jagadanand Singh said he would do whatever is needed to maintain the honour and dignity of the party. He talked about strengthening the support base of the organisation at booth, panchayat and the district levels. He exhorted the workers and functionaries to concentrate more on the agitational programmes chalked out by the top leadership of the party. “Such programmes should be made a grand success,” he asserted. Highlighting the importance of discipline not only for a human being but also for any political organisation, Singh said it is the only means to deal with the chaotic situation. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari, Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha, former ministers Shyam Rajak, Abdul Bari Siddiqui, Shiv Chandra Ram, Ashok Kumar Singh and former assembly Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/strengthen-base-to-get-clear-mandate-in-next-polls-tejashwi/articleshow/86406996.cms||Ramashankar
---||Delhi||Transport key factor, dust next in Delhi’s emission load||NEW DELHI: A research by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) has stated that the most dominating emission source of PM2.5 in Delhi is transportation (41%). The total PM2.5 yearly emission from all sources across megacities was calculated at 77 gigagrams for Delhi, 57 for Ahmedabad, 45 for Mumbai and 30 for Pune in 2019-20. Track the pollution level in your cityThe report, published in the international peer-reviewed Elsevier journal Environmental Modelling and Software, said all major traffic junctions had high PM2.5 emissions. The number of transport vehicles was rising rapidly in Delhi and Pune, leading to congestion. Some load was reduced after implementation of CNG, but the gain was offset by the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. “High population density due to urbanisation is the main reason directly or indirectly driving the PM2.5 emission in all four metropolises,” said SAFAR’s founder project director Gufran Beig. The analysis showed windblown dust contributed to 21% of PM2.5 in the capital, while the share of industries was 19%. Industrial emission was mainly from products and fuel used in the unit. The trend of high PM2.5 emission of 200-1,000 tonnes per year was present over eastern, central and parts of southeastern regions in Delhi, which included major roads networks and industrial zones. A large number of PM2.5 hotspots were seen in central and eastern parts of Delhi due to industries and rising demand of vehicles. However, the western and northern regions, being semi-urban zones, showed a comparatively lower value due to agricultural land cover and low population density. “Another major sector that contributed a significant amount of PM2.5 emissions was re-suspended windblown dust from paved and unpaved roads and construction activities. This is associated with vehicular movement and directly proportional to the number of vehicles, its weight and speed as well as the amount of dust on roads,” said the study. In Delhi, the share of other sources category, which included solid waste, trash burning, brick kiln, etc, was 11%. However, emission from power plants, mainly due to coal combustion, was at 5% and the contribution of biofuel was around 3%. The study also stated that SAFAR’s forecasting framework had “reasonably good accuracy and stability in predicting PM10 and PM2.5 levels in contrasting micro-environments of Indian megacities and captured the trend of the data”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transport-key-factor-dust-next-in-citys-emission-load/articleshow/86436393.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The state government’s technology academy-AP Information Technology Academy (APITA)-inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Dkode Global on Wednesday. The Dkode global will organise ‘DKODEing Andhra Pradesh,’ a hackathon event aimed at seeking feasible and technological remedies to solve some of the burning problems faced by various government departments in Andhra Pradesh. Students from various disciplines in state and many reputed institutions from across the country are expected to take part in this mega event along with startups and corporate entities. Speaking on the occasion, APITA CEO said innovation is the need of the hour and the government is keen to motivate the students to crack major challenges. “History is replete with examples of student innovation and student entrepreneurship. Many major tech companies including Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Dell, WordPress were started from college dormitories,” said Anil Kumar. He, however, said it was unfortunate that most of the present generation graduates were running for jobs while only a few think about entrepreneurship. APITA director said their partnership with Dkode would help the students think out of the box. He said chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is very particular about upscaling the skills of the students to make them employable much before they complete their graduation courses. Dkode Global, VC and MD Sree Sandeep said registrations for the hackathon would be open from November 10. He said the grand finale is scheduled on January, 27 and 28, 2022. Dkode Global CEO Michael Joshi was also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-dkode-global-ink-mou-to-tap-innovative-young-minds/articleshow/86436240.cms||Samdani MN
---||Trichy||40 terminated rly gatekeepers in Trichy seek reinstatement||Trichy: Around 40 gatekeepers who had been working at various level crossings in Trichy division on contract and were terminated in June have appealed to the railway authorities to reinstate them at the post. The gatekeepers, all ex-servicemen, were posted early last year as part of a nationwide recruitment following a severe shortage of staff. Around 70 vacancies were there in the Karaikudi-Tiruvarur section in Trichy division alone. At one time, a newly introduced passenger train in the Karaikudi-Tiruvarur section could not be operated due to this shortage. It was at this juncture that Trichy railway division authorities appointed around 40 ex-servicemen as gatekeepers on a contract basis in the division after imparting due training to them. Of these, around 15 were posted in Karaikudi – Tiruvarur section. “We got appointment in February 2020 and worked till May 2021. But all of a sudden we were asked to go home in June. As per the contract, we can continue work till 55 years of age. The tenure of the contract was one year and it was renewed every year. We shifted our family to the workplace from various places. Now, we don’t know what to do,” said Ramanathan, who worked at the Mudhalcherry railway gate near Pattukottai. N Jayaraman, president of Federation of Tiruvarur-Karaikudi Broad Gauge Line Rail Users Association, said, “These ex-servicemen had been working at manned railway gates including Karaikudi-Tiruvarur section. Termination of the contract gatekeepers will affect the routine operations of the rail traffic. So the authorities should reconsider it.” He pointed out that the passenger train on Karaikudi-Tiruvarur section is being operated with the help of mobile gatekeepers. Jayaraman accompanied the ex-servicemen to meet divisional railway manager Manish Agarwal on Wednesday. When contacted, Manish Agarwal told TOI that the policy of utilising ex-servicemen was permitted by railway ministry and discontinued after May. Hence their services could not be continued. “We have put forth our requests to the ministry for permitting them to continue their work. However, we have not yet received any communique in this regard,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/40-terminated-rly-gatekeepers-in-trichy-seek-reinstatement/articleshow/86438145.cms||---

Pointing out that a unique ID would be generated on the EMIS portal when a student joins a school, an official said the ID would migrate from one school to another as the student gets the transfer certificate from a school and joins another. N Geetha, district chief education officer, said, “The unique ID can be used to track the students and their school. If a student doesn’t join any school after getting the transfer certificate, his/her name will be added to the common pool on EMIS automatically. They are generally considered dropouts. But many would have joined polytechnic after Class X. Those who failed in Class X or IX would have joined some industrial training institutes as well.”While such details won’t be available on EMIS portal, she said, teachers were asked to check with their parents either over phone call or visiting them in person the real reason for being absent from schools. Many parents in rural areas, she said, had migrated from one place to another with their wards for occupational reasons. “Since there are no physical classes, they are waiting for schools to reopen to get their wards join the schools. We could identify such students and make them join the neighbourhood schools so that they could get textbooks and study at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2650-dropouts-brought-back-to-school-in-less-than-two-months/articleshow/86438164.cms||Sampath Kumar

Speaking on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Mahatma’s loin cloth revolution, which began in Madurai, here on Wednesday, she said Gandhian thoughts and ideologies are relevant even today.Recalling memories of her paternal and maternal grandfathers, Mahatma Gandhi and C Rajagopalachari, Tara Gandhi said, “I was very close to him before he was assassinated, when I was 14 years old. When Gandhi came to Madurai 100 years ago, it is the soul and spirit of people and farmers here that inspired him to start the loin cloth revolution. He changed his attire and became minimalistic. It is the dress of the farmer, a man of action. Gandhi was a karma yogi. His spiritual search was what influenced his actions,” she said. Tara Gandhi further said that the battle against injustice is still on even decades after independence. “‘Sarvodhay’ movement needs to be kept alive. All children, girls and boys need education,” she added. The 88-year-old had visited Meenakshi Amman Temple on Tuesday. Special programmes were organized at Gandhi Museum to commemorate the centenary.Earlier in the day, minister for commercial taxes and registration, P Moorthy, along with district collector S Aneesh Sekhar, corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan and Gandhians made a visit to 251, West Masi Street, the house where Gandhiji stayed as he began the loin cloth revolution. A special prayer was also held there and the bust of Gandhiji garlanded. Various competitions were held for children on “Mahatma Gandhi and the loin cloth revolution” and certificates and prizes awarded. Gandhi Museum vice-chairman M Manickam, director K R Nanda Rao and National Gandhi Museum director A Annamalai were also present.A plaque placed at Madurai railway junction in memory of Gandhiji’s first visit by train to Madurai, which was later developed into a “Gandhi Corner” with display of memorabilia, was also commemorated. Divisional railway manager Padmanabhan Ananth paid floral tributes to the photograph of Gandhiji.

---||Hyderabad||Pain-killer drug new substitute for ganja addicts||Hyderabad: A pain-killer drug has become an easy substitute for junkies addicted to ganja. A recent raid by Nalgonda police led to the arrest of a medical store owner. “The pain-killer is being sold without prescription and making it easy for people to get addicted to it,” said Nalgonda SP A V Ranganath, cautioning medical stores against selling the drug without a prescription. Explaining the dangers of the pain-killer addiction, the SP said that one person who tried to stop using it ended up at the Institute of Mental Health in Erragadda, Hyderabad. The pain-killer usage came to light recently when cops went to inspect an area after getting complaints about ganja addicts. When a police team led by One Town circle inspector Balagopal reached Kapuralagutta near Nalgonda town, they found strips of the pain-killer all around and a highly intoxicated man, identified as MD Ghouse. Ghouse told the police that he had switched to the pain-killer after failing to get ganja and named a medical store at Prakasam bazar. The medical shop owner D Janardhan was reportedly selling the prescription drug without asking for a doctor’s prescription. The SP said there were many more youngsters hooked to the pain-killer. The Nalgonda police had also seized 25 kg of ganja and arrested five men in Miryalaguda recently. Two of the arrested were from Kothapet and Hayathnagar in Hyderabad and they told cops that ganja was being sourced from two persons in East Godavari in Andhra Pradesh. Explaining the dangers of the pain-killer addiction, the SP said that one person who tried to stop using it ended up at the Institute of Mental Health in Erragadda, Hyderabad||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pain-killer-drug-new-substitute-for-ganja-addicts/articleshow/86438264.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Tourist cops to prowl beaches from Monday||PANAJI: A dedicated tourist police force has finally been put in place and is likely to start patrolling the state’s beach stretches from Monday, World Tourism Day. The team comprises about 100 policemen trained in soft skills. “The tourist police are likely to formally begin their duty in tourist belts from Monday,” an official told TOI. The tourism department had for long felt the need for such a force to man tourist areas to enable immediate rescue of tourists, to clamp down on any illegality and stop the vendor nuisance, among others. However, besides this force, more police personnel will also be required at beaches. Currently, IRB personnel are posted at beaches. Being few in number they are unable to effectively patrol when crowds build. On most days during the season, the Calangute beach is the most crowded and needs 24X7 patrolling. A tourism official said that they also want tourist police to report to them about beach shacks operators who put deck beds in excess of that permitted. “We know most put deck beds and umbrellas in excess of what is permitted. When every shack operator does that, the beach gets congested making it difficult for visitors to walk freely,” the officer said. He said that whenever they send a team following a complaint, shack operators ensure that the area is cleared and the excess deck beds removed before they arrive. Vendors, those offering massages, selling goods, and some even sell food items and beverages, and beggars are banned on beaches. Yet, a handful of them can be spotted at beaches as they manage to evade the police on patrol. “The vendors keep a close eye on the police and accordingly plan their entry. As police presence reduces in the evening, you will see vendors in big numbers at the time. At night, they have a field day,” a shack operator at Baga said. Besides, the officer said they expect tourist police to contain drinking on beaches, which is also a banned activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourist-cops-to-prowl-beaches-from-monday/articleshow/86438258.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Goa||Time runs out for Goa’s coal block plans||PANAJI: The Centre has all but terminated the allotment of the Dongri Tal-II coal block to Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) after the state government failed to develop the coal mine and pay the Rs 163.95 cr performance guarantee. The Union coal ministry had granted GIDC a “final” deadline of September 30 to appoint a mine developer and operator (MDO) and commence extraction of coal. Though GIDC did float a request for proposal for the mine, just one bid was received for the coal mine, which has a 21-year life and which GIDC values at Rs 1,544 crores. The single bid was rejected as it failed to meet the required norms, said officials. “We have time till September 30 to either get a bidder or pay the performance guarantee of Rs 163.95 crore. The matter has been put up for the board meeting on Friday. It is now for the board and the government to decide,” said an official. This would be the second time that Goa’s ambitious plan to mine and sell coal has hit a dead-end. Though the Dongri Tal-ll coal block was allocated to GIDC in September 2019, major milestones for the coal mine were missed as the state government dragged its feet in complying with norms laid down by the coal ministry, said sources. The Dongri-Tal II coal mine, at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, has a 2.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity, but the state’s attempts to exploit the coal mine have been thwarted by “political tussles”. Despite hiring a private consultant, the Goa government has not only failed to meet its deadline to select a mining contractor for its coal block in Madhya Pradesh; GIDC has yet to seek a further extension from the coal ministry, which usually takes a month to be granted. GIDC issued the tender to appoint a MDO for the coal mine in March, with the Centre’s deadline about to lapse. GIDC did organise a pre-bid meeting with potential coal mine developers, where 10 interested firms participated. The Dongri Tal –II coal block has been allotted by the Union ministry of coal for commercial mining to GIDC, and as per the terms of the allotment agreement, which was signed in October 2019, at least 25% of the coal extracted in a financial year has to be sold to the MSME sectors in Madhya Pradesh and balance to other buyers across India. The MDO will have to submit a performance guarantee of Rs 77.2 crore, along with an additional performance guarantee of Rs 163.9 crore, which is equivalent to the performance security that GIDC has to submit to the Union ministry of coal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/time-runs-out-for-goas-coal-block-plans/articleshow/86438300.cms||---

The cabinet approved the proposal to have a minimum of two to a maximum of four councillors for a ward. The system does not apply to the BMC. In December 2019, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government had moved an amendment to the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act and reversed the system, saying it caused conflicts between elected representatives of a ward, created confusion and affected development works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-multi-member-system-back-in-civic-bodies/articleshow/86441554.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ACB arrests four in Guntur for embezzling CMRF||VIJAYAWADA: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) sleuths unearthed major misappropriation of Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF) and arrested four persons including two secretariat employees in Velagapudi, Guntur, on Wednesday. The accused are CMRF office subordinate Ch Subramanyam, revenue section office subordinate Soka Ramesh, Subramanyam’s associate Ch Murali Krishna and Kondepudi Jagadish Dhanaraj. Officials discovered that Jagadish often introduced himself as personal assistant to East Godavari district MLAs, a claim which was found to be false. According to ACB’s preliminary investigation, irregularities occurred in the CMRF since 2014 when the accused allegedly submitted fake bills and applications to siphon off around Rs 1.81 crore. Officials said they have found 88 documents to be illegal and 35 claims worth Rs 61.6 lakh to be bogus. The entire scam came to light after CMRF officials noticed that a man identified as Lakshmaiah Yadav from Proddutur Town submitted fake medical bills under different names, back in 2016. A criminal case was registered against him at Simhadripuram police station in 2017. Taking note of this incident, a special officer to CM directed the CMRF staff to examine in detail the processed files available with CMRF since 2014 with a view to identifying and eliminating scope for corruption or malpractices. Based on the irregularities found, the CMRF officials lodged a complaint with the ACB on September 21 who immediately investigated the matter. “The investigation conducted so far has found that malpractices occurred since 2014 in the CMRF and funds approximately to the tune of Rs 60 lakh have been misappropriated. The exact amount is yet to be ascertained and the involvement of others is yet to be established,” ACB said in a statement. The accused were produced before the Vijayawada ACB court and sent to judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/acb-arrests-four-for-embezzling-cmrf/articleshow/86436415.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Kolkata||Bagjola, Kestopur canals rain misery on New Town, Salt Lake||Kolkata: The overflowing Bagjola canal, which has lost its capacity to flush out excess water, is resulting in severe waterlogging in areas along the water body. The canal, which runs along a 38km stretch, carries water from Kamarhati and Panihati areas off BT Road and moves along Baranagar and Dum Dum before entering Kestopur and Rajarhat and finally ending at Vidyadhari river after crossing Bantala. It is the primary drainage outlet for huge areas of New Town, Rajarhat, Sector V and parts of Salt Lake and South Dum Dum along with the entire area along BT Road. According to civic officials, the way Bagjola canal is overflowing this season is unprecedented. “The normal water level of the canal stays at 1.8m and it increases to a maximum of up to 2.5m after heavy rains. On Tuesday, the canal was flowing at a level of about 3.2m, the highest in recent times,” said an official. One of the reasons why the canal is overflowing and has lost its capacity to flush out excess water is the huge amount of silt deposition on the canal bed, which is obstructing the normal water flow. The last time the canal was properly dredged was about four to five years back, an official said. “Adding to the problem is the dumping of waste on the canal banks, which has made the water stagnant on the sides. This is leading to widespread waterlogging in adjacent areas,” he added. “Bagjola canal needs to be fully revived with thorough desiltation to increase its capacity. Short-term dredging won’t solve the problem. We have already discussed the matter with the irrigation department,” said South Dum Dum Municipality board of administrators chairperson Panchu Roy. Already, Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has come up with a blueprint to clean accumulated silt of Bagjola canal flowing on the New Town side and to increase the height of its banks. New drainage pumping stations are also being planned. The authorities will take up the plan with the irrigation department for implementation. Just like Bagjola canal, the main reason why waterlogging is happening in Salt Lake, apart from chocked drainage lines in some places, is the overflowing Kestopur canal, the main drainage outlet of the township. Here again, silt accumulation is affecting the water flow. “It has been noticed that often waste is being thrown into the canal. A plan with KMDA is being chalked out to fence off the canal side,” said Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. Irrigation department officials said a comprehensive revamp plan for Bagjola and Kestopur canals was being prepared, which will include thorough desilting and dredging after the monsoon, with special attention to lower Bagjola canal that takes stormwater from New Town and South Dum Dum areas. “Work is expected to be taken up from November. Besides, a plan has been approved by the Central Water Commission to upgrade the present 1,650 cusec discharge capacity pump house at Kulti outfall off Bagjola canal into a 4,000 cusec pump house. This will help discharge and flush off excess water even if some of the pumps do not work,” said an irrigation department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bagjola-kestopur-canals-rain-misery-on-new-town-salt-lake/articleshow/86436455.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Thane||Thane: Man asks ransom for boy he never ‘abducted’, convicted||THANE: The Thane sessions court here has convicted a 26-year-old a man for demanding ransom from the kin of a minor boy who went missing in 2015, but was not in his possession. In an order passed on Tuesday, district and sessions judge Shailendra Tambe found the accused Kalim Isshaq Ansari guilty of the offences punishable under section 387 of the IPC (whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts or attempts to put any person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to that person) and also slapped a fine of Rs 10,000. One other accused in the case, however, was acquitted. Additional public prosecutor Vinit A Kulkarni told the court that a Vartak Nagar teenager, then aged 15, went missing after which a kidnapping case was filed on March 27, 2015. His parents received a call on April 1, 2015, from the accused who demanded Rs 1 lakh for releasing the ‘abducted’ teenager and threatened to eliminate him if the demand was not met. The police then laid a trap and arrested two persons and detained one juvenile but did not find the boy since he was never abducted by them. The probe revealed that the accused had made similar calls to many kin of missing or kidnapped children, but the accused never let them hear the voice of the ‘kidnapped’ boys. A police official said that a writ petition was filed in the high court and the case of the Vartak Nagar boy was handed over to then ACP Bharat Shelke and his team. They traced the boy to Nerul on January 22, 2019, and reunited him with his parents. It was later learnt that the boy had himself left home to work with a caterer fearing he would fail in Class 9. He had actually passed but didn’t know about his results since he had fled before the results came out. The boy was traced after four years during which he ran errands for a caterer. While Ansari was convicted, the case of the juvenile accused is being dealt with by the juvenile court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-man-asks-ransom-for-boy-he-never-abducted-convicted/articleshow/86441557.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Jain wrote a letter to the state home minister, DGP and Vadodara police commissioner, claiming he is innocent. He even expressed readiness to undergo a narco analysis test. Jain, stated in the letter that the girl wasn’t working as a trainee in his firm. He said that five months ago she approached his firm through a friend and said that she wanted to undergo training. “I asked her to learn the work from the other staffers but our office closed down soon due to the second wave of Covid. The girl didn’t come to our office but she used to send me good morning messages on my mobile,” Jain wrote. He also said that he never helped the girl in getting the flat where she was staying on rent. Jain claimed that she was in a relationship with Alpesh Vadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi who is a notorious criminal. “The girl came to our office in August and said that she wanted to file her I-T returns as she was going to get Rs 15 crore from some property deal she was doing with Vadhwani,” he said in the letter. Jain said that her bank accounts have debit and credit entries of lakhs of rupees. She came to his firm on September 14 for filing the I-T returns and later left. He further claimed in the letter that the girl had called him early on September 15 morning and claimed that she was assaulted by Vadhwani. He asked her to call the police. “Later Vadhwani called me and threatened to get me booked in rape case. The girl too called me and said that she was being pressurised by Vadhwani to book me in a rape case. The photographs of me sitting beside the girl on the bed are fake,” Jain said in the letter. While the cops maintained that the second accused Raju Bhatt is an investor in Jain’s firm, Jain wrote in the letter he doesn’t even know who Bhatt is.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-ca-claims-he-is-framed-writes-to-dgp/articleshow/86434371.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fake currency racket accused pleads guilty, gets 7 years’ RI||Mumbai: A special NIA court has convicted and sentenced a 23-year-old Bandra (E) resident to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment after he pleaded guilty of being in possession of fake currency with face value of Rs 16,000. The accused, Shafahad Ansari, was arrested in 2018. Refusing to sentence him to the time already spent in pr-ison, the court said that accused involved in such crimes can be said to be involved in waging a financial war against the country virtually, therefore, it can’t lose sight of this fact while interpreting the legal provision. “Therefore, imposing sentence upon the accused for the period which he has already undergone in prison would amount to show him undue sympathy,” the court said on September 18. When Ansari expressed his intention to plead guilty, he was explained that the punishment may extend to life imprisonment. The accused iterated that he was ready to plead guilty. The court then pronounced him guilty. Ansari told the court that he was the only earning member of his family comprising his parents, three sisters and two brothers. He also submitted that since he was in jail, his family was suffering and sought leniency. “Considering the fact that there are allegations...that he was found in possession of eight counterfeit currency notes of Rs 2,000 denomination and that he has come forward to plead guilty, in my view considering the age of the applicant it would be just to impose a sentence of seven years...,” the court said. Last month another accused in the case, Abdul Kadir, had pleaded guilty after being brought from a jail in Bengaluru where he was lodged. Arrested in July 2019, Kadir was also sentenced to seven years’ RI. He told the court that he is suffering from paralysis. The NIA had accused Malda natives Kadir and his brother Sabir Ali, of procuring fake currency from absconding accused Karim Shaikh in Bangladesh. It was alleged that they had then given the fake notes to co-accused Samir Mandal for circulation. The case was originally registered at Bhiwandi under IPC sections relating to recovery of fake Indian currency with face value of Rs 4.5 lakh. The fake notes were allegedly recovered from the possession of Bandra (E) residents Ansari, Rehan Shaikh, Anees Shaikh, Kishor Fular and Rohit Singh. On December 4, 2018, the NIA took over the probe and arrested Kadir, Mandal, Sabir Rahaman and Mohammad Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-currency-racket-accused-pleads-guilty-gets-7-years-ri/articleshow/86441562.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Shilpi Ghosh, a resident of Action Area 2, has been writing on all social media groups in New Town to know if any electrician was available to repair the electric connection of the water pump in her building that developed a snag after remaining submerged in rain water for over 24 hours. Torrential rain on Sunday and Monday and subsequent waterlogging have forced residents of New Town, Salt Lake and those staying along VIP Road scramble for services of electricians, plumbers, drinking water suppliers, toto and cycle rickshaw owners and car mechanics. Most complexes and buildings in these pockets remained submerged till Wednesday evening. “Power was restored only on Wednesday afternoon, but we do not have access to clean water as the underground reservoir is contaminated. We had tried calling some people to clean it, but we were told to wait till later this week because we were on the waiting list as many people in the township suffering from the same problem have sought their services,” said Anustoop Bhattacharya, a resident of BF block in Action Area 1B. Complexes like Sukhobrishti, Elita Garden Vista and New Town Heights were submerged even till late on Wednesday. “None of the lifts are working so most residents are carrying the water cans through the stairs. We cannot take out our vehicles as there is knee-deep water still inside the complex,” said Mainak Kanrar, a resident of Sukhobrishti, the biggest housing complex in New Town. A middle-aged dialysis patient had to come down all the way from the 13th floor and again had to go all the way climbing up at Sukhobrishti in New Town with the help of neighbours as the lift has been kept shut due to waterlogging. The person will again have to go out for dialysis on Thursday. Also on Wednesday, another aged person staying in another block of the housing had to come down several floors for going to a hospital for dialysis as the lift was yet to be operational till afternoon. In areas adjacent to VIP Road, too, water had not receded till late in the evening on Wednesday. Residents had to venture through waterlogged streets and lanes to purchase vegetables, water and other edibles. “In many areas, the local markets did not open. We are wading through waterlogged streets to go to other areas to buy necessary things,” said Narayan Agarwal, a resident of Tegharia. “Our car was parked elsewhere for the last two days and we brought it back to our complex only on Wednesday,” said Jayati Ganguly Majumder, a resident of New Town AB Block. Both NKDA and NDITA issued an advisory to pump out the stored water of the underground water reservoirs in New Town and Sector V where the drain water might have entered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/services-hard-to-get-in-marooned-townships/articleshow/86436469.cms||Zeeshan Javed

However, they said Zhumabaeva was alive during their visit. They sat for around two hours and then left. We questioned the deceased woman’s husband, but his location was in the area where his friend lives. Even local inquiry supported his claims,” said an investigating officer.

Patil had sent a letter to Sena editorial Saamna, of which Raut is the Executive Editor, alleging that he and his wife had benefited from the PMC bank scam. Patil’s entire letter, which was a response to Sena’s editorial on Tuesday slamming him and the BJP, was printed in Saamna on Wednesday. “They had sent a letter to us (to Saamna newspaper) responding to our editorial where we mentioned about him and the BJP’s constant references to the Enforcement Directorate (ED). We have criticised them, so they have every right to respond to our criticism. We believe in the freedom of press and expression. They are not ornamental for Saamna and Sena. We have printed the entire letter with the exact dirty language,” said Raut. “In the letter, Patil said we have disproportionate assets… from the PMC bank and how there was ED action… We will file a legal notice for defamation. All these allegations are baseless. We don’t have properties like them. We are working, middle class people. We don’t do scams like these. People file defamation suits for Rs 100 crore or Rs 50 crore, but Patil is not worth that much money. Their worth is just Rs 1.25,” Raut said, adding that the leagl notice will be sent in four days.

Varanasi will be the first Indian city to use the ropeway services in the public transportation. These facts were revealed in the final presentation of over Rs 400 crore proposal of ropeway service given by the team of WAPCOS Limited- an accredited public sector enterprise under the Union ministry of Jal Shakti, government of India. The presentation was given before the officials in Varanasi on Tuesday evening. The final proposal will be submitted to the state government for approval on Thursday. Talking to TOI, on Wednesday, the divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said that final presentation on pilot phase of ropeway service by the WAPCOS took place on Tuesday evening and it is going to be submitted to the state government of Thursday for approval. After getting the government’s nod, he said, the bidding process for the project to be executed on public private partnership mode will be started. Providing details of the project, he said, “The ropeway service in 5 km area will start with 220 cable cars. Each cable car will have 10 seats. These cars will move in a gap of 90 seconds. As per the final alignment the main terminus will be at Cantt railway station while other stations will be at Sajan, Rathyatra and Girjaghar (Godowlia) crossings. A turning line will be created between Cantt railway station and Sajan crossing.” Four stations of ropeway services pilot phase will be at the height of above 11 meters, he said adding, that each station will be equipped with escalators. While finalizing the alignment of ropeway lines the agency tried its best to ensure that minimum buildings are coming under it, said commissioner adding, following finalization of alignment only 29 buildings are coming under it. Ropeway service is being chosen for public transport under Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS) in the densely populated old city area and pilot project of the proposed service has been finalised by the agencies concerned with an aim to launch it in coming November. According to officials, the WAPCOS was roped in for the introduction of ropeway in Kashi after the ministry of urban development signalled for go ahead in principle with this mode of transportation under MRTS. Ropeway was opted as one of the components of MRTS following the rejection of metro rail plan for the city in June 2018. In view of city’s ground realities, the Varanasi Development Authority had asked Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES) to prepare a proposal by incorporating different means of transportation that remain feasible for the city.

Ramesh, whose latest book, The Light of Asia — The Poem that Defined The Buddha, focuses on the eponymous poem by British poet-author Sir Edwin Arnold, said he wrote the book because the Buddha is a part of every Indian’s life, and since the poem appealed to him. “All Indians are enamoured and captivated by the Buddha’s life because he was not only a historical figure, but also a revolutionary and social leader…and Arnold’s book had an extraordinary impact on not just the West, but also Asia,” he added. In conversation with Rajiv Malhotra, a Indic studies scholar, Ramesh also said he regarded Arnold’s poem as a seminal text as it focused on humanity, not the divinity of the Buddha. “Even a scientist like C V Raman, in his Nobel acceptance speech, described Arnold’s poem as one that impacted him most profoundly,” he said. “It is a great tragedy of our life that we have adopted the symbols of the Buddha without necessarily adopting the principles and practices that he epitomised,” Ramesh said. “Our national symbol is Sarnath’s four lions. Our national flag has the dharma chakra. The symbols of the Buddha permeate the India nation state, but has the life of the Buddha made a substantial and significant difference to our notion of social equality, or our notions of brotherhood? Unfortunately, no.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/we-have-adopted-buddhas-symbols-not-his-principles/articleshow/86438402.cms||---
---||Kolkata||7 years after kidney transplant, Kolkata boy gets new liver||KOLKATA: A 13-year-old Kolkata boy underwent liver transplant surgery at a Chennai hospital, seven years after he had a kidney transplant. Sayak Chatterjee suffered from a rare disorder that led to growth of multiple cysts in his liver and kidney. The boy was transplanted a kidney when he was only six years old. However, recurrent infection along with jaundice worsened his condition, requiring frequent hospitalisation for liver care. His parents finally took him to Rela Hospital in Chennai where paediatric liver specialist Naresh Shanmugam diagnosed the condition as cirrhosis and portal hypertension (pressure in the vein inside the abdomen). Professor Mohamed Rela reviewed the boy and suggested a liver transplant. Even as parents consented for the transplant, none of them were found suitable to donate the organ. Sayak’s name was then enlisted for cadaver donation transplant. He had to wait for six months to get the organ. “This is a classic example for the power of organ donation. The boy’s initial recovery in the ICU was complex but later he recovered well,”said Rela. “After transplant the boy is doing well. He has been discharged 11 days after his transplant surgery,” said Shanmugam. Due to his condition Sayak mostly had to miss going to school. The doctors are hopeful of the boy’s return to classes once again as and when schools reopen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/7-yrs-after-kidney-transplant-city-boy-gets-new-liver/articleshow/86436493.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||TN may scrap Professional English course in colleges||Coimbatore: The Professional English course introduced last year for undergraduate first year students of non-autonomous arts and science colleges in the state is likely to be scrapped from the next academic year. The course was introduced to familiarize students with vocabulary related to their subjects and taught by subject teachers concerned. Initiated by former higher education secretary S Apoorva, it was introduced as an additional 1 hour per day add-on subject on par with core subjects. While it came into effect from the 2020-21 academic year, it drew flak as core subject teachers with no English literature background were asked to handle the subject. Further, it was also made mandatory for students to clear the paper to get their degrees. However, the move received good support from private colleges as they claimed it helped core subject teachers to have better interaction with students. But, Tamil, Mathematics and teachers of other subjects found it unfair to be asked to teach a professional English subject. “It was also a learning experience for core subject teachers to teach English who were oriented through a few workshops on handling the subject,” a staff from a private arts and science college in Coimbatore said. But there was poor response from students for the course. Professional English course was introduced with an objective of helping students of government arts colleges with rural background to become proficient in English speaking, reading and writing. Students from rural areas pass their degrees but most of them don’t have language proficiency to express themselves and lose out when it comes to better jobs, a senior official from the higher education department, who was part of the project, said. “Discussions on scrapping the Professional English course are on. It may not be part of the syllabus from next academic year. An official announcement is expected soon,” a senior official from the Tamil Nadu State Council for Higher Education (TANSCHE) said. Last year, Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi Siva took up the matter with the University Grants Commission (UGC), which had asked the state government to address the issue appropriately. Siva told TOI that making the subject mandatory for students to clear it to get their degrees was a bit harsh when offline classes were not possible due to the pandemic. “If the higher education department feels the subject is essential and it would make students proficient in English, let them introduce it after the pandemic. But non-English literature teachers being forced to handle a professional English paper will not fetch the desired result,” he said. Secretary of the Joint Action Council of College Teachers of Tamil Nadu M Krishnaraj said that the TANSCHE had assured the scrap the course. “English cannot be taught by other subject teachers and it would be ideal if it is handled by English teachers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tn-may-scrap-professional-english-course-in-colleges/articleshow/86438417.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||No official guilty, says North Delhi Municipal Corporation's report on building collapse that killed 2 kids||NEW DELHI: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s report on the collapse of a four-storey building in Sabzi Mandi on September 13 hasn’t found any official guilty of dereliction of duty. Two children were killed in the incident. Municipal corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel had ordered an inquiry in the matter and asked the committee to submit a report in a week’s time. On Wednesday, the commissioner told TOI that the building was neither dangerous nor was any illegal construction being undertaken there, according to the official survey. “In the survey conducted before monsoon, we didn’t find the building in a dangerous condition,” said Goel. “The corporation team usually considers the external condition of the building and in case they find it to be unsafe or in a dangerous condition, further action is taken. Also, we didn’t receive any complaints about illegal construction at the building. So in the given circumstances, municipal officials cannot be blamed for the collapse.” Goel added that they had recorded the statements of people in and around the collapse site. “There were allegations that a day before the incident, some construction had started in a shop on the ground floor. Since it was Sunday, our staff did not get an opportunity to find out if indeed anything of the sort was going on and our control room received no complaint regarding this,” Goel added. The local municipal councillor, Guddi Devi of Aam Aadmi Party, however, raised the issue of the number of buildings deemed dangerous in the area suddenly increasing from 9 to 38 in the survey conducted within two days of the incident. In the discussion in the House meeting on Wednesday, she insisted, “The building collapse was the result of negligence of the north corporation. The civic body should at least award some compensation to the grieving family that lost two children.” On being questioned how the municipal corporation staff were absolved of all blame in the existing circumstances and no one was held accountable, Standing Committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said that they would get the inquiry verified again. Congress councillor Mukesh Goel pointed out that similar incidents had taken place in other areas in the past but no action had been taken, giving a push to illegal construction and connivance in this of municipal officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-official-guilty-says-corpn-report-on-bldg-collapse-that-killed-2-kids/articleshow/86436487.cms||Vibha Sharma

Investigators scrutinised footage from at least 50 cameras to find out details of the route they took to escape. The trio was held from Bhandup where they lived. Anusuya GaikwadOn September 5, Rohini Akhade, 38, was commuting in a BEST bus from Ghatkopar to Kandivali. She was carrying her handbag on her shoulder. Later, she couldnt spot her 550 gm mangalsutra in her handbag and registered a police complaint. Cops viewed CCTV footage of the route taken by the bus and found camera grabs of three women getting off at Thakur Complex in Kandivali East. Their movements appeared suspicious. A trail of surveillance footage showed the women travelling in an autorickshaw. "We located the driver of this auto who said he had dropped the trio at Aarey Colony. It turns out the women had changed autos at Aarey. We looked up some more surveillance footage and found the registration number of the other auto too," said investigating officer Indrajit Patil. The driver took the cops to an area in Bhandup where he had dropped the three women. The trio, Anusuya Gaikwad, Marakka Gaikwad and Baby Gaikwad, were held on September 16. They told the police that they would target bus or train passengers. Two of the women would push the target while the third discreetly opened her handbag and stole valuables.

---||Mysuru||MCC leases out properties in prime locations to generate revenue||Mysuru: The city corporation has leased out its properties in prime locations in the city to generate revenue. The cash-strapped civic agency is now planning to increase its revenue by monetising two of its prime properties, which were previously used to run fuel stations, in the central business district (CBD) which has turned into illegal parking lots and home to street food stalls.The civic body is leasing its four properties located in prime locations for private agencies to run fuel stations from the past several years as per the decision by the MCC council and the approval of the state government, for a lease period of 30 years.While the private agencies still run their fuel stations started at the MCC properties on Sayyaji Rao Road, due to various technical reasons, the fuel station behind the MCC head office on New Sayyaji Rao Road near Mysuru Palace and at Ramaswamy Circle on Jhansi Lakshmi Bhai Road were closed several years back.As the MCC failed to utilise the properties, these spots became a place for parking vehicles and food stalls.Kuvempunagar M Block ward BJP corporator Sunanda Palanetra has been raising the issue for the past 15 years in the council to help the civic agency earn revenue from the properties in the heart of the city. Now, after becoming mayor, Palanetra has taken it on herself to find a solution to the properties which have been lying dormant for several years.“The building behind the MCC head office, which was earlier housing a fuel station, looks like a haunted building now. I had raised the issue for the first time in 2008-09 in the council, but no action was initiated till date. Even though there are a lot of problems regarding the properties, I have decided to find a solution and give the properties to private parties on lease to generate revenue to the corporation,” mayor Sunanda Palanetra told TOI. MCC council ruling party leader Shivakumar told TOI that they are also holding discussions on utilising both the properties for corporation.“We are planning to shift the corporation’s fuel station, which is currently situated inside the premises of the head office, to the available space behind the office building. This will avoid garbage collection trucks, tippers and auto rickshaws queuing inside the head office premises to fill fuel. Shifting of the fuel station will also provide more parking space,” he said.With regard to property at Ramaswamy Circle, Shivakumar said they plan to utilise the place to run MCC office to collect tax and provide trade license and other public services. “We will discuss and make a final decision soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mcc-leases-out-properties-in-prime-locations-to-generate-revenue/articleshow/86434262.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Pak national goes into hiding after U’khand HC quashes bail, orders his arrest||Nainital/ Roorkee: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday cancelled the bail bond of Asad Ali, a Pakistani national held from Haridwar and later convicted on charges of spying under relevant sections of the Official Secrets Act and the Foreigners Act. But before police could zero in on Ali, the 36-year-old fled his rented accommodation at Mahigran (Machhi Mohalla) in Roorkee, where he had been living with his wife and three children since 2012. On Wednesday morning, he told his family that he was going out to get a cooking gas cylinder, but did not return. “Our teams are on the lookout for Ali,” SP (rural) Pramendra Singh Dobal told TOI. The single-judge bench of Justice Ravindra Maithani held that the prosecution had proved “beyond any reasonable doubt” the charge under Section 3 of Official Secrets Act, Section 14 of the Foreigners Act, Section 12(1A)(a) of the Passports Act as well as forgery. Ali, who operated under at least four aliases, was caught by a team of the ATS during Kumbh Mela in 2010 while sending sensitive documents to the UAE. Following a tip-off, police zeroed in on Ali, a resident of Lahore. They revealed that he worked for the ISI, took pictures and made maps of the Army’s movement, which “posed a danger to national security”. During interrogation, police found that Ali had been sent to India by Major Amir Ali of the ISI and that after two months of training in Lahore, he was sent to gather information in India. “From Karachi, he was sent to Dhaka and Kathmandu. From there with the help of an agent Ash-ur-Rehman, alias Noor-Ul-Iltaf, he entered India. He went to Lucknow and met ISI agent Rehan in Meerut. Ali then visited Patiala Nabha Cantt to get information relating to military movement in Meerut, Roorkee, Dehradun and Bikaner,” the court noted in its judgement order. After the lower court in Haridwar convicted him in 2012, he appealed in July 2013 in the sessions court, which set aside the order of the lower court. The state government however moved the HC against the lower court’s order. Following which, the HC held that the sessions court had erred in law while acquitting Ali and therefore it set aside part of its order. “The accused’s bail bond is cancelled and sureties discharged. Let the accused be taken into custody to serve the sentence,” the court said in its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pak-national-goes-into-hiding-after-ukhand-hc-quashes-bail-orders-his-arrest/articleshow/86434270.cms||Prashant Jha

The accused has been sent to police custody. The businessman’s complaint to the cyber crime police (south region) states that he got a WhatsApp message from an unidentified number with the display picture of his friend and the friend’s wife. It said he needed Rs 5 lakh urgently for some work in India and it specified a bank account. The businessman sent Rs 5 lakh. Soon, another message, asking for Rs 5 lakh more. This too was remitted. When a third such message came in, the businessman checked with his friend who denied asking for any money. The businessman approached the police who started the probe with the bank account where money was transferred. The amount of Rs 10 lakh was sent to other accounts, all of which have been frozen. The accounts had Rs 8.13 lakh in them. —Mateen Hafeez||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-us-pal-holed-up-in-kandivli-cons-bizman-of-rs-10l/articleshow/86440804.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Mumbai||BMC likely to retender Rs 1,200-crore new road works||MUMBAI: The BMC is likely to retender the Rs 1,200-crore road works which additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu, who heads the roads department, had red-flagged last week after contractors bid as low as 30% below the actual cost. Officials have been told to initiate the retendering exercise departmentally and short tenders are likely to be invited so that the process could be completed in a month’s time. Multiple works may be clubbed together in the retender, said sources. However, the opposition pointed out that by doing so only major contractors would be able to place bids. TimesViewInviting fresh bids is fine, but it will not solve the age-old problem of powerful civic contractors manipulating the system in connivance with officials and elected representatives. Unless the nexus is broken, public money will continue to be frittered away in shoddily built roads.Last week, Velrasu, in an internal file note before the roads department, had said the rate analysis is unlikely to justify the possibility of doing proper quality of road works. The department was also asked to justify how the quality of road works would be maintained by bidders in case they are subcontracted and if any mechanism has been put in place to ensure the cement mixture used for the works is of good quality. In its reply, the roads department pointed that works are given to lowest bidder as per the central vigilance commission guidelines, and in case there are violations, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India raises queries during audits. In the quality control query, the department is likely to reply that surprise visits could be held and concrete testing taken up at municipal laboratories, when required. Samajwadi Party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh said the delay is acceptable if the quality of work is good. “If short tenders are called, the process can be completed faster. But it would be interesting to see what stringent conditions are put up by the BMC in case of new works.” Pointing out that the tender process had been on for months, standing committee member Asif Zakeria said: “The BMC waited till the last minute to flag off how contractors have bid below the estimates. Now too, a decision on whether or not to retender is taking time.” But corporator and BJP group leader Vinod Mishra alleged that BMC is delaying the process as it does not have funds to take up such large-scale works. “All funds have been diverted for the upgrade of specific areas, while issues, like road works, are being pushed back,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-likely-to-retender-rs-1-2k-cr-new-road-works/articleshow/86441609.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||CBSE to use blockchain tech to ensure certificates’ safety||NEW DELHI: To ensure that certificates of its students are secure online, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has created an academic blockchain document system. For now, the board exam results from 2019-21 have been made available. CBSE will push the certificates of previous years in a phased manner. This system will eliminate the dependency of an institute on a third party for verification of the certificates. It can be used by educational institutes for verification of the certificates at the time of admission for higher studies, and by companies while giving job offers. It can also be used for online counselling by the institutes, by integrating their systems with plug-in interfaces, the board said. “CBSE Academic (BlockChain) Documents (ABCD) has been established using blockchain technology to record the certificates in a linked chain structure. The result certificates are kept in a distributed manner at different locations involving multiple stakeholders, protecting them against any attempt of tampering,” said a statement issued by the board. The data is linked and stored with cryptographic security so that it is tamper-proof and traceable. This has been done in collaboration with Centre of Excellence for Blockchain Technology of National Informatics Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-to-use-blockchain-tech-to-ensure-certificates-safety/articleshow/86438464.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Over 3,000 extra admissions in govt schools in Dakshina Kannada||MANGALURU: There has been an unexpected windfall for government schools in the district, due to the pandemic. They have received over 3,000 extra admissions as on date. The admission process, that is still on, will close by the end of October. Officials from the department of public instruction say that every year they have a target for admissions. “However, this year admissions have gone up more than expected. We had targeted 98,532 and 46,229 admissions for government and aided schools in the district for this academic year, respectively. To our surprise, we have witnessed an increase of 2% to 3% in admissions in government schools,” said Malleswamy, DDPI, Dakshina Kannada. The district is one among top performing districts in the state, when it comes to admissions. Malleswamy said every year the target numbers for the district are reduced by about 600 to 700 for class I. This time the government as well as aided schools, irrespective of grades, have received more admissions. The major reason for students migrating to government schools, is that the fee issue at unaided or private schools never got sorted out. “This has forced several parents to cancel admissions at private schools, and admit their children to state-run schools,” said Malleswamy, adding that the final numbers for admission in the district will be known only after the end of October. The block education officials point out that the highest number of students were admitted at Kannada-English bilingual medium schools. This year the district has added 32 new bilingual medium schools, and the numbers have increased to 82 schools. Another official said that many parents, who earlier sent their wards to far-off private schools, have now enrolled them in nearby government schools. It is the same with those who stayed in residential schools. “The parents have strongly felt that their ward did not get enough learning from online classes. Meanwhile, parents also found an improvement in quality in education at government schools, especially bilingual medium schools,” an official said. A few private schools admit that some students have been issued with transfer certificates. “When we don’t give them TC owing to pending school fees, they directly approach the jurisdictional BEOs and take it,” said the owner of a private school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/over-3k-extra-admissions-in-govt-schools-in-dk/articleshow/86434293.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

On September 8, Ganesh (20), a resident of Ayyakere Haadi in Hanagodu Hobli from Hunsur taluk was killed by the tiger when he went to attend nature’s call. The haadi is close to Mudddanahalli forest area coming under Anechokuru of Hunsur wildlife division of the tiger reserve. After Ganesh’s death, the forest department and special tiger protection force (STPF) took up combing operation to trace and capture the tiger. They laid camera traps and installed trap cages at two places. Nagarahole Tiger Reserve director D Mahesh Kumar said that on September 9, they verified camera traps and found that the camera traps at Baale Katte and another one near a cage had captured the movement of the tiger. But after that the cameras had not captured any tiger movement in the location. To trace the tiger, the department had launched the combing operation using camp elephants – Ganesh, Balarama, Arjuna and Mahendra – along with mahouts and kavadis, around 20 forest watchers and forest guards and 15 men from STPF. Mahesh said that on September 17, during combing operation at Kachuvinahalli forest near Kallakere, they found the carcass of a tiger. They took photos captured by the camera traps and sent them to the Tiger Cell in Bengaluru for verification. “We received the report from the cell which confirmed the tiger which had killed the tribal resembles the tiger which was found dead at Kachuvinahalli based on the stripes on its body and other details. It is the same tiger which killed the tribal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/tiger-found-dead-had-killed-tribal-forest-dept/articleshow/86434294.cms||---

The miscreants warned of a bomb explosion between 12 noon and 1pm. Police rushed to the spot with a dog squad and scanned the building. Later it was confirmed that it was a hoax call, police said. High drama unfolded after a letter warning of a bomb explosion at the office of the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes between 12pm and 1pm was dropped near the office on Dewan’s Road. Immediately locals alerted Devaraja police, who carried out an inspection after sending all the staff out of the office. The inspection started around 11.45am. After nearly two hours of the inspection, it was confirmed that it was a hoax bomb threat. Commercial taxes department joint director Manjunath said, “Around 11.30am, we were informed about this letter by a police constable. The details of the office mentioned in the letter were correct. Around 80 staff and officers were working in the office. A few of us stopped a meeting in half and came out to enable inspection.” As the road was blocked, general public faced some inconvenience. Checking CCTV footage No explosive materials were found at the office. We suspect that it is a hoax threat. We are reviewing CCTV footage of the location where the letter was found.

---||Dehradun||Radio-collaring of 'research bear' goes awry, foresters shoot it dead in 'self defence'||Dehradun: An Asiatic black bear that was pursued for months by foresters to be radio-collared -- in an attempt to gain important insights that would help understand and resolve bear-human conflict in Uttarakhand -- had to be shot dead at Joshimath on Tuesday midnight in a dramatic turn of events. Foresters involved in the operation said they had to take the extreme step after the bear “charged" at the team of officials. JS Suhag, the chief wildlife warden, said that a team had been deployed to radio-collar a bear for the first time in Uttarakhand last week. The group, of about 15 doctors and forest officials, had been camping in the Joshimath forest range. On Tuesday night, around 8.30pm, forest officials got information that the seven-year-old female bear had been spotted — it was grazing on a farm near Singhdwar by villagers. The plan was to trap it, take it to the rescue centre at Haridwar and radio-collar it. “After the first two darts, the team thought it had been tranquilised. But it hadn’t. A third dart was shot. The team moved forward with the net in their hands to trap the bear. It was around 12.30am,” said Nanda Ballabh Sharma, DFO of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in Chamoli. “But the bear charged at them. In self-defence, the bear had to be shot dead.” Sharma added: “Five people were attacked by bears in just a month and a half in the area. Bear-human conflict has been on a rise in Chamoli. There were 18 injuries reported last year and five so far this year.” According to data accessed by TOI, 24 people in the state have been injured in bear attacks this year. In the last two decades, 59 people have died in bear-human conflict. Last year, three were killed and 82 injured in bear attacks. The Asiatic black bear is a vulnerable species with a declining population, according to the IUCN. “Collaring is of immense help in studying the movement of and behavioural changes among animals. In the long run, it helps reduce wildlife-human conflict,” said Wildlife Institute of India senior scientist Dr S Sathyakumar, who had worked on a bear radio-collaring project in Kashmir between 2008 and 2011. “Trapping the bear is the important part. The entire process of radio-collaring takes about two to three hours. The bear, after being trapped and tranquilised, is chemically immobilised and radio-collared. When revived, which takes little time, it is released back into the wild,” Sathyakumar said. He added that a similar exercise in Sikkim had failed. “The landscape matters a lot. Capturing bears had proven to be difficult.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/radio-collaring-of-research-bear-goes-awry-foresters-shoot-it-dead-in-self-defence/articleshow/86434307.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||Government panel to identify oxygen deaths, give compensation to kin, says Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre, alleging that it had given “factually incorrect statements” even in the Parliament regarding the number of deaths caused by the lack of medical oxygen during April and May when the second wave of Covid-19 cases swept through the national capital. Jain said in a press briefing that the Delhi government welcomed the Delhi high court’s verdict on an oxygen audit committee. On Tuesday, the high court had cleared the decks for a high-powered committee set up by the Aam Aadmi Party government to look into deaths caused by alleged shortage of medical oxygen. While dealing with a plea to operationalise the committee, the court had said that it saw no difficulty in such a probe. Welcoming the verdict, Jain said that this paved the way for the Delhi government to bring justice to the victims who lost their lives due to lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19. “The Delhi government had formed an oxygen audit committee to find out the deaths due to oxygen and to compensate the victims, which was suspended by the central government through the lieutenant governor of Delhi,” Jain said. “The high court has also said that this committee of the Delhi government is absolutely justified and there is nothing wrong with it,” he stated. Jain said that following the decision of the high court, the Delhi government would now be able to form an oxygen audit committee to investigate the deaths due to lack of oxygen and give compensation to the victims. “Anyone can apply to this oxygen audit committee of the Delhi government. The government will scrutinise these applications and give compensation of up to Rs five lakh to the victims,” he said. The minister alleged that while there were many media reports about deaths due to lack of oxygen, the central government wanted to hide these deaths. “This act during a tragedy is wrong,” he said. “The central government has given factually incorrect statements regarding the number of deaths due to the lack of oxygen. According to the central government, there were no deaths because of the lack of availability of oxygen in the whole country. They even gave this statement in Parliament,” he said. Delhi had recorded more than 13,000 Covid-19 fatalities during the months of April and May this year. In June, the Delhi government had formed a four-member medical expert panel to inspect the issue of deaths due to oxygen crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-panel-to-identify-o2-deaths-give-compensation-to-kin-jain/articleshow/86438547.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Devendra Fadnavis govt was dark era for women, says Congress||MUMBAI: A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s strongly worded reply to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on atrocities against women, Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Wednesday alleged that the Devendra Fadnavis regime from 2014-19 was a dark era for women. On Tuesday, Koshyari had asked the CM to convene a special session of state legislature to discuss the law and order situation, particularly atrocities against women. Quoting from a recent report of the National Crime Records Bureau, Sawant said it had been clearly established that atrocities against women were on the rise in BJP-ruled states. “It is not my information, it has come from the ministry of home affairs, it is available on the website of the home department,’’ Sawant said. He alleged that Maharashtra has achieved the dubious distinction of leading the states in atrocities against women. From 35,497 cases in 2018, the cases increased to 37,144 in 2019, while during the MVA government, the cases decreased to 31,954 in 2020. “We support the demand made by Thackeray for a special session of Parliament to discuss the law and order situation in BJP-ruled states. The BJP, too, should support the CM’s proposal,’’ Sawant said. Responding to a memorandum submitted by a BJP delegation, Koshyari had asked the chief minister to hold a special two-session of the legislature, evoking a sharp reaction from the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-govt-was-dark-era-for-women-says-congress/articleshow/86441613.cms||---

He has replaced Naunihal Singh, who served on the post for only 32 days. The new CP said crime prevention and detection, grievance redressal and transparency would be his priorities. While interacting with the media, he said the SHOs would be held responsible if some other agency managed to recover drugs from their jurisdictions. Bhullar was given a guard of honour at the CP office. Naunihal Singh had already left before his arrival. No senior official was present to receive Bhullar during the guard of honor, as a meeting of all officials was called minutes after his joining.Bhullar said, “Sincere efforts will be made for prevention and detection of crime in the city. Redressal of people’s grievances will be a priority. I have learned that there is a lot of pendency of cases, which we will dispose of at the earliest. Traffic is also a major concern. I have asked the traffic officials to be on roads as they don’t have any work in offices. Other cops, too, have been issued the same directions. Only those who need to be in office will be there and the rest will be in the field. Police presence will be visible in the city.”About the drug menace, he said, “It is the responsibility of the SHOs to recover drugs and stop the menace. They will be held responsible if other agencies manage to recover drugs from their jurisdictions.”He added that adequate focus would be on good, responsive and transparent policing, for which feedback would be taken from the public. “There will be a special strategy to curb snatching cases. I believe police should be friendly with the public and harsh with the criminals,” he said. ‘I will be available for public’Bhullar said he would remain present in the office to meet the complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/crime-prevention-grievance-redressal-top-cops-priorities/articleshow/86434309.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Anand Giri, Adya Prasad Tiwari sent to 14-day judicial remand||PRAYAGRAJ: Anand Giri and Adya Prasad Tiwari, accused of abetting the suicide of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Mahant Narendra Giri, were sent to 14-day judicial remand by the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court here on Wednesday. They were later sent to the Naini central jail. Body of Narendra Giri was found hanging from the ceiling of his room in Shri Math Baghambari Gaddi under the limits of Georgetown police station here on Monday evening. The mahant had charged Anand Giri, besides, two others including priest of Bade Hanuman temple Adya Prasad Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari, of mental harassment in his suicide note. Sandeep Tiwari was arrested late Wednesday evening. The police had then lodged an FIR under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of IPC against Anand Giri with the Georgetown police station on the complaint of an employee of the math, Amar Giri Pawan Maharaj, on Monday night. A police team on Wednesday produced both the accused — Anand Giri and Adya Tiwari — before the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Harendra Nath amid tight security. The CJM remanded both of them to judicial custody for 14-days and they were sent to jail. Before producing the accused in the CJM court, the police also got their medical examination conducted at a government hospital. Earlier on Tuesday afternoon, a team of UP police had brought Anand Giri to the Reserve police line in Prayagraj from Haridwar. Later, Anand Giri, priest Adya Prasad Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari were taken into custody for quizzing. A team of senior police officials had quizzed Anand Giri, Adya and Sandeep for hours. Meanwhile, a five-member panel of doctors on Wednesday morning conducted the post- mortem of Narendra Giri at SRN hospital amid tight security. The police had barricaded the street leading to the postmortem house. The videography of autopsy was also conducted. Through senior police authorities remained tight-lipped, highly placed sources told TOI that asphyxiation due to hanging was found to be the cause of death of the mahant. A 18-member special investigation team (SIT) was set up to probe the death and it had also started collecting evidence. Meanwhile, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya told reporters here on Wednesday that “detailed investigations are underway into the death of ABAP chief Narendra Giri and the guilty will not be spared”. “All the aspects of the case are under investigation and police are moving in the right direction,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/anand-giri-adya-tiwari-sentto-14-day-judicial-remand/articleshow/86436649.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Seer Mahant Narendra Giri’s suicide note fake, says Niranjani Akhara's head||PRAYAGRAJ: Rejecting the suicide note of Mahant Narendra Giri after terming it as fake, Acharya Maha Mandaleshwar (supreme head) of Shri Panchayti Akhara Niranjani, Acharya Kailashanand Giri on Wednesday said that “it is not a suicide note but a conspiracy note”. Talking to TOI at Bagambari Gaddi Math, Kailashanand Giri dismissed the purported suicide note allegedly written by Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president and secretary of Niranjani Akhara Mahant Narendra Giri. “This is not a letter written by maharaj (Mahant Narendra Giri) as he never used to pen anything so elaborate... he only used to put his signature while dictating the content of the letter to someone else. I have closely read the letter many times and it contains some words that seem to have been written by someone else having a good command over the Hindi language. Also, a character — ‘/’ — is used with some words in the letter which Maharaj didn’t even know how and when to use”. “I have been very close to him during his lifetime and knew him well. This letter is fake and part of a larger conspiracy to cover his murder which has been committed over greed of land,” he claimed. Kailashanand Giri said, “Mahant Narendra Giri could never commit suicide as he was a roaring saint, who took a tough stand against fake godmen in the country and stood up to the repercussions.” If he was under any pressure or needed money or there was any other issue, he would have shared it with me and with Ravindra Puri, the secretary of Niranjani akhara," added Kailashanad.” “I have full faith in our Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who would probe the matter with full transparency. Names of several big-shots would be exposed,” he said, adding, “Once the guilty are found, they should be punished in a way that sets an example for the future.” On being asked if Balbeer Giri would be declared as the successor of Narendra Giri, Kailashanand Giri said, “He is my disciple and the mahant of the Akhara. The Akhara would soon hold a meeting and decide the issue as to who would succeed Narendra Giri.” On Anand Giri’s role in the conspiracy, he said, “This is for the SIT and police to probe, look into the call details, etc., and come out with the truth. However, I question the facts why Maharaj ji (Narendra Giri) did not choose his own room to take the extreme step, why was the door of the room where the body was found forcefully opened, why no one videographed the entire process of breaking the door and brining the body down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/niranjani-akhara-supreme-head-terms-suicide-note-as-fake/articleshow/86436652.cms||Rajeev Mani

He also said that Delhi government’s “10 Hafte 10 Din 10 Minute” campaign is effectively aiding in prevention of dengue in the national capital. “The number of dengue cases recorded up till now is the lowest in comparison to the previous years,” Jain said in a press briefing. He said that while a total number of 87 cases of dengue were reported in Delhi in September, 2021 till this Sunday, the number of cases in September, 2020 was 188, 190 in 2019 and 374 in 2018. The number of cases in the previous years was much higher, with September, 2017 recording 1,103 cases, 1,362 in 2016 and 6,775 in September 2015. “Delhi government has been taking preventive measures to keep the spread of dengue under control, especially the launch of the ‘10 Hafte 10 Din 10 Minute’ campaign to spread awareness about dengue has been successful for the past two years,” Jain said. “Delhiites have been cooperative to not leave stagnant water around residential areas unattended for the mosquitoes to breed,” he said. Jain said that the life cycle of a dengue mosquito is about 10 days and people should check for any stagnant water around their homes once a week for 10 minutes. “All that has to be done is empty the vessels, flower vases, and containers containing stagnant water so that they don't become breeding grounds for the dengue-causing mosquitoes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sept-dengue-cases-lowest-in-6-yrs-govt-keeping-guard-up/articleshow/86438725.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Silverline yet to clear central hurdles||Thiruvananthapuram: While government is going ahead with Sabarimala airport project, another priority infrastructure project, the semi high-speed rail, is yet to overcome two barriers — clearance from the railway ministry before which the detailed project report is pending, and the department of economic affairs under the ministry of finance, where the application for external funding is pending. According to top government sources, the railway board is yet to give clearance for the project as Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had sought a detailed presentation about the project. However, he is yet to allot time for the presentation. While the DPR is yet to be cleared by the railway ministry, the funding for the Rs 62,941crore project is yet to take shape as the proposal for external funding is pending before the department of economic affairs, which needs to clear it. The state government submitted a proposal for availing foreign funds of Rs 33,700 crore for the project. The state’s proposal to the DEA said that the state is looking for funds from JICA, ADB, AIIB and KfW. However, DEA’s screening committee to clear the project decided to defer the proposal. DEA sought an undertaking from the state government that in case the special purpose vehicle (SPV) fails in debt servicing, the liability will be borne by the state government, without any budgetary support from the railway ministry. Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), the nodal agency for executing the project, is a joint venture company between the state government and the ministry of railways. However, the state government has not taken a decision in this regard and the file is currently pending with the state finance department. Meanwhile, the state government has given clearance to proceed with the preparatory works for land acquisition for the project. Orders for formation of land acquisition units have been issued, and the social impact assessment (SIA) study will be entrusted to accredited agencies after the agencies submit their proposals through the concerned district collectors. Besides funds being sought from the funding agencies, Rs 2,100 crore is being granted through KIIFB and Rs 300 crore from the government for land acquisition. KRDCL’s proposal for sanctioning Rs 2,400 crore is pending with KIIFB and the finance department. Meanwhile, a loan from HUDCO with government guarantee is also awaited and negotiations are ongoing regarding loan interest, which was originally offered at 8%. The 529.45km long semi-high speed rail corridor project, titled Silverline corridor connecting Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod requires 3,418 acre that include both railway and private land. Of the estimated project cost, Rs 11,535 crore has been estimated for overall compensation, of which Rs 975 crore would be for taking over railway land, Rs 6,100 crore for acquiring private land, and Rs 4,460 crore to pay compensation to structures that suffer damage. In addition, Rs 1,730 crore will be spent on rehabilitation and resettlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/silverline-yet-to-clear-central-hurdles/articleshow/86436698.cms||KP Saikiran

Our priority is to engage government schools and colleges for this. If it does not work out with government institutions, we will approach the private centres,” said joint commissioner of police (city & traffic) Deepak Pareek.After a meeting between former commissioner of police Naunihal Singh and the officials of municipal corporation (MC) and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada), at least 10 temporary parking sites were finalized in the city. However, besides these, more parking space is required near markets. Pareek said, “Traffic chaos is one of the biggest problems of Ludhiana. Now when the festival season is round the corner, residents will go out and visit markets. To avoid traffic congestion, some steps are being taken.”No parking space in and around some markets is a major concern. “A few markets, like Ghumar Mandi, have no designated parking space and so, people avoid visiting them and it leads to loss of business, too. So, we are approaching schools and colleges in these areas to use their space for parking vehicles in after hours. People can park their vehicles in these schools and colleges and from there, hire cycle-rickshaws or autorickshaws to go to the market,” he added.Temporary parking arrangements are already being made at vacant Glada land. Work has started at some sites like vacant land opposite mini secretariat and Old Session Court Chowk. “All these sites will be paid parking lots,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/school-college-spaces-may-be-used-for-parking/articleshow/86434340.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Kochi||Kochi: Private hospitals on a slow path to recovery||KOCHI: Even as the pressure on the healthcare sector and healthcare workers increased manifold since the Covid-19 outbreak, private hospitals that provide most health services in the city, have been seeing a decline in income due to the fall in non-Covid businesses, including nonemergency medical care and elective surgeries. Now, with the government bringing in relaxations in Covid-19 curbs and 90% eligible population vaccinated with the first dose, slowly normalcy is returning in the city hospitals, with most now admitting patients just like it was during pre-pandemic times. Hospital managements said patient inflow to the hospitals is now almost like pre-Covid times. A majority of big hospitals stated that patient inflow had dropped by 50% during the first and second phase of the pandemic and that now, they are seeing only about 10%-20% decline in the footfall of patients. “Since almost a month, there has been a steady increase in non-Covid patients coming to the hospitals. Many of the specialties that were affected in the initial phase of Covid is now seeing an increase in patient inflow,” said Ernakulam Medical Centre medical director Dr T V Ravi. Despite a flood of Covid-19 patients in the private hospitals during the second wave, a majority of Covid warriors— doctors — suffered salary cuts. However, now hospitals have restored their salaries, with some even giving bonus during the festive season. But there were no increments. As the second wave peaked in May, non-Covid patient inflow dropped by 75% in some hospitals and elective surgeries had to be stopped completely. However, now hospitals have started surgeries and procedures. “Health issues amongst people is increasing. Several health problems that people had initially ignored can no more be avoided and therefore they are rushing to hospitals even for routine check-ups,” said Lisie Hospital director Fr Paul Karedan. But health authorities are concerned over the people’s careless behaviour. “Everything is back to normal. But with heavy rush to hospitals, it is sometimes difficult to ensure that people don’t violate Covid protocols. Wearing face mask properly, sanitization and social distancing remain key,” said Dr Sunny P Orathel, medical superintendent of Rajagiri Hospital To counter crowding in hospitals, many private hospital managements have launched home care packages for the sick and elderly. Not just medical workers, even oxygen cylinders and intravenous equipment will be provided at their homes. However, one specialty that continues to see very few patients is paediatrics, with a marked reduction in patient inflow. Medical education too have gained momentum with a majority of students getting back on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/private-hospitals-on-a-slow-path-to-recovery/articleshow/86436702.cms||Preetu Nair

The police authorities concerned have taken the initial steps in this regard after a large number of tourists turned up at Ponmudi, causing traffic snarls along the hill station road. There were even several accidents reported on the road from Vithura to Ponmudi, which has as many as 22 hairpin curves, owing to heavy vehicular traffic and strong rain. Additional Superintendent of Police Raj Prasad, who is in charge of Nedumangad police subdivision, said he is in talks with the divisional forest officer of the district in this regard. ''The idea is to use the online booking platform during weekends and public holidays when the influx of tourists is greater,” the ASP said. He added that he was in talks with the DFO and working out on various options to introduce a viable system. The ASP also said the online booking platform was just one of the options being explored. “Already, we have decided to introduce a new ticket counter for the tourists at Anappara forest checkpost,” he said. Currently, the tickets are issued at the Golden Valley check post. Introducing a new ticket counter will help to reduce overcrowding and consequent loss of time. Vithura station house officer inspector S S Sreejith said the tourists who lose considerable time waiting at the ticket counter at Golden Valley tend to over speed to reach the hill top as they are only allowed to spend two hours on the hill top. Having two ticket counters will help prevent crowding and save time, he said. The inspector also said they will be conducting vehicle inspections along the route as a deterrent to over speeding. The police have identified five checkpoints along the 14 km stretch from Vithura to Ponmudi upper sanctuary and checking will be conducted during weekends. “There were as many as nine accidents that occurred on the Ponmudi road on Sunday alone,” the inspector said. The police have also decided to deploy men at vulnerable spots of Kallar river here following recent deaths of tourists here owing to drowning. People have been thronging Ponmudi recently as the hilltop remains covered in mist most of the time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plans-afoot-to-introduce-online-booking-at-ponmudi/articleshow/86407640.cms||---

The assailants took the severed head to Pandian’s house at Nanthavanapatti village located 500 metres from the murder spot and placed it below his poster. Nirmala Devi had allegedly provided protection to the assailants of Pasupathy Pandian. The beheading of Nirmala Devi, first woman and fifth victim to be killed by the supporters of Pasupathy Pandian, follows several macabre deaths of a bloody trail. Others who had fallen to retaliatory murders are Pura Madasamy, Muthupandi, Batcha alias Madasamy, and Sami alias Arumugasamy. Pandian, founder-president of Devendrakula Vellalar Kootamaipu, was hacked to death at his house on January 10, 2012. 6 spl teams formed to nab accused: PolicePolice arragned 18 people, including Subash Pannaiyar, as accused in the murder case. The trial is under way before a Special Court for SC/ST (POA) Act cases in Dindigul, On Wednesday morning, Nirmala Devi was walking towards her MNREGS work site from Valluvar Nagar, near Nanthavanapatti, when she was waylaid by the two men at David Nagar. After attacking her multiple times, they beheaded her, leaving the body in a pool of blood in front of a shop. Nirmala Devi’s body and head were taken to Dindigul medical college hospital for autopsy. Dindigul Range DIG B Vijayakumari and superintendent of police V R Srinivasan visited the scene of crime and conducted inquiries. Srinivasan told TOI that six special teams have been formed to nab the accused. Sources said that while fleeing on the bike after abandoning Nirmala Devi’s head, the assailants met with an accident about a km away as they hit a pedestrian. An argument broke out and the duo abandoned their bike and fled the scene on other bikes brought by their accomplices. The police said they traced the owner of the bike but he was unaware of his bike being used for the crime. This is the third beheading incident in the southern districts in the last 10 days. Last Monday, K Sankarasubramanian, 37, was beheaded by a gang in Tirunelveli and his head was abandoned near the grave of a dalit murdered in 2013. In retaliation, A Mariappan, 37, a dalit, was murdred two days later and his head was placed at the spot where Sankarasubramanian was killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/woman-accused-in-dalit-leader-murder-beheaded-by-gang/articleshow/86438632.cms||M K Ananth
---||Kochi||Kerala: SSLC certificates pending as Plus One admissions begin today||KOCHI: Even though Plus One admissions via single-window system starts on Thursday, the delay in issuing SSLC certificates to students who passed Class X makes the admission process complex, said teachers. They said that SSLC certificate is the authentic document that states all necessary details regarding the student, including age, marks, caste, religion, domicile, reservation eligibility, DOB, civic body, taluk, district, etc, which need to be verified during admission. Students who submitted applications using copies of the SSLC mark list downloaded from the results portal, are supposed to submit the original SSLC certificate at the time of admission to respective schools. Even though the certificates of Plus Two exams, of which results were announced much later than SSLC, were issued to the students, the government is yet to issue the SSLC certificates. Anil M George, state general secretary of Departmental Higher Secondary School Teachers Association (HSSTA), said that the admission process will have to be conducted based on the copies of marklists downloaded from the results web portal but these copies would neither be authentic nor tamperproof. HSSTA asked the government to issue the certificates at the earliest. “Though SSLC results were announced on July 14, the government failed to issue the final certificates which are the basis for Plus One admissions. The government has not made it mandatory to submit SSLC certificates for the admission due to their failure in issuing certificates on time,” George said. Meanwhile, the authorities said that the digital copies of SSLC certificates are available at the government’s digital storage app ‘Digilocker’ and those who need can use them. “SSLC certificates will be issued soon and all schools have been directed to proceed with the admissions using the marklist copies. Students will not face any difficulty,” said a senior education department official. Teachers said that as the admissions and Plus One board exams happen simultaneously, it might affect the admission process. Though the government decided to not conduct admission on days when exams will be held, teachers’ workload will increase as there are no clerks in higher secondary. Moreover, the classrooms have to be rearranged multiple times to conduct exams and then for admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sslc-certificates-pending-as-plus-1-admissions-begin-today/articleshow/86436746.cms||---

---||Delhi||Explain stand on pvt eyes: HC to Centre||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the Centre’s stand on a plea seeking framing of guidelines to regulate activities of private detectives. Justice Rekha Palli was hearing a plea by a woman who claimed that she was being harassed due to an illegal investigation carried out by a private investigator. The court granted six weeks to the Centre to file its response and said it was “inclined to examine the issue”. “If you (Centre) don’t regulate today even after Puttaswamy (judgement on right to privacy). You have to take a balanced view. You have to take care,” the judge observed. The Centre stated that the petitioner was free to take action under Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act which was applicable to any offence committed by private detectives. “These are professionals. We can’t have a guideline for everything... All (professionals) have to follow the law. There is IPC, IT Act. FIR or complaint can be filed,” the counsel stated. The court clarified that it was not going to examine any other issues raised in the plea except those impinging on right to privacy. The counsel for the petitioner stated that a private detective shared certain personal information about his client with a foreign national after conducting an illegal investigation into life. The plea added that the information obtained illegally is being used in a court of law in the United States of America in a case of matrimonial dispute. It complained that the detectives have also agreed to testify in a United States court on the material collected by snooping. The petition claimed that there were several private detectives in the country operating without being subjected to any oversight posing a grave threat to privacy of citizens. The counsel added that although a bill was introduced before the Rajya Sabha in 2007 on this aspect, no progress was made ultimately. The matter will be heard next on January 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/explain-stand-on-pvt-eyes-hc-to-centre/articleshow/86438718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||How 2 riot incidents clubbed into 1?: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: Noting “glaring” discrepancies in the complaints that were clubbed into a single FIR in a northeast Delhi riot case, a court said on Wednesday that police would have to explain them during the course of trial. The court said it couldn’t comprehend how one of the complainants, Diwan Singh, was aware of alleged looting that took place on February 24 last year when he himself visited his shops the next day. It further said when two complaints were submitted by Singh to police on February 25, why the FIR was lodged on a third complaint dated March 1, 2020. Brij Pal’s complaint was in connection to alleged vandalism of his shop on February 25. “No explanation in this regard has been provided by the investigating agency in the entire chargesheet,” additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said in the order. This court, he said, can’t understand how an incident that took place on February 24 can be clubbed with an incident that happened the next day “unless and until there is a clear evidence to the effect that same unlawful assembly of rioters was operating on both dates and there has to be specific witnesses in this regard”. The court dropped charges of arson against 10 people in the case related to the alleged vandalism and said a careful reading of the complainants had not revealed a single word regarding committing mischief by fire or explosive substance (IPC 436) by the riotous mob in the shops. “I am afraid that the investigating agency cannot cover up the said flaw by way of recording the supplementary statements of the complainants if the ingredients of Section 436 IPC were not there in their initial written complaints made to police,” the judge said. Section 436 cannot be invoked merely on the basis of the statements of police witnesses who were beat constables in the area during the riots, the court pointed out, adding that their statements had no significance when both the complainants had stated nothing in this regard. “There is also a considerable delay in recording of their statements,” it observed. Police had called the accused “active members of the riotous mob” on the day and time of the incident. They further claimed that complainant Singh had had, in his supplementary statement, categorically identified four accused and all accused were also involved in other cases during the riot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-how-2-riot-incidents-of-2-days-clubbed-into-one/articleshow/86438682.cms||Usha Das

The 12-member group made a houseboat trip to Alappuzha before MV Empress left for Lakshadweep with around 1,200 including them. The tourism department had not arranged a houseboat trip for passengers considering the fact that the vessel would be leaving for Lakshadweep by 4pm. “But Manzoori and team insisted that a houseboat trip be arranged for them. They were so fascinated by the houseboat cruise,” said Sanjeev Kumar of Voyages Kerala, the agency which facilitated the tour. In order to explore the possibilities for associating with the cruise service in Mumbai-Kochi-Lakshadweep sector in the future, representatives of a few tour agencies were also there in the vessel in its maiden journey. Cordelia, the operators of M V Empress, plans to conduct voyages in the sector twice a month for the next 12 months. “It was a very comfortable voyage. Food and other facilities, including casino in the vessel, are on a par with international standards,” said Melvin, an official with Osaka Travels, Angamaly. Of the 300 travellers who deboarded in Kochi, 127 passengers went for on-shore sightseeing for a few hours. Others went to various destinations on their own by ending the cruise in Kochi. The state tourism department accorded a warm welcome to the guests with a performance by Velakali dancers and women in traditional Kerala kasavu saris greeting them. The Cochin Port wore a festive look as Velakali performers holding sword and shield swayed with graceful vigour in two rows. The guests were received by Kerala tourism joint director K Radhakrishnan and deputy director T G Abhilash besides top officials with Cochin Port.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/as-empress-docks-tourism-prepares-a-comeback/articleshow/86436740.cms||---

A video of the incident of sarpanch K Jaipal Reddy assaulting Srinivas went viral on the social media. Police said Jaipal Reddy was arrested under IPC sections of voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation. Cops surprisingly added IPC section of insulting the modesty of a woman while booking the sarpanch. It all started on Tuesday when Jaipal Reddy (TRS) was involved in a heated argument at a local store with his cousin Krishna Reddy when Srinivas intervened. Maripally SI Venkata Srinu said Srinivas, who was drunk, suggested to Jaipal Reddy to focus on solving the water problem in the village instead of arguing with his cousin. This annoyed Jaipal Reddy, who pushed him down. Srinivas tried to get up but Jaipal Reddy kicked him by jumping in the air. Locals intervened and stopped him from further assaulting Srinivas. When his daughter questioned Jaipal Reddy on his assault, he abused her also.

The representatives of the central government and the BJP have reportedly started discussions with Joseph regarding the same. However, Joseph said that no such discussions were held so far. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi visited Joseph at his residence in Muvattupuzha on Wednesday and has reportedly discussed the matter with him. However, Joseph said that the visit was a casual and personal one. “Suresh Gopi was in Muvattupuzha for some meeting and he expressed his wish to meet me personally. He spent around 15 minutes. Only personal matters were discussed in the meeting. Even I heard the reports of my probable appointment as member in the minority commission but no such intimations have been given to me so far,” Joseph said. Meanwhile, sources with the national minority commission said that Joseph’s name has been under consideration for some time by the central government. “He is considered for appointment as one of the five members of the commission. The final decision will be announced soon,” said a source. The move comes at a time when the upcoming release of the English translation of Joseph’s autobiography ‘A Thousand Cuts- An Innocent Question and Deadly Answers’ is becoming a topic of discussion with regard to fundamentalism and religious extremism in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/joseph-tipped-to-be-minority-panel-member/articleshow/86436809.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||2 taluk emergency centres to be set up in village offices||Thiruvananthapuram: The authorities are planning to establish taluk emergency operations centres (TEOC) at Nedumangad and Chirayinkeezhu taluk offices in the adjacent village offices. Nedumangad and Chirayinkeezhu are among the taluk offices in the state which were found to have no adequate infrastructure or facility to set up TEOC. During site survey conducted as part of early warning dissemination system project (EWDS), it was found that six taluk offices in the state, including Nedumangad did not have proper space or room for accommodating ICT equipment under EWDS. The other five taluk offices are Ranni, Changanacherry, Paravoor, Ottapalam and Thrissur. The survey also found that four taluk offices, including Chirayinkeezhu do not have space in the main building. The other offices were Mavelikkara, Kondotty and Manjeswaram. It has been proposed that TEOC shall be housed in one of the rooms attached to the adjacent village office with 24X7 surveillance and arrangements shall be done in such a way that there was quick access to the taluk disaster management team. The state government has earmarked Rs 2.5 crores in the present fiscal’s budget for establishing emergency operation centres in 25% of taluk offices in the state. The works shall focus on creating a conducive environment for the TEOCs and provide room for accommodating the early warning dissemination system. As per the proposal, the works shall be implemented by district collectors with the help of the public works department, district Nirmithi Kendra and other government accredited agencies. The state government has given administrative sanction for the establishment of DEOC/TEOC as per the proposal approved by the departmental working group. As per the order issued by A Jayathilak, additional chief secretary, revenue, the district emergency operation centres (DEOCs) (one in each district) and 77 taluk emergency operation centres (TEOCs) (one in each Taluk) are the nerve centres of coordination when it comes to disaster management. It is an integral part of the DM System in the districts and taluks to coordinate emergency responses. They constantly liaise with the SEOC (state emergency operation centre) in Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/2-taluk-emergency-centres-to-be-set-up-in-village-offices/articleshow/86407702.cms||---

The KMRL authorities, with the help of an architect, have prepared two designs for the kiosks. The kiosks to come up at JLN station will have a unique design and all of them will be earmarked for sports-related shops like sports apparels, sports medicines, etc. The kiosks at all the other stations will have a uniform design, KMRL managing director Loknath Behera said. Behera said an announcement regarding slashing of ticket rates will soon be made. Most of those who took part in a recent survey have demanded a reduction in ticket rates. TOI had earlier reported that the ticket rates will be slashed soon. On Gandhi Jayanthi Day, passengers will be offered 50% concession on fares. Free rides will be extended to people with disabilities from October 2 while those accompanying them will be given 50% concession, Behera said. During the survey, it was suggested that students and employees of corporate firms, among others, should also be given concessions. These suggestions will also be considered favourably, Behera said. Passenger turnout in the non-peak hours (11am-4pm) has been very low. So, suggestions have been put forward to offer concessions to attract more passengers during these hours. Homemakers who would go for shopping at these hours can also be given concessions, he said. On Kakkanad extension of the Metro, Behera said preparatory works have been gathering momentum. The Union government prefers Light Metro and so there is a rethink on whether Metro should be extended to Nedumbassery or Light Metro would be enough to connect the Kochi airport to the Aluva Metro station, he said, adding: “Personally, I prefer the extension of the Metro to Nedumbassery, not Light Metro,” Behera said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/metro-kiosks-to-be-put-up-for-auction/articleshow/86436773.cms||---

These seven districts are Singrauli, Niwari, Narsinghpur, Katni, Datia, Raisen and Jhabua. In districts like Singrauli, six new Covid cases were reported, while Niwari reported five new cases. Narsinghpur too reported two new cases in the past 10 days between September 13 and September 22. Prior to this, the district had no active cases as per official data. In more than 50% of Madhya Pradesh — or to be precise in 30 out of 52 districts of the state — there are no active cases and no new cases have been reported so far in the month of September. In September, maximum 76 cases have been reported from Jabalpur district, followed by 48 cases in Indore and 42 cases in Indore. But in past 10 days, maximum 20 cases have been reported from Indore district where 100% of the population has received at least one dose of Covid vaccine. It is followed by 15 new cases in Bhopal and 11 in Jabalpur. Rajgarh too reported 9 new cases in past 10 days. It is definitely a positive thing that no new cases have been reported in 30 districts of the state in this month so far, but it is also a matter of concern that smaller districts where there was no new cases, too have active patients now. Given the infectious nature of the disease, appropriate Covid-19 behaviour should be strictly followed, along with vaccination, said experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-active-cases-for-10-days-7-dists-have-ve-cases-now/articleshow/86436782.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Dr MS Mustak, department of applied zoology, Mangalore University, said that his PhD student Supreet Kadkol, spotted the rare crab, purple in colour, when he was travelling from the Ghat section to the seashore. The crab was on the road basking, he said. “The six mature crabs were spotted on the roadside and under the rocks around the terrestrial habitat, and according to literature these fresh water purple crabs are only found during the rainy season. The locals present there were also surprised by the colour of the crab. Preliminary studies and morphometric analysis revealed that the purple crab belongs to the genus Ghatiana. We are yet to ascertain if it is a new species for which molecular taxonomic analysis is being undertaken at the lab,” Dr Mustak said. A purple tree crab was first spotted by Arjun Kamdar and team inJuly 2015 from rainwater-containing tree holes in Amboli, Maharashtra. Later it was spotted in 2017 at the Sharavathi valley in Shivamogga. It was then spotted by the Wildlife Conservation and Awareness Team. “This species looks different from those that have been reported earlier,” said Dr Mustak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rare-purple-crab-spotted-in-uttara-kannada/articleshow/86434451.cms||---

In June, this 34-year-old caught Covid in the peak of the second wave. Due to persistent fever, he had to be hospitalized. The steroids and heavy doses of IV medicines left him weak and with a sensitive gastric system. Once recovered, he thought the worst was over, but he came down with dengue in July. Once again, he suffered persistent high grade fever which would not respond to optimum doses of paracetamol, severe headache and acute vomiting and diarrhoea. “Once again, I had to be hospitalized for a few days,” says Rawal, a resident of New Ranip. Next month, the mosquitoes breeding at construction sites again got the civil engineer. “I am a young man, but it felt as if my bones had aged. I could not get out of the bed,” says Rawal. In all, three viral attacks in three months has left the young man reeling from the after-effects. “In my personal experience, chikungunya was worse than Covid. Doctors said that since my system has been weakened by repeated viral fever attacks, I suffered more joint pain than a patient with no Covid history,” says Rawal. As Ahmedabad battles an unprecedented fierce attack of vector-borne diseases mainly dengue and chikungunya, city doctors say there are many Covid-recovered patients who have fallen prey to the Aedes aegypti borne viral onslaught. Dr Wasimahmed Sachora of KD Hospital says he has treated some 200 dengue and chikungunya patients this season, of which 100-odd were Covid-recovered patients. “While Covid and vector-borne diseases have no connection, when Covid-recovered patients contracted dengue, we saw that the platelet fall was very dramatic and dropped as low as 15,000-20,000,” says Dr Sachora. Dr Falguni Iyer of Shalby Hospital said patients with Covid history also reported a longer duration of fever and joint pain in chikungunya. “We saw joint pains lasting for six weeks. Overall duration of the illness was prolonged by nearly a week. This could be largely due to a body already struggling with residual effects of coronavirus,” said Dr Iyer. Hiren Patel, a 45-year-old resident of Bopal, suffered Covid in April. Two months back, he got chikungunya which lasted for 5 days. “There was severe joint pain but the fever subsided in five days,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vector-strikes-add-to-corona-woes/articleshow/86438789.cms||Radha Sharma

---||Delhi||Delhi: Regulation eased for seeking relief under CM scheme for Covid-affected||NEW DELHI: In a major relief to a large number of people who want to apply for financial assistance under Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Parivar Arthik Sahayata Yojna, Delhi government has decided to do away with the need to obtain a surviving member certificate (SMC) from an applicant in cases where one of the spouses is alive. Under the scheme, which was started by Delhi government this June, financial assistance is provided to the families who lost their bread earners to Covid-19. The government has received nearly 11,000 applications under the scheme till date, out of which Rs 50,000 has already been provided as a one-time financial assistance to more than 5,000 beneficiaries and monthly assistance is being given to around 1,200 beneficiaries. The delay in issuance of SMC, apart from death certificates in many cases, has been creating pendency in approving the applications. The government has been trying to make the process hassle-free and ensure that certificates are issued on time. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot chaired a meeting of department officials to review the scheme, where it was decided to remove the need for SMC if one of the spouses is alive. However, SMC will be required for the grant of ex gratia to other applicants. In cases where the deceased was a single parent, the surviving children are entitled to the ex gratia, which will be equally distributed among all children. But for that, the name of the applicant should be reflected in SMC, the government said. Similarly, if the deceased is unmarried or is a minor son or daughter, his father or mother will get relief under the scheme, subject to their name appearing in the certificate. Gahlot said that as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had always assured the people of Delhi, the government would stand by them in their time of grief. “It is our duty and responsibility to help the families who have lost their loved ones in this pandemic in every possible way,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/regulation-eased-for-seeking-relief-under-cm-scheme-for-covid-affected/articleshow/86438806.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Police said that the victim Mukesh Sarla was resting at home when his elder brother Ragha and younger brother Munna attacked him with a knife and sickle. Prior to the attack, Mukesh and Ragha had a verbal altercation over drawing water from the borewell at their farm. The three brothers own five bigha land each which was originally one parcel of 15 bigha land belonging to their ancestors. However, since there is just one borewell between them, they often had fights over drawing water for irrigation from it. On Tuesday evening too, Mukesh and Ragha had a fight over the issue. Ragha was drawing water and Mukesh too wanted to use water at the same time. After heated arguments, Mukesh returned home when he was attacked. His wife Daxa told police that when the two accused were stabbing her husband, she and her 12-year-old son Hasmukh intervened but they too were attacked. After the two accused fled, the couple and their son were taken to a hospital in Halvad where Mukesh was declared dead before admission. Daxa and Hasmukh were referred to Surendranagar as their injuries were severe. “The woman and her son are recuperating in Surendranagar. Meanwhile, we have registered an offence of murder, attempt to murder and assault against the two accused,” said inspector P A Detivadiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/siblings-kill-farmer-over-irrigation-water-dispute/articleshow/86434513.cms||---

The joint raid by STF and the security wing of department of telecommunications (DoT) led to the arrest of one person Amit Kumar Gupta (35) and detention of a few others for questioning. “ We raided the place and recovered three SIM boxes with 512 slots and 73 active SIMS, a CPU, three routers, a media converter, two mobile phones and a pen drive. A case was registered at Kasba police station. Besides sections of cheating and fraud, specific sections of Indian Telegraph Act has been registered,” said DC (STF) Aparajita Rai. TNN The STFs are carrying out similar raids in other cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, in connection with the same case lodged at Airport police station. Cops said the areas around Airport and Taltala acted as the gang's headquarters. "We have found ten addresses from where they ran offices, the others were used as hideouts. These offices - four of them in Siliguri, two in Jalpaiguri, one each at Nakashipara and Kolkata - amongst others were taken on rent by telling the owner it was either a micro-financing or a loan recovery agency," said a police source. The Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) box fraud is a setup where fraudsters team up with partners abroad to route international calls through the internet using voice over internet protocol (VoIP) and terminate those calls through a local phone number to make it appear as if the call is local. The fraudulent activity creates unnecessary high traffic for local calls, causing congestion that affects the network’s performance. A case in this regard pertaining to cheating and fraud and sections 4, 20 and 21 of the Indian telegraph Act has been registered at Kasba police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-phone-exchange-busted/articleshow/86436863.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Provide free cancer treatment to gas-hit at AIIMS: High court||Bhopal: A division bench of MP High Court comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice V K Shukla ordered for free treatment to victims of Bhopal gas disaster suffering from any type of cancer at AIIMS Bhopal. The HC directive came on Sept 20, while hearing a plea filed by the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sanghatan and others. Citing the recommendation made in the meeting convened by additional chief secretary on June 17, 2021, the HC said "It is directed that free of cost treatment be provided to the victims of Bhopal gas tragedy who are suffering from any of the cancers at AIIMS, Bhopal. Earlier, the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee looking into the medical and rehabilitation of gas victims in its 17th quarterly report has exclusively focused on what it called "The plight of gas victim cancer patients.” The committee headed by Justice (retd) V K Agrawal said that the Monitoring Committee in its report had pointed out that the oncology department has become non-functional and the other state government hospitals run by the gas relief & rehabilitation department don't have any facility for cancer treatment. The committee further said that it may be pointed out in the above reference that three hospitals namely- Navoday Cancer Hospital, Chirayu Cancer Hospital and Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital (JNCH)- are empaneled for cancer treatment by the state government and all the gas victim cancer patients are taking treatment in these hospitals. The committee further said "Of late, the committee has been receiving large number of complaints regarding non-availability- denial of cancer treatment to them, in as much as estimates for their treatment issued by JNCH are not being sanctioned. Copies of complaints/requests received in the above regard by the Monitoring Committee are enclosed", said the report. Citing a few instances in this context, the committee said that P K Chaurasia, who was receiving chemotherapy at JNCH in his letter dated July 10, 2021, complained that his application for sanction of estimate of his treatment has not been approved/cleared by the director of gas relief & rehabilitation (GRR) as a result his treatment is suffering. The Monitoring Committee sent a letter dated July 12, 2021, to director GRR through email. The report also has reference to complaints/requests received from some other cancer patient gas victims namely Usha Yadav, Nannu Ansari, Raju Yadav, Sheeba and Amana Sultan that treatment is being stopped/denied due to delay/denial of sanction of estimate issued by JNCH.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Special meet of corp council to be held today||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation will hold its fifth special council in four months on Wednesday. The special council to be held on Wednesday will centre on the corporation’s falling tax revenue and lapses in asset management. Earlier, the BJP had demanded a special council to discuss revenue income and assets of the corporation, however, Mayor Arya Rajendran did not give the nod citing that the notice did not comply with the mandatory 10 day timeline. In the last few months, special councils had been convened to discuss allegations of corruption in the waste management related to Attukal pongala, regarding number of beneficiaries for housing schemes, SC/ST fund fraud and waste management. All the special councils had led to heated debates between the opposition and the ruling council. Meanwhile, the corporation ruling council so far has not acceded to any of the demands raised by the BJP in special councils. This time the opposition is training its guns to highlight the dipping tax income of the civic body. Around 6,200 tax defaulters in the city owe corporation property tax dues above Rs 10,000 in the past two fiscals alone, says the data compiled by revenue wing in a review meeting held recently. The figures on defaulters were presented in the wake of the corporation dealing with serious fund crunch. With expenses skyrocketing above Rs 100 crore in the last four months, the revenue wing was directed to spruce up tax collection drives through localized collection camps across all the wards in the city. In many cases among the topmost defaulters, the dues had piled up since 2010-11. In 2020, the revenue wing of the city corporation made good use of the lockdown period to reach out to some of the tax defaulters with huge amounts as dues, eventually raising the collection from tax arrears by more than Rs 1 crore. Long pending dues as tax arrears had always dented the corporation’s revenue prospects and city corporation had made public the list of defaulters, including star hotels, retail chains and super markets which owed corporation amounts worth lakhs in terms of tax dues. The corporation aimed to raise Rs 8 crore from localized tax collection drives; however, with the government extending the time limit for clearing tax dues without penalty, the corporation fell short of attaining the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/special-meet-of-corp-council-to-be-held-today/articleshow/86407741.cms||---

Chugh said the way Sidhu has been overbearingly guiding and accompanying the chief minister and the two deputy chief ministers, it was a clear indication that Sidhu would be calling shots in Punjab and the rest of the cabinet would play second fiddle to him. The BJP leader said he was surprised at the manner the chief minister and the two deputy chief ministers were being made to play a subservient role under his overbearing presence. Chugh asked All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi if they had to make the chief minister and his deputies tools in the hands of Sidhu then why did the AICC high command not appoint Sidhu as chief minister. “The Congress has heaped an insult on the people of Punjab by making this kind of an arrangement for the government to run,” he said.He also lambasted Punjab Congress in-charge Harish Rawat for saying Pakistan army chief general Bajwa was his ‘Punjabi bhai’. “This is the sentiment Congress will spread in Punjab, the BJP would oppose it tooth and nail and expose its anti-national designs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-bulldozing-pb-cabinet-bjps-chugh/articleshow/86438874.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Bela cops rescue man from a tree in swollen Nand river||NAGPUR: A man in his 50s clung to a branch of a teak tree for around three hours to avoid getting swept away by strong currents of Nand river before Bela police of Nagpur district rural and local divers rescued him on Tuesday. The man, identified as Chinmay Biswas hailing from Umred in Nagpur district. He got himself into trouble after ignoring warning from cops about not to cross a small bridge on the river whose water level had risen after heavy rain and opening of the gates of Nand reservoir and Shedeshwar dam. It’s learnt, Biswas had gone to Pipla village in Nagpur district for some work on his bike on Tuesday morning. He was warned by cops on bandobast duty while returning around noon. After waiting for some time, Biswas tried to cross the bridge on foot when cops had gone to the other side to remove people from a spot where the flood water was fast entering. While crossing the bridge, the river water swept him away. Biswas was on the verge of drowning when he managed to grab a tree branch. With water level rising and the tree swaying hard, Biswas started shouting for help. On getting alert, assistant inspector Pankaj Waghode, in-charge of Bela police station, rushed to the spot with his team. Waghode said he immediately asked the engineers of the dam and reservoirs to close the gates. “Else, the tree would have either got submerged or the branch would have broken off,” said Waghode. Waghode said the first challenge was to reach the place. “There is Sawangi bridge on the way which was flooded. As the police jeep would not have been able to cross it, we requested an acquaintance, Chetan Bhoyar, to bring his tractor. Bhoyar drove into almost five feet deep water. The tractor nearly overturned on a couple of occasions,” he said. The cop said he sent another team under police patil (police warden) Chandrakant Raut from another side. “Long ropes, rubber rings and life jackets were hurled towards Biswas who was trembling with fear. We kept egging him on to hold onto his nerves,” said Waghode adding that expert divers and swimmers rushed towards Biswas in life jackets. “It was a battle between men and nature to save a brother. The khaki uniform motivated us to fight like commandos and be ready to even die,” said the API. SP Rakesh Ola, addl SP Rahul Maknikar and DySP (home) Sanjay Purandhare appreciated the efforts of Waghaode and his team. Waghode said Biswas was brought down from the tree and pulled to safety before being administered first aid. “The drama continued for three hours before coming to an end,” said the API.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-3-hr-effort-cops-rescue-man-from-a-tree-amid-swollen-river/articleshow/86438861.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Jhimli MCQ||CISCE brings in changes in ICSE English language paper for November semester exam Jhimli.Mukherjeepandey@timesgroup.com Kolkata: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has brought bin a fresh question and answer format for the English language paper for the November semester examination. It has revised the earlier format and fine- tuned it further to make it conducive to the MCQ format. A sample question paper has been sent to schools for teachers to follow and a national workshop has been arranged for all English language teachers to adapt to the changed format, on Thursday. While the earlier paper had short answers to comprehension passages, the new sample paper indicates one word answers and in some cases three word simple sentences from which the candidate will make his/her choice. Teachers of English language is city schools welcomed the new slim question paper pattern and said that this would help students pinpoint answers better and chances of making mistakes would be reduced. They also said that since they would have to tackle so many questions within the span of an hour, the new format will help them pick up speed while writing the answers. The marks allotted to each section has also been re-formatted and scaled down so that chances of losing marks are reduced. Many questions have been redesigned to carry a weightage of one mark. “There are hundreds of children who will access the question paper on mobiles since they do not own laptops. Naturally on that small screen big format question papers will only help to confuse. So the Council decided to make it a slim paper without compromising on the quality,” said a teacher who is an ICSE English examiner. Hilda Peacock, director of Gems Akademia and a senior resource person of the Council for English will conduct the workshop on Thursday following the new sample question paper and new format. “A change in format was necessary because we are adapting to an all new board exam in semester mode in the MCQ. The paper will look like a competitive exam paper now and teachers will have to be trained so that they can in turn get children to adapt to the new pattern,” Peacock said. eom||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jhimli-mcq/articleshow/86436964.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

DDC is a system used to classify knowledge in any form like text, music, images or other knowledge resources, printed or digital. “Though there is only a mild readership for yoga, we designed a number for it and sent the application to the US-based non-profit, computer library service and research organization, Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). It was approved and is now recognised in their classification,” said assistant professor, department of library and information science, (GU) Carlos Fernandes. OCLC said that this move will not only, “lead to a dedicated number that all interested libraries can use for works on Ayush system of medicine but also add greater flexibility for DDC users around the world to emphasize chosen medical and therapeutic systems.” Until now, yoga-related texts and material were kept on the shelves listed for ‘medical therapy’ where books of various therapies are also stacked. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gu-library-gets-special-yoga-section/articleshow/86465441.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand villagers say no to coal mine project, reject lucrative offers from DVC||RANCHI: They could be unlettered with no knowledge about energy dynamics, but they know that life is possible in the lap of nature. Their love for jal, jungle, zamin (water, forest and land) is so deep that thousands of villagers in Tubait village of Latehar district rejected all lucrative offers of Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and stuck to the idea of tilling the land to produce two square meals for themselves. Having obtained environmental clearance from the ministry of forest environment and climate change (impact assessment division) for the 6MTPA Tubaid Coal Mine Project in April 2020, DVC officials on Wednesday visited the village to hold talks with villagers and inform them about the provisions of compensation. Under the revised rates, the corporation has offered to pay them Rs 27,36,700 for per acre of agricultural land and Rs 54,73,500 for per acre of residential plots. In addition, offers were made for shifting allowance, house in R&R colony and absorption of local workforce in the project. Though DVC officials refused to speak to the media, they made the offers to villagers on the loudspeaker and appealed to them to cooperate for development of the region. DVC official Sudhir Mukherjee said this was their first attempt to share details of compensation being offered to the villagers. “We will make another attempt to negotiate,” he said after the protests grew louder and the administration interfered to end the public hearing. Circle officer, Latehar, Rudra Pratap, said the administrative team was present there under the direction of the deputy commissioner to take care of law and order. “Our role is limited to making sure that the interests of the local villagers is not compromised by the ‘company’ people and that they adhere to the state policies of rehabilitation and resettlement,” he said. Pratap added that since a handful of villagers started to agitate and refused to part with their land, the DVC officials were asked to conclude the public hearing. According to coal block allotment documents, the total mine area is spread over 460 hectares which comprises 230 hectares of agriculture land, 162.4 hectares of forestland, 39 hectares of wasteland, 22 hectares of surface waterbodies and settlements spread over 1 hectare. Geological reserve is estimated to be 189.82MT with 170.89MT mineable reserve. Out of the mineable reserve, 139MT corresponding to 81.3% is extractable. The mining proposal targets to mine the coal over a period of 30 years. Spread across six villages — Tubaid, Mangra, Dihi, Ambajharan, Dhobiajharan and Newari — the mining project is expected to displace thousands of families. Around 3,000 people gathered for the public hearing on Wednesday and openly protested any attempt to claim their land. “We are poor tribals who have no use of money because we are going to spend it purposelessly and our future generation would be left to die. For us, land is our only property that sustains generations,” said one of the villagers. Another village girl, both unwilling to be identified, said coal mining will pollute the area and degrade their forest. “We live in sync with nature and if anyone disturbs our forest deity she gets angry for which we all have to pay a price for generations,” she said, explaining the reason why they have collectively refused to accept any volume of compensation to leave their land and forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/latehar-villagers-reject-hefty-dvc-package-to-protect-land/articleshow/86437322.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The survey is aimed at identifying fresh cases of TB as well as to provide them adequate supplements meant for their nutritional balance according to the NTEP. ASHA workers along with block and district-level TB cell officials will be visiting door to door in villages and urban areas to collect sputum of suspected patients. Talking to TOI, director-in-chief, health services, Dr Marshal Aaind, said, “As part of TB elimination programme in the state, we have already completed formulation of a micro plan and updated backlogs of patients for direct to benefit transfer (DBT) scheme who are provided Rs 500 for nutritional food. Apart from that we have conducted IEC programmes across the state between September 11 and 21 to create awareness among people so that more and more suspected patients can come forward for the sputum testing during the survey.” Asked how long the survey will continue, Dr Aaind said, “We started the survey on Monday and we are hopeful that all 24 districts will be completed on or before October 31. We have also asked all our district cells to review the database of old patients who are not getting the funds under the NTEP.” According to the state health department records, over 35,000 people were identified as live TB cases across the state and they have been connected with their district TB cell for medication as well as financial assistance. Asked about the protocols for selection of suspected patients and their testing, Dr Aaind said health workers will be providing sample container to the suspected patients with symptoms of TB. The patients have to collect the sputum overnight which will be sent to the labs situated in every district after collection by health workers. After the test reports are finalised, the health care workers will map the patients data and will submit it to RNTCP cell as well as the state health department so that they get the benefits of the NTEP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/door-to-door-survey-starts-to-detect-tb-cases-in-state/articleshow/86437330.cms||Gaurav Pandey

ACB officials said that the driver had complained against the depot manager identified as Hemantkumar Patel for demanding a bribe of Rs 10,000 from him. The driver used to operate on the Dahod-Surat route, but Patel allotted him the rotation route between Dahod and Surat from September 9. The driver requested Patel to assign him on the fixed route since he had been handling it for quite some time. Patel agreed, but asked the driver to pay him a bribe of Rs 10,000. After repeated requests to Patel, the driver gave a complaint to ACB against the depot manager. The ACB sleuths decided to nab Patel through a trap for which they asked the driver to agree to his demands. When the driver called Patel, the latter asked him to deliver the money at the workshop compound of GSRTC on Wednesday. As soon as Patel accepted the cash, the ACB sleuths arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gsrtc-depot-manager-caught-accepting-bribe/articleshow/86434315.cms||---

GCCI said that hotels and tour operations staff should be completely vaccinated to ensure the safety of the citizens of Goa as well as visitors. “It is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that all precautions are taken to avoid any infection, as negligence on their part would lead to the shutdown of the tourism industry for at least another year,” said GCCI president Ralph de Sousa. GCCI, along with international charter operators, had submitted representations to the state government and had even met chief minister Pramod Sawant requesting him to start international flights into Goa. Six days earlier, Modi announced that international tourists would be allowed to visit Goa. GCCI and TTAG have been campaigning for international scheduled and charter flights to land at Goa International Airport subject to strict Covid norms. Lapses in Covid protocols will lead to a surge in new cases, and the government will have no option but to stop the inflow of tourists, leading to the failure of the upcoming tourist season, said Sousa. He also said that vaccine certificates or negative RT-PCR tests need to be verified at the border and during check-in. “If this is strictly followed, the Goan tourism industry will be back on track and ensure rise in economic growth, which was lost last year,” said Sousa. GCCI also said that the Centre has accepted the demand of industry to extend the timeline for companies to convene the annual general meeting (AGM).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-to-exercise-caution-while-restarting-tourism/articleshow/86465465.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Inc seeks quicker access to funds, asks small industries dvpt bank to ease norms||Panaji: While appreciating the funding avenues created by the government and banks for the manufacturing sector, Goa Inc said that the procedure to obtain working capital loans continues to be riddled with paperwork, endless compliances and a convoluted process. During a meeting with chairman and managing director of the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), Sivasubramanian Ramann, industrialists asked him to consider taking over the loans disbursed by other bank to businesses. Obtaining loans continues to be difficult, particularly for women entrepreneurs and tech startups, industry representatives informed Ramann during the interaction, which was held at the Goa chamber of commerce and industry. “Despite lowering of interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India, this has not percolated to the business community as banks are not forthcoming in their disbursements,” said an industry representative. Ramann has reportedly promised to come up with suitable solutions to cater to the borrowing needs of the industry. He also appeared open the idea of SIDBI taking over the loans from the banks where MSMEs face difficulty. Ramann said that creating a repository of authentic data of borrowers makes credit assessments easy and the NeSL (national e-governance services ltd) is a perfect example of how technology could be used to harness data of a borrower’s debt exposure and in turn help the financial institution in loan disbursements. He said that SIDBI has computerised its lending operations and was awaiting the Goa government’s approval of the digital stamping system. This would eliminate paperwork and make disbursement efficient. He said that there are 15-20 schemes offered by SIDBI to MSMEs of different sizes which could be shared with GCCI. Chairman of GCCI’s industry committee, Raj Kumar Kamat, who requested SIDBI to consider taking over existing business loans, said that this would “relieve many businesses which are suffering due to unreasonable demands from banks”. A representative from the ITES industry said that tech companies and startups, whose principal investment is in software, are unable to offer any collateral security while securing loans. GCCI president Ralph De Sousa agreed and said that the current regulations are based on the brick and mortar industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-inc-seeks-quicker-access-to-funds-asks-small-industries-dvpt-bank-to-ease-norms/articleshow/86465399.cms||---

As an initial step, 10 face-reading attendance machines will be installed in the varsity building next month. Later, the machine will be installed across its 12 constituent and nine affiliated colleges. “The university’s finance committee has approved the proposal and funds are likely to be allocated shortly, following which process for the installation of the machines will begin,” KU spokesperson P K Pani said. He added that the decision was taken to minimise the chances of transmission of Covid-19. “As per the government’s Covid-19 guidelines, biometric finger-print attendance system has been suspended and the conventional system of physical attendance (where an employee signs on an attendance register) is being followed,” Pani said. “The new age face-reading attendance machine is technology-driven, which is capable of tracking a person’s eye and capturing physiology data and KU will become the first university in Jharkhand to adopt this technology,” he added. Initially, the 10 machines record the attendance of 160 varsity staff. “All the colleges will be asked to share the data of their respective employees and accordingly, we will decide on the number of face-reading machines which need to be installed at each of the colleges,” Pani said. A contractual worker from Jamshedpur Women’s College preferring anonymity said, “As the fears of a possible third wave of Covid loom large, the varsity should explore the possibility of acquiring machines that have an added feature of screening a person’s body temperature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kolhan-varsity-to-adopt-contact-less-attendance-system/articleshow/86437304.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court said that at most it can be said that there was a breach of the contract between the construction company and the flat purchasers. “The lodging of FIR by the informant (one of the flat buyers) was prima facie appearing to be an attempt to resolve the civil dispute by giving it colour of criminal offence. No fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of accepting the booking amount from the customer is seen,” additional sessions judge H S Satbhai said. The court said that the prosecution has not made out a prima facie case against the accused. The court pointed out that due to obstructions at the construction sites, including those involving Cidco and environmental activists, progress in construction was stalled. The property was also attached by the Enforcement Directorate in 2015 in connection with money laundering cases. It said that the inaction in further construction was not wilful or deliberate. The court held that the circumstances were beyond the control of the company, which prevented it from handing over possession in 2012. “There was a just and valid cause, which prevented M/s Devisha Infrastructure Private Limited and its directors to complete the project and handover the constructed flats to the purchasers,” the court said. The Bhujbals and two others, Rajesh Dharap and Satyen Kesarkar, who were directors of DIPL, were discharged from offences relating to cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy under the IPC, and also under provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act. The court said that the case will proceed against the fifth accused. The case will come up for hearing on October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/judge-who-discharged-chhagans-kin-cant-infer-intention-to-cheat/articleshow/86451037.cms||Rebecca Samervel

At the same time, it has unleashed ‘creative destruction’ which will boost productivity and can alter the course of development. The governor pointed out that the fillip to automation and digital during the pandemic would improve productivity, but it would provide challenges to inclusiveness and slack in the labour market. “Such a scenario calls for significant skilling/training of our workforce. We also need to guard against any emergence of “digital divide” as digitisation gains speed after the pandemic,” said Das. According to Das, the government needs to provide a big push to investment in health, education, low-carbon and digital economy in addition to transport and communications. In addition, the warehousing and supply-chain infrastructure will be critical to bolstering value addition and productivity in the agriculture and horticulture sector. “This will create employment opportunities in semi-urban and rural areas and promote inclusive growth,” said Das, delivering the keynote address at the 48th National Management Convention of the All India Management Association. Das noted that the pandemic has affected the poor and vulnerable more, especially in emerging and developing economies. “The lasting damage inflicted by the pandemic on these segments is of serious concern for inclusive growth. In the medium to long-run, both efficiency and equity will greatly matter for sustainable growth and macroeconomic performance,” said Das. The RBI governor said that the government’s measures to boost manufacturing in the country has yielded results. “The pandemic has brought to focus what India can achieve in the area of manufacturing. In the pharmaceutical sector for the first time in history, vaccines were developed and administered within a year with India remaining a forerunner and a global leader in vaccine manufacturing,” said Das. He noted that the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme introduced by the government has resulted in India being home to almost all the leading global mobile phone manufacturers and turning from being an importer to an exporter of mobile phones. “This trend is likely to spill over to other sectors also. The presence of global players would help in enhancing India’s share in Global Value Chain (GVC) and building up a resilient supply chain network,” said Das. Das said that sustainable growth should entail building on macro fundamentals via medium-term investments, sound financial systems and structural reforms. “Towards this objective, a big push to investments in healthcare, education, innovation, physical and digital infrastructure will be required,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/creative-destruction-dents-inclusion-ups-output-reserve-bank-of-india-governor-shaktikanta-das/articleshow/86443367.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Protest against farm laws completes 300 days||BATHINDA: Large-scale protests by farmers against the three contentious farm acts, which has affected normal life in several north Indian states, completed 300 days today. Braving hot summers and chilling winters, scores of farmers representing various unions have been camping near the border of Delhi ever since they reached the spot on November 26, 2020. Even as the agitation entered its 300th day, protesting farmers sounded defiant today and claimed they were prepared for a long haul. A section of the protesting farmers also added that they will budge only after the Centre repeals the three “black” laws. In another significant development, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has called for a Bharat Bandh on September 26 to pressurise the Centre to accept their demands. Several unions today reiterated that their primary focus now is to ensure that the bandh call is successful. “The stubbornness of Narendra Modi government could be gauged from the fact that this government is not ready to listen to the legitimate demands of the farmers. The movement stands as testimony of the will, resolve and hope of farmers across the country. We take a vow to strengthen the movement and also make it widespread,” the morcha said in a statement today. Reacting to the news of a bumper harvest this Kharif season, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha claimed that a good harvest means nothing if a minimum support price is not guarantedd by the Central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/movement-against-farm-laws-complete-300-days-will-budge-only-after-acts-repealed-say-defiant-farmers/articleshow/86439978.cms||---

In a statement issued by EEPC, it mentioned that unlike the previous months, exports to China registered the second largest export destination witnessing positive monthly growth in August 2021. Shipments to China rose 15% in August to reach $613.3 million as compared to $531.3 million in the same month last year. Malaysia was the only country which saw a negative trend in import of engineering goods from India. The US continued to be on top of the chart with August import of engineering goods from India growing 42% to $1.3 billion as compared to $916.5 million in the same month last year. All the European countries for India’s top-25 engineering export destinations — Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, UK, Poland, Spain and France — recorded high positive growth during August as well as on a cumulative basis this fiscal. The share of India’s engineering exports to its top 25 nations accounted for 76.8% of India's total engineering exports in April-August 2021. This significant high share is indicative of the dependence of India’s engineering export on the traditional markets. India’s engineering exports was at its all-time monthly high for the second straight month in August. The robust performance of the sector resulted in the share of engineering goods in total merchandise exports during the previous month rising significantly. Share of engineering in total merchandise export was 27.6% in August 2021 as against 25.8% in July, 27.1% in June, 25.4% in May, 24.8% in April 2021 and 25.3% in March 2021. "In the month of August, engineering goods exports recorded more than 40% growth even when compared with the same month in 2019. It now seems that the pandemic is behind us. We are positively hopeful that as a result of a turnaround in global trade and policy support the sector would do better than expected in the full financial year," said EEPC India Chairman Mahesh Desai. "The annual target of US$ 107 billion looks very doable even though the achievement till August fell a bit short of the target when calculated on a pro-rata basis," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/24-out-of-25-top-nations-post-growth-in-aug-engg-exports/articleshow/86437685.cms||---

In Amroha to lay the foundation stone for development projects, the chief minister said, “Earlier, it was said that if you notice potholed roads, just think that UP has come. Wherever the darkness starts, just think that you have entered UP. We broke all those stereotypes. We have constructed four-lane highways and local roads as well. Electricity supply is also uninterrupted in most places.” Addressing a gathering, he also boasted of better law and order in the state and also about the absence of communal riot during his tenure. “Our government has completed its four-and-a-half years. Not a single riot took place in the state. We had warned the anti-social elements that if they create disturbance, their property will be confiscated. If they burn public property, the house of the poor, then their seven generations will pay the fine.” CM Adityanath, who laid foundation stone for projects worth Rs 433 crore in the district, said, “In our government, Amroha’s dholak and garment industries are flourishing and making their presence felt. Now Amroha has got the gift of development projects worth 433 crore and more projects will be announced soon.” He also attacked the opposition parties for “indulging in Twitter politics” rather than helping people during the pandemic. “During the pandemic, leaders of the opposition were preaching on Twitter. None of them came forward to help the people. They just vanished. It was only our government, health workers, voluntary organizations and BJP workers who stood by the people in those desperate times.” CM also paid tribute to late senior BJP leader and international cricketer Chetan Chauhan. Meanwhile, BKU’s national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait also visited Amroha district. During the CM's programme, BKU leaders were put “under house arrest”, its leaders alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-now-known-for-highways-uninterrupted-power-supply-says-cm-adityanath/articleshow/86435736.cms||Harveer Dabas
