Keeping her husband's busy schedule and the pandemic restrictions in mind, a car trip to Lepakshi Village and Nandi Temple seemed like the perfect plan tailor-made for the occasion. "We planned a few one-day trips for a change in our schedule, as my six-year-old son Ivaan needed a break as well. And since my family had flown down from Delhi, we wanted them to enjoy the pleasant weather through the car drives," she says. And for Kavitha Singh a two-hour-long drive to Dodda Aalada Mara (Big Banyan Tree) was just what she needed to bond with her husband. Not just Surbhi and Kavitha, many Bengalureans are making the most of the relaxed travel restrictions and are setting travel goals with short trips to nearby scenic spots or cafés to unwind. Destinations for all kinds of travellersWhether you're the type for whom holidays mean taking innumerable selfies against beautiful backdrops or the type that just wants to have some good food and relax — there are no dearth of weekend designation options. "For a quick weekend trip with the family, we recently headed to an organic farm, retreat and café Rocky Ridge Café at Denkanikota-Palacode state highway, which is 77 kilometres from the city. It was a great way to bond with parents and kids at the same time," says 37-year-old Girish K. Hesaraghatta, which is around 30 kilometres from Bengaluru, is a cyclist's paradise. This made it the perfect getaway for cyclist Siddalinga Swamy. "The ride around Hesaraghatta Lake is extremely rejuvenating. The lush greenery, with fantastic tree cover, grassland and lakes on this route is a welcome break. There is also a temple on this stretch which is another good place to relax. This stretch takes about 1.5 hours by cycle. But cyclists who want longer rides can take a detour towards Gopalaswamy Temple, the mini forest stretch that crosses Doddaballapur Road, and then come around Chikka Madhure, thereby covering a good 50 kilometres through amazing countryside. Chikka Madhure also has good breakfast joints," he says. Abhijith Padival and his gang of fellow riders eagerly await Sunday for their breakfast ride. "We meet at the Yeshwanthpur toll and ride out of the city. Luckily there are many nice eating joints enroute to make our rides memorable. Bikers are always looking for nice empty stretches with minimal traffic," says Abhijith. For bikers, short trips mean riding at least 100-150 kilometres. Pet-friendly spots are a hitThe lockdowns were bearing down hard on Tamaghna Adhikari's outdoorsy rottweiler. So, he decided to take him camping to a farm that is located 1.5 hours from the city called Backyard Camp. "We bonded with other pet parents there who also love to camp. Luckily, there are quite a few camping spots and cafés around Bengaluru that are pet-friendly, where you can unwind with your pets," she says. Naturalist Kaushik Bajibab, the founder of one such camping spot, Backyard Camp, says that his camp sees not just young couples, but entire families on day trips. "Everyone is keen to have different experiences. Nearly 70%-80% of people who choose to go camping are pet parents," he says. Age no bar for short tripsGirish Krishnamurthy's Rocky Ridge Café has witnessed a good turnout with the relaxations on cross-border travel restrictions post the second lockdown. Interestingly, it is not just couples, but many senior citizens and families with toddlers and adolescent kids doing one-day trips to the farm. "The biking community is also making the best use of their weekends and for many, the café is a pitstop."

---||Bhubaneswar||Antibodies in Covaxin, Covishield recipients decrease after 2, 3 months: Odisha researchers||BHUBANESWAR: The level of antibodies generated among recipients of Covaxin and Covishield decreases after two and three months of second dose vaccination, revealed a follow-up study conducted by researchers in Odisha. Samples were collected from 614 participants for the study led by ICMR-regional medical research centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar. Among these participants, 308 (50.2%) were Covishield recipients and the rest 306 (49.8%) got Covaxin. A total of 81 breakthrough cases were recorded among participants for whom infection post-vaccination acted as a booster. The remaining 533 healthcare workers without any history of post-vaccination infection showed significant decrease in antibodies. “We have found that antibody level of Covaxin recipients is decreasing after two months of second dose vaccination, while it is three months in the case of Covishield recipients,” said Debdutta Bhattacharya, a senior scientist from ICMR-RMRC Bhubaneswar. Whether or not there is a need for a booster shot (after a significant population of the country is vaccinated with two doses) requires scientific evidence, said Bhattacharya. This study and further follow-ups will be helpful in generating such important evidence, he felt. As many as 24 researchers from RMRC Bhubaneswar, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) Bhubaneswar, MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur, KIMS Bhubaneswar, VIMSAR Burla and the Chest Clinic Berhampur took part in the study which is pre-print publication. Bhattacharya said the study was a first of its kind from India wherein they followed the vaccine recipients of Covaxin and Covishield for six months and correlated it with gender, age, blood group and co-morbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/antibodies-in-covaxin-covishield-recipients-decrease-after-2-3-months/articleshow/86158962.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

Tinsukia SP Debojit Deuri said Bora had recently left her base camp in Myanmar due to her health issues. She was caught when she was trying to sneak into Tinsukia district through Arunachal Pradesh. “She is an old cadre of the Ulfa-I and had joined the militant outfit in 2000. She belonged to Sarupathar area of Golaghat district. After her arrest, we immediately admitted her to the Tinsukia civil hospital for treatment. Her health condition is very bad,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/woman-ulfa-i-cadre-held-in-tinsukia/articleshow/86149737.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Come April, user fee for international flyers at Bengaluru airport to go up by 43%||BENGALURU: Beginning April 2022, passengers flying out from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) will pay Rs 350 for domestic and Rs 1,200 for international flights instead of the existing Rs 184 and Rs 839, respectively, as user development fee (UDF). The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) has announced the revised fee for departing flyers. The Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) that operates KIA wanted the hike to take effect from October this year, but their request was declined. Its representatives have expressed displeasure over the decision. A BIAL spokesperson said the tariff revision has come at a time when the airport is about to complete and operationalise a massive Rs 13,300-crore expansion programme focused on investing in critical capacity to cater to the demand, including construction of a runway, terminal 2 and associated projects. “For the past 11 years, BIAL has reinvested its earnings to fund this capacity enhancement hoping to provide strong earnings to the shareholders once this project is completed. It is therefore disappointing to receive a tariff order which is likely to be inadequate to meet our cash flow requirements and will also pose a challenge when it comes to meeting operational expenses. This is further exacerbated by the fact that during the period of the recovery of this investment, traffic is at its lowest owing to the pandemic situation,” the spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/come-april-user-fee-for-intl-flyers-at-kia-to-go-up-by-43/articleshow/86149941.cms||---

The Congress has plans to raise issues of price rise, alleged corruption in Covid management, procurement of agriculture equipment and in awarding contracts by the skill development department. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah had last week convened a meeting of Congress legislature party, where the MLAs resolved to target the government on the collapse of law and order with incidents like Mysuru gang rape, Nanjangud temple demolition and among others. The functionaries are expected to arrive on bullock carts to Vidhana Soudha, protesting the fuel price hike. Siddaramaiah is likely to bring up the issue of caste census and demand the government accept Kantharaj Commission socio-economic survey. The JD(S) legislature party will meet on Monday at 4pm to discuss its strategy. “We’ll question about mismanagement of the pandemic situation and other issues. The government must explain as to why it has not controlled the skyrocketing price despite the income levels of people being low because of the pandemic,” said KPCC president DK Shivakumar. 18 bills to be tabledWhile 18 bills, including banning online gambling and reduction in stamp duty on registration of affordable flats, being lined up, the session will see many firsts. An ethics committee is likely to be formed to ensure discipline in the house and the best legislator award will be introduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/litmus-test-for-cm-as-monsoon-session-starts/articleshow/86149784.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Debris, parked cars pose hurdle for cyclists||BENGALURU: The much hyped 17km bicycle lane stretching from Silk Board to KR Puram along Outer Ring Road (ORR) has turned into a nightmare for cyclists. The reason: It’s punctuated by construction debris and encroached upon by cars, besides terminating abruptly and literally missing at several places. “The bicycle lane is not continuous and ends suddenly only to begin again some distance away. It is filled with construction debris dumped by civic agencies. Whom do we blame then?” lamented Shilpi Sahu, a cyclist and member of Relief Riders, a cycling activists’ groups. Relief Riders hit the 17km lane on September 5 morning but were forced to deviate from the designated track and enter the main road at several places due to the debris, parked cars and abrupt ends. Sahu regretted that civic agencies just mark these lanes without actually maintaining them, adding that cyclists don’t figure in their scheme of things. No signageSathya Sankaran, bicycle mayor of Bengaluru, said civic agencies have even failed to place signboards announcing the lane is dedicated for only cyclists. “There is no awareness about the lane. Signage needs to be installed at every 50 metres to begin with, and the distance could be increased later,” opined Sankaran. VKS Pakala, another cycling enthusiast, said with no signage, the lane is being appropriated by two-wheeler riders. “Many livelihood cyclists are not using the lane as they are not aware it is reserved for bicycles. Also, the transition from one lane to another across junctions needs to be looked at. Proper boards should be put up to facilitate a smooth transition for cyclists and the traffic,” added Pakala. The cyclist community feels discontinuity of the lane at several places is a disincentive to those wanting to pedal to their destinations. “Why create a bicycle lane if there is no connectivity?” Sankaran added. According to data accessed by TOI, the 34km stretch of proposed bicycle lane along ORR slated to be implemented by the directorate of urban land transport (DULT) is only 70% complete. V Manjula, DULT commissioner, said: “We are the planning agency. We give the designs. Stakeholders like BBMP, Bengaluru Smart City Limited and Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited need to implement them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/debris-parked-cars-pose-hurdle-for-cyclists/articleshow/86149954.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani called upon the country's new rulers to "involve all Afghan parties in national reconciliation" when he met Prime Minister Mullah Muhammad Hasan Akhund, Qatar's foreign ministry said. Qatar is considered one of the countries with the most influence over the Taliban and played a pivotal role in the massive US-led airlift of its own citizens, other Western nationals and Afghans who helped Western countries. The Qatari capital Doha also hosted the Taliban's political office, which oversaw the negotiations with the United States that eventually led to the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. Sheikh Mohammed and new premier Akhund also discussed "concerted efforts to combat terrorist organizations that threaten the stability of Afghanistan", ways to enhance peace in the country and the safe passage of people, according to the Qatar ministry. Sheikh Mohammed met the prime minister and a number of other senior ministers, a Taliban spokesman said. "The meeting focused on bilateral relations, humanitarian assistance, economic development and interaction with the world," according to the Taliban. Sunday's meeting in the presidential palace was attended by a number of other Afghan ministers including Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Salam Hanafi, Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, Defence Minister Yaqoob Mujahid, Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani and intelligence chief Abdul Haq Wasiq. The Taliban said the leadership of the Islamic Emirate, the term used by the group to describe the new order in Afghanistan, thanked the Qatar government for supporting the Afghan people. The Doha agreement, signed by the United States and the Taliban, was a "landmark achievement, all sides should adhere to its implementation", the Taliban added. Qatar's Sheikh Mohammed also met Abdullah Abdullah, a senior official in the previous Afghan government, and former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the foreign ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/qatars-foreign-minister-visits-premier-of-taliban-ruled-afghanistan/articleshow/86150007.cms||---

Hundred of them had to get treated for food poisoning and dehydration. They suspect groundwater contamination due to seepage of water from drains. Ten apartments with 1,000 flats are affected. Six hundred of the flats are in one apartment complex alone. The residents are getting water ferried by tankers from outside. “The water is black and has many particles. We got the water sample from a 1,100-ft borewell checked with local geologists and found there was contamination at 85-ft depth and another at 600 feet. BWSSB officers visited our place to check. We suspect seepage of drain water caused contamination,” NP Srinivas of Yashoda Tranclave Apartment, said. "Every apartment has its own borewells and all of them appear to have got contaminated with sewage water. We get Cauvery water, but it is not sufficient and hence, we depend on borewells," said Sunil, a resident of Athena Apartment.  "Initially, the water began to smell bad. We thought there could be a problem with the cleaning of the tank. By evening, my daughter complained of stomach pain and began throwing up. We took her to hospital and after a few hours, my sister’s health worsened. I had to be hospitalised at midnight," said Jyothi Krishna of MR Sannidhi Apartment.  Bengaluru South MLA Krishnappa, accompanied by BBMP and BWSSB officials, visited the apartments on Sunday. "According to officials, if there is leakage of sewage water, it should have entered through water lines. It looks like more than 100 feet of groundwater is contaminated. I have instructed officials to check the cause. They will start work tomorrow," Krishnappa said. BBMP south health officer Shiva Kumar said they don't have information about the incident. “Maybe this happened in the apartments and residents got treated by themselves. We will visit the area and check the issue,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/contaminated-borewell-water-leaves-400-sick/articleshow/86150048.cms||---

Unaware that the robbers were threatening them with a fake gun, the women parted with their chains. Ravi Singh, 28, from Bihar and Sandeep, 26, from Uttar Pradesh targeted passengers on trains that stopped at the outer signal between the railway station and Seshadripuram railway bridge for track clearance. Police have recovered three chains worth Rs 3 lakh and a toy gun from the duo. “They would point the ‘gun’ at the head of the women and demand valuables,” an officer said.  They committed robberies on August 22, 25 and 29. The first incident took place between 8.50pm and 8.55pm on a Tirupati-Bengaluru special train. Poornima of Kumaraswamy Layout was returning to the city from Vellore along with her three children, when the duo fled with her chain worth Rs 88,000. The duo robbed Minal Sudam Kshatriya of Doddabanasawadi of her chain worth Rs 60,000 between 8.30am and 8.45am on August 25 on Kochuveli-Mysuru special train. A mother of a 11-month-old baby aboard Kacheguda Bengaluru special train was their third victim at the same spot. Mamatha Devi of Talakunda, Tamil Nadu, was on her way to Mysuru from Kacheguda.

India may have put a halt to its bilateral and largely symbolic `Hand-in-Hand’ exercise with China since the military confrontation erupted in eastern Ladakh in May last year, but it’s all systems go as far as other countries are concerned. “Exercises enhance military and strategic cooperation, confidence-building and interoperability with different countries, apart from honing combat skills, imbibing best practices and operational tactics,” said a senior Army officer. “Defence diplomacy is an instrument to further India’s diplomatic interests,” he added. India, for instance, has stepped up its outreach to Africa, a continent where China has made deep inroads, with military exercises being used as one of the tools. Then, of course, there is strategic signaling to countries like China through exercises like the quadrilateral `Malabar’ among India, the US, Japan and Australia, the last edition of which was conducted off Guam in the Western Pacific towards end-August. Read AlsoIndia, Australia hold inaugural '2+2' talks; Afghanistan situation, boosting strategic ties on agendaNEW DELHI: India and Australia on Saturday held the inaugural foreign and defence ministerial dialogue to boost overall strategic ties in the backdrop of an unsettling phase of geopolitical flux in the region. External affairs minister S Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh held theThe growing strategic congruence to deter coercion in the Indo-Pacific also came through the `Quad-plus-France’ exercise called La Pérouse’ in the Bay of Bengal in April. Having already set a scorching pace in undertaking exercises this year, India has several more scheduled in the last four months. A`Quad-plus-UK’ naval exercise, for instance, is slated in the Bay of Bengal next month. This will be followed by the first tri-service exercise with the UK, centered around the 65,000-tonne aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth with its fifth-generation F-35B `lightning’ fighter jets, off the western coast from October 24-27. India has undertaken tri-service exercises only with the US and Russia till now. The Indian Army, having just concluded bilateral exercises `Indra’ in Russia and `Kazind’ in Kazakhstan, has currently deployed around 200 soldiers for the ongoing 17-nation `Zapad’ exercise at Nizhny in Russia. Other forthcoming Army exercises include `Surya Kiran’ with Nepal, `Mitra Shakti’ with Sri Lanka, `Ajeya Warrior’ with the UK, `Yudh Abhyas’ with the US and `Shakti’ with France in the September-November timeframe. The Navy, in turn, has conducted bilateral exercises with countries ranging from Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand to Kenya, UAE, Qatar, Brunei, Bahrain, Egypt, UK and Germany this year.Indian warships also undertook their first-ever naval exercises with countries like Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Sudan and the European Union Naval Taskforce. Not to be left behind, the IAF dispatched its Sukhoi-30MKI fighters and C-17 Globemaster-III aircraft to take part in the `Desert Flag’ exercise, which saw participation of air forces from India, US, France, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, at the Al Dhafra airbase in March. “India is steadily enhancing its military outreach to the strategically-located Persian Gulf region,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-sets-scorching-pace-for-military-drills-across-the-globe/articleshow/86150385.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||India||Pocso lawyer scores century, sends 100 to jail in four years||MUMBAI: It is a century that she is both happy and sad about. Happy that she helped put behind bars men who were held guilty of sexually abusing and preying on children and sad that the tribe of such men has only grown since she became a special public prosecutor. Geeta Sharma, a special PP since July 2017 for courts trying cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), nailed her hundredth conviction on Thursday at the session court in south Mumbai. She has been a prosecutor for more than 200 cases, she says. Since last March when the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown began, she secured 33 convictions in her cases. Her tally includes 18 convictions with life imprisonments, four with a 20-year prison sentence, 16 the convict got sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment. Thursday’s conviction was for an offence of kidnapping with accused acquitted of sexual assault and rape charge. The victim was a young girl, barely 15-years-old, who had befriended the 19-year-old accused on social media. The cases of teenagers as victims and the accused in their early 20s are abound in courts. They easily form a third of all cases, says Sharma. Some of the other SPPs for Pocso cases at the sessions court in Fort concur that cases of ‘runaway marriages’ make a significant portion of cases and the other category often is of younger children abused by people they know or are acquainted with. The cases that shock even the most prolific prosecutors are the ones where victims are still toddlers or pre-schoolers. “Neighbours and relatives as accused are on the rise. 90% of the time in Pocso cases, accused are ‘known’ persons, of these 50% are relatives or neighbours and 25-30% are boyfriend-girlfriend cases,” Sharma said. “If age of consent is amended and brought down to 16, the case load would drop by 25%,’’ she says. “When I see their small faces as we talk about the incident, sometimes it is stressful. I do get angry. I write poetry and stories to let off some steam,’’ says Sharma, who herself started as a young mother and has three children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pocso-lawyer-scores-century-sends-100-to-jail-in-four-years/articleshow/86150965.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Designer wear back in demand, as celebration season kicks off||The pandemic saw a drastic fall in demand for designer wear as weddings and other celebrations were either postponed or scaled down massively. Till last year, the fashion industry was staring at losses and uncertainty. However, now with the festive and wedding season starting, things are looking up. After reopening their stores post the second wave, designers say they are again getting a good number of appointments and queries from clients. (Location courtesy: Ashima-Leena) ‘Business is unexpectedly good’“I have one retail store and I also operate from my studio in NCR, and the number of appointments we have been getting is unexpectedly good. When we reopened in mid-July, business was slow for a month, but things have turned around after mid-August. The upcoming festive and wedding season, and the fact that consumers are more confident about coming out and shopping are some of the reasons why business has picked up,” says designer Anju Modi. Adds designer Manav Gangwani, “While earlier families would buy a Rs 10 lakh lehenga without giving it a second thought, now the budget has come down to Rs 1-2 lakh. But there are orders coming in and we are hoping things will turn around in the coming months.” How the lehenga turned out to be a saviour for fashion business during pandemicIf there’s one thing that hasn’t faded or lost its charm during the pandemic, it is the craze for wearing a designer wedding lehenga. Designers say that weddings have been a saviour for businesses during the pandemic. “It is true that the number of functions around weddings are far lesser and scaled down than what they used to be in the pre-pandemic era, but as weddings are now intimate, some families have more budget to spend on a designer lehenga. So, while the bride’s relatives might not be buying designer wear, the bride is still choosing her dream lehenga even if she has to spend a little extra on that,” shares designer Rina Dhaka, who has still not reopened her retail outlets, but “is doing decent business from appointments at her factory-cum-studio”. Designer Charu Parashar adds that she has been getting a lot of queries/orders for destination weddings. “Destination weddings seem to have picked up during the pandemic and along with bridal trousseau, there is also a demand for semi-formal/traditional designs,” says Charu. ‘Buyers are price conscious but there are more wedding orders than last year’The one change that designers have noticed in consumers’ buying behaviour during the pandemic is that “most have become more price conscious and want to invest in designs that can be worn on several occasions”. Designer Gautam Gupta says that from his experience in the last few days he can say that “if things (number of COVID cases) continue to be what they are at present and we continue to remain open in the coming months, our business in the next three months could be 30-50% more than pre-COVID times. There were a lot of weddings that were postponed last year and are lined up in the coming months. So, the number of orders is going up. We are getting a lot of clients from cities like Jaipur and Raipur. Also, since there is still a fear of the third wave looming, people just want to complete their wedding shopping while everything is open. So, everyone wants us to deliver their orders in just a few days.” ‘Consumers check collections online, make appointments before visiting store to be safe’Before confirming their appointment with designers, buyers are making sure that the store wouldn’t be crowded. They are also checking out the collections online, and making notes before visiting the store to reduce the number of outfits they try on. “In the last one year, clients have become very conscious and aware about their shopping experience. To maintain their safety, we are still not allowing walk-ins and take just two-three appointments in a day,” says Charu. Every garment that is put on display goes through a sanitisation process after every client visit, but in the case of couture where the “touch and feel factor” is important for clients, designers make sure that sanitisation is done carefully and in moderation. Rina says that sample designs in her store are used for trials, and once the order is confirmed, the design is made afresh to maintain safety. “Even the sample pieces that are on display go through the sanitisation process after almost every client visit. I am still operating from my studio, as it has a bigger space and social distancing is easily maintained, so at one point not more than one or two clients are there in the studio. People are stepping out to shop now, but safety is an important factor now in sales,” shares Rina. Designer Leena Singh adds that as compared to her store in a mall, buyers prefer booking an appointment at her studio-cum-factory. “Buyers are still hesitant at coming to a retail outlet in a mall, where they feel the number of walk-ins will be higher. They prefer scheduling an appointment at a studio-cum-factory, where we meet clients with appointment. Safety protocols are very important for buyers now, but the good sign is they are coming out for shopping. I am even getting calls from NRI clients, who are keen to visit India soon for their wedding shopping,” says Leena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/designer-wear-back-in-demand-as-celebration-season-kicks-off/articleshow/86138580.cms||Divya Kaushik
---||India||Pakistan’s 131-page dossier accuses India of hosting ISIS camps||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Sunday released a 131-page dossier against India, accusing it of grave human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir and alleged that it was “hosting and running terror camps of ISIS”. The dossier was presented at a press conference here jointly addressed by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf and human rights minister Shireen Mazari. It came at a time when Islamabad has been in focus of international attention in the backdrop of US-led foreign troops’ chaotic exit from Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul last month following a swift surrender of Afghan cities to the Taliban. Qureshi said the decision to compile the dossier was taken due to the alleged actions of Indian authorities after the death of Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani and their treatment of his family. Qureshi said that considering the situation in Kashmir and “the kind of government’s thinking present there”, the Pakistani establishment decided that “we should play our role and unveil the real face of this government, claiming to be the world’s biggest democracy, before the world”. Citing information from the document, Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar blamed India for “patronizing ISIS”. He alleged that evidence suggested that India was operating training camps in Gulmarg, Raipur, Jodhpur, Chakrata, Anupgarh and Bikaner. “By injecting these state-trained ISIS fighters, India may try to establish linkages of the freedom movement with international terrorism in order to malign the freedom struggle of Kashmiris and to justify its own crimes as counter-terrorist operations,” he said. The NSA said that Islamabad is clear on what is going in the region. “What is happening in J&K is so egregious that there is no possibility that anyone can tell you with a straight face that what Pakistan is saying is wrong,” Moeed Yusuf said. To a question why India’s alleged involvement in fomenting terrorism from Afghanistan wasn’t addressed, the NSA opined that one reason was India’s interests with the world such as being a counterweight to China. “There is a clear shift in what the world thinks about India. I’m not taking any credit for ourselves, India is what it’s doing inside the country and the world is seeing that,” he said. Qureshi claimed there was a continuing communications blackout in Kashmir as independent journalists and observers were denied access, while facts were distorted and brutalities went unreported “by design”. He called for unhindered access to the region for journalists, UN and human rights commissions of other international bodies. He said the dossier contained details on a vast range of incidents and atrocities, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, cases of torture, pellet gun injuries and rapes, over 100,000 children being orphaned, false flag operations and planting of weapons on innocent residents to implicate them. He elaborated that most of the references in the dossier were taken from international and Indian media outlets as well as international human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In her anti-India tirade, the human rights minister criticised the European Union for not giving a statement against India’s “annexation” of Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistans-131-page-dossier-accuses-india-of-hosting-isis-camps/articleshow/86151839.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

While a terrorist was killed in an encounter in Thanamandi in J&K's Rajouri district in the morning, a sub-inspector succumbed to his injuries after terrorists attacked a police party in Khanyar area in Srinagar. The operation in Thanamandi continued late into Sunday night.

Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Jammu Zone Mukesh Singh confirmed that one terrorist has been killed. At Khanyar, unidentified militants attacked a police party and shot a probationary sub-inspector Arshid Ahmad from behind. He was later seen being carried away by fellow policemen. DGP Dilbag Singh said that all the previous modules of militants involved in pistol shooting were wiped out and it is suspected that a new group has been formed. “I would not like to disclose about the outfit or module behind today's attack but the perpetrators have been identified and will be brought to justice soon,” he said. Former J&K chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti along with other political leaders strongly condemned the killing of the police officer by militants.

---||India||BJP springs a surprise in Gujarat, picks first-time MLA, a Patel, as new CM||GANDHINAGAR: PM Narendra Modi sprang one of his biggest surprises when the soft-spoken, first-time MLA Bhupendra Patel was anointed as the successor of outgoing Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on Sunday. Following the script penned in New Delhi, Rupani proposed Bhupendra’s name, which was seconded by deputy chief minister Nitin Patel in the presence of central party observers. Read AlsoBhupendra Patel to be next Gujarat chief minister​His name was proposed by CM Vijay Rupani, whose resigned from the post on Saturday. Patel had won the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections from Ghatlodia constituency.Bhupendra, 59, a known aide of former Gujarat CM and Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel, edged out several top party leaders from the CM race. He will now lead the BJP into the crucial assembly polls scheduled in December 2022. Bhupendra, who was Anandiben’s nominee from Ahmedabad’s Ghatlodia constituency after she vacated the seat in 2017, met governor Acharya Devvrat on Sunday evening to stake claim to form the government. He went to the governor after 111 BJP legislators elected him as their leader at the swanky Kamalam, the state BJP headquarters on the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar highway. He will be sworn in on Monday — astrologers have suggested 2.20pm as the most auspicious moment for the ceremony. The CM-designate, who has a diploma in civil engineering, seems to have the blessings of Union home minister Amit Shah too. While state BJP president C R Paatil said the new council of ministers will be announced in the next couple of days, a major reshuffle in the bureaucracy and police is also expected soon. Read AlsoBJP MLA Bhupendra Patel named new Gujarat chief ministerThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday announced that Bhupendra Patel will be the new chief minister of Gujarat. Patel, an MLA from Ghatlodiya constituency, will replace Vijay Rupani, who had resigned from the top post on Saturday.A real estate developer himself, Bhupendra has headed the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) and helmed the standing committee of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, the largest urban local body in Gujarat. Bhupendra is a Kadva Patel and his elevation is likely to help the BJP soothe the tempers of the powerful Patidar community, its loyal vote bank. The community has been somewhat estranged from BJP. That disaffection was reflected in the Aam Aadmi Party’s performance in the Surat Municipal Corporation elections held in February this year — the AAP won 27 seats, all in Patidar-dominated areas. The CM-designate has been actively involved with socio-religious Patidar organisations. He has been a trustee of the Sardardham and the Vishva Umiya Foundation along with the Dada Bhagwan Foundation. The latter association is the reason why he is popularly known as ‘Dada’. Few know that Bhupendra is also a believer in Jainism, a community strongly aligned with BJP in Gujarat. Read AlsoVijay Rupani exits as Gujarat CM, 5th to go in 6 monthsIn an abrupt move, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani resigned on Saturday, becoming the fifth CM to leave the top post in a BJP-ruled state in six months. Rupani’s exit came after helming the state for five years and 36 days, and with just over a year to go for the assembly polls. His departure,His elevation as the chief minister had the BJP’s trademark surprise element stamped all over it. The names of deputy CM Nitin Patel, state BJP president C R Paatil, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, state agriculture minister R C Faldu and Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel were doing the rounds as CM probables. Bhupendra’s name was not even casually discussed in the BJP circles. Kamalam witnessed a flurry of activity on Sunday, as central observers, BJP national leaders and those from the state held a number of closed-door meetings before all leaders and MLAs held a final meeting in which Bhupendra’s name was announced as the next CM. “Sauthi nana ma nano rahis, ane kaam karis (I will remain a common worker for the party). I thank the PM, Amit Shah, J P Nadda, C R Paatil, Vijay Rupani and other leaders. I always have the blessings of Anandiben Patel,” said Bhupendra.

Similarly, legal dreamers (children of H-1B holders who have aged out or will age out, and who have turned 21) will also get a chance to obtain permanent residency and citizenship, according to the portion of the Reconciliation Bill released by the US House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigration. The Bill, however, does not seek to eliminate country caps for green cards, or increase the annual quota of H-1B visas. Cyrus D Mehta, founder of a New York immigration law firm, told TOI, “This is a terrific bill. While it does not have everything, it would allow Indians in the employment green card backlogs to seek a waiver of the numerical limitations by paying a super fee of $5000 at the time of filing their final adjustment of status applications and get green cards.” Annually, the US sets aside only 1.40 lakh green cards for employment-based applicants and there is a 7% cap per country. Given the heavy influx of Indians in the US — majority of them holding an H-1B visa — this restrictive policy poses challenges. Read AlsoRecon bill includes legal dreamers for green cards and provides a path towards US citizenshipThe Reconciliation Bill, in its proposed provisions relating to immigration that was released by the US House Judiciary Committee, has good news in store for legal (documented) dreamers. On payment of a supplemental fee of $ 1500 and passing the requisite law enforcement checks and a medical exam,According to a study by David J Bier, Immigration Policy Analyst at Cato Institute, a Washington-headquartered think-tank, the employment-based green card backlog (EB2 and EB3 skilled category) for those from India had reached 7.41 lakh in April 2020 and had an expected wait time of 84 years. In the context of this Bill, Bier tweeted, “Employment-based applicants can adjust if they have waited two years from their priority date…This is almost like abolishing the employment-based caps for adjustment applicants who can pay $ 5000. Awesome!” Mehta adds, “Many Indians facing backlogs may also qualify under the essential worker provision, which is more generous as it does not need an employer to sponsor them or for them to pay the super fee of $5000.” However, it appears that a fee of $1500 would be payable. Essential workers qualify based on “consistent” income in an essential job between January 31, 2020 and August 24, 2021.

In giving the advice, a bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy quoted 18th century economist Adam Smith, who in his ‘Wealth of Nations’ had said, “The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person”. “Just as the government does not wish for avoidance of tax equally, it is the responsibility of the regime to design a tax system for which a subject can budget and plan. If proper balance is achieved between these, unnecessary litigation can be avoided without compromising on generation of revenue,” Justice Roy said, writing the judgement for the bench. Justice Roy said, "It needs to be observed here that in the taxation regime, there is no room for presumption and nothing can be taken to be implied. The tax an individual or a corporate is required to pay, is a matter of planning for a taxpayer and the Government should endeavour to keep it convenient and simple to achieve maximization of compliance." The assessee banks had raised the following question before the SC — "Whether proportionate disallowance of interest paid by the banks is called for under Section 14A of Income Tax Act for investments made in tax free bonds/ securities which yield tax free dividend and interest to assessee Banks when assessee had sufficient interest free own funds which were more than the investments made." The assessees are scheduled banks and in course of their banking business, they also engage in the business of investments in bonds, securities and shares which earn them, interests from such securities and bonds as also dividend income on investments in shares of companies and from units of UTI etc. which are tax free. Section 14 of the Income Tax Act classifies various incomes under Salaries, Income from house property, Profit & Gains of business or profession, Capital Gains & Income from other sources. Section 14A relates to expenditure incurred in relation to income which are not includable in Total Income and which are exempted from tax. No taxes are therefore levied on such exempted income. Section 14A had been incorporated in the Act to ensure that expenditure incurred in generating such tax exempted income is not allowed as a deduction while calculating total income for the concerned assessee. The banks clarified that none of them maintain separate accounts for the investments made in bonds, securities and shares wherefrom the tax-free income is earned so that disallowances could be limited to the actual expenditure incurred by the assessee. In other words, the expenditure incurred towards interest paid on funds borrowed such as deposits utilized for investments in securities, bonds and shares which yielded the tax-free income, cannot conveniently be related to a separate account, maintained for the purpose. Ruling in favour of the banks, the bench said, "Shares and securities held by a bank are stock in trade, and all income received on such shares and securities must be considered to be business income. That is why Section 14A would not be attracted to such income." "The revenue has failed to refer to any statutory provision which obligates the assessee to maintain separate accounts which might justify proportionate disallowance. The issue framed in these appeals is answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee. The appeals by the assessees are accordingly allowed," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/keep-tax-regime-simple-to-check-dodging-supreme-court-tells-govt/articleshow/86153713.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, Dunwoody Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter said. One person was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Carter said 90% of the building had been searched and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. He said there were reports of two people being unaccounted for. A helicopter and drone circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes. Earlier, the Dunwoody Police Department wrote on social media that they received a report of an explosion at Arrive Apartments shortly before 1:30 p.m. Brandon Winfield, 28, who lives in a building next to the one that collapsed, said he felt lucky that he avoided injury since he had driven by the site minutes before the explosion. “I’m alive. I’m alive,” he said. The collapse reminded him of a terrible accident that happened when he was a teenager, severing his spinal cord while participating in motocross. “I dodged two bullets,” he said. Eboni Thornton told WSB-TV that she was in a moving truck outside the building when it felt like something fell on top of the vehicle. She said the whole vehicle shook. She was shocked at what she saw when she got out of the truck. “The leasing office was collapsed on the left side, the double doors were blown out and I could hear a lady screaming her head off,” Thornton said. Thornton said she saw a couple people limping and bleeding and being carried out of the rubble. Police said they are working with fire officials to determine the cause of the blast in Dunwoody, a suburb just north of Atlanta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/one-injured-as-explosion-collapses-part-of-apartment-building-near-atlanta/articleshow/86153706.cms||---

With four more deaths in the last 24 hours, the toll on Sunday increased to 114, including 88 children. A team of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had identified a dengue outbreak in the district last week. The deaths have continued despite widespread fogging and door-to-door surveys to drain out stagnant water and to arrest the spread of vector-borne diseases. On Sunday, government hospitals continued to scramble to arrange beds while treatment prices in private hospitals have sky-rocketed. Veer Pal, a resident of Bhim Nagar and a daily wager, lost his five-year-old son following lack of treatment for high fever on Sunday. The father told TOI that a private hospital in the city had demanded Rs 30,000 in advance to start treatment. “I requested them to start treatment and give me time to arrange money, but they refused. Later, I took my child to the Firozabad medical college where staff refused to admit my child as beds were not available. I arranged for a private taxi to take us to Agra, but my son died on the way,” Veer Pal said. No official complaint was made in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/12k-bedridden-with-dengue-in-up-dist-88-kids-among-114-dead/articleshow/86153566.cms||Deepak Lavania

A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and B Pugalendhi observed that various kinds of religions and beliefs are in existence in different countries. The places of worship change according to the culture and religion, but only the local language is being used for doing heavenly service in these places. “However, in our country, it is made to believe that Sanskrit alone is God’s language and any other language is not equivalent. No doubt, Sanskrit is an ancient language with enormous ancient literature. The belief is spread in such a way that only if the Sanskrit Vedas are recited, the Gods will listen to the prayers of the devotees,” observed the judges. Referring to various ancient literatures showing the importance given to Tamil hymns at temples, the court said therefore it cannot be said that only one language alone is God’s language. If Tamil hymns cannot be used in temples situated in Tamil Nadu, it cannot be used anywhere else. The judges directed the state government to constitute a committee of Tamil scholars and devotees to identify and consolidate important and ancient Tamil hymns. On receipt of the report, the state government shall take a decision regarding the date from which consecration ceremonies would be conducted in Tamil or by giving equal importance along with Sanskrit, said the judges. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed last year by D Ponnusamy of Chennai who sought a direction to conduct the consecration ceremony of Pasupatheeswarar Temple in Karur district in Tamil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/not-just-sanskrit-hymns-give-primacy-to-tamil-verses-hc/articleshow/86153797.cms||---

The missiles flew 1,500 km (930 miles) before hitting their targets and falling into the country's territorial waters during the tests held on Saturday and Sunday, KCNA said. The development of the missiles provides "strategic significance of possessing another effective deterrence means for more reliably guaranteeing the security of our state and strongly containing the military maneuvers of the hostile forces," KCNA said. The reclusive North has long accused the United States and South Korea of "hostile policy" toward Pyongyang. Talks aimed at dismantling the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in return for US sanctions relief have stalled since 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-test-fires-long-range-cruise-missile-kcna/articleshow/86153955.cms||---

Cholan said the entire drive would take 14 days and curbs on vehicular movement will be in place only in areas where work will be under way. “The entire stretch won’t be closed at any point of time. It will be done in a phased manner and commercial establishments will be functional,” he added. “Sunday night onwards, pavement work will begin and continue for three days. During this period, vehicular movement will not be disturbed. Only when work begins on the carriageway, we will stop vehicular movement in that particular area. It will be done in a phased manner,” explained Cholan. He said the entire plan was discussed with the traders and their consent was taken before going ahead with it. While pavement work will be wrapped up in three days, the carriageway will remain open for vehicle and pedestrian movement. “Once the pavement work is completed, BSCL will take up work on the first 240- metres of the carriageway for six days. Business can continue uninterrupted,” Cholan said. After this stretch is ready, the remaining 300 metres of the carriageway will be taken up for rectification, he added. Cholan said Commercial Street traders were involved in the project discussions and meetings. “The entire stretch (of carriageway) will be developed in two phases and this plan was given by the traders’ association,” he said. The road was redeveloped under Smart City Project and inaugurated in July 2021, but showed signs of damage. Sanjay Motwani, president of Bengaluru Commercial Association, said they have been informed that work would be carried out mostly at night to avoid inconvenience to traders and shoppers. “When revenue minister R Ashoka recently visited the street, he noticed that work was not up to the mark and hence the rectification work was taken up...,” he added. Motwani said vehicles won’t be allowed only when tiles are laid and subsequent curing period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/refix-work-wont-hit-biz-on-comm-st-agency/articleshow/86149774.cms||---

Five armed miscreants chased a 26-year-old rowdy Aravind alias Lee into the stadium and hacked him to death inside the referees' room. Aravind was a resident of New Bagaluru Layout near Lingarajapuram, East Bengaluru. They escaped after entering bylanes in the neighbourhod. The murder caused panic among the public and football players and spectators at the football stadium and a BBMP ground outside it. The murder happened after United FC, Kodagu defeated Young Star 6-0 in the first match of the day. Players from Roots were ready to take on GRK FC in the second match at 4pm. The KSFA-Sporting Planet Women’s A Division League qualifiers were under way. “I was standing near the players’ dressing room when I saw a person jumping down from the gallery and running for his life. There were two or three persons with machetes chasing him. They cornered him in the referees’ room and hacked him to death," an eyewitness told TOI. He added: "Players from the two teams were ready to go onto the pitch when the murder took place. We rushed them back to the dressing room. The match was cancelled and players sent home safely." A KSFA official said security persons couldn't stop the attackers. “They ran in from the BBMP ground opposite the stadium. After the attack, they escaped through a small gate as no one dared stop them. The police sniffer dog went a few hundred metres on Malcolm Road from the crime scene but lost the scent." Police said they have no clue about the motive but suspect his rivals were the killers. “Aravind had two attempt to murder cases against him in 2014 and 2017. We’re investigating whether there’s any connection between the Sunday murder with those cases,” a police officer said.

Students who have not learnt the language in school will have to learn Kannada only for two semesters, instead. According to sources, students from other states and countries will have to study Kannada for two semesters. After the two semesters, they can opt for other languages for the next two semesters. Students who have learnt Kannada in school will have to pursue it for four semesters. However, the government is yet to issue an order to this effect, said officials. Want to make all students learn Kannada Higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan told TOI the department was following the model of Visvesvaraya Technological University where Kannada is taught for two semesters for all. “Those students who have not studied Kananda as a language so far will have study it for two semesters. We want to make all students learn Kannada,” he said. Till now, only engineering and medical colleges students (under Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences) were learning Kannada as a mandatory subject. It was not followed for other undergraduate courses. As per the National Education Policy being implemented from 2021-22 for first-year degree courses, students must study Kannada for four semesters, apart from another language the college offers. Kannada in each semester has three credits. Colleges with large numbers of non-Kannadiga students said it is unfair to expect them to learn the language for four semesters. They expressed concern that students might shy away from Karnataka colleges. Other Indian- and foreign-language departments in colleges were concerned about their future as students were likely to take up English and Kannada. “For students who have not studied Kannada at any point of time or are from other states and countries, it would be difficult to learn the language for very long at this age. For other semesters, they can choose any language,” said an official. Colleges said it would be a relief for students and added they would wait for the official order before offering comment. Thirty-five subcommittees drafting the model syllabus for each subject are likely to submit them by Monday and Tuesday. Universities and autonomous colleges can adopt this syllabus and tweak it to their needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/min-want-to-make-all-students-learn-kannada/articleshow/86156045.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

In February-March, it served system-generated notices to owners on charges of paying tax less than due for four assessment years from 2016-17 to 2019-20. Claiming that owners had chosen the wrong zone, the agency imposed twice the difference amount as penalty and 24% interest per annum. The BBMP admitted the notices were wrongfully issued as it hadn’t informed them about zonal reclassification on which new rates were fixed. It proposed waiver of penalty and interest components and sent it to the government on August 11. “We have sought clarifications. We’ll send the final version to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai who will decide,” said Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary, urban development department. As per the self-assessment scheme designed in 2000, properties are classified under six zones based on guidance value (minimum selling price fixed by the government) of the locality or street and tax rate is fixed accordingly. While Zone A attracts the highest rate, Zone F the lowest. If an owner chooses a lower zone wrongly, she has to pay twice the difference amount and interest. The rules mandate that BBMP reclassifies zones once in three years based on changed rental value and guidance value. This was last done in 2016-17 but was not communicated to taxpayers. While notices have been served to 22,000 property owners, BBMP has collected over Rs 16 crore. With owners crying foul, BBMP is mulling over a refund. “The amount can be adjusted with future tax liability if the government agrees,” said M Venkatachalapathy, joint commissioner (revenue), BBMP. Rules do not permit it and officials said it may attract audit objections. The issue may figure in the monsoon session of the legislature starting Monday with Congress members ready to raise it in both assembly and council. “The government should explain how it will solve this problem,” said MLC PR Ramesh (Congress).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-property-owners-fret-overbbmp-delay-in-penalty-waiver/articleshow/86149776.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

Six persons were killed on the spot while two others succumbed to injuries later in hospital. The incident took place around 4pm, when the jeep with 17 passengers was heading towards Chintamani from Royalpad in Srinivasapur taluk, Kolar district. Both vehicles were moving at a high speed when they collided, M Narayanappa, PSI Kencharlahalli, said. He said the impact of the accident was such that the jeep was dragged for about four metres. The deceased are Venkatalakshmamma ,59, resident of Nareganapalli, near Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh, Munirathnamma, 49, of Gopalli in Chintamani Taluk, Narayanaswamy, 55, resident of Tapateswara Colony in Chintamani and Ramesh ,40, owner-cum-driver of the jeep.

One passenger escaped with minor injuries. The truck driver fled leaving his vehicle behind. Malur legislator KY Nanje Gowda said he was heading from Srinivaspur to Chintamani and was behind the ill-fated jeep when the accident happened. He said the victims were travelling in the private jeep due to lack of affordable and reliable public transport facility. Gowda said a majority of the private operators are greedy and run vehicles without proper permit, licence and insurance cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/8-killed-after-jeep-truck-collide-in-chintamani/articleshow/86150050.cms||---

Following the script penned in New Delhi, Rupani proposed Bhupendra’s name, which was seconded by deputyBhupendra is known to be a close supporter of Anandiben's group and reportedly shares a more than three decade long and strong professional relationship with Ben. He is remembered to be at Ben's side always during her political career as an MLA and later as minister and CM. In Bhupendra’s nomination to helm the top post after the exit of Vijay Rupani, local political leaders see a clear hand of Ben. In fact, leaders aver that Bhupendra got lucky as his name got the stamp of approval of Union home minister Amit Shah as well. There were no surprises then when Bhupendra ensured to acknowledge Ben along with top BJP leadership -- PM Narendra Modi, national BJP president JP Nadda and Amit Shah for entrusting him with the role. "I am lucky to have continuous blessings of former Gujarat CM and UP governor Anandiben Patel," said Bhupendra, who insisted that he had no inkling about his appointment. It can be said that Bhupendra owes his political career to Ben. During her time as revenue and urban development minister, he was appointed as chairman of the standing committee of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in 2010 for four consecutive years. He was also appointed chairman of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority in 2015.

Granted a ticket at the last moment -- his name was on the last list of nominated candidates in 2017 elections -- he did his mentor proud by winning Ghatlodia seat with a record margin of 1.17 lakh votes in Gujarat. With Bhupendra as CM, local leadership expects Ben's say back in the state politics.

Manipur will go to the polls early next year to elect 60 members, for which different parties have begun ground work and rolled up their sleeves for canvassing. A key partner of the BJP-led coalition government in the state, NPP won four seats in the last assembly polls held in March 2017. Currently, the party has two ministers in the government, including the deputy CM. Conrad, who arrived in Imphal on Saturday to chalk out poll strategies, was speaking to reporters during a media conference at Hotel Classic Grande here in the evening. Conrad hinted that the party will decide on post-poll alliance after the declaration of election results. “We will fight the elections on our own, and based on the outcome and political scenario, we will decide how to move ahead. Recently, BJP has also made a statement that they will go to polls on their own,” said Conrad. He said his party will field more than 30 candidates in the assembly election. Stating that several political leaders have recently joined the party and many more are in the queue, he said NPP will become a strong political force in the state and the northeast region. Though NPP supported BJP in forming the coalition government in Manipur, two of its minsters were dropped before completing their full term, which is a violation of commitment, said Conrad. Stating that every political party has its rights to fight polls on its own strategy, Conrad said NPP will put its best possible efforts to win maximum seats in the polls. He added that the party focusses more on improving economy, unemployment, inflation, education, social healthcare, infrastructure development as well as issues related to the youth, women and farmers. Conrad, who chaired a poll-related meeting with party MLAs, leaders, office bearers and intending candidates at the same hotel just after his arrival, said the meeting was productive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/npp-to-go-it-alone-in-manipur-polls-conrad/articleshow/86163175.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

People in the city have no other option but to deal with filthy, stinking surroundings and mosquitoes as door-to-door waste collection, fogging and other maintenance and repair works have come to a halt due to the strike. Though some quantity of trash is being dumped at the Ramachak Bariya landfill site by outsourced workers of Patna Municipal Corporation, their manpower is inadequate to handle the amount of garbage the city generates per day. According to sources, more than 6,000 tonnes of garbage have accumulated in different localities of the city, including posh areas like Boring Road, Bailey Road, Fraser Road, Patliputra, Exhibition Road, Gandhi Maidan and Ashok Rajpath. In Patna, around 1,200 to 1,400 tonnes of trash are generated per day. Rajat Chaudhary, a resident of Lodipur, said even traffic movement has been affected in the area as most part of the road is covered with filth and garbage. “We apprehend spread of viral diseases in the locality. I had to hire a sanitation worker to dump the household garbage as the bins are overflowing,” he added. Himani Singh, a resident of Ashiana Colony, said the longer the trash sits, the dirtier the streets get. “All the efforts of the civic body to keep the city clean would go in vain if the strike continues like this. The state government should take steps to persuade the agitating workers to return to work,” she said. Over 400 sanitation workers protesting at the PMC’s headquarters at Maurya Lok Complex here were adamant on their 12-point charter of demands, including equal pay for equal work, regularisation of jobs, pension and compassionate jobs. Chandra Prakash Singh, president of PMC Staff Union, said the UDHD was giving them verbal assurances only. “We need written assurance,” he added. Pintu Kumar, a sanitation worker, said, “We do not like to make people’s lives miserable by protesting like this. However, we must raise our voice for our rights. This time, we are not throwing trash on the roads. It is just a peaceful protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-stinks-as-sanitation-workers-continue-strike/articleshow/86147286.cms||Faryal Rumi

Speaking at the centenary year celebrations of Tuticorin-based Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, Sitharaman said, “Today, we don’t need to set up new branches in remote areas, as technology has replaced a physical branch. All banking requirements of customers can be met by digitization of banking services.” Digitization is the way forward for any bank, particularly for banks like TMB, the finance minister said. With over Rs 41,000 crore of deposit, of which about Rs 32,000 crore are given as advances by TMB, “If that is the rapidity of which the bank is using the money to make more business. Then, it is more efficient to adopt tech-oriented solutions,” she said. “Digitisation of banks help collect auto-populated data, which in return will support better credit assessment of customers and better lending by banks. Fintech is the biggest area (of business) using which we are able to cross populate data,” she added. TMB’s MD & CEO KV Rama Moorthy said the disbursement of loans to pharma and health care units will be at the heart of a year-long series of events and initiatives from us. The bank will be launching the TMB Mobile DigiLobby and a Mobile vaccination drive to support our communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digitization-helps-banks-with-data-collection-aids-better-credit-assessment/articleshow/86148970.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Currently LIC, which is governed by a special law, is allowed to transfer 5% of its surplus to the shareholders’ fund. The remaining 95% goes to the policyholders’ fund for paying bonus on eligible life insurance policies. In case of other life insurance companies, which are regulated through the Insurance Act, the permissible allocation is in the ratio of 90:10. With the IPO planned in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal, the government intends to bring parity to make investment into LIC an equally attractive proposition, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. “It’s only natural that investors will expect a similar structure. We are working out the details, along with a few other changes,” a government source said.  The Centre hopes that this will help balance the interests of shareholders and policyholders and still make the IPO attractive for investors. The government is also expected to clarify the level of foreign investment that will be permitted in the company after its listing. Currently, up to 74% foreign direct investment (FDI) is allowed in the insurance business, but LIC is expected to be governed by a special dispensation. LIC’s valuation surplus is arrived at after calculating its entire liabilities in respect of the business that it has already underwritten. This means that policyholders with term insurance, guaranteed return policies and unit-linked plans will not be impacted by dividend distribution policies. It is only the participating policies where the benefits are determined by the level of bonus that will be affected. According to industry sources, a change in the payout ratio will not make as significant a difference to policyholders as, say, a reduction in RBI’s policy rate. For private companies, the profits from selling protection also account for a significant portion of their profits. Any surplus that a private insurer makes from selling protection goes entirely to the policyholders. In the case of LIC, the profits are shared between the government and other policyholders. Changing the dividend distribution policy will benefit shareholders but can, again, impact existing participating policyholders. The government believes that several individuals who have purchased life covers from the insurance behemoth will also buy LIC shares during the IPO as a certain percentage of the issue will be reserved for them. This will entitle them to dividends in the coming years. For LIC’s policyholders, the greatest attraction is that whatever has been promised in the policy will continue to be guaranteed by the government. The government, while amending the LIC Act, has retained section 27, which states that the sums assured by all policies issued by the corporation — including any bonuses declared in respect thereof and all bonuses — shall be guaranteed as payment in cash by the central government. A senior government official said that the department of investment and public asset management will work out the details of the proposed issue based on the embedded value that is currently being worked out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-plans-to-revamp-lics-rules-for-sharing-surplus/articleshow/86162348.cms||Mayur Shetty

Then he will go to Birsa Chowk and garland the statue of tribal icon Bhagwan Birsa Munda. In the same evening, Tejashwi will hold a meeting with the party’s core committee members in Jharkhand,” senior RJD leader and former Jharkhand MLA Radha Krishna Kishore told TOI over phone on Sunday. Kishore, who was in Patna on Sunday to formally invite Tejashwi, said the RJD leader would also hold separate meetings with some senior party leaders and discuss issues related to the state during his two-day stay at Ranchi. “On September 19, Tejashwi will address a workers’ meeting in the Dibdih area. Party workers from many parts of Jharkhand have been invited to that meeting,” Kishore said. RJD’s Jharkhand unit president Abhay Singh held a meeting with senior party leaders in Ranchi on Saturday to review the preparations to accord a grand welcome to Tejashwi. Contacted over phone, Singh told TOI that RJD has decided to make 10 lakh new members to expand the party’s base in almost all districts. “When Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in November 2000, the Lalu Prasad-led RJD had nine members in the first Jharkhand assembly. But the number of MLAs reduced to seven after the 2005 assembly polls and five after the 2009 assembly polls,” a senior RJD leader said. Currently, the RJD has only one MLA, Satyanand Bhokta, who is also a cabinet minister in the Hemant Soren-led coalition government in Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-to-visit-ranchi-for-2-days-on-sept-18/articleshow/86147477.cms||Madan Kumar

The Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) in a press release here on Sunday said it is going to establish 23 skill colleges at an estimated cost of Rs 460 crores. Skill training centres are being developed on an area of five acres in each Parliamentary constituency at an estimated cost of about Rs 20 crores. Built on an area of 45,520 square feet, skill colleges will be designed to house six classrooms, two labs, two workshops, a startup lab, admin and staff rooms. Hostels will also be built to accommodate 126 people. Similarly, the government has also selected two priority courses in each college to suit the needs of the area. The course duration ranges between three to six months depending on the sector. “The idea of the government is to reduce the unemployment rate in the state by giving training to the youth where the industries are located, taking advantage of the opportunities to hire those who have completed the training there. That is why we are fully focused on this programme. More than 40 reputed companies are ready to partner with the government in skill development,” the release stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/apssdc-to-set-up-23-skill-colleges-at-rs-460cr/articleshow/86148653.cms||---
---||Business||FM: Vax only way for eco recovery||Chennai: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday underlined the need for vaccination to not just help avert a possible third wave of Covid infections but also to step up economic activity, describing it as the only medicine that allows people to go about their business. “Vaccination programme has been going on smoothly in the country and, so far, 73 crore people have already received jabs... Through the vaccination programme, people were able to conduct business, traders were able to procure products to run businesses, boosting the economy, or farmers were able to do farming. So, vaccination is the only medicine,” she said at the centenary year celebrations of the Tuticorin-based Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB). Sitharaman’s team of economists in the finance ministry has repeatedly pushed for a ramp-up of vaccination for faster economic growth. In fact, in the latest monthly assessment of the economy, the economic division in the ministry had suggested heightened caution against the highly infectious virus amid the festival season, especially with Kerala and Maharashtra accounting for nearly 70% of the cases. On Sunday, the FM said that the support through viability gap funding will also help bolster the healthcare system to deal with a possible third wave. Sitharaman said hospitals located in rural areas were able to take up expansion work by availing of the schemes announced by her ministry. “Through the report by TMB, we are able to see that they take the schemes announced by the ministry to the beneficiaries (such as hospitals)… Not only public sector banks, private sector banks should also follow,” she said while asserting that every individual is entitled to banking service. The FM also said that public sector banks appeared to be stable now. “The problems faced by the banking sector affects the business dependent on the banks too. With increased bad loans leading to the government bailing out the banks through developmental or growth finance, the banks’ energy and resources were diverted towards recovery of loans,” she said. Sitharaman said that banks had to digitise to offer better services in the coming years. “Today, we don’t need to set up new branches in remote areas, as technology has replaced a physical branch.” The finance minister also stressed that tech-related solutions take away other kinds of problems and fintech is the biggest area (of business), using which we are able to cross-populate data. Such auto-populated data helps in better credit assessment of customers and better lending by banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-vax-only-way-for-eco-recovery/articleshow/86151630.cms||Mamtha Asokan

They, however, feared that the cutoff would be higher than previous years this time. The exams were held at 126 centres across the city amid Covid safety measures. Around 56,000 candidates appeared for the offline exam in the city. M S Ahmed, principal of Kendriya Vidyalaya-Danapur and one of the coordinators of NEET, said no untoward incident occurred at any centre. “I supervised 24 exam centres and found 13,320 students writing papers. The exams passed off peacefully,” he said. Yashaswini Suman, who passed Class XII from Notre Dame Academy and took NEET, said all the questions were direct and from NCERT book. “Nothing was out of syllabus. Biology was easiest among the three subjects. In physics, all the questions were formula-based. However, there were some questions on memory-based concept in chemistry. As the paper was easy, I think the cut-off marks would be higher than the previous years,” she said. Prachi Prasun, a DAV Public School passout, said physics section was comparatively easier and all the questions were from syllabus. “Since, I had prepared a lot throughout the lockdown, I am hopeful of qualifying the test. Biology section was easy and chemistry moderate,” she said. “The calculations were not lengthy at all in physics section. I was quite happy when I went through the paper. The questions I had solved during the preparations were very tough and lengthy,” said Shashank Kumar Singh, another medical aspirant. Karan Verma, who also appeared for NEET, said, “It was my first attempt. Biology and chemistry sections were easy. The questions were asked from NCERT books. Physics was also easy, but a bit lengthy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/neet-students-find-paper-easy-but-expect-high-cutoff/articleshow/86147480.cms||Faryal Rumi

As a result, used cars have seen a 5-10% increase in prices and online transactions have surged by 25% on organised players’ platforms like Droom, OLX, Cars24 and others in the April-August period. “We have seen used car demand shoot through the roof from April to August. In April, we did business of $130 million, which is now at $165 million. In terms of units, 7,500 used cars have now gone up to 10,000. Used car listings on our platform have increased from 900,000 in April to 1.1 million now,” said Droom founder-CEO Sandeep Aggarwal. Most of the jump in sales is in bestselling models. “Between Q4FY21 to Q2FY22, sales of fast-moving models like Alto 800, Scorpio, Santro and WagonR on our platform have gone up 55%, 42%, 37% and 23% respectively,” said OLX Autos CEO Amit Kumar. This has also meant an increase in prices. “Prices are up 5%, but used cars are still bargain buys,” said Droom’s Aggarwal. “Price of best-selling models are up 3-10%,” said OLX’s Kumar. Pre-owned car marketers say that the ongoing chip shortage in the auto industry — which has hit production ramp-up before the festival season — will further boost sales of second-hand vehicles. “Now that the auto industry is facing the chip shortage crisis, production will see a significant decline in the coming months. With the upcoming festive season and decline in production of new cars, the demand for pre-owned cars is expected to witness a significant uptick,” said Kunal Mundra, CEO of Cars India, CARS24. New car dealers have already said that with stocks at around 25 days, the festival season will be lacklustre this year because car companies will not be able to produce enough. Used car inventory too has come down due to high demand — from 19.2 days in January-March to 18.7 days in July-September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-chip-woes-brake-auto-cos-used-cars-take-off/articleshow/86151540.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

With discoms facing a severe financial crisis, the state government came to their rescue and released Rs 28,166 crore to power companies between 2019-20 and 2020-21. Of the total electricity subsidy arrears of Rs 13,388 crore as on March 31, 2019, the state government released Rs 11,442 crore between 2019 and 2021. It also provided Rs 16,724 crore for power subsidy and other charges during the same period. Discoms paid Rs 64,007 crore towards power purchase costs. During a teleconference with chairmen & managing directors (CMDs) of discoms, energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said Andhra Pradesh has created a niche for itself in the power sector and achieved new records in implementing cost-effective power measures. “The state government now wants to strengthen the sector and conduct a capacity building programme for power sector professionals for successful implementation of new initiatives of the government,” said Srikant. The CMDs explained that the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) had earlier given permission to recover true up charges to the tune of Rs 3,669 crore. The decision was made taking the financial distress of discoms into consideration and without giving much inconvenience to consumers. CMDs H Haranatha Rao, K Santhosha Rao and J Padma Janardhana Reddy justified the true up charges issued by APERC. Srikant Nagulapalli said chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had emphasised the need to protect consumer interests in the power sector. “The chief minister asked the power utilities to keep public interest in mind while taking any steps or initiating any programme in the power sector. We are seeking the support of our esteemed electricity consumers and are strongly committed to continuing the welfare schemes in any case. The support of consumers will give moral strength to the department that is working for the benefit of consumers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/govt-asks-discoms-to-be-consumer-centric/articleshow/86148559.cms||---

He said, mayoral elections across the country was flawed and their tenures varied from 1-5 years. The convocation, which was inaugurated by urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon, was attended by 70 mayors from across the country. “In some cities, the 74th amendment is in force, while in others it is not. Some Mayors are directly elected by people, while others indirectly by corporators. If 74th amendment is uniformly implemented, it will be easy to provide civic amenities to citizens as all departments will be interlinked. Development will be seamless if water and municipal corporations and development authorities work in tandem,” said Jain. If the municipal corporation constructs a road, water corporation begins digging to lay pipelines, he added. The mayors’ council appeals to chief minister Yogi Adityanath to implement 74th amendment in Uttar Pradesh, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayors-council-demands-one-nation-one-election-rule-for-mayors-implementation-of-74th-amendment/articleshow/86152218.cms||---

The diamonds, collectively weighing 156.46 carats, were quarried from mines in the district, Panna's diamond officer Ravi Patel told media persons on Sunday. A carat is a unit of mass equalling 200 milligrams and is used for measuring diamonds and other such gems. These precious stones also include a 14.09 carat diamond, which was found by a labourer in Februrary this year and remained unsold in the previous auction, he said. It is expected to be the main attraction and may fetch about Rs 70 lakh, officials said, adding that it will be the biggest gem to be put up for the auction this time. According to officials, the proceeds from the auction of the raw diamonds would be given to the respective miners after deduction of government royalty and taxes. In February, a labourer and his partners found the 14.09 carat diamond in a mine which they had taken on lease near Krishna Kalyanpur village in the district.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Sanskarnagari sinks in just 3 inches of rain||VADODARA: Three inches of rain in just two hours and the city started to float at many places even in the heart of the city itself, forget the peripheral areas. In fact, many houses near Kashi Vishwanath Temple were inundated for hours on Saturday too. Until Sunday evening, several parts on the eastern periphery of the city remained inundated since the rainfall of September 10. Vadodara is not new to downpours with the city experiencing heavy to very heavy rainfall in the past. However, it is only in recent years that heavy rainfall for a couple of hours only can convert into major flood woes for the citizens. Environmentalists and urbanists blame the frequent waterlogging in the city to the ‘disturbed’ geography and topography of the region in the last two decades. “Vadodara’s topography is not flat and there are several undulations. The topology of the intricate landscape has been overlooked completely in the process of random planning,” said Sanjeev Joshi, an architect urbanist. “The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) or the Vadodara Urban Development Authority (VUDA) should plan the town planning schemes keeping the topography of the city in mind and should take cognizance of rampant construction activities,” Joshi told TOI. Joshi further said that for centuries Vadodara has an inter-connected network of a river, nullahs, wetlands and ponds. However, haphazard construction of buildings and roads has disturbed this inter-connectivity due to which the issue of waterlogging has become frequent in the past few years. Joshi also said that several channels have been lost. These wetlands and channels have been filled over the years for developing buildings or roads. “Many wetlands and ponds have been filled up, but there are still many left and these can be reservoirs to prevent waterlogging,” he added. A past study by city-based Gujarat Ecology Society (GES) has also revealed that Vadodara has lost around 40 hectares of wetlands. This area is equal to the size of eight Sursagar ponds put together. “As these wetlands have been lost, water comes on road,” said Dr Deepa Gavali, director of GES. “Just before monsoon, the civic body had laid a new storm water drain from Shannen School to Mukhinagar yet, our roads are inundated,” said Tejas Brahmbhatt, a resident of Khodiyarnagar. On the night of September 10, phones of several councillors kept ringing as water had started entering their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sanskarnagari-sinks-in-just-three-inches-of-rain/articleshow/86149247.cms||---

Sharing his letter on his Twitter handle, Chirag hoped the PM’s affection and blessings for his family will continue. “Sir, you have summarised the whole life of my father in your own words and honoured the work done by him for the society. You have shown your affection towards him. This letter gives strength to my family and me,” Chirag tweeted. In his heartfelt letter, PM Modi said it was an emotional day for him. “I miss him (Ram Vilas Paswan) as a friend. I also sense the loss that Indian politics has suffered because of his death,” the PM, in his one and a half page letter wrote, calling his former cabinet colleague a great son of the nation and a strong voice for social justice. “Those youths who want to serve the country through the political route must take lessons from the life of Ram Vilas Paswan. Even after reaching the top, he was always available and cordial for his fellow workers. He believed in dialogue and cordial relationship. This is the reason he had such good relationship with political leaders,” the PM wrote. But the event did not pass off without political comments as politicians cutting across party lines, except from JD(U), paid tributes to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founder on his first death anniversary as per the ‘tithi’. Governor Phagu Chauhan and several BJP ministers and leaders apart from RJD and Congress visited Chirag’s residence to pay their tributes. CM Nitish Kumar also paid tribute to the late Dalit leader through a statement. When asked about it, Chirag told this newspaper: “It has given me another opportunity to attack him (Nitish). I will continue to raise my voice against the misrule of CM Nitish.” Chirag said he he had sought time from the CM to personally invite him, but he did not oblige. “I wanted him (Nitish) to be here. But he sent a condolence message. It would have been better, had he come to grace the occasion,” Chirag said. Meanwhile, Union minister Pashupati Kumar Paras turned emotional for a while when his nephew Chirag went to receive him on the occasion. With tears rolling down his cheeks, Paras offered floral tributes to his elder brother Ram Vilas. The relationship between Paras and Chirag got bitter after the former caused a split in the LJP and became its president with the support of five of the six party MPs. Paras stayed there hardly for 15 minutes. However, Chirag’s cousin Prince Raj, who is Samastipur MP and was supposed to come, remained conspicuous by his absence. Prince Raj is also the state chief of LJP (Paras faction). Leader of opposition in Bihar legislative assembly and RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav hugged Chirag and touched his mother Reena Paswan’s feet after paying floral tributes to “guardian” Ram Vilas. Apparently pleased with the huge response received from all the political parties, except Nitish’s JD(U), Chirag said he is proud to be the son of such a towering personality. “I am saying this not because I am his son. For the last several years, he did a lot for society, especially for the Dalits and the backward classes. So, he deserves respect, Chirag said and added: “I also want to build his statue so that the coming generations get inspiration to do something for the society.” Earlier, the Jamui MP reiterated his demand for conferring Bharat Ratna award posthumously on the departed leader. BJP Rajya Sabha member and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had supported the demand for installing a statue of Ram Vilas in Patna.

Unlike dry ganja, hashish oil is easy to conceal and transport. Parts of Vizag Agency and Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) are among the few locations in the region where locals, with the support of interstate gangs, are producing the contraband. Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) officials are in the process of identifying the kingpins of hashish oil production and smuggling gangs. Speaking to TOI, assistant enforcement superintendent of SEB, DVG Raju said they recently seized 25 kg of hashish oil and nabbed a smuggler. “The accused said the price of one kg of hashish oil was around Rs 1 lakh and it may cost Rs 5 lakh in bigger markets. We have formed a team to conduct a deeper investigation into the illegal trade,” he added. “Our investigation revealed that the oil was produced in remote areas of G Madugula mandal in Vizag Agency. The gangs are operating from Maoist-affected areas in the Agency and AOB. They produce the contraband by processing dry ganja using some machinery. We suspect the role of interstate smugglers from Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the illegal business,” Raju added. Most customers of hashish oil are college students and young employees of private firms. Extracted from the cannabis plant, hashish oil has a higher concentration of tetra hydro cannabinol (THC), a psychoactive chemical that disrupts nerve cells in the brain. It can have serious health hazards,” said Dr Uma Mahendra Raj of Greenvalley Foundation, which deals with substance-addicted patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hashish-oil-turns-smugglers-choice-after-repeated-seizures-of-dry-ganja/articleshow/86148550.cms||Nalla.Babu

The trouble started when one Md Irshad Alam was barricading his land to build a house. Enraged over Irshad’s act, one Md Kaushar reached the spot and opened fire. The bullet, however, missed the target. When Irshad’s brother Jehangir Alam came forward, he was shot by Kaushar from a close range. Jehangir was rushed to the referral hospital at Rupauli where he was declared brought dead. Police said four people from rival group led by Kaushar also suffered injuries when they were attacked with lethal weapons. The four – Sabina Khatoon, Jainab Khatoon, Anguri and Md Muslim – were rushed to the sadar hospital in Purnia where Md Muslim died during treatment. Irshad’s wife Rehana Khatoon told the police that the dispute over one-bigha land was continuing for the past one decade. The matter was still pending in the court. However, both the groups were called at a meeting convened by the local panchayat to settle the issue. However, Kaushar refused to abide by the decision of the panchayat, which led to fresh tension. Purnia SP Dayashankar said a country-made pistol was recovered from the spot. “Armed police personnel have deployed at the village to avoid any untoward incident,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-killed-3-hurt-over-land-dispute-in-purnia/articleshow/86147612.cms||Ramashankar

People and organisations dealing in machines celebrate the day with deep reverence while residents generally offer puja to their electronic belonging and vehicles. On this day, construction works remain suspended owing to the celebration. At the railway coaching depots, the day is celebrated with much fanfare. Chief public relations officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway, Rajesh Kumar, told this newspaper that Vishwakarma Puja is celebrated at all wagon repair centres, wagon post care centres, coaching depots such as Rajendra Nagar terminal, Danapur and Harnaut station among others. Ram Lal Khetan, president of Bihar Industries Association (BIA), said all the factories and their workers perform puja this day. “However, the association does not conduct any separate puja on this occasion,” he said. For owners and workers of micro and small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the puja will be a low-key affair this time, too, amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Several auto, e-rickshaw and cab drivers remain off the road on September 17. Santosh Kumar, an auto driver, said after performing the prayer service, he would resume the work. “It is an auspicious day,” he said. Akhilesh Singh, the owner of an electronic shop at Hariniwas Complex, said, “We are giving offers and discounts on different gadgets, including laptops, bluetooth, headset and different computer parts from September 14.” The other electronics and electrical shops have also come up with exciting offers for the residents. Sanchit Verma, a resident of B M Das Road, said the prices of commodities and stuff for puja remain generally high ahead of Vishwakarma Puja. “But with the blessings of the Lord, business was better than previous year. This time we will also pray for the situation to get better by next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/preparations-on-for-vishwakarma-puja/articleshow/86147682.cms||Faryal Rumi

The victim, in her complaint, alleged that Kanhaiya Yadav and Sawan Yadav dragged her husband to a secluded place and mercilessly thrashed after he refused to pay them Rs500 as extortion for food and liquor. The victim said Sawan came to her saying she she should meet Kanhaiya and seek pardon otherwise her husband will be killed. Out of fear, she went to meet him, but her husband had managed to flee somehow. She alleged that Kanhaiya, brandishing a pistol and threatening her with dire consequences, raped her and also asked Sawan to do the same. The victim alleged that she somehow managed to get herself free from their clutches and took shelter in a nearby house where she was given clothes. She told the police that people gathered and informed the police. City SP Swarn Prabhat, when contacted, said on Sunday raids were being conducted to arrest them. “We are also looking into the criminal antecedents of the accused,” he said and added that the medical examination of the victim has been conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/25-year-old-gang-raped-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/86147489.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||Family & political relations are different things: Pashupati Kumar Paras||PATNA: Union food processing industries minister Pashupati Kumar Paras seems to be in no mood to reconcile with his nephew and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, who is engaged in a bitter tussle of power to regain his status as the LJP supremo. Though Paras attended the ‘barsi’ (death anniversary as per ‘tithi’) of his elder brother and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, organised by Chirag in Patna, he hardly stayed there for 15 minutes after paying floral tributes to his elder brother and political mentor. Talking to this reporter, the Hajipur MP said attending a family function is altogether a different matter. “Earlier, I used to organise any programme or function. It is unfortunate that today I have been invited to attend the event,” he asserted. Elaborating it further, the Union minister said blood relation is different from political relations. The two should not be linked with each other, he said, adding that the situation in which he had been invited was obvious. He, however, thanked Chirag for inviting him to the event. Paras reiterated that he would have attended the first 'barsi' of his elder brother even if Chirag had not invited him. He said Ram Vilas Paswan was like a God to him. “What I am today is because of him. His blessings are always with us,” he said, giving a clear indication that he was in no mood of reconciliation. The invitation cards mentioned Paras as a member of the bereaved family. The names of Samastipur MP Prince Raj and two other cousins were also printed as RSVPs on the invitation cards. In addition, both the groups — Paras and Chirag — have announced separate functions to commemorate the death anniversary of Ram Vilas on October 8 as per the Gregorian calendar. Chirag said on Sunday he would organise a function at Bapu Auditorium in Patna. “If dignitaries like President and Prime Minister give their consent to grace the event, the venue may be shifted to Delhi,” he told this newspaper. Paras earlier said he would organise a function in Delhi on October 8 to recall the contributions of the departed leader. “I will invite Chirag and his family members to attend it,” he had said. Both the leaders claim themselves to be the political heir to Ram Vilas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/family-political-relations-are-different-things-paras/articleshow/86147455.cms||Ramashankar

The health authorities said they were planning to intensify the vaccination drive by adding more staff as the availability of vaccines is increasing steadily. “During recent times, the number of vaccines received has been on the higher side. The pace of vaccination has also increased during the same period. We are now planning to increase it further,” deputy collector Ganesh Misal, who is also the district nodal officer for vaccination, said. The district recently achieved the highest number of vaccination — 76,485 in a single day — and the administration is targeting to inoculate 1 lakh people in a single day. “There was hesitancy about vaccine especially in the rural areas of tribal talukas of the district, but that is now history. People are now forthcoming for the vaccination,” the officer said. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has appreciated the efforts put in by the health officials in constantly vaccinating the beneficiaries. The district received one lakh doses of vaccine on Friday and the same will be distributed to the vaccination centres on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-zp-aim-to-intensify-vaccination-drive/articleshow/86145459.cms||---

Altogether 1,51,046 samples were tested across the state in the last 24 hours. The day also saw two more people recuperating from the virus, taking the state’s recovery rate to 98.65%. Of 7,25,827 people who got infected with Covid-19 since the outbreak of the virus in March last year, 7,16,088 have recovered. Active cases in the state stood at 81 on Sunday. The number of active cases has increased by 47% in the past one week as it was 55 on September 6 and 7. Patna has maximum active cases at 18. Twenty-three districts, on the other hand, have less than 10 active cases.

---||Business||Low Covid cases sink vitamin sales||Mumbai: As Covid cases reduce and the severity of its impact wanes, consumers appear to be popping lesser immunity supplements. Sales of health and multi-vitamin supplements — including the widely sold and highly popular Zincovit, A to Z and Becosules — have plummeted after May-June as the Covid caseload declined in most parts of the country. This was one of the fastest-growing therapies in the organised pharma retail market last year, with sales of Zincovit among the top pecking order. The latest data culled from a pharma research firm by TOI, along with a survey on patient billings of health supplements, indicate that purchases have nearly halved during the July-August period from the corresponding period of the previous year. Immunity supplements witnessed a downslide, from being present in 92% of bills in June 2020 to around 49% in August this year. For instance Zincovit, manufactured by Chennai firm Apex Labs, after hitting the highest monthly sales ever of over Rs 80 crore in May, dropped by over 60% in July. Last year in October, the 30-year-old brand dethroned the largest-selling Human Mixtard (insulin). Experts said substantial sales of multi-vitamins assume significance in a market where the top order is dominated by anti-diabetic therapies, indicating a strong need to prop one’s immunity during a raging pandemic. During May, other supplements like Becosules (Pfizer), A to Z (Alkem) and Shelcal (Torrent) also recorded high sales of Rs 30-50 crore, according to healthcare service provider IQVIA. Vitamin D plain & combinations, and Vitamin C also witnessed high sales after the resurgence of Covid this year. A similar trend had played out in August last year, with 74% of retail billings having at least one immunity booster, while this year it declined to 49% in the same month. In the first week of September, it further reduced to 43%, a study of over 2 lakh bills by research firm Pronto Consult showed. Pronto Consult founder Karishma Atul Shah said, “There was a nearly 58% drop in the purchases of immunity boosters in August as compared to the corresponding period last year. However, there was an increase in antibacterials and derma-related brands. Chronic brands were also purchased, but lower as compared to August last year.” Though there’s been a drop over the last few months, sales of vitamins and immunity supplements are still 20-30% higher than the pre-Covid level, a top executive with a market player said. Presumably, companies ramped up production to meet the higher demand. The Pronto Consult study says that increase in cases of viral infections, dengue, stomach-related ailments, headache, itchy eyes and sneezing seem to have pushed purchases of acute-related therapies. Hygiene products have seen huge spurts and continue the trend of being present in bills. Overall, the pharma retail market jumped nearly 14% to Rs 1.73 lakh crore (12-year period ended July), buoyed by higher sales of acute therapies of anti-infectives and respiratory drugs, and certain chronic medication including anti-diabetics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/low-covid-cases-sink-vitamin-sales/articleshow/86151500.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

Police said one Kiran Devi had spat on the face of her relative, Kodai Mahto, at Jasauli village under the Kathaiya police station area around 10am. Kodai, who had returned from the local market, replied to his younger brother’s wife Kiran in the same manner, leading to an altercation. Kodai, a daily wager, was subsequently attacked by his brother Dhanai Mahto and his accomplices with bricks and sticks. The injured was rushed to the primary health centre where he succumbed to his injuries. The victim’s wife, Urmila Devi, has lodged an FIR against her husband’s brother and his wife in connection with the case. She alleged that her husband had lent Rs 50,000 to Dhanai about a year ago. But he was not serious about returning the money. On Sunday, when her husband visited his younger brother’s house, his wife spat on his face and hurled abuses. SHO of Kathaiya police station Santosh Kumar Rajak said four suspects have been detained for interrogation in connection with the incident. While Kodai died, seven others – Subodh Mahto, Binod Mahto, Shobha Devi, Dhanai Mahto, Kanti Devi, Anil Mahto and Chandan Mahto – were injured in the clash that broke out after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-killed-for-spitting-on-face-of-kin/articleshow/86147539.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Deltasura set for pandal debut to spread awareness||Kolkata: This year, Kumartuli has received several orders for a different kind of asura idol — the Deltasura. With the threat of a possible third wave and the delta-plus variant looming over the festivities, a number of puja organizers and artisans have decided to use their creativity during Durga Puja to raise awareness about the disease. The idea was conceived by a few organizers from the city and its outskirts. Idol-makers in Kumartuli said they are ready to go along with the organizers as long as it propagates their imagination and creativity. Indrajit Pal, an artisan at Kumartuli, has received four orders for Deltasura and is confident of getting a few more. So is Sujit Pal, treasurer of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Association, who had conceptualized the Coronasura last year. “It is our way to raise awareness. People remember our work and there cannot be a greater satisfaction than helping people develop awareness about the pandemic,” said Indrajit. Indrajit has introduced a number of changes from the Coronasura. “They were all painted black last year. But now, with the arrival of vaccines, we have the capability to fight back. This year, all Asuras are coloured steel, a mixture of white (good) and black (evil). The Asuras’ ornaments have been given the shape of the delta variant as observed from the internet and I have made the Asuras look fiercer and angrier,” he said. Arnab Chowdhury, secretary of Rabindra Memorial Sporting Club near Picnic Garden, has ordered a Deltasura. “It will raise awareness and send a message of Maa Durga slaying coronavirus,” he said. The Chingripota Dulatpur Sarbajanin Puja at Batanagar has decided to install the special Asura to “spread positivity amidst testing times for the second year running”. For Shibtola Sadharan Sangha in Amtala, this will be a wake-up call for November when the third wave is likely to leave a lasting impact. Club secretary Tarun Kumar Mondal said, “We chose to have a Deltasura as the Covid situation between October and December will be critical. We want people to be aware of the impending health threat.” “We only have images used in newspapers and on TV. So I am creating the asura based on that,” said Sujit. “Such efforts will help develop community consciousness. But organizers must display some cautionary rules around the pandal,” said Aishwarya Ghosh, who has been treating Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deltasura-set-for-pandal-debut-to-spread-awareness/articleshow/86149485.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Stringent action should be taken against employees of outlets who flout the rule,” he added. He said the price list of liquor bottles should be kept visible to the consumer and only the actual MRP could be charged. Anyone found violating the rules will face departmental action immediately. The minister said bars are not currently allowed to operate and they will remain closed until further orders. “If any such outlets are found to be operating, a case will be registered against the shop salesman and supervisor concerned and disciplinary action will be taken,” he said. “The surroundings of liquor shops should be kept clean and guidelines should be followed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The general public should be asked to wear facemasks and maintain social distancing,” he added.

Air conditioners are getting pricier as raw material prices and increase in sea freight push up production costs. Johnson Controls - Hitachi Air Conditioning India, the joint venture company of Johnson Controls and Hitachi Appliances which makes ‘Hitachi’ brand air conditioners in India, is all set to take its third price increase since January 2021 to compensate for the cost pinch. “More price hikes are inevitable as there has been a 15% increase in input costs since January 2021. We have already increased prices twice to the tune of 5% and we will have to take another 5% increase very shortly,” said Gurmeet Singh, CMD, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India. Sea freight rates, he added, have doubled along with prices of copper and steel. The global shortage of semiconductor chips has also hurt production. The company, which is preparing to invest Rs 100 crore this year on tools, dies and energy-efficient new products, is battling supply chain disruption due to container shortage. “We now have to order parts 9-12 months in advance," said Singh adding that the AC market is facing sales uptick in India thanks to work from home demands. "By January 20222, we should see a 25% growth over 2019 levels,” he added. The company, which currently enjoys around 7% share of the southern market though its national marketshare is 12% has announced its aggressive expansion plans to scale up its channel partner network in south India. It opened a Hitachi brand outlet ‘Hitachi Home’ in Puducherry for both room AC as well as commercial air conditioners. “We are relatively weaker in southern markets so we will aggressively build presence in this region,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hitachi-air-conditioners-to-get-dearer-by-5/articleshow/86140928.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

But the sale of hair thus offered by devotees at the Male Mahdeshwaraswamy temple in Chamarajanagar district has earned the shrine’s management close to Rs 1.5 crore. The Male Mahadeshwara Kshetra Development Authority auctioned the hair offered by devotees over 99 days inviting manual and e-tender. Authorities at the temple said that they collected nearly 4.6 tonnes of short hair, and 951.2kg of long hair between November 2, 2020 and August 2, 2021. Many of the devotees who rushed to the temple towards the end of 2020, when it reopened its doors after it was closed owing to the pandemic, offered their hair as an offering to the deity at Male Mahadeshwaraswamy temple. Shrinivasa Mahadevan, a resident of Mysuru, was among those who made a successful bid to purchase the long hair offered at the shrine. Solaimuttu from Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu, bought the short hair, for which he quoted a price of Rs 34.5 per kg. In 2020, a kg of long hair had fetched the temple management Rs 7,400, while the short hair was sold for Rs 12 a kilo. Secretary of Sri Male Mahadeshwaraswamy Kshetra Development Authority Jayavibhava Swamy said that they sold the hair for record-high prices this year. “We received record-high offer for the long hair via e-tender this year, while the bid for the short hair, which was made through a manual tender, was also an unprecedented sum. We earned Rs 1.5 crore through sale of hair,” Swamy said. President of Mysuru District Savita Samaja NR Nagesh, a businessman involved in trade of hair, said, “There is a huge gap in the supply chain as far as hair is concerned. MM Hills, Kukke Subrahmanya temple, Tirupati and Nanjangud are the pilgrimage centres where a considerable amount of hair is collected from devotees. The price of long hair ranges between Rs 6,000 and Rs 16,000/ kg depending on the quality. And the hair thus collected is exported.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mm-hills-shrine-collects-rs-1-5-crore-through-sale-of-devotees-hair/articleshow/86148536.cms||Shrinivasa M

Only candidates were allowed access to the 48 examination centres in Kolkata. The test was held simultaneously across the country, with strict surveillance of observers sent by the National Testing Agency. Stringent restrictions were in place for students, guardians and hosting authorities. Barricades had been erected 100m to 300m from the main entrance of exam centres and circles were drawn to ensure physical distance. Guardians were not allowed to cross the barricades. No gathering was allowed in front of the centres. Students were allowed to enter from 10.30am, though the exam started from 2pm and continued till 5pm. Centre authorities were instructed not to interact with media persons. A city-based school principal said, “We were instru-cted not to reveal anything regarding the examination. Everything was monitored by NTA’s observers and they even arranged the security and sanitization.” The test was a big relief for students. Avik Sen from Halishahar went to Salt Lake KV 1 to take the exam. “I am a student of Halisahar Ramprasad Vidyapeeth and have scored 74% in my Plus-II board exams. I prepared well for this exam and expect a good rank,” he said. Sangeeta Biswas from Barasat said, “The test had been delayed due to Covid, but I am happy that we are finally taking it. The delay gave us more time to prepare.” Due to the second Covid wave, several tests were pushed back by NTA. More than 1,000 students had sent a written petition to the NTA asking that the exam be pushed back to October. But the NTA had turned it down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neet-held-offline-with-cov-rules-in-place/articleshow/86149528.cms||---

Atal Incubation Centre, run by Bihar Vidyapeeth, has come up with this solution. Bihar Vidyapeeth president Vijoy Prakash said many such innovative experiments were being done by the institution for the benefit of people of the state. “Fortified grains are the ones in which proteins, vitamins and other nutrients are added. As a result, the nutritional capacity of grains increases manifold,” Prakash said. According to experts, fortifying means adding in nutrients that don’t occur naturally in the food. Most refined grains are enriched and many enriched grains also are fortified with other vitamins and minerals, such as folic acid and iron. Prakash said fortified grains would be provided to anganwadi centres to prepare midday for schoolchildren. “The idea is to improve the nutritional level of children in rural areas. We will start producing fortified grains on a commercial scale. Such an experiment was done in the state in 2008 as well when I was the principal secretary of the social welfare department. Nutrients were being given in the form of small candies. However, it is now being expanded and linked to cereals,” Prakash added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fortified-food-on-midday-meal-platter-in-bihar-soon/articleshow/86147650.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vax coupons sent home to help locals skip queues||Kolkata: The civic body has started sending health workers to households across the city with coupons that will ensure a vaccination slot without queueing up at civic vaccination centres. This door-to-door visit by health workers was launched last week and will continue till the end of this month, said a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department senior official. This coupon distribution scheme was planned following a dip in the number of second-dose recipients at the civic clinics, said an official. According to plans, the KMC health department has assigned three honorary health workers for each of its 144 wards spread across the city and each of them has been given a target of visiting 100 households every day. “We have set a target of reaching around 43,000 households a day to trace unvaccinated persons in each of these households. Based on the results of the survey at the end of week, and attendance at our vaccination clinics, we shall take the next step necessary to spread awareness among those who are yet to take the jab or are waiting for the second dose,” said a KMC health department official. With thousands from the districts streaming into Kolkata’s vaccination centres, city recipients — especially the elderly — have been finding it difficult to get slots. Queues for tokens have been forming since early in the mornings with those from outside the city limits often outnumbering and edging out locals, making the latter wait for weeks. The coupon-at-doorstep scheme will help them bypass the queues, said civic officials. Thousands in Kolkata had been kept waiting for their second doses in June-July, a period which also saw vaccine supplies slowing down. According to a KMC official, another reason behind the dip in the number of second-dose recipients could be that a section of senior citizens was scared of the crowd that has been building up at the civic vaccination clinics. “Several of our vaccination clinics, particularly those in the southern outskirts and centrally located areas, have been witnessing a surge of recipients from different parts of South and North 24 Parganas. This surge has perhaps scared senior citizens and they might be waiting for the serpentine queues at the clinics to get short. If such senior citizens are given coupons that ensure their vaccination, they will turn up in large numbers,” said a KMC health department senior official. In early August, the KMC had announced a scheme to vaccinate those above 80 and the infirm at home in some areas. But it was quickly withdrawn. In mid-August, the civic authorities re-announced the scheme and laid down a set of elaborate rules for the drive. But the drive never took off following a court ruling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-coupons-sent-home-to-help-locals-skip-queues/articleshow/86149451.cms||Saikat Ray

The department will conduct a pilot experiment at Male Mahadeshwara Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Chamarajanagar district, which has one of the highest elephant populations in the state. Movement of elephants along the Cauvery river in the sanctuary is common as elephants are assured of fodder and water along the riverbed throughout the year. But over the years, various projects including mini-hydel projects have come up across the river bed, and elephants were forced to move out of their habitat into nearby agriculture lands and human habitations resulting in human-elephant conflicts. Foresters have decided to install a solar powered rope barricade system which will have anchor posts made of concrete pillars at every 250 metres with seven galvanized steel live spacers with insulators and specially designed 14mm jumbo rope barriers secured with bulldog clamps. The fencing will also be attached with a hanging fence. The multiple rope lines with solar power connection will be capable of preventing wild animals from venturing out of the forest. Sanctuary DCF V Yedukondalu told TOI that the initiative will be the first of its kind in the state. “We have submitted a detailed project report (DPR) to the PCCF to take up fencing on a 16-km stretch along the forest border. The 7km fencing at Hanur range and 9km fencing at PG Palya range will be taken up soon. We are waiting for funds to be released,” he said. Yedukondalu said the rope barricade will have larger 14 mm cables as against the 2mm cables in regular solar fencing. “It will be double protection. It will be more effective than railway barricades. One kilometre of rail barricades cost Rs 1.7 crore, but we have seen elephants crossing the rail barricades. But rope barricades cost around Rs 50 lakh and are effective in preventing elephants from crossing the barricades,” he said. Wildlife activist Goluru Basavaraju told TOI that the encroachment of elephant corridors is also a cause for human-elephant conflicts. “Foresters must take up initiatives like fencing forest borders to prevent conflicts,” he said. Gundlupet farmer Mahadevappa told TOI that regular raids by elephants and destroying crops have worried farmers. “There should be some permanent solution to protect farmers from wild animals including elephants,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/forest-department-to-try-solar-hanging-barricades-to-stop-jumbos/articleshow/86148779.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Prosecutor scores century, sends 100 to jail in Pocso cases in 4 years||MUMBAI: It is a century that she is both happy and sad about. Happy that she helped put behind bars men who were held guilty of sexually abusing and preying on children. And sad that the tribe of such men has only grown since she became a special public prosecutor. Geeta Sharma, a special public prosecutor (SPP) since July 2017, for courts trying cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), nailed her hundredth conviction on Thursday. She was a prosecutor for over 200 cases. Since last March, when the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown was imposed, she secured 33 convictions in her cases. Her tally includes 18 life sentences, four 20-year prison sentences and 16 convictions with 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment.  Thursday’s conviction was for kidnapping, with an acquittal under rape and Pocso offences. The victim, just 15, claimed to have befriended the 19-year-old accused on social media.  Cases of teen victims and 20-somethings accused abound, easily forming a third of Pocso cases, says Sharma. Few other SPPs concur that cases of ‘runaway marriages’ make for a significant portion of cases and the other category often is of younger children abused by persons, known or acquainted.  Sharma says the boy is often 21-24 and the girl often a teen, around 15, many are 17, some shy of 18 by a couple of days even in such cases. Often an FIR is filed by the girl’s parents—in some cases she is a major by then. There are times when the accused and the victim later visit court together with a baby in arms, wanting the case dropped, or turn hostile too, says Sharma who has been a lawyer for 14 years, having studied at Advani and Thane law colleges. The cases that shock even the most prolific prosecutors are the ones where victims are still toddlers or pre-schoolers. Cases of “neighbours and relatives” as accused are on the rise, says Sharma, adding “ninety per cent of the time in Pocso cases, the accused are ‘known’ persons, of these 50% are relatives or neighbours and 25-30% are boyfriend-girlfriend cases”.  Though, as prosecutors they read through hundreds of pages each day of statements recorded by police and magistrates of brazen acts or abhorrent behaviour, some testimonies do bring these professionals close to tears. Sharma says an image that she couldn’t shake off was of a two-year-old boy who deposed during trial. He had been sodomised. The child bled, said a doctor. “The accused tried to bury him in quicksand, a boy saw and saved him.’’ While handling such young witnesses, prosecutors display other skills too to elicit as evidence a sketch of the sordid sexual assault from the survivor. “We speak gently with love and care. We speak about other things first, about what they like to eat, put them at ease with a friendly atmosphere.’’ The trials are in-camera—no outsiders or media is allowed, but the courtroom is still a stark place for a child. Among the “most shocking cases” and her “most complex case’’ was of a step-father fingering a one-year-old girl, seen by the mother who later turned hostile, but he was convicted with “life imprisonment”.  “When I see their small faces as we talk about the incident, sometimes it is stressful,’’ says Sharma, 45, told TOI. “ I do get angry.’’ “I write poetry and stories to let off some steam. Not about the cases... They are not published,” she laughs.  Amid the starkness of their evidence, the tots sometimes bring smiles too. “They spill other harmless family ‘secrets’ innocently, or refuse toffees saying, ‘Nahi, mummy datengi’ (no, mom will scold).  The cases where witnesses turn hostile are “most challenging”, but she said she has secured 11 such convictions. DNA, other forensic tests, doctors’ and police officers’ testimony and other witnesses play a role too in Pocso trials. In one case, the victim got pregnant, a second-DNA test matched the accused to the crime and he was convicted of rape. She is “driven” and while “grateful” to be an SPP says, “100 is a good record but I intend to work hard for justice in all cases to come”.  While false cases cannot be ruled out, she says, a child as a survivor of crime is traumatised for years. For the younger ones, it’s often innocence lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prosecutor-scores-century-sends-100-to-jail-in-pocso-cases-in-4-years/articleshow/86153497.cms||Swati Deshpande

In the first incident, a 23-year-old BTech student P Chaitanya took his life by hanging himself from a tree near his home at Maharanipeta. Police said Chaitanya had failed in some subjects in his BTech course. However, he made his relatives believe that he had passed the course. Recently, his family members came to know that Chaitanya had actually failed in his examinations. This led him to take the extreme step. A case has been registered by MR Peta police an investigation is underway. In another incident, a 22-year-old MSc student K Harshita committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan at her home in Srinivasanagar under Pendurthi police station limits. Police said the girl was in a relationship with another youth. “But he suspected she was having an affair with another boy. Disappointed over this, she ended her life,” police said. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/2-kill-selves-in-2-separate-incidents/articleshow/86148605.cms||---
---||Business||Irdai seeks to cut unhealthy biz with data bureau rejig||Mumbai: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai), in an effort to ensure that the non-life and life industry underwrites healthy business, has decided to recast the Insurance Information Bureau (IIB). The regulator will empower the IIB to collect data from the industry and come out with benchmark pricing. According to insurance sources, the IIB will be similar to credit information bureaus like Cibil and help companies identify and reprice loss-making businesses. In the draft regulations for the IIB, the regulator has said that the bureau will be a repository of data for all entities regulated by the Irdai. IIB will use this data for analytics and the generation of reports for the industry. It will also provide benchmark rates for life, motor, health, fire and marine insurance. These benchmark rates will be aimed at promoting “reasonableness of rates and sustainability of business in all lines of insurance”. The bureau will ensure that information about losses on account of fraud is shared among all players to help the industry reduce the same. While the IIB will give an industry-specific level of permission to use the data, Irdai will be the overall exclusive owner of the information. IIB will also help to improve efficiency by acting as a digital hub for electronic insurance accounts and, finally, it will act as a repository for KYC data. It will also enable insurers to upload and download KYC data. Once the regulator receives feedback on these proposed regulations, they will be forwarded to the government for notification in the official gazette. The regulator has given the industry until the end of September to respond to the proposals. The proposed regulations come at a time with many non-life companies reporting underwriting losses in various lines of business. In fire insurance, following the abolition of tariff rates, premium rates fell by 90% over a decade. The resultant losses forced the General Insurance Corporation to hike reinsurance rates sharply a couple of years ago, causing an outcry among corporates. Incidentally, the IIB was created by repositioning the Tariff Advisory Committee that existed before liberalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-seeks-to-cut-unhealthy-biz-with-data-bureau-rejig/articleshow/86151579.cms||---

Currently LIC, which is governed by a special law, is allowed to transfer 5% of its surplus to the shareholders’ fund. The remaining 95% goes to the policyholders’ fund for paying bonus on eligible life insurance policies. In case of other life insurance companies, which are regulated through the Insurance Act, the permissible allocation is in the ratio of 90:10. With the IPO planned in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal, the government intends to bring parity to make investment into LIC an equally attractive proposition, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. “It’s only natural that investors will expect a similar structure. We are working out the details, along with a few other changes,” a government source said.  The Centre hopes that this will help balance the interests of shareholders and policyholders and still make the IPO attractive for investors. The government is also expected to clarify the level of foreign investment that will be permitted in the company after its listing. Currently, up to 74% foreign direct investment (FDI) is allowed in the insurance business, but LIC is expected to be governed by a special dispensation. LIC’s valuation surplus is arrived at after calculating its entire liabilities in respect of the business that it has already underwritten. This means that policyholders with term insurance, guaranteed return policies and unit-linked plans will not be impacted by dividend distribution policies. It is only the participating policies where the benefits are determined by the level of bonus that will be affected. According to industry sources, a change in the payout ratio will not make as significant a difference to policyholders as, say, a reduction in RBI’s policy rate. For private companies, the profits from selling protection also account for a significant portion of their profits. Any surplus that a private insurer makes from selling protection goes entirely to the policyholders. In the case of LIC, the profits are shared between the government and other policyholders. Changing the dividend distribution policy will benefit shareholders but can, again, impact existing participating policyholders. The government believes that several individuals who have purchased life covers from the insurance behemoth will also buy LIC shares during the IPO as a certain percentage of the issue will be reserved for them. This will entitle them to dividends in the coming years. For LIC’s policyholders, the greatest attraction is that whatever has been promised in the policy will continue to be guaranteed by the government. The government, while amending the LIC Act, has retained section 27, which states that the sums assured by all policies issued by the corporation — including any bonuses declared in respect thereof and all bonuses — shall be guaranteed as payment in cash by the central government. A senior government official said that the department of investment and public asset management will work out the details of the proposed issue based on the embedded value that is currently being worked out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/govt-plans-to-revamp-lics-rules-for-sharing-surplus/articleshow/86151661.cms||Mayur Shetty

While the vaccination drive scheduled on September 10 was cancelled on account of the beginning of the Ganesh festival, the replacement drive carried out on Sunday saw a total of 1,975 beneficiaries getting the jabs. The relatively poor turnout of beneficiaries was attributed by health authorities to the start of three-day Gauri Pooja celebrations on Sunday. Among different age-groups, a total of 74,460 citizens aged above 60 years have received the first dose of vaccine against Covid-19 so far while another 55,784 have been fully vaccinated having received both the doses. Another age-group from 45 to 59 years —also considered as vulnerable groups — has received the highest 1,16,365 doses, out of which 89,280 have got both the doses. Meanwhile, Aurangabad on Sunday reported 10 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking total number of active cases to 70, including 28 patients admitted in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vaccination-figure-crosses-7-5l-mark-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/86145563.cms||---

Many found the papers tougher than last year. The difficulty level for chemistry and zoology papers was higher than last year. Teachers are expecting the cut-offs to drop compared to last year. Around 2.2 lakh students registered for the test in the pandemic. Some students complained of administrative problems at a few centres. This was the first year that the NEET paper had optional questions. An analysis done by a coaching institute found that physics and botany were at the same difficulty level as last year, whereas chemistry and zoology were more difficult than last year. Vinay Kumar, the MD and CEO of the coaching class, estimated the total number of students scoring 700 and above to be more than 100. Overall, the paper was a little difficult compared to last year, he said. Ravi Sangoi, a student whose centre was in Vidyavihar, said that the invigilator asked them to tear and separate the OMR (optical mark recognition) sheet from the carbon copy, which is against the NTA (National Testing Agency) rules of conduct. “What if the NTA considers it as tampering of the OMR sheets?” asked Sangoi. The student has written a complaint to the NTA. Ruiee Kapoor, a parent representative, said that several administrative complaints were reported from exam centres this year. “More centres were included this year, probably the invigilators were not trained well,” she said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-succour-to-neet-aspirants-many-find-papers-tougher-than-even-last-year/articleshow/86151798.cms||---

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the executing agency of the metro project, found that non-acquisition of land patches has come in the way of constructing sheds, approach road to administration building at the depot, electric substation, construction of cable trenches, drainages and utilities of the depot. “Landowners and the villagers of depot area often caused law and order situations, halting the project, forcing RVNL to file FIR. We have managed to acquire 86% of land of the depot. But disputed plots are stalling the work. We need active assistance from state government to resolve the issues,”said an RVNL official. The Joka depot is a key to bringing rolling stock. Land acquisition and project work suffered massive setback because of the pandemic. The depot is being built on 24.5 hectares of land spread over five moujas — Banogram, Raspunja, Hanspukuria, Kalagachia and Sakharipota. The project has already suffered a long delay and cost-overrun because of land issues. All project offices were closed for a long time last year. When they opened partially, restrictions continued on travel. Hearing of land cases, verification and possession of land were affected as owners refused to attend proceedings in the office of Competent Authority (land acquisition office), said an officer. The Competent Authority and Appellate Authority are functioning with 25% attendance since April 15. Thus out of 364 cases, land were awarded in 331 cases. Possession could be achieved in 272 cases. In 24 cases, proceedings are in the final stage, in 10 cases under payment of compensation by the Competent Authority, 18 cases are pending with Appellate Authority and 3 cases with Calcutta High Court. In a major breakthrough for Joka-Esplanade Metro project, the letter of award for the Joka Metro depot was issued to ISGEC Heavy Engineering Limited that emerged as the lowest bidder after a thorough technical evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-rake-to-arrive-in-dec-but-joka-metro-hits-land-hurdle/articleshow/86149746.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The move came soon after UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a review meeting with the health department and ordered action against quacks and unregistered practitioners who are now being blamed for rising deaths following high fever in Firozabad. An internal investigation of the health department has found that quacks are also to be blamed for the high number of fatalities in the district. Additional director of the health department, A K Singh, told TOI that during investigation they found that in many cases, initial treatment to fever patients had been provided by quacks or clinics that were not registered with the health department. “Many patients suffering from fever were administered steroids. This provided temporary relief to those suffering dengue-like symptoms, but multiplied the rate at which their platelets reduced. Blood vomiting was common in such cases. In a review meeting on Saturday, the CM ordered action against quacks following which we have started cracking down on all such practitioners,” said Singh. On Saturday, an FIR was registered against eight quacks under section 419 (punishment for cheating by personation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 15 of the Medical Council Act, said Firozabad (south) police station in charge Anoop Kumar Tiwari. All eight were running private unregistered clinics which have been sealed, said Tiwari. Health department has also banned the use of steroids that were found causing critical illness among patients suffering from dengue symptoms. These include dexamethasone, prednisolone, betamethasone and methylprednisolone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-cm-orders-action-against-quacks-in-firozabad-fir-against-8-notices-to-200-clinics/articleshow/86147824.cms||Deepak Lavania

Keen on honouring the remover of obstacles, he has installed an idol of the elephant-headed god in a tarpaulin tent near his collapsed house. Gawade works as a helper and belongs to the small Scheduled Tribes settlement of Kankire village. His house is one of the three that collapsed during the floods two months ago. Ganesh Chaturthi has now renewed his hopes that assistance to rebuild his home, and life, will be more forthcoming. Although Gawade received compensation of Rs 1 lakh from the state government, he says it is too little to rebuild his house. “The government should understand that such a small amount of money is insufficient. Hence, we seek more financial help,” he says. “Health minister and local MLA Vishwajit Rane had promised that he would rebuild my house with his own money and urged me not to take support from social groups. Two months have gone by, but there has been no progress,” he rues. For now, he and his family of 10 live in a rented house nearby and hope that better days will shine on them soon. While distributing relief letters to at least 150 beneficiaries, Rane had said that financial assistance was provided as top priority to the flood-hit villages of Sattari and Usgao. He has also said that the state government strives to reach out to citizens in all circumstances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-flood-hit-sattari-locals-celebrate-remover-of-obstacles/articleshow/86151780.cms||Afaq Khan

According to officials, a few of these kiosks will come up by the end of the year. Work for the kiosks has already begun with the police already in the process of engaging an agency to supply, install and maintain them. The kiosk installations have been planned keeping women’s safety in mind. This will enable them to get in touch with the police control room directly, even if they are unaware of the local police station and protocols.  “At times, women who have been a victim do not know how to and whom to report the crime. Many are also hesitant in visiting police stations specially at night. This kiosk will help them directly get in touch with the police control room and seek help,” said an official working on the project. According to victims many a times there has been a delay in initiating action over jurisdiction issues. In the past few years the police force has started several helplines too which have been of tremendous help but on some occasions, there has been no response from the other side. “These smart women help kiosks will eliminate all the intermediaries and put the person directly in touch with the control room which is operational throughout day and night. We are in the process of executing the pilot project. Very soon similar smart kiosks will come up in various key locations in the city,” said the officer. The LCD screen will have a help button by pressing which the person in emergency will be put through to an officer in the police control room via an internet video call. The officer will provide help and advice to the complainant and based on the call will lodge an official complaint which will be sent to the complainant’s contact number through messaging service.  Several within the department have, however, cautioned the initiative must not fizzle out like police kiosks that were launched few years ago, but were often spotted empty and locked. “Few years ago, kiosks came up at all key locations. It was said that there will be cops present inside to help people in distress and there will be arrangement for women to lodge complaint without going to the police station. But within a few weeks we saw the kiosks were under lock and key but huge advertisements came up on top. It was embarrassing and erodes credibility,” said a retired police officer. Setting up one ‘smart kiosk’ will cost up to Rs 9 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smart-kiosks-to-come-up-at-key-locations-for-women-to-get-hassle-free-link-with-city-cops/articleshow/86149773.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The garden is famously associated with Swami Vivekananda who visited it in 1890 when he was travelling in the Kumaon Himalayas. “Swami Vivekananda is an inspiration for all of us and we want our youths to know more about the great monk. Thus, the garden will be developed as a part of the Swami Vivekananda circuit. We will install several boards in the garden giving a detailed account of Swami Ji's trip to Kumaon hills. This will also promote tourism in the town,” said Chandra Singh Chauhan, archaeologist and in-charge of the Kumaon culture department. According to historians, Vivekananda meditated in the garden when he had come to Almora to meet Amba Dutta Joshi, an officer in the justice department. Educationist and advocate Manorama Joshi, the great-granddaughter of Amba Dutta Joshi, said that the memoirs of her great grandfather reveal that Swami Vivekananda, during his visit to the hill town, used to reach the garden early in the morning for meditation and yoga. Back then, the garden had apple and plum trees and several vegetable crops as well. The development comes days after a historical dak bungalow in Champawat where Swami Vivekananda had stayed when he travelled through the Kumaon region 120 years ago was demolished to make way for a meditation centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almora-garden-where-swami-vivekananda-meditated-to-get-a-facelift/articleshow/86147897.cms||---

The state also made it mandatory for those entering Goa from Kerala to undergo five days of either institutional or home quarantine. For those coming to Goa from Kerala, this will be an added condition, besides carrying a negative RT-PCR report. The Covid-negative report should be from a test done a maximum of 72 hours prior to entering Goa, state the collectors’ orders. “Students/employees coming from Kerala shall be subjected to institutional quarantine of five days. The arrangement for the quarantine for students will be done by the administrators/principals of the education institutions. For employees, it shall be done by respective offices/companies/firms,” the order states. At the end of these five days, the individuals, who have entered from Kerala, will have to undergo another RT-PCR test. “Arrivals from Kerala, other than students and employees, should produce the RT-PCR negative test report and should be in home quarantine for five days,” read the orders. Exemptions to these orders will include constitutional functionaries, healthcare professionals and their spouses, and children below two years. Those in dire emergency situations like death in the family, requiring medical treatment, etc, will also be exempt. Passengers in transit through Goa from and to Kerala using any mode of transport will also be exempt from these testing and quarantine rules. Persons entering Goa for medical emergencies will have to produce proof of the same to claim exemptions from the new conditions. “Two drivers and one helper per goods vehicle (will also be exempt). However, the police or other authorities will have to scan such persons with a thermal gun and see whether they display any symptoms, and if they display any symptoms, police or other authorities should deny access to such persons within the state of Goa,” read the orders.

Despite a delay in conducting the exams due to the second wave of Covid-19, a majority of the students that TOI spoke to, said that they were low on confidence to take the test, because they had prepared through the online mode. Likitha K from Puttur said that she had to opt for online NEET coaching, since in-person coaching was not available due to the pandemic. “I feel I have not prepared enough for the test,” she said, before entering an examination centre. Prajwal N, accompanied by his father, a driver, travelled here from Kumta in Uttara Kannada district. He said, “It is my father’s dream that I become a doctor.” Kushi Naveen and Chaitra Rathod, students from a college in Moodabidri, stayed back on campus to prepare for the exams. “Staying back on the campus gave us sufficient time to prepare well for the test. Our classmates who went home and studied online, said that they often got distracted, and said that they could not prepare well,” they said. Kushi and Chaitra had attempted the CET. At one of the centres in the city, students were addressed to boost their confidence once they occupied their seats, and before the exams began. Meanwhile, there were many students who were writing their exams for the second time, or those who had taken a break for a year. “My daughter is pursuing the second year of BDS at a private college in Mangaluru. Since her dream is to get into MBBS, she has decided to write the NEET again. If she gets lucky, she will be able to join an MBBS course,” a parent from Davanagere said.

The incident took place in the C-wing of Khatri Building owned by Ashfaq Vagani. The slab that crashed trapped three people. “I heard a loud thud... As as I came out of my apartment, I saw dust all around, heard people yelling,” said a resident of another wing. TimesViewThe risk people take to live in dilapidated buildings is because they have little faith in the authorities who warn them to move out of such structures. There have been innumerable cases where occupants had to vacate their old homes and later forced to live in cramped transit tenements for years, waiting for their buildings to be redeveloped. Sunday’s tragic incident is another reminder of the housing crisis and the government’s abject failure to redevelop old and dilapidated buildings in a time-bound manner.The disaster management cell of TMC and other agencies began rescue work and pulled out the three trapped persons. Two of them who died were identified as Rameez Shaikh (32) and Gous Tamboli (38). The injured person, Farha Gous Tamboli (10), is seriously injured and has been shifted to a local hospital. As a precautionary measure A, B & C wings of 73 flats of Khatri Apartment were evacuated and residents of all three wings temporarily shifted to a nearby madarasa.  Guardian minister for Thane Eknath Shinde visited the site of the slab collapse and said that implementation of cluster development on priority was the only solution for the perennial problem of dilapidated and dangerous buildings and the cluster plan has been approved by the TMC. Shindesaid, “It is unfortunate that the slab of the building crashed in which two persons lost their lives. The residents had been repeatedly warned to evacuate.” “The family members of the deceased will be granted compensation as per government norms. Now the elected representatives, civic corporation and occupants should meet and finalise development works and implement it,” Shinde said. A civic official said that the entire building of three wings and 73 flats has been sealed and an audit of the same would be conducted. An inspection of the building had been done in 2013 and it was declared ‘dangerous’ and served a notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-2-dead-10-year-old-hurt-as-slab-of-thane-flat-crashes/articleshow/86152054.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Agra||UP: 12,000 bedridden in dengue-hit Firozabad, death toll mounts to 114||AGRA: At least 12,000 people in Firozabad are now bedridden with a viral fever that has the district in its grip, sources in the health department have revealed. With four more deaths in the last 24 hours, the toll on Sunday increased to 114, including 88 children. A team of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had identified a dengue outbreak in the district last week. The deaths have continued despite widespread fogging and door-to-door surveys to drain out stagnant water and to arrest the spread of vector-borne diseases. A top source in the health department told TOI an estimated 12,000 people are now bedridden at home or in hospitals. On Sunday, government hospitals continued to scramble to arrange beds while treatment prices in private hospitals have sky-rocketed. Veer Pal, a resident of Bhim Nagar and a daily wager, lost his five-year-old son following lack of treatment for high fever on Sunday. The father told TOI that a private hospital in the city had demanded Rs 30,000 in advance to start treatment. “I requested them to start treatment and give me time to arrange money, but they refused. Later, I took my child to the Firozabad medical college where staff refused to admit my child as beds were not available. I arranged for a private taxi to take us to Agra, but my son died on the way,” Veer Pal said. No official complaint was made in the matter, said chief medical superintendent of Firozabad medical college, Dr Hansraj Singh. “We are continuously adding beds to adjust the increasing number of patients,” he said. There are 64 active camps in the district and 4,800 people, including those with fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. According to the health department officials, 578 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad so far. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus — a bacterial illness spread by larval mites, leptospirosis, another bacterial disease spread through the urine of infected animals, have also been reported. Diarrhoea has also emerged as a threat to children. Additional director of the health department, A K Singh, said over 100 teams of health staff are conducting door-to-door surveys to identify patients and provide them with medicines and required assistance. “There is no shortage of platelets or required medicines at the government centres. Additional ambulances have been arranged to take patients to hospital. Civic body teams are carrying out special cleanliness drives in the affected areas. All recent deaths are being investigated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/12k-bedridden-in-dengue-hit-firozabad-death-toll-mounts-to-114/articleshow/86147930.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Private nursing colleges push for fee hike by forging expenses’||MUMBAI: A female staff employed as a peon/aaya at a nursing college in Ahmednagar, has been shown as ‘lecturer’ in a pharmacy college run by the same management. A housekeeper in the nursing college is also ‘head of department’ (HoD) in the pharmacy college. While the principal holds the post in two nursing colleges, he is also listed as lecturer in a third. At least 19 people are shown to be employed in two or more colleges run by the management on different posts. These anomalies came up when the state’s Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) was examining proposals by these colleges seeking fee revision. Salaries of employees are shown as the institutes’ expenditure to seek fee revision. Even as nursing colleges are proliferating in the state, the FRA has started noticing deficiencies in the fee proposals submitted by some. The management in question, Gramin Samajsevi Sanstha, runs four colleges in Ahmednagar – one offers as BSc (Nursing) course – Dr Kolpe Nursing College, the other two – Shir Swami Samarth Nursing College and Shri Sai Baba Nursing School – offer Revised General Nursing & Midwifery (RGNM) and Revised Auxiliary Nursing & Midwifery (RANM) – and Dr Kolpe Institute of Pharmacy offering diploma in pharmacy. While the FRA had fixed fees for B Sc (Nursing) course on August 17, it has decided to recall the decision and to look at all proposals afresh after giving an opportunity of hearing to the principal and trustees of the college. The FRA noticed the anomaly while examining the trust’s fee revision proposal for Shri Swami Samarth Nursing College. “…It is pointed out that the same person is shown as employed and being paid salary during the same period from three different colleges run by the same trust… there is reason to believe that deliberate attempt has been made to practise fraud...,” the FRA noted in a recent order. Along with trustees, the FRA also called the chartered accountant for hearing, as there were discrepancies in balance sheets too. By showing full staff strength, colleges justify their proposals for fee hikes, said a member. An official from the college, however, claimed it was a mistake by a junior operator while feeding data on the portal. “Due to the pandemic, we were short-staffed... We will be showing all our documents to the FRA during the hearing,” said the official. An FRA member said that there is rampant proliferation of private nursing colleges in the state – maybe due to the pandemic. “We’re coming across deficiencies in many colleges seeking fee revision," said the member, adding that these colleges set up shop only to seek reimbursement of fees from the state. The FRA also noticed an anomaly in proposal submitted by Spandan Nursing College, Bhandara. Seven other proposals scrutinised by FRA were incomplete and full of deficiencies and were sent to the colleges for rectification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pvt-nursing-colleges-push-for-fee-hike-by-forging-expenses-in-mumbai/articleshow/86153518.cms||Yogita Rao

Only candidates were allowed access to the 48 examination centres in Kolkata. The test was held simultaneously across the country, with strict surveillance of observers sent by the National Testing Agency. Stringent restrictions were in place for students, guardians and hosting authorities. Barricades had been erected 100m to 300m from the main entrance of exam centres and circles were drawn to ensure physical distance. Guardians were not allowed to cross the barricades. No gathering was allowed in front of the centres. Students were allowed to enter from 10.30am, though the exam started from 2pm and continued till 5pm. Centre authorities were instructed not to interact with media persons. A city-based school principal said, “We were instru-cted not to reveal anything regarding the examination. Everything was monitored by NTA’s observers and they even arranged the security and sanitization.” The test was a big relief for students. Avik Sen from Halishahar went to Salt Lake KV 1 to take the exam. “I am a student of Halisahar Ramprasad Vidyapeeth and have scored 74% in my Plus-II board exams. I prepared well for this exam and expect a good rank,” he said. Sangeeta Biswas from Barasat said, “The test had been delayed due to Covid, but I am happy that we are finally taking it. The delay gave us more time to prepare.” Due to the second Covid wave, several tests were pushed back by NTA. More than 1,000 students had sent a written petition to the NTA asking that the exam be pushed back to October. But the NTA had turned it down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neet-held-offline-with-cov-rules-in-place/articleshow/86149822.cms||---
---||Goa||Pernem to Tiswadi, messy tar balls hit north Goa beaches||PANAJI: The coastline of north Goa – almost in its entirety covering three talukas - has been swamped by tar balls as the popular beaches have been messed up by deposits of oily blobs for the past couple of days. The turbulent sea appears to have been coughing up the sticky matter with a vengeance since Friday. The crude oil weathered by various processes is being deposited along beaches from Keri on Goa’s northern coastal border in Pernem, from Vagator to Candolim in Bardez and Miramar to Siridao in Tiswadi. In Pernem taluka, all its beaches, Keri, Arambol, Mandrem and Morjim have been carpeted by the filmy deposition and big tar balls. “It is difficult to walk on the beach as the sticky matter has swept ashore and some tar balls are as big as buffalo dung,” a Morjim villager said. From among the hordes of tourists seen on the beaches due to the long vacation, those who entered the water complained of irritation and difficulty in washing off the thick oil. The tar ball episode – one of the worst in north Goa in recent years – has also hit Vagator and the long stretch of Bardez coastline from Baga to Sinquerim, sources said. The oily matter and big pieces of tar balls were visible at Miramar beach making it difficult for tourists and visitors to walk on the beach. “In Cacra and Siridao the waters stink and one can get the sticky matter on the feet when entering the water,” Sanjay Pereira, a fisherman said. Tar balls are either remnants of oil spills or produced from natural seeps. “Wind and waves tear the oil slick into smaller patches that are scattered over a much wider area. Various physical, chemical and biological processes (weathering) change the appearance of the oil,” a study by national institute of oceanography (NIO), states. The problem could arise from a few factors, including clandestine release by ships and spillage of oil in the sea. “We have seen that it is not happening in other coastal waters. This is because the governments themselves are eco-friendly and they protect their water from pollution. Our government and states need to be responsible in protecting the environment,” Captain Venzy Viegas, a master mariner said. The work of cleaning the beaches has started on some stretches but sources said it will be a tough job as vast stretches of the coastline have been literally tarred by the oily matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pernem-to-tiswadi-messy-tar-balls-hit-n-goa-beaches/articleshow/86151849.cms||Paul Fernandes

Besides, the number of microbiologists and technicians has also been reduced in the medical college. The hospital now has three microbiologists and six technicians as against five microbiologists and 16 technicians during the second wave of the pandemic. Consequently, the pace of Covid-19 testing in the district has dropped by almost 50%. On an average, 300-400 samples are being tested per day. Earlier, this number was about 800 samples per day. Meanwhile, hospital officials say they are awaiting technicians from Delhi to come and fix the machine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/defunct-machine-lack-of-staff-covid-19-testing-affected-in-almora/articleshow/86148016.cms||---

Khurshid’s claims before the media are apparently contrary to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s earlier statements that her party is open to forging alliances with other political parties for the UP assembly polls. While interacting with media persons in the city on Sunday, Khurshid said, “We have our calculations and there is no point in forging any alliance, if we are not getting seats that we ask from our alliance partners. We are preparing a manifesto for 2022 assembly polls after visiting every corner of Uttar Pradesh and there is a clear indication that alliances will not help us.” On being asked about the CM’s face by Congress party, Khurshid, said that the party’s face is Priyanka Gandhi. He, however, said, “Priyanka hasn’t officially announced this yet, so, even we can’t do it, but the party will fight the elections under her leadership.” Khurshid said, “We are visiting cities to prepare our manifesto on directions of Priyanka ji and there is no need to label this.” After interacting with people in Tora village, Khurshid said people’s issues like widows pensions will be added in the manifesto. He was accompanied by party's national spokesperson Supriya Shrinate. In July this year, Priyanka Gandhi told reporters in Lucknow: “I do not rule out (alliance). We are absolutely not closed-minded. We are having an open mind.” She also added that the party’s aim is to defeat BJP, and other parties should also be open-minded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/priyanka-would-be-congresss-cm-face-for-up-polls-salman-khurshid/articleshow/86148030.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||Five-day quarantine for people from Kerala entering Goa||GOA: The Goa government on Sunday extended the state curfew by another week till September 20. The state also made it mandatory for those entering Goa from Kerala to undergo five days of either institutional or home quarantine. For those coming to Goa from Kerala, this will be an added condition, besides carrying a negative RT-PCR report. The Covid-negative report should be from a test done a maximum of 72 hours prior to entering Goa, state the collectors’ orders. “Students/employees coming from Kerala shall be subjected to institutional quarantine of five days. The arrangement for the quarantine for students will be done by the administrators/principals of the education institutions. For employees, it shall be done by respective offices/companies/firms,” the order states. At the end of these five days, the individuals, who have entered from Kerala, will have to undergo another RT-PCR test. “Arrivals from Kerala, other than students and employees, should produce the RT-PCR negative test report and should be in home quarantine for five days,” read the orders. Exemptions to these orders will include constitutional functionaries, healthcare professionals and their spouses, and children below two years. Those in dire emergency situations like death in the family, requiring medical treatment, etc, will also be exempt.

---||Delhi||Dairies across Delhi flout rules, flag activists||NEW DELHI: A team of three activists, who are a part of the Ahimsa fellowship to create animal welfare leaders, have submitted a report to the chief secretary and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) after inspecting nine major dairies stating that there were violations ranging from overcrowding and poor hygiene to sick and dead calves at each location. In the report, the team suggested improvements in the dairies, including remedial action for violations under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, Food Standards and Safety Act, 2006, Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, Air Act, 1981 and Water Act, 1974, among others. The inspections were carried out on August 9 at the dairies located in Bhalswa, Jharoda, Ghazipur, Goyla, Nangli, Kakrola, Madanpur Khadar, Masoodpur and Shahbad Dairy. The team consisted of 23-year-old Sunayana Sibal, who recently completed her masters in psychology, Dr Asher Jesudoss, an IIT-Delhi faculty member and Akshita Kukreja. The group highlighted that animals were found tethered with short ropes or heavy chains, rendering them immobile. Carcasses of dead calves were found at almost each dairy, with excreta on the floor making it a breeding ground for diseases. “This kind of tethering hampered the animals from maintaining their natural posture and could contribute to a host of diseases. All the dairy colonies had carcasses of dead calves lying in the middle and corners of the streets with swarms of flies and crows hovering over them,” the report said. In addition to finding hard, slippery floors that made it difficult for the animals to stand or walk on, the report stated that oxytocin was found being used at certain dairies, despite this being a cognisable offence. “The rampant use of the non-therapeutic hormonal drug, oxytocin, was seen. It’s easily available for Rs 10-20 to all dairy workers, which is injected in the milch animals just before milking. The purpose behind these injections is to increase the yield, but it is very painful to the animals. Additionally, it is injected by untrained workers without any veterinary supervision,” added the report. The team suggested monitoring dairy farms regularly to ensure proper disposal of dung and wastewater in accordance with environmental norms. “Ensure there is an environmental audit of at least two, randomly chosen dairy farms from each district, and ensure reports detailing compliance and action taken are submitted to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on a half-yearly basis,” the reported suggested, stating environmental compensation for violations should be adopted from CPCB’s methodology for industrial units for damaging the environment. Sibal said they had met officials from the development department and DPCC and were given assurances that action would be taken. “We will present the report to other departments and the corporations too. It aims to highlight the existing flaws in the system,” she added. A DPCC official told TOI that action was already being taken against dairies and poultry farms not complying with the norms. A senior animal husbandry department said inspections at dairies were carried out at intervals and those found flouting norms were issued fines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dairies-across-city-flout-rules-flag-activists-list-corrections/articleshow/86149898.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay ‘unlocks’ campus to hold UG mid-semester exams in hybrid mode||MUMBAI: In another step towards relaxing ‘lockdown’ norms within the IIT-Bombay campus, the institute is allowing its departments to conduct the ongoing undergraduate mid-semester exams in a hybrid mode. Those on the campus are taking the exams physically from well-ventilated classrooms, following all Covid protocols, and others are taking it from their respective home locations. While the mode of exam remains the same for both set of students — online — those on the campus will be giving it under physical invigilation (pic). As of now, there are no plans to start lectures in the hybrid mode. At least one in five students from undergraduate programmes (close to 1,000) are on the campus, and for reasons ranging from poor connectivity to irregular power supply in their hometowns. Director of the institute, Subhasis Chaudhuri, said that since the pandemic has posed an unprecedented situation, they are trying to experiment with different modes. “We are coming out with the best possible solutions keeping in mind all the BMC rules. With more students being allowed on the campus, the total strength has almost reached 50% this semester,” said the director, adding that a majority of them are postgraduate and research students. The exams are decentralised and, therefore, departments are free to take a call on the hybrid mode. Some faculty members believed that for students on the campus, indulging in malpractices was easier as they are with their friends and classmates, said a professor. “A few departments approached the institute seeking permission to hold the exams for the on-campus students in classrooms. Since we have the facilities, it was decided to allow these departments,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, academic and infrastructural affairs.  The institute estimates around 15-20% of the undergraduate exams are now being held in the hybrid mode, he added. The civil engineering department saw three students leaving the campus after the in-person exams were announced for hostelites. And the administration found that at least one student lied about the reason. Deepankar Choudhury, head of the department which conducted the exam in the hybrid mode from Saturday, said they had “ensured to use only 20% of the class capacity during the exam ensuring all Covid protocols”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-unlocks-campus-to-hold-ug-mid-sem-exams-in-hybrid-mode/articleshow/86153540.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 'Deltasura' set for pandal debut to spread awareness||KOLKATA: This year, Kumartuli has received several orders for a different kind of asura idol — the Deltasura. With the threat of a possible third wave and the delta-plus variant looming over the festivities, a number of puja organizers and artisans have decided to use their creativity during Durga Puja to raise awareness about the disease. The idea was conceived by a few organizers from the city and its outskirts. Idol-makers in Kumartuli said they are ready to go along with the organizers as long as it propagates their imagination and creativity. Indrajit Pal, an artisan at Kumartuli, has received four orders for Deltasura and is confident of getting a few more. So is Sujit Pal, treasurer of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Association, who had conceptualized the Coronasura last year. “It is our way to raise awareness. People remember our work and there cannot be a greater satisfaction than helping people develop awareness about the pandemic,” said Indrajit. Indrajit has introduced a number of changes from the Coronasura. “They were all painted black last year. But now, with the arrival of vaccines, we have the capability to fight back. This year, all Asuras are coloured steel, a mixture of white (good) and black (evil). The Asuras’ ornaments have been given the shape of the delta variant as observed from the internet and I have made the Asuras look fiercer and angrier,” he said. Arnab Chowdhury, secretary of Rabindra Memorial Sporting Club near Picnic Garden, has ordered a Deltasura. “It will raise awareness and send a message of Maa Durga slaying coronavirus,” he said. The Chingripota Dulatpur Sarbajanin Puja at Batanagar has decided to install the special Asura to “spread positivity amidst testing times for the second year running”. For Shibtola Sadharan Sangha in Amtala, this will be a wake-up call for November when the third wave is likely to leave a lasting impact. Club secretary Tarun Kumar Mondal said, “We chose to have a Deltasura as the Covid situation between October and December will be critical. We want people to be aware of the impending health threat.” “We only have images used in newspapers and on TV. So I am creating the asura based on that,” said Sujit. “Such efforts will help develop community consciousness. But organizers must display some cautionary rules around the pandal,” said Aishwarya Ghosh, who has been treating Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/deltasura-set-for-pandal-debut-to-spread-awareness/articleshow/86149881.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The deceased have been identified as Vijay (16), Vivek (15) and Shivam (11). One of the teenager’s family member said the three drowned while trying to save the life of one of their friends. According to officials, the bodies might have flown downstream to other parts of the city. The minors had gone to Sonia Vihar to immerse the Ganesha idol in the Yamuna. One of them, who was holding the idol, slipped and fell into the river. The other two boys immediately rushed to save him, but all of them drowned in the heavy current. “One boy was lucky to escape as he was saved by other people,” a police officer said. Family members claimed that they weren’t aware that their wards had gone for idol immersion. “We did not know that our children had gone to the Yamuna for immersion. There was no such plan,” Shivam’s father, Amod Singh said. “The boys came to the river from Sonia Vihar Pusta number 2 side for idol immersion. There was a heavy flow on that side and they drowned. Divers tried to find the bodies, but it was dark and the operation had to be suspended, a police officer said. The rescue operation continued on Sunday but the bodies could not be found, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-boys-drown-in-yamuna-during-idol-immersion/articleshow/86149905.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccination coupons sent home to help locals skip queues||KOLKATA: The civic body has started sending health workers to households across the city with coupons that will ensure a vaccination slot without queueing up at civic vaccination centres. This door-to-door visit by health workers was launched last week and will continue till the end of this month, said a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department senior official. This coupon distribution scheme was planned following a dip in the number of second-dose recipients at the civic clinics, said an official. According to plans, the KMC health department has assigned three honorary health workers for each of its 144 wards spread across the city and each of them has been given a target of visiting 100 households every day. “We have set a target of reaching around 43,000 households a day to trace unvaccinated persons in each of these households. Based on the results of the survey at the end of week, and attendance at our vaccination clinics, we shall take the next step necessary to spread awareness among those who are yet to take the jab or are waiting for the second dose,” said a KMC health department official. With thousands from the districts streaming into Kolkata’s vaccination centres, city recipients — especially the elderly — have been finding it difficult to get slots. Queues for tokens have been forming since early in the mornings with those from outside the city limits often outnumbering and edging out locals, making the latter wait for weeks. The coupon-at-doorstep scheme will help them bypass the queues, said civic officials. Thousands in Kolkata had been kept waiting for their second doses in June-July, a period which also saw vaccine supplies slowing down. According to a KMC official, another reason behind the dip in the number of second-dose recipients could be that a section of senior citizens was scared of the crowd that has been building up at the civic vaccination clinics. “Several of our vaccination clinics, particularly those in the southern outskirts and centrally located areas, have been witnessing a surge of recipients from different parts of South and North 24 Parganas. This surge has perhaps scared senior citizens and they might be waiting for the serpentine queues at the clinics to get short. If such senior citizens are given coupons that ensure their vaccination, they will turn up in large numbers,” said a KMC health department senior official. In early August, the KMC had announced a scheme to vaccinate those above 80 and the infirm at home in some areas. But it was quickly withdrawn. In mid-August, the civic authorities re-announced the scheme and laid down a set of elaborate rules for the drive. But the drive never took off following a court ruling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-coupons-sent-home-to-help-locals-skip-queues/articleshow/86149913.cms||Saikat Ray

Dinesh Holla, convenor, Sahyadri Sanchaya, who works to uplift tribals and for protecting the environment, told TOI that last year, through the ‘Vana Belaku’ programme, 36 camps to motivate tribal children, who were not attending schools, towards education, were held. As a follow-up, ‘Vana Chethana’ is being launched. “This is an attempt to ensure that children, especially from Siddi, Halakki, Kunubi and Gauli communities, living in the forests of Yellapur, Joida and Anashi, are not deprived of an education during the pandemic,” he said. “We hope to reach out to at least 40 schools, and Vasudev Aithal has given a new dimension to the programme. All Samveda e-classes of the government, that are also being telecast on DD Chandana, have been downloaded on a pen drive and handed over to a few schools, along with television sets. We have visited every remote village, and realised that either the children have no access to television sets, and if there is a television set, there is no power supply. Aithal has plans of providing solar inverters to schools,” he said. Nearly 40 resource persons, from across the state, have agreed to volunteer, and take up various activity-based learning initiatives for the children. “We plan to document the programme and submit a report to the government. If it is successful, this model of learning can be implemented in other remote places of the state,” Holla said. NRI Vasudev Aithal, who has been in the US for the past 26 years, said early education is fundamental to the success of any child. “If we can make that little change in early education, a lot can be achieved. This is an ad hoc programme to help the less privileged communities,” he said. Government Higher Primary school, Nandolli, headmaster Bhaskar Naik said that the school was provided with a smart TV and a pen drive last week. “This has been helpful, because students and teachers can pause whenever required, and watch the lessons again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/edu-programme-for-tribal-kids-of-uttara-kannada-begins-today/articleshow/86148134.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Agra||Aligarh farmers stage protest, demand new sugar mill promised by BJP in 2019||AGRA: Two days ahead of the Prime Minister’s visit to Aligarh, more than 1,500 farmers staged a protest on Sunday to demand fulfilment of the BJP government’s four-year-old promise of setting up a new sugar mill in the district. The farmers also threatened to vote against the party in the upcoming assembly election if their demand was not fulfilled. Stopped by police when they were on the way to meet UP minister for sugar industry and cane development minister Suresh Rana who happened to be in the city, the farmers sat on the road, shouting slogans like “jo kisan ke hit ki baat karega.. wahi desh par raj karega” (Only those who talk in favour of farmers will rule the country) and held up placards, saying, “Naye chini mill nahi to 2022 me vote nahi” (No vote in 2022 elections if the new sugar mill is not set up). State general secretary of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) Shailendra Pal Singh told TOI that they had invited all legislators along with the MP and district administration officials to join the kisan panchayat in Jawan area, near old sugar mill — Satna Kasimpur. The panchayat was organized to question them about the efforts they made in the last 4.5 years for fulfilling the promise of setting up a new sugar mill. However, only Barauli MLA, Dalveer Singh, turned up and claimed that he had raised this issue several times in the assembly. He claimed that efforts were being made to fulfil the promise. As Rana was in town, the panchayat decided to call on him. “When we were heading to meet the minister, police stopped us at various locations and did not allow us to meet him,” Singh said, adding that they forced them to sit on a road and protest. “We did not create any ruckus and were peacefully heading to the circuit house,” he added. The farmers’ leader said the “government had assured us of a new sugar mill in 2019 Lok Sabha elections but till date, nothing has been done. The 52-year-old sugar mill is non-functional and we had lodged a formal complaint to officials concerned but to no avail”. According to farmers, sugarcane was sown across 9,336 hectares in Aligarh in 2015-16 but now, the area has shrunk to 4,500 hectares due to the defunct sugar mill in the district. The other sugar mills are at least 100 kilometres away from the district and transporting produce there is expensive, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-farmers-stage-protest-demand-new-sugar-mill-promised-by-bjp-in-2019/articleshow/86148144.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Bareilly||Hike sugarcane prices, PM Kisan scheme amount: BJP MP Varun Gandhi to UP CM||Bareilly: BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi, who had earlier backed farmers protesting against the three new farm laws, saying that they are “our own flesh and blood”, has now written to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath outlining several measures that could “help farmers improve their revenues and resolve their issues”, including increasing sugarcane prices, doubling the amount of PM Kisan scheme and bonus on wheat and paddy. Talking to TOI, a day after he shot off the letter on Saturday, the three-term MP, said, “The last few years have been an economically tumultuous time, more so for our farmers who have borne the brunt for many things. "As a public representative who has written on rural economics and worked with farmers for years, I felt the requests I made to the UP CM are fiscally affordable and can be immediately actualised and would go a long way in normalising government-farmer relations,” he added. In his letter, Gandhi has suggested increasing the sugarcane state advisory price (SAP) to Rs 400 per quintal — currently fixed at Rs 315 per quintal. He also suggested that contractual farmers be allowed to sell their crop directly to sugar mills. At present, contractual farmers are unable to sell sugarcane to sugar mills because only those with a “cane supply ticket” from the district administration can sell their crop directly to sugar mills. The cane supply ticket is only given to growers who have land in their name, forcing contractual labourers to sell to jaggery manufacturers at nominal prices. Sugarcane is widely grown in west UP, the epicentre of the farmers’ protest against the farm laws. The MP has also suggested Rs 200 per quintal bonus above the minimum support price (MSP) on grains like paddy and wheat to cover transportation costs associated with the delivery of the grains at the procurement centres. Gandhi said the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM Kisan) scheme should be doubled to Rs 12,000 annually for farmers with the state government contributing Rs 6,000 from its own funds. The PM Kisan scheme is an initiative by the Centre under which all farmers can get up to Rs 6,000 per year as minimum income support. Sharing farmers’ concern over high prices of electricity and diesel, Gandhi requested Adityanath to allow a subsidy of Rs 20 per litre on diesel to farmers and reduce the power prices with immediate effect. Electricity connections of thousands of farmers have been disconnected by the power supply department over pending dues in west UP. Gandhi's letter also suggested that labourers be deployed for farming under MGNREGA and 'gaushalas' be developed to stop stray cattle from destroying crops in rural areas. Gandhi has been conducting meetings with protesting farmers and tweeting in their support. On September 5, he had shared a video of the large turnout at the farmers’ mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar and said that “we need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/hike-sugarcane-prices-pm-kisan-scheme-amount-bjp-mp-varun-gandhi-to-up-cm/articleshow/86148197.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mangaluru||Around 15% of angiograms performed on those below 45 in city hosp||Mangaluru: Actor Sidharth Shukla’s sudden death at the age of 40, reportedly due to sudden cardiac arrest, left many shocked, but it also forces one to think about the causes for a rise in heart attacks among people below 45. Around 10%-15% of the total angiograms done in a private hospital in the city are of patients who are below 45. According to Dr Maneesh Rai, consultant, cardiac electrophysiologist, KMC Hospital, Mangaluru, in the last three months, out of 750 angiograms conducted for proven or suspected coronary artery disease cases, around 100 patients were below 45. Dr Manish Rai told TOI that studies have shown that coronary artery disease occurs a decade earlier in Indians, when compared to other developed nations. “About 10% of heart attacks occur in individuals who are under 40 in India. The traditional risk factors of diabetes mellitus and hypertension and high cholesterol are common in older patients with heart disease. In young people, in addition to the above risk factors, smoking, truncal obesity, psychological stress and a combination of low levels of good cholesterol and higher levels of bad cholesterol seem to be common. Another important risk factor, probably the most important, which can predispose to premature coronary artery disease is bad genetics or a family history of heart disease,” he said. “It is observed that many people with exercise-induced cardiac events experience chest discomfort or pain in the preceding few days. Unfortunately, these are often neglected by the patient. Recognising these symptoms and obtaining timely help could prevent a catastrophe. Also, it is important to avoid strenuous exercise immediately after recovering from an illness,” he added. Dr Yusuf Kumble, managing director and chief interventional cardiologist of Indiana hospital, said that he has noticed a 30% rise in the number of patients who are below 45, who have cardiac issues, in the last 10-15 years. “This could be due to diabetes, stress, lifestyle or family history. In case in a family there is the sudden death of a woman who is below 55, and a man below 45, due to cardiac arrest, then it is important for the family members to conduct routine checkups,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/around-15-of-angiograms-performed-on-those-below-45-in-city-hosp/articleshow/86148201.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

In November 2013, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, before the 2014 general elections, while addressing a mega rally at Kothi Meena Bazaar had spoken about the need for a potato processing unit in Agra. Now, ahead of the PM’s rally in Aligarh on September 14, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) members said over 5,000 farmers from across the district will go to the meeting to remind him of the “pending promise”. Cultivated in around 75,000 hectares, Agra is the largest potato producing district of northern India. As per the plan, farmers will leave for Aligarh early in the morning on Tuesday by private vehicles and roadways buses. Farmers will not hold any demonstration at the PM’s rally and will highlight their demands only with handmade posters. On Sunday, BKU district president Rajveer Lawaniya said, “PM Modi led-BJP government has completed seven years but the potato processing unit still remains a dream. We will go to Aligarh to remind him of his promise he made before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. We will peacefully highlight our demand at the public event.” BKU’s women wing leader, Savitri Chahar, said, “Trusting the PM, farmers in Agra voted for BJP and made party's candidates win both the Parliament seats and all the nine assembly seats. But in return, they got nothing meaningful." According to farmers, a potato processing unit in Agra is necessary as it will supplement farmers' income and create a scope for manufacturing of various potato products at the local level. Farmers will not have to preserve potatoes in cold storages for a long time. The unit will also generate employment opportunities. Besides the processing unit, farmers at the Aligarh rally are also going to demand for a subsidy on cold storage charges. At present, there are 270 cold storage units in Agra district with a total capacity of over 25 lakh metric tonnes. The PM will be in Aligarh to lay the foundation stone of the upcoming Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh University. Modi will also allocate land to 19 investors, investing Rs 1,500 crore in Aligarh node of the defence corridor. This will be the first of his many visits in the state ahead of the 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farmers-to-remind-pm-of-his-promise-for-potato-processing-unit-in-agra-at-aligarh-rally/articleshow/86148237.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||AAIB stresses on safety, lists out 45 recommendations||Kozhikode: After finding non-adherence to SOP by flight commander as a probable cause for the Air India Express (AIE) flight crash at Calicut airport on Aug 7, 2020 and red flagging several systemic failures as contributory factors, Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) made 45 safety recommendations covering all stakeholders–AIE, Airports Authority of India (AAI), DGCA, IMD and AAIB itself. Key recommendations include call to use extensive use of simulator training by AIE, proper maintenance of Runway End Safety Area (RESA), widening of airport perimeter road to facilitate quick movement of emergency vehicles, asking DGCA to study feasibility and efficacy of Child Restraint System for safety of infants and children on board aircraft, among many others. Among the recommendations, the panel has recommended AIE to put in place extensive simulator training to promote assertiveness of the first officer to take over control and initiate a go-around on an unstabilized approach when the commander fails to respond and covering scenarios involving tailwind landing on wet runways. Also, to address the steep authority gradient in the cockpit which preventing the first officer from being assertive enough to take charge in the cockpit (when required to do so), the report stressed on focusing CRM (Crew Resource Management) training including the trans-cockpit authority gradient and assess the responses of captain and first officer as a team. It also suggested changes in HR management by AIE to ensure better availability of crew, especially captains at all bases considering the quantum of flights originating from respective bases. It was found that the captain, who was earlier on standby duty for Qatar flight on August 8, 2020, was assigned to operate this flight. The report says that this last-minute assignment put additional pressure on the captain to land at Kozhikode in time on August 7. Regarding AAI, the panel recommended that training programmes for ATC staff should focus on the impact of tailwind conditions in adverse weather and precautions required while deciding the change of runway in adverse weather. It also asked AAI to ensure proper maintenance of the soft ground portion of RESA as it offers crucial defense in case of runway excursion. Vegetation growth was observed in RESA soft ground area as it was not ploughed regularly. The report recommended widening the airport road which was found with sharp turns that affect the speed of emergency vehicles, including CFTs and overall response time during exigencies. It also recommended that approach radar be installed in Karipur which is one of the 10 busiest airports in India. It also recommended video graphing rescue operations. After finding surface wind observation for Runway 10 was affected on the day of the mishap by nonstandard installation and poor maintenance, the panel recommended that they be installed as per the specifications mentioned by DGCA while also ensuring proper maintenance. The report recommended DGCA to ensure periodic surveillance of flights at critical, table top runways, with increased surveillance during monsoons. It was asked to ensure that Runway Centre Line Lights are installed at such airports as they help in maintaining directional control by the flight crew during adverse weather. It was also asked to issue directives to all scheduled, non-scheduled operators to educate their aircrew regarding aeromedical consequences of self-medication after finding that the commander had taken self-medication for diabetes. With regard to AAIB, panel recommended setting up a modern flight recorders (DFDR and CVR) lab to carry out readout and analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/aaib-stresses-on-safety-lists-out-45-recommendations/articleshow/86150022.cms||---

The power corporation has sent notices to another 55,000 consumers and they face similar action if they fail to clear their dues. In Bijnor alone, over 1.14 lakh people had taken new connections under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) since its launch in 2017, but barely 32,000 paid their power bills, leading to a loss of Rs 20 crore to Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam(PVVNL). A free connection does not mean free power, PVVNL officials said. SK Agarwal, Bijnor's superintendent engineer, PVVNL, said, “There are over 7.5 lakh power consumers in Bijnor. Out of these, 1.14 lakh consumers are availing of the Saubhagya scheme. But, 82,000 have never paid their electricity bills. We are disconnecting their supply. Besides, power supply of consumers with outstanding dues of Rs 10,000 or more will also be snapped.” According to officials, the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – ‘Saubhagya’ was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 25, 2017. It was aimed at providing energy access to all through last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in both rural and urban areas to achieve universal electrification in the country. Dheeraj Kumar, a resident of Mandawali who has defaulted in paying his power bill, said, “I am jobless and unable to pay the dues. I am trying my best to deposit the electricity bills. The decision to disconnect our power supply is uncalled for." end||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/27000-power-connections-of-saubhagya-beneficiaries-in-bijnor-cut-over-unpaid-bills/articleshow/86148280.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kozhikode||Airport hopes wide-bodied aircraft ban may be lifted||Kozhikode: AAIB’s probe report into the AIE flight crash from Dubai, which identified pilot error as the likely cause of the mishap, is giving rise to hopes that DGCA might lift the ban on wide-bodied aircraft at Karipur airport. Also, probe panel hasn’t made adverse references about the tabletop runway of Karipur airport or operation of wide-bodied aircraft citing runway safety concerns. Union civil aviation had earlier said that the revocation of the ban will be subject to the outcome of this report. DGCA had barred operation of wide-bodied aircraft in May 2015 on runway safety concerns and permission was reinstated in 2018 after AAI undertook mitigation measures along with safety assessments by airlines. After AIE crash, operation of jumbo flights was suspended in Aug 2020. After the crash, the airport had to face a slew of charges including that the tabletop runway led to the mishap. There were allegations that runway surface friction was below the required level and there was the presence of rubber deposits that could have affected braking performance. A PIL was filed at HC urging that the airport be shut until it is ensured that all regulations are complied with. It was dismissed by the court. But, the report found that the average value of coefficient of friction was above the required value in the tests conducted on Aug 8 and 12, 2020. The report said the feedback from two pilots of flight, which landed before AIE flight, said that braking was good and satisfactory. On the runway front, the report recommended installation of runway centre line lights for maintaining directional control by flight crew during adverse weather. Also, it called for proper maintenance of soft ground portion of RESA. While the availability of runway strip of 75m on both sides of the runway centre line at Karipur is in variance with DGCA’s requirement of 140m, AAI had sought exemption in this case from DGCA. Following the mishap, DGCA had reduced the crosswind limit for aircraft operations in Jan 2021 stating that aircraft operations are not to be undertaken above crosswind of 15 Kt for dry runway and 10 Kt for wet runway, which may vary according to aircraft. AAIB has recommended that the long-pending permanent exemption for runway strip width (as sought vide letter on Sept 28, 2018) may be resolved by DGCA on priority. MP Abdussamad Samadani in a letter to civil aviation minister said that as the cause of the accident is not found to be related to runway or other infrastructure inadequacies, the operation of jumbo flights should be allowed from the airport immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/airport-hopes-wide-bodied-aircraft-ban-may-be-lifted/articleshow/86150078.cms||---

SAS Nagar is at the top (76.9 per 100 persons) followed by Hoshiarpur (56.2) and Pathankot (56). In Sangrur, just 30.2 per 100 persons of the entire population have received the first dose.While 16.2 per 100 persons have so far received both the doses in Ludhiana, the figure was 14.2 till August 31 and 13.1 till August 12, indicating a gradual increase. On the parameter, Ludhiana is among seven districts of the state with better value. At 28.9 of 100 persons, SAS Nagar has the best score, followed by Hoshiarpur (21.8), Pathankot (20.2), Jalandhar (19.5), SBS Nagar (18.1) and Gurdaspur (16.7).

Total number of persons eligible for vaccination (18 years old and above) are around 26 lakh in the district.”Health experts said eligible persons must be fully vaccinated ahead of the probable third wave.“It is good that about half of the population has received the first dose, but it is important to fully vaccinate more and more eligible persons. A person usually gets protection about 15 days after the second dose. Even after getting fully vaccinated, people must follow Covid rules,” said former SMO Dr Rajinder Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/nearly-half-of-dist-population-has-received-1st-covid-vax-dose/articleshow/86148314.cms||Shariq Majeed

District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said the vendor had arranged labourers for unloading the glass sheets. The glass sheets were being unloaded when they accidentally fell on the labourers, killing one of them. “The KV Temple trust has given Rs 2 lakh as immediate relief to the family of the deceased, while efforts are being made to ensure more financial assistance,” the DM said. According to officials, a consignment of glass sheets had reached KV Dham project area from Prayagraj in a pickup van on Saturday night. The vendor had arranged eight labourers from Maidagin market for the unloading of glass sheets. The labourers were allowed entry in the project area after the security personnel deployed in the highly sensitive Kashi Vishwanath Gyanvapi complex collected their personal details. When the labourers were unloading, a glass sheet slipped from their hands and fell on Sintu (25) of Baburi area and Vinod (25) of Jalipur in Chandauli district. Security personnel immediately rescued the duo and rushed them to SPG divisional hospital, where doctors declared Sintu as brought dead. The officials swung into action on being informed and the DM also reached the spot. Following initial investigation, the officials termed it an accident. The DM said that financial assistance for the kin of the deceased was provided by the temple trust immediately and proper treatment of the injured labourer is being ensured. In a gap of three months, this was the second incident in which a labourer lost his life in the project area. Earlier, on June 1, two labourers from Malda district in West Bengal were killed and six others were injured when the roof of a dilapidated and partially demolished building in the project area had collapsed and they were buried under its debris.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/labourer-killed-1-injured-as-glass-sheets-fall-in-kvt-project-area/articleshow/86150115.cms||---

Around 20 private guards were deployed with alcometer at all four gates of Har-ki-Pauri. Initially, only suspected pilgrims will be checked and handed over to the police for legal action, Ganga Sabha officials said. Interestingly, police officials denied having any information about the drive and claimed that Ganga Sabha did not contact them. SHO city police station Amarjeet Singh told TOI, "We do not have any idea about the campaign of the Ganga Sabha and they did not contact us in the matter.” Several recent incidents have been reported in which tourists were caught drinking liquor on the river bank in Haridwar and Rishikesh after which state police launched 'Operation Maryada' to reinforce to people the need to stay within limits while visiting religious spots. General secretary of Ganga Sabha, Tanmay Vashistha, told TOI, "It is our responsibility to maintain the dignity of Har-ki-Pauri. So, we have launched a breathalyser drive to curb menace of people who come to these sacred places and consume liquor. It is our own initiative to stop such activities which is why we have not informed the police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ganga-sabha-launches-breathalyzer-drive-at-har-ki-pauri/articleshow/86148318.cms||MS Nawaz

A number of vehicles pass through the stretch daily. The municipal corporation had dug up half of the road for laying new sewerage lines and on the other half it had set up road gulleys. With the road not levelled properly, there is a complete mess here. The MC, however, said it would start the road repair work after monsoon. Harish Jain, a commuter, said, “I take this road almost daily while going to Jalandhar. It is tough to drive here. Two days ago, a cart turned turtle after losing balance on a big pothole.”Gurjit Singh, a shopkeeper on this road, said, “Rain turns the stretch muddy and dry weather makes it dusty. The MC had dug it up for laying sewerage lines, but its timing was incorrect. The work should have been done months ago and the road repaired before monsoon. Even the road gulleys have not been set up properly.”Another commuter KK Garg said, “The road gives a short-cut to the national highway. Its poor condition is a nightmare for commuters. Same is the state of most of the city roads.”MC operation and maintenance cell SDO Anshul Garcha said, “To lay new sewerage lines, we had dug up half of the road. And before constructing it anew, we are placing road gulleys to check waterlogging. The practice was followed on all roads constructed before the rainy season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/driving-on-broken-jassian-road-is-a-nightmare-for-commuters/articleshow/86148342.cms||---

A total of 3,623 new cases were reported, taking the state’s overall tally closer to the 65-lakh mark (64,97,877). Upto 40% cases were reported from Pune division, which continues to see the highest volume of new infections. Of the 3,623 cases, the division registered 1,446 cases. It includes 700 cases from Pune district alone, 390 from Satara, 223 from Solapur and 126 from Pimpri-Chinchwad corporation areas. Nashik circle reported the second most cases (779), followed by Mumbai circle (city and Mumbai metropolitan region) with 751. In fact, MMR recorded less than 1,000 cases for 45 days. Aurangabad, Nagpur, Akola and Latur divisions together contributed 206 cases on Sunday. Daily casualties remained below 100 for the eleventh day in the state. As many as 26 districts did not report any Covid-19 deaths. Forty-six on Sunday took Maharashtra’s overall mortality count to 1,38,142. Cases and deaths remained steady in Mumbai too. On Sunday, 357 cases and seven deaths were reported. Mumbai’s cumulative tally now stands at 735055 and toll at 16,022. Five of the seven deceased had comorbidities. On continued transmission in Pune, Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said weather conditions appear to be the most plausible explanation. “The weather is more conducive for the virus to thrive. If we consider our decade-long experience with influenza H1N1 (formerly called swine flu), Pune has always been the worst affected. Mumbai, despite population density or mobility, didn’t see that kind of swine flu outbreak,” he said. Dr Awate ruled out the role of new variants in Pune region. “Delta is still dominant in the state,” he said, adding that there was no noteworthy increase in cases of Delta-plus, a sub-lineage of Delta variant. “We are constantly monitoring samples,” he said. Active cases in the state stood at 50,400 and 5,244 for Mumbai. Daily discharges are nearly as much as new case detections now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-3k-new-cases-slight-rise-in-daily-detections/articleshow/86153603.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The civic body issued the work order to the contractor in July and now it has served him with a notice to come and meet its officials this week. Until a plant starts working, the C&D waste will continue to be dumped in the vacant plots or abandoned green belts, ending up as not only an eyesore but also an air pollutant. The project was under discussion for a long time. The plant is to come up in Dhandhari Kalan under the Smart City mission. Officials claim that the project will be one of its kind, while the contractor is supposed to look after supply, installation, commissioning, operation, and maintenance for five years. The contractor will restore the C&D waste into sand and gravel that the MC can use in road construction or some other civil works.The superintending engineer of the MC’s bridges and road department, Rahul Gagneja, said: “We have given a notice to the contractor and he had promised to come and see us this week. We are hopeful that the work will now begin in the next few days.” Recently, a few MC officials and councillors had visited a C&D waste plant in Indore to study how debris was crushed and converted into paver tiles for roads. The delegation had advised mayor Balkar Sandhu that Ludhiana should do something like this to get rid of its construction and demolition waste. Officials in dilemmaSources in the municipal corporation said its officials were in a dilemma over building a plant to deal with the construction and demolition waste because, in the past, the carcass-processing plant and modern slaughterhouse built under the Smart City mission could not be used optimally. The carcass-processing plant is yet to start, while the slaughterhouse had a poor response.6 sites, umpteen dumpsSix sites were fixed for dumping the C&D waste but it’s deposited wide acorss the city. This debris from the new construction or renovation of houses or commercial units ends up in the city parks and green belts, besides on the canal banks. The dumping sites are on the Chandigarh, Dhandhari Kalan, Rahon, Barewal, Jugiana, and Kanganwal roads but mountains of this waste can also be seen around the Buddha Nullah, abandoned green belts, Model Town Extension, and Dugri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cd-waste-mountains-get-taller-recycling-project-in-deep-abyss/articleshow/86148356.cms||---

The Virology Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) of BHU had stopped conducting RT-PCR tests amid the looming threat of third Covid wave as the dues of companies and suppliers providing consumables for RT-PCR tests and drugs for treating black fungus surged to Rs 20 crore and the supplies were stalled. Varanasi DM Kaushal Raj Sharma told TOI on Sunday, “The state government is preparing to extend funds to BHUs labs and hospitals for RT-PCR tests and other Covid-19 facilities. BHU officials informed that the dues of companies and suppliers providing consumables for RT-PCR tests and drugs for treating black fungus infection, have surged to Rs 20 crore. We have asked them to submit a breakup.” Medical superintendent of SSL hospital of BHU, Prof K K Gupta said details of dues are being prepared for being sent to district administration. The Multidisciplinary Research Unit of the anatomy department in Institute of Medical Science (IMS-BHU) also conduct RT-PCR tests but has limited funds. Swab samples from Varanasi and five surrounding districts were being tested in VRDL and Multidisciplinary Research Unit labs only. BHU officials said the university receives grants from the Union ministry of education but there was no provision for expenditure on tackling pandemic in it. “Despite this fact, we extended full cooperation to the state government in combating Covid-19. However, the dues of expenditure on RT-PCR tests in labs and Covid-19 treatment facilities kept piling up,” said Prof Gupta. VRDL in-charge Prof Gopal Nath said, “Since the first Covid wave, 21 lakh samples, including 10.50 lakh during second wave, were tested at VRDL. The state government does not give funds for consumables like microtip, PPE kits, masks, gloves, sanitisers, head covers, plastic plates for RNA extraction, PCR plates and others. On an average, Rs 100 is spent on consumables for each RT-PCR test. Expenditure on these items only has been Rs 11 crore.” In view of increasing pressure from suppliers to clear their dues, the university administration held a meeting on August 7 in which it was decided to discontinue RT-PCR tests at VRDL from August 16. “We were given assurance by the district officials and so we continued conducting tests till August 31. However, when the dues of suppliers were not cleared, we stopped testing from September 1,” said Prof Nath. The DM said that Rs 9.5 crore will be paid in three instalments through State Disaster Relief Fund to clear the dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/state-govt-to-clear-dues-ensurert-pcr-tests-continue-at-bhu/articleshow/86150138.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Opposition leaders are not only trying to trace the presence of intelligence sleuths but are also objecting to their presence at the political events. It has led to a few activists resorting to violence against the plain clothed security operatives. Two different cases were registered by Karimnagar police after intelligence officials lodged complaints alleging assault, vehicle damage and obstructing them from performing their official duties. Following these incidents, former minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eatala Rajender, who is expected to be BJP’s candidate in the upcoming Huzurabad by-election, called up senior Telangana police officials and raised objection at intelligence surveillance of his political events. Nearly two weeks ago, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) rank official was taking photos and videographing a BJP political event, where new members were joining the party in Rajender’s presence. This was noticed by Rajender himself and he allegedly took objection to it and questioned the plain clothed policeman. “Who sent you to take the photos?” the former minister asked the policeman. More than eight BJP activists immediately rushed towards the ASI and they alleged hurled abuses at him and assaulted him. When another constable tried to intervene, he too was allegedly abused and his vehicle was damaged. “Later, Rajender was told that intelligence officials and Special Branch (SB) officials will be there at any political event irrespective of political party and he need not have unnecessary doubts. He expressed some other grievances too and we assured him that police will look into it,’‘ sources in Telangana police told TOI. The presence of intelligence wing at political events in the run up to the Huzurabad by-election has been a controversial issue for several months with parties, especially BJP, taking strong objection to the surveillance||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intel-sleuths-seen-at-political-events-oppn-netas-see-red/articleshow/86152256.cms||Srinath Vudali

Police said Akshay Saxena of HAL colony in Kanpur’s Ramadevi Chakeri area used to travel on reserved berth in the VIP train to carry out the thefts of backpacks and trolley-bags of passengers after they slept during the overnight journey. Circle Officer GRP Qamrul Hasan said, “He was arrested from the city side platform on Saturday.” “There has been a major rise in theft cases in Dibrugarh-Rajdhani train these days. Subsequently, a joint team of GRP and RPF was constituted and investigation was initiated. As part of the drive, we started monitoring all those who de-boarded the coaches of the train on arrival at Kanpur Central through CCTV,” the CO said. During monitoring we found a man alighting from the train several times. “Each time he de-boarded the train he had a different trolley bag in his hand. After suspicion, he was identified from the CCTV footage. The passengers who made the complaint also identified him,” said the CO. He said the GRP team then laid a trap and on the morning of September 11 they arrested Saxena. During interrogation, he made shocking revelations. “He said that he usually used to board Dibrugarh-Rajdhani Express and travel from Kishanganj in Bihar after procuring a reservation ticket. During the journey, he used to roam around in other coaches. After midnight, when most of the passengers used to sleep, he would pick up their bags and get down as soon as the train arrived at Kanpur Central. A large number of trolley-bags and backpack bags were recovered from his house. He has been booked under relevant sections of IPC and sent to jail,” said the official further. The police said passengers should remain extra cautious about their belongings as thieves seem to have switched over to a different modus operandi in VIP trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/mba-graduate-held-for-stealing-bags-from-vip-train/articleshow/86150165.cms||---

The function is being organised by the Indian Air Force as part of 50 years of the 1971 War victory.The flying officer was posthumously awarded PVC in recognition of his defence of Srinagar airbase against Pakistan air force’s raid during the war.Late officer’s 38-year-old nephew Amardeep Singh, who lives with his mother Jagnandan Kaur in Rajguru Nagar, Ludhiana, said they have been invited for the function, which his mother would also attend. “We are proud that we are from the family of the officer who was the only one from the IAF to get a Param Vir Chakra. As the government is celebrating 50 years of the 1971 War’s victory, IAF called me to Adampur, where I lit a baton and now they have invited us to attend the function. Though the programme was slated for March 30, it was delayed due to Covid,” said Amardeep. He said his father and late uncle had got married on the same day in 1970 and after a year Nirmaljit Singh achieved martyrdom. He didn’t have any children and his wife remarried. Villagers are also proud of the PVC flying officer. “Who doesn’t know about him here? We have been seeing films on his valour for decades now. I was around eight years old when I heard about his martyrdom. Though not many villagers are being allowed to attend the IAF function because of Covid restrictions, we have heard that schoolchildren and around 15 villagers will be attending it. We heard there will be programmes on the valour of Nirmaljit Singh on the day,” said Ranjit Singh, a villager. On Sunday, IAF officials were seen making arrangements for the function and a pack of children from the village were rehearsing.Shinda, another village, pointed to government apathy towards the village of the martyr. “This village of PVC Nirmaljit Singh lacks proper roads. We don’t have a transport facility from here to Mullanpur or to Ludhiana. We don’t like asking for a lift from drivers on the main road. Not only the state government, but the Centre also did not think about it. They could have done something about the roads now when IAF is holding a function here.” When asked about it, chief minister’s political secretary Captain Sandeep Sandhu, who contested from Dakha assembly segment in the byelection, said funds have been allocated for roads in Issewal and work would start after monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/only-pvc-from-air-force-to-get-memorial-tomorrow/articleshow/86148392.cms||Shariq Majeed

Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said it saves the trouble of contractual hiring if the job is outsourced. “If any of the staff leaves mid-way, one has to repeat the hiring process again. Now, this responsibility has been entrusted to private players,” he said. The workforce that has been outsourced includes medical officers, pharmacists, staff nurses, among others.

On Sunday, around 30 unidentified people, including 10 named, were booked by Dineshpur police following a complaint filed by the SOG in-charge Kamlesh Bhatt. Police arrested four persons, including a woman, and sent them to jail. The SOG team, led by sub-inspector (SI) Surendra Pratap Singh, following an input about possession of illegal arms and a loot case, had raided the house of one Niranjan Mandal in Jagdishpur village. Superintendent of police (SP), city, Mamata Vohra, said, "In July this year, an employee of a cash collection agency was looted in broad daylight in Subhash Colony of Rudrapur. In the course of investigation, it was suspected that Niranjan Mandal was a part of the gang which committed the loot." Vohra added, "A team of SOG was sent to his house to interrogate him. But as soon as the team entered his house, Niranjan and his wife Champa called a few others and they collectively attacked the SOG team. They misbehaved with the woman constable and also tried to snatch the service revolver from SI Singh.

But a good spell that started from last Tuesday turned the tables – the overall rainfall was 49.8% till September 5. The rainfall increased by 11.6% as it reached 61.4% on September 12. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast mentioned that the wet spell is likely to continue for the next five days with a majority of the regions in Gujarat standing a chance to get good rainfall. According to GSDMA data, the biggest gainers were north Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra where over 10% deficit was wiped out. Kutch got 15% of seasonal rainfall, whereas Saurashtra and north Gujarat got 14% rain. “The low-pressure area over southwest Rajasthan & adjoining Gujarat region along with cyclonic circulation is one of the systems active over the region that would give a good rainfall. Moreover, a trough from northeast Arabian Sea to east-central Bay of Bengal would further accentuate the scenario for Gujarat,” said a Met department official. “The systems are covering almost entire Gujarat, and thus all regions are likely to get good rainfall for the next four days.” Ahmedabad city recorded 3mm rainfall from 6am to 8pm on Sunday. Of 251 talukas of Gujarat, 198 got at least 1mm rainfall on Sunday. Khambhalia in Devbhoomi Dwarka got 98mm rainfall, followed by 66mm in Kaprada in Valsad, 64mm in Muli in Surendranagar, 63mm in Limdi in Surendranagar, and 59mm in Jamnagar. In all, 12 talukas got 50mm or more rainfall on Sunday.

Four police teams have been formed with senior officers, including the Moradabad DIG, to investigate the case, police said. The family on Saturday had alleged that police refused to file the FIR saying that the area where the crime took place was not under their jurisdiction. It was, instead, something the GRP had to look into, they said. The closest GRP station was about 40km away in Najibabad, where the FIR was eventually lodged after local BSP members intervened. Unidentified persons were booked under sections 302 [murder] and 376 [rape] of the IPC. On Sunday, a senior police officer said that cops have picked up a few clues and are now working on multiple fronts. Moradabad DIG Shalabh Mathur is now camping in Bijnor to keep a close watch on the probe. Mathur told TOI, "We found some clues. Multiple teams are working on them. I hope that the case will be cracked soon." The young player's body was dumped amid piles of cement railway sleepers less than 100m from her home in Bijnor on Friday afternoon. Her clothes had been pulled down, her face badly bruised, a tooth broken and her neck had strangulation marks when the body was found. Her family said she had been raped. “On Friday, she had gone to a private school for a job interview,” her father, who works as a daily wager at a sugar mill, had said. When she didn’t return for hours, her family was worried. “We started looking for her. Around 3pm, a neighbour said a girl — they thought she was unconscious — was found lying close to the railway line amid cement sleepers.

The CM held a review meeting on Covid 19 cases along with the health officials at Pragati Bhavan on Sunday. Officials informed that while there are 2.80 crore people who are above 18-years-old, 1.42 crore people have received single dose of vaccine and 53 lakh have been vaccinated second doses. Another 1.38 crore are yet to receive single dose in the state. KCR directed the officials to involve all local bodies elected representatives such as gram panchayat sarpanches, ZPTCs, MPTCs, village secretaries, ward members to take up the special drive. “Gram Panchayats sarpanches had done good work during lockdowns by providing food and isolation centres.

---||Kochi||Decentralize decision to reopen schools at local level, says Indian Academy of Paediatrics||KOCHI: The decision on school reopening should be decentralized and taken at the local level (districts or taluk/city/village/school) as per the prevailing pandemic situation there rather than at the national or state level, said Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), the largest association of paediatrics. IAP said that they would not recommend the seropositivity of the population as an epidemiological indicator for school reopening as it is unreliable. They also said that educational void is increasing, and students, parents and the teaching community are eagerly awaiting reopening of schools. IAP, which published guidelines and recommendations on ‘School Reopening, Remote Learning, and Curriculum during and after Covid-19 Pandemic’ in 2020, has constituted a ‘Task Force on School Reopening 2021’ to review and update its earlier recommendations to suit the present Covid scenario in the country. The 12-member task force has prepared an advisory that proposes a slew of recommendations to be considered while school reopening. “Children have been homebound for more than 17 months now. Consequently, they are displaying significant physical and psychosocial health issues. Studies have shown that schools do not act as significant sources of viral transmission. However, the horrific experiences during the second wave are unforgettable and act as a big barrier to any attempts to bring the children back to school. Government authorities, school administrators, and parents appear to be in dilemma and confusion. The decision for school reopening, therefore, needs to be taken vigilantly with a scientific temper,” said the advisory. Besides decentralized decision-making, IAP said that strict compliance to Covid-appropriate behavior (social distancing, masking, sanitization, etc) by everyone in the community should be ensured. Also, local Covid statistics should be vigilantly followed and the decision to keep schools open should be reviewed every 15 days. Schools and governments should facilitate students back to school by arranging transport as before, and not imposing restrictions like RTPCR tests of students. “The current scientific research suggests that seroprevalence is an unreliable indicator with high false positivity and should not direct policy decisions on social restrictions. This unreliability is due to factors like restricted population surveys, non-representative samples, uncertainty around test accuracy, and limited knowledge about antibodies in the long term. To understand the disease epidemiology, the survey results need to be interpreted in the context of other external information, such as confirmed cases, deaths, and infectious disease models. Hence, IAP does not recommend the seropositivity of the population as an epidemiological indicator for school reopening,” the advisory said. IAP also said that students above the age of 18 years should have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. Also, high-risk children — those suffering from chronic diseases like asthma, kidney diseases, disabled children, children on steroids, etc — should consult their pediatricians before joining the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/decentralize-decision-to-reopen-schools-at-local-level/articleshow/86150235.cms||---

Senior leaders of our party are trying to sort out the problem and are deliberating with the local functionaries.”The KPCC president expressed satisfaction with the party’s performance in the HDMC polls, pointing to the increase in the support base among the voters of the twin cities. “We suffered a setback here owing to our choice in candidates. Five Congress rebels won the elections, and these corporators have expressed their intention to return to the party. The Congress will sit in opposition in the HDMC Council, and perform its role responsibly,” Shivakumar said.The outcome of the poll, Shivakumar dubbed a ‘setback’ for the BJP. “Despite the chief minister, former CM and a union minister campaigning in Hubballi, the BJP failed to obtain a simple majority. The delimitation of wards was done in a manner to benefit the BJP, and the reservation matrix too finalised to its favour. Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi and Jagadish Shettar can claim that they are pleased with the party’s performance,” Shivakumar said.On Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani’s resignation, Shivakumar said that the people were unhappy with increasing corruption in the BJP-ruled states, compelling the saffron party to change guard in four states.Former minister and senior Congress leader RV Deshpande pointed out that the BJP had failed to obtain a clear majority in the HDMC polls despite having been in power in the civic body since 2004. “Nearly 60% of the electorate voted against the BJP,” Deshpande said.Former MP and KPCC working president R Dhruvanarayana pointed to the low voter turnout for the HDMC poll. “It indicates that the people are unhappy with the BJP,” he said.MLAs Prasad Abbayya and Kusumavati Shivalli were among those in attendance at the ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-poll-result-a-setback-for-the-bjp-says-dks/articleshow/86148410.cms||---

Despite the heavy rain proving a dampener over the past two days, eateries across the city have reported a rise in the number of customers.There are nearly 700 dine-in restaurants in Noida and Greater Noida. With Delhi staying open, most restaurants earlier were losing out on dinner profits to the neighbouring city.“The time relaxation has been a huge relief for restaurants, though it has been just a few days. Overall, restaurants are seeing a 10-15% increase in business and we expect the number of customers to increase this week. Many people still don’t know that the curfew timing has been extended till 11 pm, so markets still start getting deserted by 9-9:30 pm,” said Varun Khera, head of the Noida chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI).Restaurateurs with eateries within malls said business has increased beyond expectations even as they were slower to catch up after the first lockdown. This time around the malls started getting increased footfall.According to Amit Bagga, co-founder and CEO of Daryaganj Restaurant that recently opened up in Mall of India, “The response has been much better than our expectations, especially since the relaxation in timings. We have seen about a 30% increase in business already, though we were expecting that dine-ins will pick up slowly.” The Daryaganj restaurants are located at five places across Delhi-NCR. It opened in Noida in August and is already serving dinner to about 50-60 people daily.Meanwhile, the pubs and bars are still waiting for the night curfew to be lifted. Club owners complained that the current curfew timing only affects one business, while all others can operate.“Delhi has all clubs and pubs open till late night now. People are going there. Meanwhile, we have paid extra for a '2 am license' and there is no relaxation in the fee too. Still, we are operating as a restaurant. The party crowd usually starts coming in around 10 pm and leaves by 1 am-2 am. That crowd, which is 45-50% of our entire business, is not back,” said Ajeet Sharma, owner of Time Machine in Gardens Galleria Mall, Noida.Sushil Kumar Jain, convener, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said that traders have been seeking relaxation in curfew timings and the demands have been gradually met.

Cops said Susmita’s cousin Sanjay Das (44) had planned and executed the crime. His younger brother Sandip (32) accompanied him to carry out the murders. The Das brothers are residents of Shyampur at Ghoshpara in Maheshtala.They will be produced in a local court on Monday. “We had picked up Sanjay for questioning on Saturday evening. He finally broke down past midnight during questioning. He was arrested at Lalbazar around 2am. His brother was arrested two hours later on Sunday morning from near India Exchange Place,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. According to the police, Sanjay had murdered Susmita to rob her gold. The gold, however, is yet to be recovered. “Sanjay was employed at a departmental store in Esplanade as a CCTV maintenance staff. He barely earned Rs 14,000 per month. During the lockdown his salary was reduced, putting him in a financial crisis. The crisis further escalated after he married a widow, whose son (from her first marriage) also had to be married off sometime ago. His son’s marriage left him debt-ridden and he began taking loans from his colleagues and neighbours. About a month-and-a-half ago, the lenders demanded that the borrowed money be paid back. It was around this time that Sanjay contacted Susmita and asked for a loan of Rs 5,000. He requested her not to reveal it to either Susmita’s father or Sanjay’s mother. Susmita assured him that she would arrange the money sometime but she revealed Sanjay’s pleas to Sanjay’s mother. This had upset him,” said a police source. Sanjay told cops that he had decided to murder Susmita for the gold about a month ago and got his brother Sandip on board about 12 days ago. Three days before the crime, the two brothers had come on a bike and carried out a recce. They finalised the road that they would take to avoid CCTV cameras and also studied that the CCTV in the flat was not working. Last Monday — exactly a week ago — Sanjay told his colleagues that his maternal aunt had died (in reality, she had passed away two-and-half-a-year ago) and skipped office. The accused slashed the woman multiple times with a knife and on hearing his mother’s scream, Tamojit rushed to the spot. Both the victims tried to resist the attack but they were overpowered and killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cousins-held-for-killing-behala-woman-and-son/articleshow/86150305.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Prayagraj and Lucknow had maximum active cases till three days ago. The number of cases is not alarming yet. While Noida has been registering 2-3 cases daily, all other districts have not been reporting any fresh case of late. Neighbouring Ghaziabad also has also stopped reporting fresh cases for almost a week now. It has just two active cases as of now. Meanwhile, Noida had 17 active cases till Saturday and two new cases were added to the tally. The district has reported a total of over 63,000 cases so far. Officials said the cases were not a cause for concern as the positivity rate was still low. They said that since the district has a large floating population and many of its residents travel to nearby cities for work, reducing the cases to zero was extremely difficult. “We are tracking the numbers closely. We are taking all precautions, asking people to follow Covid protocols and also keeping the testing numbers high. There is no need to worry now. But people should be vigilant in their social interactions,” said Suhas LY, the district magistrate. 22 cases in DelhiDelhi recorded 22 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours with a positivity rate of 0.04% on Sunday and zero fatalities. The month of September has recorded one death due to the disease, which was reported on September 7. The 22 cases recorded on Sunday were from 61,968 tests, including 47,028 RT-PCR and 14,940 rapid tests. With 44 patients recovering from Covid in the last 24 hours, the number of active cases stood at 390 on Sunday, down from the 412 active cases on Saturday. The number of containment zones also dipped to 94 from 100 on Saturday and is the lowest since May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/at-2-3-noidas-daily-cases-states-highest/articleshow/86152336.cms||---

The examination was held by the National Testing Agency (NTA) following approval from the Supreme Court to conduct it as per schedule despite strong opposition from a section of students. The court rejected a plea filed by some students claiming that NEET-UG was clashing with other exams. This year, 16,118 male and 35,559 female candidates registered for the NEET-UG from Telangana. As per NTA, almost 60% testing centres recorded attendance above 94%. For many students, the biology section was easy while chemistry and physics sections were moderately tough this year. “As compared to last year, the question paper was slightly moderate for me. There were a few questions in physics which took more time to solve. The chemistry section was slightly lengthy,” said Shreya Kotagiri who took the test at Vikas Concept School. The examination was conducted following all Covid-19 protocols. Although the examination was scheduled from 2 pm to 5 pm, students were allowed to enter the examination centre from 11 am to avoid crowding. Following one-minute late rule, some students were allegedly not allowed in an examination centre in Nampally. “Vanita College at Exhibition Ground is not allowing more than 40 students to enter the examination centre just because they were late by a minute for NEET. @SabithaindraTRS who will take responsibility if they take any extreme step in depression,” tweeted Sumaiya Khan. At many exam centres, students were seen doing away with religious threads, plastic wrappers to carry Aadhaar card and hall ticket, socks etc. to follow exam rule. While the question paper and OMR was distributed among students at 1.50 pm, they were not allowed to fill the OMR until 2 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-50k-take-neet-held-under-covid-shadow-in-t/articleshow/86152344.cms||---

Doctors said that his recovery is satisfactory. Dr Chirag Solanki, a neurosurgeon with Sterling Hospital, said that the man had the condition for the past eight years. “In simple terms, dystonia could be understood as a neurophysical condition where the patient experiences twisting of the limbs that makes leading normal life difficult. DBS could be understood as the device or treatment akin to pacemaker for heart. In this case, the man’s conditions started with difficulty in writing with right hand that later progressed to the entire upper limb, trunk and neck,” he said, adding that it could well be one of the first DBS procedures for dystonia. Compared to movement disorders such as tremors or Parkinson’s Disease, DBS is relatively rarer, said experts, and has no conventional treatment or medication available. “Early diagnosis and treatment can give some respite to the patients,” said a city-based neurologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dystonia-sufferer-gets-treated/articleshow/86150296.cms||---

---||Puducherry||When Ba met Ghosh: How Puducherry brought out the best in Mahakavi Subramania Bharati||By P Raja Mahakavi Subramania Bharati’s stay in Pondicherry for a decade from 1908 to 1918 turned out to be the most creative period in his lifetime. Bharati arrived in Pondicherry, to escape the tightening net of the British government and found peace and patronage of his admirers. Kuppusamy Iyengar looked after the new political refugee in Pondicherry for a time. Soon the patriotic Mandayam brothers, Tirumalalachariar and Srinivasachariar, who launched a new Tamil weekly, ‘India’ in 1906 with the purpose of providing a free outlet for Bharati’s flaming words, too shifted to Pondicherry from Madras and continued publishing ‘India’ from here. Subramania Bharati’s home in Puducherry is now a museum with a libraryAfter moving to Pondicherry, Bharati felt that he was no more in shackles and that his pen could flow freely. Every piece he wrote in his weekly was satirical to the core. In every issue what actually took the cake was the cartoon on the cover page. In the history of Tamil journalism, ‘India’, published every Saturday, was the first to bring out cartoons. It is said that every cartoon was drawn under the able guidance of Bharati. ‘India’ became a household name. The public loved the cartoons so much that they cut the page, pasted it on cardboard and displayed it in front of their houses. The British took several measures to stop the printing of the journal. But all such efforts only publicised the journal more. The French government in Pondicherry turned down the request by the British to ban the journal. The best of his poetical works like ‘Panchali Sabatham’, ‘Kuyil Paattu’ and ‘Kannan Paattu’ were all inspired writings from Pondicherry. Bharati’s friendship with a like-minded political refugee-cum-intellectual Sri Aurobindo, made him write his essays in English for the monthly journal, ‘Arya’, edited by the latter. Sri Aurobindo learned the Tamil language and translated excerpts from Tamil Classical literature with the help of his poet-friend. Both of them being well versed in the Sanskrit language, joined their heads for the study of the Vedas and Upanishads. The result was the birth of ‘Vachana Kavithaigal’. These prose poems of Bharati liberate Tamil literature from the tyranny of prosody. The influence of Walt Whitman’s poetry made him enrich Tamil Literature with soulful poetry. His prose poems pulsate with life and are a real feast for meditative readers. Bharati found a soulmate in Aurobindo. Aurobindo called Bharati as ‘Ba’ and Bharati called Aurobindo as ‘Ghosh’. Such was their intimacy. It would be appropriate to record here an interesting episode that took place in Aurobindo’s house. One evening, when everybody left, Aurobindo found his shoes missing. It took little time for him to guess who had walked away with them. Smiling, he pulled out his letter pad and pen and began writing a letter to his brother Barin in Calcutta: "I am in need of a pair of shoes very urgently, for Bharati has walked away with the one you have sent me a few days ago. His need is greater than mine." Pondicherry not only gave the Mahakavi a new life but boosted his career as well for he had patrons, friends, and admirers in plenty. He made a small coterie of disciples too. Kanaka Subburathinam, who later became famous as Bharatidasan, was the chief of his disciples. Bharati found a guru too. Following Aurobindo’s lead, Bharati became a disciple of Kullasamy (a dwarf saint). In his long poem ‘Bharati Arupatharu’ (Bharati sixty-six), he showers encomiums on four of his friends — Kullasamy, Govindasamy, Yazhpanathusamy and Kuvali Kannan — during his self-imposed exile. In this poem Bharati confesses that he had a darshan of Kullasamy at Rajarama Iyer’s house in Easwaran Dharmaraja Koil Street and became a realised soul after listening to his ‘Gnanopadesh’. During his last days in Pondicherry, Bharati’s life was not smooth and he had to face a series of family problems. Overwhelmed by the situation, Bharati took to drugs. And the poet’s friends V V S Iyer and Parali Su Nellaiappan invariably said that Bharati’s addiction to drugs was the result of his friendship with Kullasamy. Just like the coastal town influenced the poet, Bharati’s imprint on Pondicherry is undeniable. The government of Puducherry not only honoured Bharati with a statue and named the Government Park after him, but also preserved as a national monument his house in Easwararan Dharmaraja Koil Street, where he lived and preached the religion of love.

Health officials said with ample vaccine availability, they can achieve the one crore vaccination mark by September-end. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The state is allotting the vaccine doses to the districts which are exhausting them at the earliest. This way, the Pune district is doing quite well. We will be getting another bumper lot of doses on Tuesday and we will be achieving the one crore doses feat well before September-end.” Authorities in Pune rural, which has got an enormous boost to the vaccination from the last week of August, are planning to continue the momentum with a few more special drives. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Pune ZP, told TOI, “We covered about 82,000 vaccination in rural areas on Saturday. The fact that our staff members kept aside the festivities in their homes and chose to be on duty to vaccinate, makes our current achievement quite special. We did not put any pressure on anyone to work on Saturday. It was by their own motivation to do their duty and save lives. I salute everyone who worked towards this incredible feat. With this momentum, we will vaccinate all the eligible population at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/of-dists-90l-vaccines-in-8-months-65l-are-first-doses/articleshow/86150342.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert in Jalna, Parbhani, Beed, Hingoli and Nanded districts for September 13 and 14. While Aurangabad, which reported few spells of moderate to heavy showers on Saturday night, is very likely to experience such adverse weather condition on September 14. Latur and Osmanabad districts are very likely to get light to medium showers for the next 48-hours beginning from Monday. While different parts of Maharashtra are also likely to witness rainfall at least for the next couple of days, the forecast of rain especially for Marathwada is a cause of worry as the region has already received excess showers with some areas struggling to cope with the aftermath of floods that occurred due to incessant rainfall on September 7 and 8. Nanded district so far has been at the more receiving end of heavy rain, prompting the district administration to ask citizens to take precautionary measures in the wake of the latest IMD forecast. “In case of a flood-like situation, cover all drains including toilet hole with sands bags to avoid backflow of rainwater coming into houses. Collect your valuables and important documents in one place and keep them at a higher place in the home. Shut down the power supply and LPG connection. If the flood situation becomes grim, take shelter in open grounds or heightened places outside the house,” said Nanded resident deputy collector Pradeep Kulkarni. With over 3 mm showers during the past 24-hours, which ended by Sunday morning, Marathwada has now received 805 mm rainfall since June 1. It accounts for 139% of expected showers. The region has received 165 mm rainfall in September so far, which is 248% of normal rainfall, causing floods in some areas and flood-like situations in many areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/yellow-alert-for-already-rain-battered-marathwada-districts-sparks-concern/articleshow/86146463.cms||---

The overall question paper had 180 multiple choice questions from physics, chemistry and biology (botany and zoology). Question paper analysis by experts from various institutions indicated that while the biology section was easy, chemistry and physics were moderately difficult. “Two questions in physics had very close answers. In Biology, four of the 100 questions were out of NCERT textbooks and answer to one question which was related to venereal diseases was ambiguous as it had two correct answers,” said V Kumar, executive dean for NEET at Sri Chaitanya Group of Institutions, expecting the cut-off to drop from 490 last year to 470-475 this year. Experts said that the question paper was slightly tougher than last year’s. “While biology was student-friendly, physics was moderately difficult. Physics usually has more direct formula based or concept based questions. However this time, multiple concepts were involved in nearly six to ten questions, making it slightly difficult for students. Chemistry was tad lengthy as more physical calculations and memory based concepts were involved,” said NM Habeeb, NEET wing head of Narayana Group of Institutions (India).

The peak was on September 6, when nearly 14,000 were fined. Data shows that people being penalised had dropped to below 5,000 till recently. But on August 29, civic chief I S Chahal, in a stern message to ward officers, said they must ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour among citizens at any cost, and that he would be monitoring the achievements of every ward. Over the weekend people penalized for not wearing masks hovered around 10,000-12,000, which was double the number of those penalized last month. Civic records show that on August 14, 4,945 people were penalised. Mumbai Police have joined hands with BMC to take action against anti-maskers. At the beginning of the second wave of Covid-19, BMC had given marshals a target to act against 25,000 citizens per day. A civic official said with the festive season around many more people are moving out and they tend to get lax. “Marshals have been stationed at high footfall areas in the city,” he said, adding that there are orders to fine people on the spot for not wearing masks appropriately as it cannot be compromised at any cost, because it is not only unsafe for them but for fellow citizens who may come in their close proximity.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Conman lands in Facebook trap to meet ‘lady friend’, walks into police van instead||KOLKATA: When Kolkata Police officers Premjit Biswas and Disha Mukherjee entered into a conversation on Facebook messenger with a profile resembling that of the fraudster Angad Mehta, who had duped a Gariahat jewellery store in August 19, little did they know that their efforts over the next two weeks would land conman Sarthak Rao Babras in police net. Forty-two-year-old Babras has served prison terms in Hyderabad and Port Blair and he has been implicated in various cases in Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Lucknow. Babras is believed to have cheated multiple five-star hotels, jewellery stores and with his multiple forged identities, he would simply vanish into thin air. His luck ran out on September 5 when the two officers conned him to believe that his new lady friend on Facebook, Payel Sharma, was desperate to meet him. In custody, when he told cops about his real name, they realised his web of lies and fraudulent activities across India. Earlier, the Gariahat police, having used digital forensics, could finally trace a social media profile, which resembled that of Babras. According to the FIR lodged with the Gariahat police station, the fraudster had checked into a shady Hindustan Park guest house that had no CCTV cover with a fake voter card named Angad Mehta, which he shared on WhatsApp. Babras had ordered jewellery online, asking for cash-on-delivery. When the jewellery, worth Rs 1.9 lakh, was delivered, he took it on the pretext of showing it to his wife in the next room and then vanished. His voter ID turned out to be fake while all his phones were switched off. Barring a WhatsApp image that he had provided to the guest house, he left no other trace. That single image was traced to a Facebook profile. The Gariahat police studied the Facebook profile. Babras’s lifestyle and his tendency to respond to his multiple women friends led Biswas and Mukherjee to lay the trap. Having earned his trust, the officers lured him from Andhra Pradesh to Millennium Park. Babras, dressed neatly, came to meet his new lady friend but walked into a prison van instead. After that, his real identity emerged. According to the investigators, Babras, who is from Port Blair, has a long antecedent of committing such crimes. As per the details available with cops, he had been arrested in Port Blair in 2012 and six years later in Hyderabad. In Port Blair, he had been in prison for a brief period of time but he had served a three-year-term in Chanchalguda Correctional Home. In Port Blair, he was arrested for slipping out after checking into a five-star hotel of Hyderabad like Kolkata where he had tricked a delivery executive into handing him the jewellery, which he had ordered online. “These are the two specific instances we have got. We are trying to find out more about his past criminal records,” said a senior police officer. Investigators first realised their catch when they – along with Salt Lake police – scanned the OYO hotel room he had checked into Salt Lake sector-2 when he reached Kolkata early this month. Police seized two voter IDs (EPIC no NOH00782648 in the name of Harsh Oberoi and ANQ00785461 in the name of Angad Mehta). But it was the seized Aadhar card (456800243490) that gave the name Sarthak Rao Babras. An internet search and an interrogation did the rest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/conman-lands-in-fb-trap-to-meet-lady-friend-walks-into-police-van-instead/articleshow/86150365.cms||Saibal Sen

---||Amaravati||AP: New rail line ready for operations, to boost industries||AMARAVATI: The new Piduguralla-Savalyapuram railway line, part of the prestigious Nadikudi-Srikalahasti project, is ready for commencement of operations. With commissioner of railway safety (CRS) giving green signal, railway authorities are now gearing up to launch services. The construction of the 46-km long track between Piduguralla on Guntur-Secunderabad section and Savalyapuram on Guntur-Bengaluru section was completed recently. This new rail line is expected to boost the industrial growth in the drought-hit areas of Palnadu region in Guntur district. This line would also act as an alternative facility to operate trains during emergencies.  After getting the CRS clearance, the south central railway (SCR) general manager Gajanan Mallya has decided to inspect the section on Monday. Sources said the SCR would send a formal request to the railway board for grant of clearance to launch the passenger/goods services after the GM’s inspection. Guntur divisional railway manager (DRM) R Mohan Raja inspected the new line and set the stage for the GM’s inspection. “Commissioner of railway safety has granted permission to operate trains at a speed of 80kmph on trial basis. Speed limit will be increased after completion of trial run,” said a senior official.  The authorities of SCR are contemplating to divert the freight movement services between Bengaluru and Secunderbad via new line. Sources said the new section would be a boon to the cement factories located in the Rayalaseema region as well as Palnadu of Guntur district. In fact, Nadikudi-Srikalahsti rail project was on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s top priority infrastructure projects list. With the Centre focusing on the completion of the works, railway engineering authorities are closely monitoring the progress of other packages part of the total project.  Though the project was granted in 2010, delay in completion of land acquisition halted the project. The state has promised to complete acquisition by December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/new-rail-line-ready-for-ops-to-boost-industries/articleshow/86148553.cms||Samdani MN

Vishnoi was hit by a bullet in his head during an anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir on August 27 and after battling for his life at the Military Hospital in Udhampur, passed away on Saturday. He was cremated in his hometown in Meerut on Sunday. A recipient of the Sena Medal on August 15 this year, Vishnoi made a video call to his sister on Rakhi and that was the last time his family saw him alive. “He showed me the Rakhi on his wrist and said he will come to meet me soon. He broke his promise,” said his sister, Tanu, before bursting into tears. Son of retired Subedar Virendra Vishnoi, he had come to visit home in March when his parents and wife had tested positive for Covid-19 and he had spent his vacation taking care of them. He was expected to visit home this year-end for some family function. Seeing him being carried in a coffin for cremation, his mother and sister fainted. It was his wife Swati who turned into a pillar of support for the family. “We don’t know from where she got this strength from but she was consoling everyone. As if she is getting this strength from Mayank himself,” said Vaibhav Singh, the late officer’s brother-in-law. Thousands attended Vishnoi’s last rites. The lanes and bylanes near his home were choked with people who showered petals on the coffin as cries of “Bharat Mata ki jai '' rent the air . “He was passionate about serving the country since childhood. He used to say that he would like to eat a bullet rather than medicines. No one would have ever imagined that he would leave us so soon,” said his father while talking to the media. As a tribute to the late Army officer, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the family, a government job for one of his relatives and a road that would be named after the Major in his hometown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/widow-of-major-killed-in-terror-op-stands-up-to-be-son-of-family/articleshow/86148563.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: King George’s Medical University to revive cadaveric multi-organ donation unit||LUCKNOW: King George’s Medical University is set to revive its Cadaveric Multi Organ Donation (CMOD) programme in a full-fledged manner. The programme will help save hundreds of lives per year by retrieving organs from brain dead patients for transplant into those whose organs have failed. It would also enlighten the lives of visually challenged people through cornea transplant and help those suffering from skin cancer and severe burn injuries. KGMU trauma centre, on an average, records 1-2 brain deaths daily. Most of these patients are victims of accidents. Several organs, including two kidneys, two lungs, liver, heart, pancreas, intestines, corneas and skin tissues among others can be retrieved from a body. KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Prof Bipin Puri, who has taken the initiative to revive the CMOD programme, said, “As a first step to revive the programme, the university will organise awareness workshops from Tuesday for its faculty members and paramedic staff in casualty and critical care departments. They will be sensitized about what constitutes ‘brain death’ and about steps that need to be followed thereafter so that organ retrieval can be performed.” “Counselling team will also be strengthened with more hands and training to convince families of the brain-dead patients to agree for organ donation of the deceased. “We will seek help in this regard from centres which are running such programmes successfully,” he added. Further, he said, a committee will also be set up to coordinate among departments for smooth roll out of the programme. This committee will also ensure that CMOD is done in compliance with National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, he added. Donations can only be done when a patient is declared brain dead after 2 consecutive apnea tests in six hours apart. The apnea test is a mandatory examination for determining brain death as it provides an essential sign of definitive loss of brainstem function. CMOD was started in KGMU by the department of surgical gastroenterology in 2016. Since then, the department led by Prof Abhijit Chandra has conducted around 30 CMODs. About 24 livers were sent to Delhi-based institutions and 58 kidneys to SGPGIMS for transplant. Corneas were used by KGMU’s ophthalmic department. Two Cadaveric liver transplants were also conducted at KGMU itself after surgical gastroenterology started doing liver transplants here. Last cadaveric liver transplant was done in March 2020. Despite lack of financial and administrative support, the programme ran for three years, but had to be suspended due to pandemic. Help from religious leadersKGMU will also seek help from religious leaders to motivate and make people aware of the importance of cadaveric organ donation and transplants. VC Lt Gen Bipin Puri said, “Many a time it has been found that families refuse donation due to religious beliefs.” Times ViewMost of the kidney and liver transplants in UP are taking place through live donations at present. Cadaveric donations can save many lives without risking lives of living donors and check malpractices. KGMU's effort will encourage people to donate organs of their loved ones after their death, thus saving lakhs of lives||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-set-to-revive-its-multi-organ-donation-unit/articleshow/86152446.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Kolkata||Cyber gangs target Kolkata academics, create fake FB profiles for fraud||KOLKATA: After senior state bureaucrats and top police officers, Mewat cyber gangs have targetted city educationists with a similar modus operandi — creating fake Facebook pages in their names and seeking money from those in their friend lists. Police said these gangs are mainly operating from Bharatpur and Alwar. In the past week, prominent educationalists Pabitra Sarkar and Debnarayan Sarkar have lodged complaints against fake Facebook pages that the accused had created in their names and asked for Rs 10,000 as help from their social media friends. In the first case, an unidentified person attempted to cheat people by using a fake Facebook account of Pabitra Sarkar by sending messages to his friends and asking for money. His friends suspected when they found the word “urgent” was misspelt as “argent’ and informed him about the matter. “On September 9, one of my JU students asked me whether I had opened a new FB account. I checked and found the fraud. My friends, who received the message for money, complained about the fake profile. By the time I clicked on the fake account link shared by my students, it was deactivated,” Pabitra said. Debnarayan had received the news of fraud around midnight on September 5. “I got to know that the accused had sought Rs 10,000 from a lawyer, Gopal Chandra Mondal. I was shocked since I was not active on FB. I had opened an account five years ago but it remains dormant. One of friends said that the lawyer had called him to find why I needed such a paltry amount. When I called him up, he said that he was having a doubt from the beginning. I went to the cyber crime cell at Lalbazar with him and lodged a complaint,” said Debnarayan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-gangs-target-city-academics-create-fake-fb-profiles-for-fraud/articleshow/86150417.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||12 cops test positive after returning from training at Pune||Nagpur: Around 12 cops handling the intelligence gathering system at police station level tested Covid-19 positive last week, after returning from a ten-day training schedule in Pune on September 9. The 12 cops and their families were quarantined at MLA Hostel by Nagpur Municipal Corporation and police hospital staff. A woman cop from Sakkardara police station, whose second vaccination dose was pending, was among the ones who tested positive. Out of the 12, around 10 had received both the doses of vaccination. Around 33 cops from different police stations, working as ‘khufiya’ (intelligence collector), had gone to Pune for training from August 30 onwards. The training was scheduled at Maharashtra Intelligence Academy (MIA) where cops are imparted regular on-job training. Apart from Nagpur, cops from other districts and units too were present at the training. City police have conducted Covid tests of 31 cops so far. Testing of their family members is also being done. It's learnt that the Nagpur cops were given the task to collect information from Shanichara Market and adjoining localities as a part of the training. Some of the participants feel their prolonged presence among crowds in Pune could have exposed them to the virus. “On September 6, I felt some uneasiness but could not gauge what it was due to. On September 9, we were released from the training and reached Nagpur the following day. I decided to go for a Covid test,” said one of the affected cops. It's learnt that the constable from Kotwali police station had first shared his uneasiness with chief medical officer Dr Sandip Shinde at the police hospital at headquarters on Friday. He, along with his room partner from Lakadganj police station, got tested and were the first to test positive for Covid. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said she had alerted higher officials regarding the screening of the outstation travellers coming to the city. “I am seeing many Covid patients coming from outside,” she said. Another infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the trend of cases surfacing on and off could be labelled as a “casedemic” as it is a common phenomenon in the backdrop of vaccination drive. “We will have a plethora of cases but 90% of them may not become severe or lead to hospitalization or deaths, thanks to vaccination," Shinde said. City police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar, who along with joint CP Aswati Dorje and DCP (headquarters) Sandeep Pakhale was supervising the patients’ testing and treatment, said the condition of the infected cops and their families was being monitored. “We are providing all possible medical support and assistance,” said Kumar. NMC health officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said contact tracing of the 12 cops will be done by the civic body’s dedicated team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/12-cops-test-positive-after-returning-from-training-at-pune/articleshow/86148555.cms||Soumitra Bose

The city corporation, which has so far attained 76% expenditure in 2021-22, could broaden the scheme to introduce institutional-based farming and integration of various works. Vegetable farming was introduced in five institutions in each ward covering all the assembly constituencies in the city. Mostly school-based farming was initiated in the city as part of the project. The beneficiaries of the scheme also undertook desilting works in Ulloor canal and the silt and mud collected from the canal were refilled in grow bags, which were then distributed to promote farming in urban areas. Of the urban local bodies in the district, Nedumangadu municipality generated 13,134 person-days under AUEGS in 2021-22. “AUEGS provided succour to hundreds of men and women, especially the urban poor in the towns of Kerala. Convergence with other government schemes like PMAY and Subhiksha Keralam has resulted in a lot of asset creation. We are also in the process of associating with works related to drainage reconstruction and flood mitigation in major cities in the coming days. Some other states have also shown interest in learning the structure and functioning of AUEGS,” said urban affairs department director Renu Raj. As part of chief minister’s 100-days programme, the urban affairs department has embarked on a mission to create eight lakh person-days in 100 days. The mission has so far created 8.05 lakh person-days and spent Rs 26.42crore across the state. School-based farming was initiated on vacant premises as part of Subhiksha Keralam. “There has been great response to the scheme from the elderly women, especially from urban slums. We could also employ women from slum areas to participate in Pachathuruthu scheme, which was implemented in Chalai School. We are readying for harvest from the mini farms created in the school compound,” said a project official associated with the city corporation. Urban employment guarantee scheme in the city also helped in reviving paddy farm at Chanthavila. Plans are afoot to integrate farming and animal husbandry under institution-based farming in the district as part of creating more job opportunities for urban poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/urban-local-bodies-create-over-34k-work-days-under-auegs/articleshow/86148591.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Swami Vivekananda was believer in secularism as India’s path: CJI||HYDERABAD: Stating that long before the emergence of an egalitarian Constitution for India, Swami Vivekananda had propagated the need for adopting secularism, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Sunday underlined the great saint’s prophetic words at the World Parliament of Religions on September 12, 1893, which prove that he firmly believed that the true essence of religion was common good and tolerance. “Religion should be above superstitions and rigidities. To fulfil the dream of making a resurgent India through the principles of common good and tolerance, we should instil the ideals of Swami Vivekananda in the minds of today’s youth,” the CJI said at a webinar organised by Vivekananda Institute of Human Excellence at Domalguda on its 22nd Foundation Day and to commemorate the 128th anniversary of the historic Chicago speech. Emphasising the importance of a vibrant youth, Justice Ramana recalled the valiant struggles led by two Telugu warriors Birsa Munda from Telangana and Alluri Sitarama Raju from AP during the freedom movement. “History is witness to the power wielded by the youth. The story of India’s freedom struggle would be incomplete without youth leaders such as Birsa Munda, who mobilised the tribals against the formidable British for land rights, or the trio of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, who valiantly fought till their last breath. The inspiring tales of ‘Manyam Veerudu’ Alluri Sitarama Raju, the revolutionary leader shot during the resistance movement, still continue to inspire generations,” the CJI said. Pointing out that about 65% of our population was between the age group of 15 to 35, the CJI reminded how Swami Vivekananda believed that the young in India were the chain that bound our past to a greater future. “Educational institutions have a huge role to play. They must create awareness in students about rights and restrictions, promote a culture of lawfulness and equip young minds with knowledge to empower them to be effective change-makers in society,” the CJI said. Ramakrishna Mutt and Vivekananda Mission elders Swamy Bodhamayananda and Swamy Jnanadananda from Hyderabad and Swamy Gautamanandaji Maharaj from West Bengal along with several others participated in the function.

---||Pune||Pune: Display expiry date for loose sweets or face fine up to Rs 2 lakh, says FDA||PUNE: Intensifying surveillance amid the festive season, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have told sweet shop owners to display a ‘best before date’ for loose sweets kept in trays/containers. Pune FDA joint commissioner (food) Shivaji Desai said sweet shop owners and others in the food business can decide on the ‘best before date’ depending on the nature of the product and local conditions. “An indicative list of the shelf life of various types of sweets is given in the guidance note on the safety and quality of traditional milk products. The list is available on the FSSAI website,” said Desai. Not abiding by the norm may attract a fine up to Rs1 lakh for sweet shops with an annual turnover of less than Rs 12 lakh, and a fine of up to Rs2 lakh for those with an annual turnover of Rs12 lakh and above, said officials. Apex food regulatory body, the Food Safety and Standards Association of India (FSSAI), in a notification in February 2020, said the norm will be effective across the country from June 1, 2020. “We ensure compliance throughout the year. However, we intensify surveillance during the festive season when sweets are sold and consumed in large quantities and there are higher chances of norms being flouted,” said Desai said. The owner of a sweet shop in Wanoworie said every sweet made of or containing milk solids should be consumed in 24 hours. “That is a basic rule consumers need to follow,” he said. Paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, also former state president of the Indian Medical Association, said eating sweets long after they have been made can cause food poisoning or vomiting and nausea. Health activists, too, said an expiry date will help consumers stay safe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/display-expiry-date-for-loose-sweets-or-face-fine-up-to-rs-2-lakh-says-fda/articleshow/86150451.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This has automatically hit patients awaiting corneal transplant and currently there is a huge pendency said local experts. According to the figures from the Eye Bank Association of India (EBAI), as compared to 9185 eye donations during 2019-20, Telangana saw 4122 donations in 2020-21. Across India, between April 2019 and March 2020, the country saw 50,953 eye donations. But during April 2020 and March 2021, only 18,359 corneas were collected. While an estimated 25,000-30,000 new cases of corneal blindness occur in India, the number of corneal transplants reduced to 12,998 between April 2020 and March 2021 from 27,075 corneal transplants in the previous year according to the EBAI. One of the reasons for the decline has been patients who had pledged donating their eyes but contracted Covid-19 and succumbed to it. “A lot of the patients had succumbed to Covid-19. As a result, we could not use the cornea for transplantation although it can be used for our laboratory research. The pendency is at an all-time high in recent years,” said Dr M Ramalingam, superintendent of the city-based SD Eye Hospital. Corneal transplantation is the only known cure for corneal blindness, which is made possible by the donation of healthy corneas by individuals upon their death, experts say. The state-run Sarojini Devi eye hospital has a current pendency of 500 patients awaiting cornea transplant, over 2 times of the general pendency previously. In most cases, corneal blindness is curable with corneal transplantation but the low availability of donors is a major hindrance say experts. Corneal disease is a major cause of blindness in India and an estimated 2 million Indians are affected by corneal blindness of which over 1.2 million are below the age of 12. This could be due to corneal disease, injury or infection. “The current cornea collection in India is able to cater to only one-fourth of the patients in need of corneal transplant surgeries. There has been a decline in cornea collection. The nationwide estimate suggests a decline of close to 60 percent due to the pandemic,” says Dr Sunita Chaurasia, medical director, The Ramayamma International Eye Bank, LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) adding that it is important that the person pledging eye donation needs to share their pledge, and will to donate their eyes, with their family members, and request them to execute the same after their death. “Eye donation can happen only after the death of a person and consent from their family members. By donating eyes, we can gift sight to someone not able to see, and keep the memory of the deceased person alive,” she added. Eyes donated by a person can help restore vision in two corneal blind people. "Lack of awareness and myths associated with eye donation prevents people from donating their eyes. Any person can donate their eyes irrespective of sex, age, religion or blood group. Therefore,on the occasion of the National Eye Donation Fortnight, we urge people to come forward and pledge their eyes. Eye donation usually takes place only after the person is deceased, and with the consent of the family, so it is important that not only the person pledging the eyes is aware of its importance but the entire family is educated about the needs to do the same too," said Nikkhil K Masurkar, Executive Director, ENTOD Pharmaceuticals. ENTOD is supporting EBAI in the ongoing eye donation pledge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-hit-eye-donations-in-telangana-rest-of-india/articleshow/86153640.cms||Amrita Didyala

A senior official with the Kalamassery police said that a custody application was filed, and is under the court’s consideration. Kalamassery police had arrested 19 persons hailing from Rajouri last Tuesday in connection with the case. As per preliminary investigations, the guns were found to be original guns procured from an armoury in Rajouri, police said. “Though these were procured from an armoury, it never received a license. As per initial reports, the armoury in question was shut a couple of years ago. We have confirmed that the documents of the guns were fabricated and that there were no valid licences,” said an officer. Earlier, Karamana police and Kannur police had made similar seizures and arrests from branches of the agency. “A Karamana police team has gone to Rajouri for investigation, and we have collected information from them.

DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh said the accused, Farman (22), had a readymade clothes shop. “He committed the murder as he had been nurturing a grudge against his aunt and wanted to seek revenge,” he added. During interrogation, Farman said his aunt, Mumtaz Parveen, had tried to implicate him in a double murder case reported in Bara Hindu Rao two months ago because of an ongoing property dispute between them. When he came to know that she had tried to frame him, he decided to kill her. Parveen was earlier convicted for circulating fake currency for her husband, an alleged ISI agent from Pakistan. She had married Kamran Gauhar, a Pakistan national, in 1998. Special Cell had arrested Gauhar for supplying explosives to another person and circulating fake currency at the behest of ISI in 2000. She was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in 2004 for being an accomplice. Gauhar was convicted on charges of terrorism and espionage and deported to Pakistan. Parveen had got Pakistan citizenship on the basis of her marriage with Gauhar, but she had recently applied for Indian citizenship. Her murder was discovered around 7.30pm on September 3 when police reached Parveen’s house on a neighbour’s complaint about foul smell emanating from her house. She was found lying in a pool of blood in her bedroom. Her body had deep cut marks at the back of the neck. An FIR was registered and a team led by inspector Lalit Kumar was formed to catch the killer. Footage from CCTV cameras in the locality was analysed. “It was noticed that around 8pm on August 30, an unidentified man got off an autorickshaw and entered the lane. After half an hour, he was seen coming back and boarding another auto. His face was covered,” the DCP said. After questioning relatives and neighbours and other suspects and mounting technical surveillance, Farman was identified. He was arrested from Meerut on September 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/revenge-murder-man-heldfor-killing-aunt-in-old-delhi/articleshow/86150529.cms||---

Acting on the complaint of Sunil Satdive (57), assistant engineer of MSEDCL, police have registered an offence against Dungarsing Rajpurohit and his brother Rajusing Rajpurohit. Police said the MSEDCL staffer had gone to the shop of the accused in connection with recovery of electricity dues worth Rs 1.02 lakh. “The accused on August 17 had issued a cheque of Rs 50,000 towards partial payment of dues. The cheque, however, was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the bank account. Despite repeated follow-ups by Satdive, the accused did not pay the outstanding amount,” a police officer said. On Saturday, the Satdive again went to the shop after the shop owner had promised to issue another cheque towards the payment of dues. “During the meeting, the accused asked the complainant to produce the cheque issued earlier for certain audit-related work. When the MSEDCL employee asked why a cheque was given even if no balance was available in the bank account, the shop owner and his brother abused and threatened Satdive of cutting his hands and legs,” the officer added. Police have invoked Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-brothers-booked-for-intimidatingmsedcl-employee-in-aurangabad/articleshow/86146571.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Circulars on conduct issued to cops time & again||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At least a dozen circulars and advisories have been issued from the police headquarters to field offices instructing that the police should behave in a civilised and dignified manner while dealing with public. Interestingly, the latest circular issued by state police chief Anil Kant recalls at least eight such circulars issued since 1965, directing officials to behave politely and treat public with dignity. Such circulars have been issued in 1965, 1983, 1995 (twice), 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2018. Many more were issued on the finer aspects of the same matter, the last one being an advisory from former state police chief Loknath Behera on September 14, 2019. Behera had issued a set of guidelines on improving the professionalism of the force on the basis of a meeting convened by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on July 16, 2019. “Police officials should not use foul language and instead, their behavior should be with compassion towards the people approaching them,” the guidelines had stated. On January 12, Vijayan had informed the assembly that the government has been able to ensure decent behavior from the part of the police towards the public. He had also said that the government has asked all district police chiefs to strictly comply with orders from courts, rights commission and the government. Contrary to the CM’s claims, such assurances mostly remain on paper, which is testified in the latest circular issued by the state police chief on Friday. “It has been noticed that despite several instructions, incidents of police officials misbehaving with the public in police stations and public places are increasingly being reported. Some police officials are still behaving in such a way that defames the dignity of the police force and invites court’s scathing criticism. Such issues are being seen seriously,” it said. “Even several senior officials are behaving in an undignified manner with their subordinates, which is mostly arising out of their sense of insecurity. Numerous circulars have been issued from time to time and issuing those alone would not suffice. The only way to curb such behaviour is by taking action against such officials and the public and other police officials should come to know about it,” former DGP Vinson M Paul said. The human rights commission had through an order on April 12, 2018, asked the government to initiate action against police officials involved in crime as stipulated under Section 86 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The government had taken action against eight officers on the basis of the instructions of the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/circulars-on-conduct-issued-to-cops-time-again/articleshow/86150490.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Lucknow||UP: Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi writes to CM Yogi Adityanath, seeks Rs 400 SAP for sugarcane farmers||LUCKNOW: A few days after tweeting support to protesting farmers, BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi has demanded that sugarcane’s State Advisory Price (SAP) for the forthcoming crushing season in UP should be raised to Rs 400 per quintal. The state government has kept the SAP unchanged for the past three years after effecting a hike from Rs 305 to Rs 315 per quintal in 2017. In a letter (dated September 11) sent to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Gandhi has also demanded that the pending cane arrears for 2020-21 -- around Rs 5,300 crore -- be paid to the farmers as soon as possible. Varun's observation vis-a-vis cane growers comes amid CM Yogi's hardened stance, suggesting strict action against the millers defaulting on payment of cane dues to the farmers. Yogi had recently said that the SAP for the forthcoming cane crushing season would be increased. While officials in the cane department refused to comment, sources indicated that a hike of between Rs 5 to Rs 10 was expected. Officials, however, said that the state government sought to tread cautiously given the contraction in the paying capacity of the millers despite recovery in the economic activity which got hit by pandemic. Varun said in the letter that his suggestion was driven by farmers' claim that the cost of cane cultivation has risen sharply. “The SAP for the cane may be kept at a minimum of Rs 400 per quintal," he said, underscoring that the incumbent state government's efforts to pay much more cane dues to farmers in comparison to the previous governments was laudable. The Pilibhit MP further said that he had come to know that many sharecroppers were unable to supply cane to the millers and were rather forced to sell the crop to 'kolhu' (local crushing units) at a very low price. He added that the farmers should also be provided seeds, fertilizer and pesticides at low cost. Varun's letter comes days after he stood in support of the farmers who had called a 'mahapanchayat' in Muzaffarnagar against the new farm laws. He said that the wheat farmers of his parliamentary constituency are demanding that their crop be purchased by the government at the stipulated minimum support price (MSP). He said though the present state government raised the purchase of wheat, there were still "many farmers" who were not able to sell their produce at the procurement centre. Varun has demanded the state government to set up procurement centres in adequate numbers for facilitating the farmers seeking to sell their produce to the government. On September 8, the Centre had hike the MSP for wheat by Rs 40 from Rs 1975 to Rs 2015 per quintal. The Union ministry of consumer affairs, food & public distribution had recently said that the government paid Rs 11,141.28 crore to the farmers as MSP in Uttar Pradesh as the state recorded the highest ever procurement of wheat. It said 58% more wheat was procured in 2021-22 as compared to 2020-21. A record 56.41 lakh MT procurement of wheat has been done during Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2021-22 in Uttar Pradesh as compared to 35.77 LMT wheat procured in RMS 2020-21. Varun, however, maintained that the state government should consider giving a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to the wheat farmers. He also demanded that the electricity rates for farmers be reduced. "Farmers are complaining of higher electricity rates in case of tube wells and rural power feeders as a result they are not able to make timely payment," he said in the letter. Varun also said that incidents of damage to crops by stray animals have increased. "It is requested to step up construction of cow shelter homes and take other measures," he said. The BJP MP further suggested that the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi be increased from Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000 per annum. "For this, the state government can contribute a share of Rs 6,000 per farmer," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/varun-writes-to-yogi-seeksrs-400-sap-for-cane-farmers/articleshow/86152521.cms||Pankaj Shah

Tomar, a BJP veteran who was given a ministerial-rank post in 1997 when Kalyan Singh was in power in the state, was cremated in his ancestral village on Sunday. His body with struggle marks on neck was found inside the house by his driver in Baghpat. According to police, Tomar was living alone. His elder son works in Meerut while the younger one is in the US with his mother. The postmortem report revealed that he was "choked to death". Initially clueless, the police got a tip-off about the accused from CCTV footage. It showed two men arriving at the gate of his house a night prior to the murder. About 45 minutes later, one of them hopped into the SUV of the BJP leader and drove away, while his accomplice fled on the bike. Atmaram’s mobile phone was also missing. Police had registered an FIR of murder and theft against the accused, Praveen Kumar and Balram Singh, after scanning the CCTV. Baghpat superintendent of police (SP), Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, released a video on Sunday in which he spoke about the Rs 25,000 reward. “We have arrested Manmohan, a resident of Sankalputhi police station in Chandinagar district of Baghpat and, Subhash, a resident of Sonta police station in Babri district of Shamli for helping the main accused to flee," the Baghpat SP said. In his police complaint, Atmaram’s elder son, Pratap, a radiologist, said, “Praveen - the main accused - used to work at a gas agency owned by my father. He was recently removed due to financial irregularities. However, my father called him back at the family's request. But, he was still angry. Praveen and his accomplice Balram killed my father.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-police-announces-reward-of-rs-25000-for-information-on-murder-of-former-bjp-minister/articleshow/86148651.cms||Ishita Mishra

However, the official data does not reflect so many patients. All patients with symptoms of headache, joint pains and high grade fever are being rushed to casualty and emergency wards of public and private hospitals. Most of them test positive in the NS1 antigens test, result of which is delivered within an hour. These patients are treated as dengue positive, and even insurance providers accept the NS antigen tests for approving claims. The data of health department, however, shows poor positivity rate. Against over 10,000 serum samples of NS1 and IgM, only 2,200 have tested positive through ELISA in Nagpur division comprising six districts. TOI spoke to experts about the large difference in data and actual scenario. Dr Shailesh Mundhada, a pathology and immunology expert, said the false positivity of NS1 antigen tests can’t be so high. “NS1 is less sensitive as compared to ELISA. If a sample is testing positive in NS1 then it should be the same in ELISA. Delay in confirmatory tests and storage also affect quality of the samples,” he said. Dr Mundhada also said that unlike Covid, there is no online reporting system for dengue. “Many cases may not be getting reported as well,” he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Confirmation by ELISA is completely unnecessary and detrimental to public health approach. It’s like denying the existence of a problem. NS1 by card test has good sensitivity and specificity. In fact, we are missing a lot of patients who are negative on test but actually dengue. They have all clinical and radiological symptoms of dengue. They come negative due to low level viremia. So, total number of cases is actually more than only NS1 positive cases.” Assistant director health services (malaria) Dr Shyam Nimgade admitted that there is delay in confirmatory tests due to unavailability of kits at times. “But we ensure results come in a week. The quality of sample is unlikely to be affected as we don’t collect whole blood,” he said. Dr Nimgade said every fever is not dengue and ELISA remains the first choice. “NS1 antigen is a screening test. I agree there are lots of dengue patients. Vector-borne disease have a cyclical trend and they increase after every 3 or 4 yrs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-running-full-yet-officials-record-few-dengue-cases/articleshow/86148639.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Hospitals across the city are flooded with fever patients even as the district administration has been focusing on fever survey to detect Covid-19 and dengue cases early. With rains continuing for the last twenty days, mosquito menace has worsened in the city. Vacant plots are filled with water. They have turned breeding grounds for the mosquitoes and the public are at the receiving end. Fever cases are being reported in urban slum areas and flood affected areas in the city. “Of the four members of my family, two tested positive for malaria. Mosquito menace is on the rise in our area. Many people in my locality are sick. Officials should take necessary action,” said K Madhava Rao, a resident of Prabha colony at Ajith Singh Nagar. Fearing contracting Covid-19, people prefer private hospitals to treat fever cases. Serpentine queues are noticed at private clinics across the city. “Patients with viral fever and dengue symptoms are coming in large numbers to our clinic. They are complaining of joint pain indicating chikungunya. One should be very cautious about mosquitoes,” said Dr. Raghunandan, a physician practising at Madhuranagar. Meanwhile, various special drives conducted by the civic body are failing to produce results. Municipal commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh has directed the malaria wing authorities to focus on anti-larval activities including fogging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vijayawada-sees-surge-in-viral-fever-cases/articleshow/86148587.cms||Venu Lanka

His family found the suicide note about two-and-a-half months after his death, from his daughter’s notebook. Vimla Dodia, 43, a resident of Shivam Flats in Vasna, has filed an FIR with the local police. She said her brother Kamlesh Vala had married Rekha Vala, a resident of Nadiad, about 15 years ago. For about two years, Kamlesh and Rekha did not have cordial relations as she used to fight with him over petty issues, said Dodia in her FIR. She said that Kamlesh told her about five months ago that Rekha was having an affair with a man from Sarkhej with whom she constantly talked on the phone. Whenever Kamlesh objected to her extramarital relationship, she used to fight with Kamlesh and accused him of harassing her. Dodia said in the FIR that Rekha had left Kamlesh and their 10-year-old daughter on June 24. Disturbed, Kamlesh stayed at Dodia’s place for some time. On June 26, he left his daughter at his elder sister’s house. When this sister visited him on June 27, his house was locked from the inside. She along with others broke the door, entered the house, and found him hanging from a ceiling fan. About a week ago, the victim’s family found the suicide note in his daughter’s notebook in which he said his wife and her boyfriend were harassing him, forcing him to commit suicide. Vasna police have registered a complaint of abetment to suicide against Rekha and have begun an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aggrieved-with-wifes-affair-man-commits-suicide/articleshow/86150528.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Co-working makes big splash in small cities||HYDERABAD: With a large population of India’s migrant metropolitan workforce returning to their home states during the pandemic, smaller cities are hit by a new realty wave: Co-working space. The current hotspots: Coimbatore, Indore, Nagpur, Vadodara, Surat, Thiruvananthapuram among others. Collectively, these destinations have at least 5 to 6 lakh square feet (sft) of co-working space in the offing, with several companies creating small offices here, for the convenience of their staff. As per rough estimates, about 30% to 40% of professionals working in metros – primarily Hyderabad and Bengaluru – have moved back to their homes in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Multinational corporation employees TOI spoke to from Hyderabad said that they have been allowed to work remotely till mid-2022 for now, with indications of a further extension. “Reverse migration is a major reason why co-working is picking up in smaller cities and towns. Since the infrastructure in many of these places is still in the development stage, work-from-home often becomes a challenge. So, companies are using these shared areas to create an office-like environment for employees based there,” said Amit Ramani, founder and CEO of Awfis that forayed into Ahmedabad, Indore and Bhubaneswar this year. By the end of 2021, the co-working space provider hopes to open in Jaipur, Lucknow, Nagpur and Kochi too. Another leading operator, Tablesapce, too has taken 60,000 sft in Trivandrum – its first project in the Kerala capital. “We’ve also done a 13 city deal with a company in places such as Ahmedabad, Nagpur etc,” said its founder, Karan Chopra. But while he admits to tier 2 and 3 cities gaining traction, Chopra feels that it could be a short-term trend with many companies eventually calling back its workforce to the cities. In a recent meeting of Ciril – a pan-India real estate brokerage company – in Hyderabad, members reiterated how the co-working industry is “witnessing a paradigm shift, heralding a new phase of office space expansions in major tier 2 cities”. “This trend is slowly and steadily building momentum and is here to stay,” said its national director, Aju Thomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/co-working-makes-big-splash-in-small-cities/articleshow/86153656.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The case has been lodged under sections 498 (a), 417, 323, 506, 504, and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. B R Patil, the inspector of the Karad city police station, speaking to TOI said, “No one has been taken into custody so far. We have, however, initiated an inquiry with respect to the complaint filed by the daughter-in-law.” In a statement issued on Sunday evening, MLA Patil refuted the allegations. He claimed that his daughter-in-law had not been staying with them for the past one-and-a-half-years and, therefore, the issue of harassment does not arise. “We tried — through family relations and then via legal counsel — to get her to come back home. She has not been staying with us for a long time now. The issue of harassing her, therefore, does not arise. Throughout my public life, I did not take favour of even a cup of tea from those I had helped in some way or other. The allegation of me seeking money is disheartening. We have full faith in the judiciary,” Patil said in the statement. According to the police, the complainant had married Rajesh Patil four years ago in Kolhapur. Over the past few months, relatives had been trying to patch things up between the families. The daughter-in-law is currently staying with her parents in Karad city. Patil’s family is prominent in the Kolhapur district. He was the president of the district unit of Congress for two decades.

---||Nagpur||‘Dengue is disease of young but elderly too need care’||Although mosquitoes are tiny little creatures, they can create a huge problem for humans as well as animals, as severe diseases are caused by them like dengue and malaria amongst others, resulting in extensive morbidity and mortality. Recently an outbreak of dengue is being witnessed in the town. Dengue is a seasonal, viral infection presenting with headaches, muscle & joint pains, tiredness, rash that last for 4-7 days and need to be treated symptomatically with paracetamol and plenty of oral fluids. Ibuprofen and Aspirin containing drugs are not to be given. There are 4 distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Infection with any of the four serotypes for the first time is believed to elicit lifelong immunity against that serotype, but confers partial or transient immunity against other serotypes. Second infection by other serotypes result in higher viral burden and contribute to increased disease severity. Usually it is a disease of young, but the disease in elderly needs special care. Secondary infections have been associated with large, clinical outbreaks of dengue haemorhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Warning signs of severe dengue are persistent vomiting, severe abdominal pain, bleeding from any site, rapid breathing, restlessness, confusion and irritability. These patients may land in multi organ failure, and hence should immediately seek medical attention. They may need hospitalisation for effective fluid management, and organ support in intensive care units. Platelets need to be watched after 4 days and transfusion is indicated only if the patient starts bleeding. Dengue is diagnosed by serological tests. The NS1 Antigen being positive in the initial days followed by IgM antibodies 1 week after infection, that are highest at 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of illness. They remain detectable for about 3 months. The presence of IgM antibody is indicative of a recent dengue viral infection. IgG antibody levels take longer to develop than IgM, but IgG remain in the body for years. The presence of IgG is indicative of a past infection. Platelets need to monitored after 4 days of fever along with the liver and kidney functions. Dengue viruses (DENV) are spread to humans through the bite of an infected female Aedes species (Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus) mosquito. The mosquito is 4-7mm in size, dark in colour and has white markings on legs and lyre markings on thorax. The Aedes Aegypti mosquito cannot stay alive during the winter season and thus only lays eggs in the summers or monsoons. They usually lay their eggs near households due to the proximity to potted plants and still water.The dengue mosquito mostly bites its victims during the day. The mosquito is most active during the daytime, approximately two hours after sunrise and several hours before sunset. These mosquitoes usually rest in cool and shaded areas, like closets and under the beds. Though they usually bite during the day, there are chances that they may bite humans during the night as well. They usually target areas such as ankles and elbows. Mosquitoes become infected from people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (they are pre-symptomatic), but also people who show no signs of illness as well (they are asymptomatic). Human-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, or up to 2 days after the fever has resolved.

---||Kochi||This panchayat vaccinates 97% of target population||Thiruvananthapuram: While vaccine shortage and other factors are hindering inoculation exercise in local bodies, Perumkadavila panchayat has managed to administer 97% of target population with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The panchayat had started vaccinating people in February. It had a target population of 19,128 of which 18,654 people have been vaccinated at least partially. Authorities set up a ward-based camp at the onset which paved the way for their success. Except for the people who were Covid infected, who have medication allergies, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, remaining persons in target groups have been administered with Covid vaccine. The panchayat gave vaccine to 50 people daily from each ward. This way, they could give around 500 vaccines daily. Authorities are following the same strategy in giving the second dose as well. “The success behind the drive is our teamwork. We made a detailed plan for carrying out the vaccination process. We had taken a survey of people, their age and their medical conditions. We could set up 32 “anganvadis” in our panchayat as vaccination booking centres, where people can book the vaccine online. Anganvadi teachers, ASHA workers and health and sanitation volunteers were roped in for online booking. We did spot registration and administered the vaccines to individuals who did not receive a slot,” said panchayat president S Surendran. Vaccines were given at homes to those who were physically unable to come to the vaccination camp. “Whenever there was a shortage of vaccine, we communicated it to people and thereby we could avoid unnecessary crowding. We provided specific timeslots for each individual which helped in social distancing,” said Surendran. “We had conducted a survey on how many people received their 1st and 2nd doze. So, it became easy for us to plan accordingly,” said health supervisor of Perumkadavila panchayat Radhakrishnan Nair. “We are having a review session every Wednesday at the panchayat office. The review session helped us to know the percentage of people who got vaccinated and how many persons are yet to take the vaccine,” said medical officer of the panchayat Dr R Sunitha Kumari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/this-panchayat-vaccinates-97-of-target-population/articleshow/86148661.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||UP BJP plans to make 100 new members in each of 1.63 cr booths||Lucknow: In an ambitious political move ahead of the high-stake UP assembly elections, the BJP has set the target of making 100 new members in each of the 1.63 lakh polling booths in the state. This translates into 1.63 crore new party supporters, which is more than 47% of the total around 3.44 crore votes -- a vote share of 39.67% -- polled in favour of the BJP in 2017 assembly elections, when the saffron political outfit bagged 312 of the 384 seats it contested. The elaborate plan entails booth-level functionaries making spirited efforts in reaching out to first-time voters who will be attaining an age of 18 years by January 1, 2022. Besides this, the party will seek to cut into the vote bank of the opposition, especially the SP and BSP, which have been positioning aggressively against the ruling dispensation. BJP's zealous target is, in fact, comparatively just less than the total votes polled in favour of the SP (1.89 crore) and the BSP (1.92 crore) in the previous assembly elections. Experts also interpret this as the BJP's attempt to compensate for the loss of votes which the party may suffer in the wake of a potential anti-incumbency factor. Sources said that the saffron outfit will be intimately helped by the Sangh Parivar, essentially the RSS and the VHP. Coming close on the heels of `Booth Vijay Abhiyan' (booth victory campaign) kicked off by BJP national president JP Nadda on Saturday, the strategy hinges on the invocation of popularity of PM Narendra Modi and "damdaar" governance of CM Yogi Adityanath. "Making new members is the ongoing process of the party. We will further step up our efforts to reach out to the maximum possible people in the state. We have given the target of making 100 new members every booth," UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh told TOI. BJP strategists believe that an apparent erosion in the vote base of the regional political players including the SP and BSP makes enough room for the party to flex its political muscles and move closer to people, especially the youth. As per the plan, the party's foot soldiers will strategically befriend new people before making them aware about BJP ideology vis-a-vis opposition. "Our party leaders even meet children who otherwise have no political ambitions. This makes his/her family feel gratified and brings it closer to the party," said a senior BJP leader. The seven frontal organisations of the BJP have already been pumped up by the party brass to expedite the electoral spade work. The Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP, is expected to play a crucial role in intensifying the party's outreach among the youth and the first-time voters. Likewise, the Kisan Morcha has been asked to counter opposition narratives stoking discontent among the farmers about the three farm laws. The party, at the same time, is unlikely to shy away from playing the caste card as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-plans-to-make-100-new-members-in-each-of-1-63-cr-booths/articleshow/86152553.cms||Pankaj Shah

There was a strong buzz over appointment of two senior ministers as the deputy chief ministers. Sources said that appointing senior tribal MLAs and OBC MLAs as deputies is being considered along with several new faces as the ministers. CM-designate Bhupendra Patel participating in a Jain religious event recentlyTwo new women MLAs are expected in Bhupendr Patel’s cabinet. He is expected to set right caste and regional combinations while forming his new cabinet. When asked, state BJP president C R Paatil refused to divulge any details saying the decision on the new cabinet will be taken by the top party brass. His wife (on phone) with family members and friends on SundayMeanwhile, Nitin Patel has asserted that as long as he is in the hearts of people, nobody can remove him. He said this hours after the BJP chose Bhupendra Patel as the chief minister. “There was talk in the media that deputy CM Nitin Patel left (the legislative party meeting). I am in your hearts,” Patel said. “As long as I am in the hearts of the people and party workers, nobody can remove me.” said Patel while addressing a boisterous crowd in his hometown Mehsana. While the BJP has chosen Ghatlodia MLA Bhupendra Patel as the next CM, suspense remains over the political future of Nitin Patel and other senior ministers in the state government. Both CM designate Bhupendra Patel and state BJP president C R Paatil avoided answering questions on the cabinet. Outgoing CM Vijay Rupani could be given a key role in the party organization at the national level. Replying to questions about his political future, late on Sunday evening, Nitin Patel said in Mehsana: “I do not know what decisions will be taken by Bhupendra Patel about his cabinet. I cannot say anything at present.” He added: “The CM decides this in consultation with the national leadership. I have nothing to say on the matter.” However, sources in the ruling party said that four to five senior ministers in the current government, including Nitin Patel, are likely to be dropped from the new cabinet. Nitin Patel went on to say: “I am happy that my friend and neighbour Bhupendra Patel has been chosen as the CM.” ‘I got threatening calls’Speaking to reporters after his rally in Mehsana, Nitin Patel said that he has received threatening phone calls and messages. “I have been receiving messages and phone calls from known and unknown persons who ask me why I am making such statements,” he said. “They allege that I am attempting to segregate one community or people of one religion from the others. I have received threats as some persons or organizations also have.” He did not offer any elaboration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/im-in-your-hearts-cant-be-removed-nitin/articleshow/86152610.cms||---

Residents claim that one of the major factors for the prevailing situation is the lack of proper mechanism for the collection and lifting of household garbage and trash. “For a single corporator’s division, there are about 40,000 households but we see only three or four Swachh Auto Tippers which are capable of covering only about 400 households each and shift the same to the transfer stations. The door-to-door collection of garbage also takes place only once or twice in a week, despite people paying Rs 200 to the GHMC staff every month,” said Mohammad Ahmed, a local resident and social activist. Many also allege that the GHMC’s attempt towards a bin-free city has ended up in disaster with garbage piling up in all those areas where bins existed earlier. Earlier this year, the civic body took the blue bins off the streets in an attempt towards improving the aesthetics of the city. “The move to remove garbage bins was implemented without any foresight. Where did they think will the garbage go when there are no bins? More and more people are falling prey to viral fevers, dengue and even typhoid in areas across Old City,” rued Rubina Begum, a resident of Himmatpura. As a result, one sees that street corners in areas such as Himmatpura new road, Asha Talkies in Shalibanda, near Shah Ghouse restaurant in Shalibanda, near Badam ki masjid in Gowlipura, Alijah Kotla, Ghansi Miyan Masjid at Khilwat, Purani Haveli, Moosabowli main road and the water tank area near Moghalpura have been turned into garbage dumping grounds. “A rotting smell pervades the neighbourhood. We can’t help but bear with it,” complains Mohammad Mateen, a resident of Shalibanda. Agreeing that there was shortage of Swachh Auto Tippers in some localities, GHMC deputy engineer and sanitation in-charge for Charminar area A Srinivas said, “There is a shortage of around 50 autos. There are no autos for some localities. They have been sanctioned recently and they will be procured in two or three months. Once they are procured the garbage problem will be reduced.” “Also, the bin-less concept is new to GHMC so it is taking some time for people to get used to it. To change their way of thinking, we are now conducting awareness programmes in areas where this problem persists,” Srinivas added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/garbage-heap-overflowing-drains-posing-risk-to-residents/articleshow/86152580.cms||---

The dam is at 98% of its total capacity due to heavy rainfall in its catchment areas. The total capacity of the dam is 105.25 TMC and it was 103.95 TMC full when the water was discharged. Th gates of the dam were lifted in July and were opened with different levels of discharge until mid-August. The gates have been opened for the second time in the current season. The total rainfall in the catchment areas of the dam was 25 mm in Mahabaleshwar, 37 mm in Navaja and 17 mm at Koyna by 5pm and the rainfall is expected to double at night. Residents along Koyna river, a tributary of Krishna river, have been alerted about the increase in water level as the gates may open further and increase in discharge is likely if rainfall continues at night. The discharge from other dams in the region has also been initiated. Warna dam in Sangli’s Shirala tehsil attained 99.85% capacity by Sunday evening and the discharge was 3,800 cusecs. Despite discharge from upstream dams, the water level in Krishna river was close to 9 feet the entire day due to increased discharge from downstream Almatti dam. Sangli collector Abhijeet Chaudhary appealed that residents living along the river from Shirala, Walva, Palus and Sangli city should stay away from river banks. The Panchganga river swelled to 25.8 feet, within a few hours on Sunday. The discharge from two gates of Radhanagari dam and rainfall in free catchment areas led to the swell. The river is much below the danger mark of 43 feet as yet. On Sunday evening, 17 barrages were under water. The ghat section witnessed decline in rainfall for a few hours in the evening and the gates of Radhanagari dam were closed again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/discharge-of-25000-cusec-initiated-from-koyna-dam/articleshow/86146633.cms||---

The percentage of full immunisation is 67% in senior citizens 60 years and above while it is pegged at 64% in those in the 45 to 60 years, the report has stated. However, the percentage of beneficiaries who have received both the doses of Covid vaccine is only 16% in the 18-44 years age bracket. Earlier, inclusion of senior citizens followed by middle-aged groups in the vaccination drive after prioritizing vaccination of healthcare and front line workers has pushed the vaccination numbers in these age brackets. However, with the high level of mobility in 18-44 years, it is essential to speed up their full vaccination with the rest of the population, experts said. “We have achieved the desired pace and speed in vaccination and we need to maintain that. Going by this speed, we will fully vaccinate both the senior citizens and middle-aged population within the next two months,” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune circle. said. The PMR's total population is 1.17 crore. Of this, 85.39 lakh residents are above 18 years who are eligible to get the Covid vaccine. Among this, 74% population have received the first dose of the Covid vaccine as of September 12. However, the completion of vaccination with both doses is achieved in 34% of the region's eligible population, he said. On the low numbers in young adults, Deshmukh said, “The vaccination of 18-44 years began from June 1 and there is an 84 days interval between the two doses. Hence, the percentage of full immunization is comparatively low.” “There is still sizeable amount of vaccine hesitancy among young adults especially in rural areas of Pune and in city areas and the slum pockets,” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, said. Besides, those (in the 18-44 years) who are due and can afford paid shots must get their second doses as soon as possible as a sizeable number of vaccine doses are currently lying unused with the private hospitals as the demand for paid jabs had plummeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/full-vaccination-touches-64-in-45-to-60-age-group-in-region/articleshow/86150530.cms||Umesh Isalkar

When contacted, Rathore confirmed that he called upon Akhilesh on September 8 and described the meeting as a “formal courtesy call”. The SP has, however, lapped up the opportunity to claim that the meeting was just a precursor to a series of similar events set to unfold in the near future. A few months ago an audio clip of Rathore’s telephonic conversation had gone viral on the social media where he was heard attacking the state government. He was issued a show cause notice for it. “He (Rathore) is not the only one from the BJP who is in touch with the SP leadership. There are scores of others in the queue,” said SP national secretary Rajendra Chaudhary. “Who knows the BJP’s prospects in 2022 elections better than the sitting BJP MLAs themselves,” Chaudhary said adding: “It is now for these MLAs to explain why are they planning to abandon the BJP if the party is set to win 300 plus seats in the 2022 polls as claimed by the party leadership. Sources in the SP said more BJP leaders are slated to call on Akhilesh. They listed the names of MLAs from Lakhimpur, Hardoi and three other leaders from Sitapur who may call on Akhilesh soon. The sources said though most of the BJP MLAs reaching out to the SP may seek ticket for the 2022 assembly polls, not many will be able to make it through. “The SP leadership is in no mood to dump cadres who have been with the party for years,” said a senior SP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sitting-bjp-mlas-snap-withakhilesh-triggers-rumours/articleshow/86152602.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Kochi||An eventful journey with a twist at the end||Thiruvananthapuram: After walking an average of six km daily for 10 days, resting in cars at night and leading a giant cargo to its destination, an unpleasant confrontation with a crowd over nokkukooli would be the last thing a logistic consultant would have wanted. That is exactly what was in store for Rajeswari S Pillai, the consultant of Express Global Logistics Private Ltd, who transported the massive cargo to VSSC. It was an eventful journey marked by a rather unexpected culmination for her. The journey from Kollam to Thumba VSSE was not easy. In the journey spanning 70km, often Pillai, along with her crew had to walk kilometres as the trailer moved slowly. It demanded immense physical strain and planning. They had to take care of many things, including dealing with the cable lines all the way. Prior to the trip, they had done a route survey which helped them anticipate hurdles on the way. The team members on the journey included electricity board officers, police officers, fire force officers and also members from private agencies like Keralavision and Asianet. But, right at the destination dramatic scenes unfolded and she was surrounded by a bevy of people who demanded nokkukooli for unloading the cargo. Rajeswari remained unflustered as a crowd swarmed around her. She stood up to them and refused to pay nokkukooli. “We travelled 70km from Kollam to Thumba; covering six to 12km every day. We took 10 days to complete the journey. We never planned a certain period for rest on this journey. We took breaks during the time it took the trailer workers to eat and while they looked for the parking area for the trailer. At night we rested in the car,” says Rajeswari. She said the residents in the area gave her a hard time and it was really challenging. They started the ruckus without any justifiable reason, she said. “I do not want it to happen again. I am totally against paying people who are not doing any job. Let it be the last nokkukooli case in the state,” Pillai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/an-eventful-journey-with-a-twist-at-the-end/articleshow/86148700.cms||---

With incidents of theft, officials of the observation home are worried about the safety of the girls and boys and the security of the various articles inside the home. Seema Patil, the superintendent of the observation home, said, “While various articles have been stolen from the remand home. We are worried about the safety of the boys and girls. We have 15 boys in the age group of 6 to 18 years and 22 girls in the age group of 12 to 18 years. The area of the government observation home is spread over two acre. There is a need for woman police for the safety of the girls and boys.” Chandulal Shah, the honorary secretary of the observation home, said, “The thefts started taking place after the work of a proposed road from the rear side of the home began a few months ago. The girls are afraid of the continuous incidents of theft and the movement of burglars in the area. We have registered complaints with the police from time to time but we are seeking a permanent guard at least during the night.” Senior police inspector of the Mumbai Naka police station Bhagirath Deshmukh told TOI that providing a security guard around the clock would not be possible.

After the floods in July, state irrigation minister Jayant Patil had asked the irrigation department authorities to revise the floodlines. The surge in water during the floods this year was a little higher than in 2019. After the floods two years ago, the floodlines were marked for Panchaganga river passing along Kolhapur city only. “This time the red and blue lines will be marked for the main towns situated along the river. Also, the irrigation department is marking lines for other rivers as well. The task will be completed by the end of October,” said Rekhawar. Patil had stated that after the flood of 2019, the lines were altered due to pressure from owners of land plots as the extension of the red lines would make the area from the line to the riverbank a no-development zone. The minister has said that this time, however, he has asked the authorities to ensure that there is no kind of interference in marking the lines. Based on the floodlines, the local authorities grant permission for different types of constructions. Due to the extension of the red floodlines, construction activities on over 350 hectares across Kolhapur city had been affected. “The work to draft the plan for rehabilitation of the flood-affected villages is also underway. I appeal to the local residents and representatives to provide their valuable inputs to prepare the plan, which can be effectively implemented,” added Rekhawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchaganga-floodlines-to-be-marked-by-oct-end-collector/articleshow/86146650.cms||---

In an effort to fix the city’s drainage system, GHMC’s Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) was rolled out in November 2020 post the floods that created havoc in the city. The SNDP wing is responsible for developing and maintaining storm water drain/nala system in the city. Though 260 properties with a combined extent of 23,000 square yards have been listed for acquisition through the legal route, GHMC is making efforts to acquire properties through negotiations under GHMC Act. “While some packages are currently under procurement stage, the removal of encroachments is being monitored by zonal commissioners. After land acquisition, the nala widening or reconstruction works will take off after October,” SNDP chief engineer Dr C Vasantha said. Those who had settled on government land over 10 years ago were being paid compensation at the prevailing market rates. However, encroachments shorter than 10 years were being removed immediately, official sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/260-properties-to-be-acquired-by-ghmc-for-nala-widening/articleshow/86152608.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Protege named CM, Big Ben Anandiben Patel back in driver's seat in Gujarat?||GANDHINAGAR: One thing was clear when Ghatlodia MLA Bhupendra Patel was named as then next CM of Gujarat — Big Ben Anandiben Patel, UP governor, who had to quit the top post in 2016 in the aftermath of a violent quota stir led by Hardik Patel and Dalit agitation, and the flogging of youths in Una, is back in the driver’s seat in Gujarat politics. Bhupendra Patel is known to be a close supporter of Anandiben’s group and reportedly shares a more than three decades long and strong professional relationship with Ben. He was known as a constant presence at Ben’s side during her political career as an MLA and later as minister and CM. BJP workers celebrate appointment of Bhupendra Patel as next CMIn Patel’s nomination to the helm of the state after the exit of Vijay Rupani, local political leaders saw a clear hand of Ben. In fact, leaders averred that Patel got lucky as his name got the stamp of approval of Union home minister Amit Shah as well. There were no surprises then when Patel thanked Ben along with the top BJP leadership including PM Narendra Modi, national BJP president J P Nadda, and Union home minister Amit Shah for entrusting him with the role. “I am lucky to have continuous blessings of former Gujarat CM and UP governor Anandiben Patel,” said Patel who insisted that he had no inkling about his appointment. It can be said that Patel owes his political career to Ben. During her time as revenue and urban development minister, he was appointed as chairman of the standing committee of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in 2010 for four years. He was also appointed chairman of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority in 2015. It was Ben who’d nominated Patel to contest from Ghatlodia, a seat she vacated when she resigned as Gujarat CM. Granted a ticket at the last moment, his name was on the last list of nominated candidates in 2017 elections, and he did his mentor proud by winning the Ghatlodia seat with a record margin of 1.17 lakh votes. With Patel as CM, the local leadership expects Ben’s say back in the state politics. “There is a good chance that the new CM will seek advice from his mentor to forge ahead on the party's agenda, to walk the tightrope and steer the party to victory in 2022,” said a senior leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/protege-named-cm-big-ben-back-in-drivers-seat-in-guj/articleshow/86152613.cms||Kapil Dave

Police officials said that Prashant had stolen as many as six mid-size cars in Barabanki and Lucknow. The stolen cars were even sold in Nepal. A massive manhunt has been launched for the other members of the gang. Police initiated the probe after one Rohit Prasad of Kotwali Nagar police station area in Barabanki lodged a complaint of his car being stolen from outside his house. Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad said, “Acting on a tip-off, our team arrested the accused Prashant Shukla and seized three stolen mid-size cars from his possession.” “During interrogation, Prashant revealed that he used to break the lock of the cars usually parked on the roadside or not in the parking lots. He also smashed the steering lock of the cars and took them to Sitapur where his aide Naushad Ali, a mechanic, used to change the chassis number, engine number of the vehicle. The car was then sold or else its valuable parts were taken out and fitted in another car,” said Prasad. Another police officer said the gang had a well-oiled machinery for stealing and disposing of the cars. “Members of the gang were entrusted specific tasks like recce of targets, checking the security arrangements in the area, including installation and placement of CCTV cameras, besides confirming the security features of the target car. If a car was automatic, or had enhanced security features, then the gang did not even attempt stealing it. The gang picked safe spots and vehicles with normal security features for stealing,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gang-of-car-thieves-bustedaccused-held-in-barabanki/articleshow/86152660.cms||---

He added that the members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) will assist the administration in monitoring the health of the home-isolated patients then. Bhujbal, who reviewed the Covid situation in the district during a meeting with collector Suraj Mandhare, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, civic chief Kailash Jadhav, Nashik zilla parishad CEO Leena Bansod, said drop in number of cases was appreciated, but both people and government agencies have to be vigilant against the spike in the cases. Talking about preparations for the third wave, Bhujbal said infrastructure was being readied in terms of oxygen storage and oxygen support beds across the district. “During the third wave the stress would be on home isolation for which members of IMA will help the health department in monitoring the health of patients and cut down the spread of the disease,” Bhujbal said. The rate of positivity in the district stood at 3.6%, while the fatality rate stood at 2.11%. The number of active case in the district has dropped to 862. “After a long time, the number of active cases have dropped in the district to a new low. It is an encouraging fact. The festive season is going on and hence people should stick to covid appropriate behavior to ensure cases do not increase,” said Bhujbal. When pointed out that cases in rural Nashik were still on the higher side, Bhujbal said the rural health department was keeping a close watch on the cases. Bansod said bulk of cases in rural areas were from Sinnar and Niphad talukas that have very strong connectivity talukas of neighbouring Ahmednagar district where the number of active cases are quite high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ima-to-assist-admin-in-monitoring-health-during-3rd-wave-bhujbal/articleshow/86146720.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||For Covid and financial plight, court lets man go with Rs 2k fine||New Delhi: A court has imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 on a convict for assaulting a police officer while noting that on account of Covid-19, citizens — particularly in private employment — were in great distress, and superior courts have emphasised the need to decongest prisons. The court said that though no grounds were made to release the convict after admonition, imposing imprisonment would be harsh considering the convict Naveen Kumar’s family and financial condition. Kumar was convicted under sections 186 (Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code. The court said the theory of rehabilitation is in vogue at present. “The theory of deterrence effect postulates that the punishment imposed should be such that it has a deterrence effect on anyone who thinks about committing such crime in the future. On the other hand, the theory, which is in vogue at present, is the theory of rehabilitation. The theory focuses on rehabilitating the offender rather than punishing him in a retributive sense of justice,” Metropolitan Magistrate Dev Chaudhary said in the order. However, it noted that it was not the case that the convict was a devout follower of the law of the land. The court said that Kumar had assaulted an on-duty police official, who had issued him a ticket for violating the law. Instead of obeying the police officer, Kumar attacked him and ran away in a brazen disregard of the law. “Thus, even after being found on the wrong side of the law, the convict showed utmost disrespect for the law,” it added. The court further noted that Kumar’s conduct after the conviction was also worth mentioning, as non-bailable warrants were issued against him. “No grounds are made to release the convict after admonition. At the same time, imposing imprisonment would also be harsh, keeping in view the family and financial condition of the convict. Further, on account of Covid-19, citizens, particularly in private employment, are in great distress, and even superior courts have emphasised that there is a need to decongest prisons,” it said. Kumar’s counsel had submitted that the convict was a poor person and the family’s sole earning member. The additional public prosecutor had argued that the convict had assaulted an on-duty officer, and maximum punishment be imposed on him to send a message to society that any obstruction in the work of a public servant would be dealt with strictly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-covid-and-financial-plight-court-lets-man-go-with-rs-2k-fine/articleshow/86150617.cms||Usha Das
---||Delhi||AAP’s growth in other states is behind ED notice, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party hit out at the central government over the Enforcement Directorate notice sent to party national secretary Pankaj Gupta under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Gupta has been asked to record his response at the ED’s office on September 22. Kejriwal alleged BJP was employing such tactics to undermine AAP, which was growing in strength in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand and Gujarat, while AAP MLA Raghav Chadha said this was how BJP was using "baseless and false charges" to attack Delhi’s ruling party. “In Delhi, they tried to defeat us with IT department, CBI, Delhi Police, but we won 62 seats (out of 70). As we grow in Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, we get an ED notice! The people of India want honest politics. These tactics of BJP will never succeed, they will make us stronger,” Kejriwal tweeted. In Delhi they tried to defeat us with IT Dept, CBI, Delhi Police - but we won 62 seats. As we grow in Punjab, Goa,… https://t.co/enw2ZSxnPh— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1631522123000Later at a press conference, Chadha categorised ED as the Modi government’s “favourite agency to persecute AAP”. He said, “ED has become a political department for revenge under BJP and its headquarters should be shifted close to the BJP office for ease in command. There has not been a single year since AAP was formed that the Centre hasn’t sent a notice to AAP.” Chadha added that rule of law would prevail over vendetta politics. About the ED letter of September 10, issued under the Money Laundering Act, Chadha said, “The increasing popularity of AAP and Arvind Kejriwal has shaken PM Modi and BJP so much that they have unleashed their agencies and directed them to destroy AAP. ED is working like a frontal organisation of BJP. As opinion polls show Arvind Kejriwal and AAP growing in popularity in Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab, all these agencies have been pressed into action to conduct character assassination of AAP leaders.” In recent months, senior AAP functionaries have been active in Uttarakhand and Gujarat and some other states. Saying that similar attacks against others, including deputy CM Manish Sisodia, had yielded nothing, this was only one in a string of witch hunts against APP. “The mud-slinging mud at Arvind Kejriwal began during the India Against Corruption movement, when the Union home ministry sent a notice to investigate the funding of the movement. BJP used every agency from ED, CBI, EC and Delhi Police to put us on notice,” said the MLA. “CBI also raided the CM’s office. Delhi Police then went to the extent of searching the bedroom at the CM’s house but didn’t find a shred of evidence against him.” Chadha said that AAP leaders were not scared of “BJP’s agencies”. “If the largest, richest and the party of the rich are afraid of the poor and the party of the poor people, then we accept this as a medal of honour,” Chadha said. He claimed that no other political party had been subjected to such harassment in independent India as AAP had been. “No CM has ever had to suffer raids on his office. We believe in rule of law and welcome the ED notice with open hands,” declared Chadha. “We only pray that rule of law will prove victorious over the rule of vendetta politics in this country. We are not intimidated by the ‘alleged financial crimes’ notices sent by ED.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-aaps-growth-in-other-states-is-behind-ed-notice/articleshow/86181364.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Only 2% of Maharashtra’s 20L pregnant women jabbed||MUMBAI: Vaccination against Covid for pregnant women started in mid-July, but it is still to pick up in the state. Only around 40,700 women have taken the shot so far in Maharashtra, shows data. Considering the state has an estimated 20 lakh women in this category, it means barely 2% have taken the jab. In Mumbai, home to about 1.5 lakh pregnant women, only 1,278 have taken it. Nationally, over 6 lakh had taken it till September 7. Doctors believe fear, misconception and lack of local data on pregnancy outcomes for the mother and the child may be keeping women away. ‘More data, awareness can push pregnant women to take shot’The low rate of vaccination despite mounting evidence that pregnant women face a higher risk of severe Covid has the medical fraternity calling for more awareness and confidence-building campaigns. BMC data shows that only one woman of the nearly 1,200 vaccinated had a serious adverse event that required a few days of hospitalisation. Data for adverse events recorded could not be obtained at the state level. In the first wave, pregnant women were relatively less impacted. Dr Tushar Palve, superintendent of Cama and Albless Hospital, said less than five pregnant women needed oxygen support out of nearly 700 admissions. That changed drastically in the second wave as nearly 30% (120) required oxygen support out of 450-odd admissions. “Morbidity was higher in the second wave, so we highly recommend vaccination to our patients,” he said. Dr Palve said they counsel pregnant women when they come for antenatal visits. As they wait in a common hall for their turn to see the doctor, a senior nurse or a doctor counsels them in groups about the benefits of vaccination outweighing risks for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. “Few get convinced to take the vaccine and walk up to the vaccination centre on our premises,” he said, adding that only 21 have taken the vaccine at Cama, a dedicated women’s hospital, till now. Vaccination is avoided by most in the first trimester although it has been approved any time during pregnancy. Dr Hrishikesh Pai, president-elect of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI), said repeated counselling is needed to allay fears of miscarriage. “There is strong hesitancy, but that’s understandable,” he said. Dr Pai thinks the numbers may see an uptick next year, provided more data is available. Globally, there is robust data on the safety of mRNA vaccines for pregnant women. Dr Pai said the government must collect local data, including on Covaxin and Covishield. One way to do that would be to study pregnancy outcomes in women, particularly healthcare and frontline workers, who may have inadvertently taken the vaccine in January-February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-data-awareness-can-push-pregnant-women-to-take-shot/articleshow/86153665.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Delhi||EDMC places huge bins to make its areas free of dhalaos||New Delhi: To make areas under its jurisdiction dhalao-free, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has started placing huge bins outside apartments and colonies where waste can be dumped and later lifted by the civic body’s vehicles thrice a day. However, residents have objected to this and argued that the open bins placed near the boundary walls or entrances not only make the colonies look ugly, but also add to the unhygienic conditions. In Mayur Vihar, residents said the bins placed outside Samachar Apartments had already become a nuisance. People said either covered bins should be placed in limited numbers or replaced with dhalaos. “I contacted the mayor and informed him about the situation. Contrary to the claims of EDMC, these bins were not cleaned till 11.30am on Friday. Also, ragpickers gather there to search for plastic and other items,” said Aditi, a local resident. “We are worried because the open bins will become mosquito breeding grounds as rainwater will collect in them. Earlier, there was only one dhalao in the area, but that was covered completely,” added Aditi. EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal said people should cooperate rather than criticise the move. “If we cover these bins, then people will not touch them because they will be considered unhygienic. As far as the closing of dhalaos is concerned, we have installed huge compacting stations at big dumping sites. But people are resisting and asking us to remove them. This situation is occurring due to the negligence of people, who are not dumping waste in bins and are throwing it outside. We will work out all the loopholes, but people should also cooperate,” added Agarwal. Arun Mahajan, vice-president of Nirman Apartments, said, “Because the bins are placed in public places, everyone is throwing garbage there. Due to lack of education and common sense, people are dumping garbage outside rather than inside the bins, which is leading to foul smell emanating at all times. Earlier, we lodged a complaint with the councillor and arrangements were made for regular lifting of garbage, but after some time things were back to square one. We tried to fix timings for lifting waste from the apartment, but that didn’t continue for long.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-places-huge-bins-to-make-its-areas-free-of-dhalaos/articleshow/86150657.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Gangapur Dam Complex — comprising Gangapur dam, Kashyapi dam and Gautami Godavari dam — has a capacity of 9,350 million cubic feet (mcft) and the current storage is 89% (8354 mcft ) of its capacity. The storage, last year during the same time, was 90 % (8403 mcft). “The water in-store in the complex is just enough to fulfil drinking water needs for citizens of Nashik Municipal Corporation areas. The dam also caters to the requirements of industries and agriculture. Current storage is good as far as city needs are concerned,” an official from district administration said. The overall storage across 23 major and medium dams in the district, which store water for Nashik and parts of parched districts of Ahmednagar, Aurangabad and Jalgaon, has touched 47,485 mcft (72%) against the capacity of 65,814 mcft. Last year, the storage was 59,599 mcft (91 %). Water from seven major and medium dams was being released into the Godavari, Darna and Kadva rivers after they were filled to the brim. The Water Resources Department (WRD) said to ensure caution while using the water from the dams. “The collective water storage in the district is not very encouraging at this point. However, the water in Gangapur Dam Complex is good. But the actual picture and availability of water will be decided only on October 15 when the water reservation is announced under the provisions of Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authorit,y which takes into consideration the water levels in Jayakwadi,” said Sagar Shinde, the executive engineer of Nashik Irrigation Division (NID).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dams-have-adequate-stock-to-meet-citys-drinking-water-needs/articleshow/86146755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There is no way or means to know on the black-listing/lifting of black-listing of companies by various govt agencies,” he said. “Regarding the allegations that the tender was awarded to a black-listed company TSL, the issue was verified with APTS and it was found that TSL was removed from the black-list on August 6, 2015 which makes them eligible in terms of the tender eligibility conditions,” he added. Hari Prasad also stated that documents submitted by consortium of TSL and HFCL had been thoroughly verified for their eligibility by INCAP internal committee assisted by PwC.

---||Vadodara||5 love-related deaths shake tribal beliefs and customs||Vadodara: Since March this year, at least five incidents of suicides or attempts to kill selves by young tribal couples believed to be in love have left many deeply surprised on how the outside world is adversely impacting the tribal-dominated customs and beliefs in central Gujarat. Suicides are otherwise rare among tribals and these incidents and practically unheard of earlier. Police investigations in these cases have hinted at love affairs between couples who decided to end their lives after their relationships were not acceptable to their respective families. Such incidents came to light in both Panchmahal and Dahod districts. Tribal activist and writer Kanji Patel said that marriages were not possible among same clans in some tribal communities. “If the couple does so, they may face consequences. This is more likely in small villages where the community is closely knit and such affair challenge the social fabric,” he explained. Patel said that now, with the influence of the outside world, such frustrations are pushing tribal people to end their lives. He also added that songs about failure in love and its consequences have made it to the tribal areas through folk music. “Such lyrics were never a part of their culture. The culture and tribal society is in a state of flux,” the writer said. Mathur Bhedi, a retired teacher having in-depth knowledge of tribal traditions, said that the Bhil tribals prohibit people with the same surname from getting married. Similarly, a boy or a girl cannot marry a person having the surname same as his or her maternal uncle. “For a tribal, all persons having the surname as their ‘mama’ (maternal uncle), are considered as their maternal uncles.

The CID has made several allegations of irregularities in the awarding of the Rs 320 crore contract. It has also alleged a loss of Rs 120 crore. CID has contended that officials had accepted falsified documents of the consortium led by Tera Software. “The accused went out of the way and removed the name of Tera Software from blacklist from participation in government’s tender processes,” CID alleged. On August 19, 2015, AP Technologies Services Limited managing director B Sundar raised objections in awarding the bid to Tera Software. “Tera Software had been blacklisted by APTS recently for their failure to deliver goods and services to the Civil Supplies Dept, the blacklisting of again revoked by the Techno Finance Committee on the initiative of Civil Supplies on August 6 2015. Tera Software is a bad performer with reference to e-Govt, contracts,” CID said . “Vemuru Hari Krishna Prasad was directly connected to Tera Software Ltd. The files do not reflect anywhere that Vemuru Hari Krishna Prasad disclosed about his acquaintance with the bidders or offered to recuse himself from the tender process,” CID alleged. The losses are due to non delivery of features, software by Tera Software, non-adherence of standard guidelines, release of payments without completion of full acceptance test and other certificates by violating conditions. In his statement to the CID, managing director of Signum Digital networks, K Gouri Shankar stated, “In the month of August 2015 Signum Digital Network received an e-mail and letter from the managing director of INCAP, wherein the managing director INCAP requested them to confirm the supply and installation of digital head-end and other equipment by Tera Software.” CID alleged that Vemuru Hari Krishna Prasad contacted and threatened him to give confirmation mail to INCAP immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fibernet-tender-irregularities-vemuru-summoned-by-ap-cid/articleshow/86152676.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Jackfruit in diet can help lower diabetes||HYDERABAD: A joint study in controlling diabetes by doctors from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra has highlighted the role of fruits in bringing down sugar levels. During the pandemic, many non-diabetics turned pre-diabetics and pre-diabetics turned diabetics in south Indian states, particularly Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The two Telugu states are said to be diabetes capitals due to high rice intake. Most cases of diabetes are being seen in 30-45 age group while pre-diabetes is increasingly being found in children. Published in the international science journal ‘Nature’, the role of jackfruit in controlling diabetes, has shown encouraging results for patients, said Dr Gopal Rao, assistant professor for general medicine at Government Medical College, Srikakulam, who carried out the research along with Dr A G Unnikrishnan, endocrinologist & CEO of Chellaram Diabetes Institute, Pune. The study found decreasing mean blood glucose in seven days of administration of jackfruit flour meal. “These findings backed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) can be significant in the way diabetes is managed, especially in a country like India where a variety of food choices are available,” Rao said. 40 patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus were studied for the impact by replacing rice and wheat in their meal with jackfruit flour. “We gave 30 grams of jackfruit powder mixed with food to patients, for a period of three months and it was found to have lowered fasting blood sugar, post-prandial blood glucose, a significant reduction in HbA1c level was observed. Weight loss was also observed in patients,” said Dr Gopal Rao, While the clinical profile and pattern of diabetes is different in the Indian population compared to western population, over 30 per cent of patients with diabetes in India are reported to not fall in the obese category. “The south Asian population has a higher risk of diabetes at low BMI and dietary interventions that achieve normoglycemia without weight loss may also be important. In the present study, a significant reduction in HbA1c level was observed, without a significant reduction in weight...Jackfruit flour can be useful in such a population with diabetes for improving glycemic control without weight loss,” as per the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jackfruit-in-diet-can-help-lower-diabetes/articleshow/86152878.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Security for Telangana, Andhra Pradesh projects to cost river boards a bomb||HYDERABAD: The Union ministry of jal shakti’s decision to take over all major and medium irrigation projects in Telangana and AP is going to cost both the river boards a bomb in paying central forces providing security. It is estimated that both the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) may have to cough up around Rs 50 crore to Rs 70 crore annually for security at 107 major and medium projects in the two states. The Centre took the decision to give security to central forces as there were instances in the past few years where both Telangana and AP officials came to blows at the project sites over hydel power generation or releasing of water. Even the states had lodged police complaints against each other. Official sources said the water resources ministry had written a letter to Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) over deployment of forces at the irrigation sites, at least near common projects, last month. The CISF, while accepting the request, informed that the Boards would have to bear the expenses that includes salaries and allowances of the personnel deputed to the Boards. As part of the gazette notification issued by the Centre on July 15 deciding the jurisdiction of both Krishna and Godavari Boards, both Telangana and AP have been asked to deposit Rs 200 crore respectively with each of the Boards within 60 days from the date of publication of notification. Which means that both the states have to deposit the amount before September 15. Apart from this, both the Telugu states have to deposit funds required for functioning of the Boards on a regular basis within 15 days after receiving request from the Boards. During the meet with Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat recently, Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao reportedly enquired about the seed money to be deposited with the Boards. The CM was informed most of the money went towards security at the project sites and the rest was for regular expenses. As of now all major dams such as Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar are being guarded by the Telangana State Special Protection Force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/security-for-t-ap-projects-to-cost-river-boards-a-bomb/articleshow/86152751.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Goa||FC Goa enter knockout stage as injured Ortiz is ruled out of Durand Cup||Panaji: Delightful long rangers from Muhammed Nemil and Jorge Ortiz helped FC Goa put it across Sudeva Delhi FC 2-1 and book a place in the quarterfinals of the Durand Cup on Monday. Goa conceded a late penalty at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Kriranganat in Kolkata which was calmly converted by William Pauliankhum. Goa’s entry into the knockout stage came at a price as Ortiz was ruled out with what looked like a bad injury. The star winger was recklessly tackled by Akbar Khan and had to be stretchered out of the field. Club sources said Ortiz has now been ruled out of the Durand Cup but worryingly it could be a longer spell on the sidelines. “We will be able to confirm only after examining all the reports. The injury looks really bad,” said one official. Coach Juan Ferrando made a couple of changes to the starting lineup after their opening game win over Armey Green. Young midfielder Nemil, who impressed on his debut against Army Green, was handed a start. The 19-year-old, who played in Spain last season, tried to make an early impression. He found himself in an ideal position within the first minute, but his right-footer ballooned over. However, Nemil announced his arrival in style. Just before the break, he cut back on his right on the edge of the box, made space for himself and curled the ball with his left to the top corner of the Sudeva goal. There was hardly anything worthwhile before the opening goal. Holding the ball was never a problem for Goa against Sudeva. But the I-League outfit left them frustrated for most part of the first session with a compact defence. Alberto Noguera could hardly slide a ball through for forward Devendra Murgaonkar. On the right wing, Romario Jesuraj was left frustrated. Sudeva showed promise after the restart as Maichael Singh’s effort hit the upright. At the other end, Goa could have doubled their lead just after the hour mark when Noguera played a quick one-two with Nemil but the Spanish midfielder’s shot was saved by goalkeeper Legend Singh. Soon, the Goa duo were substituted as Edu Bedia and Jorge Ortiz made their first appearance of the season. Ortiz scored a beauty with 10 minutes left on the clock, but it came at a cost as he was tackled by Akbar. He had to be substituted and was stretchered inside the dressing room. In injury time, Edu brought down Shubho Paul inside the penalty area and William kept his cool to slot the ball past Dheeraj Singh from the resultant spot-kick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-enter-knockout-stage-as-injured-ortiz-is-ruled-out-of-durand-cup/articleshow/86181387.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The district administration said though no loss of property has been reported over Saturday and Sunday, a 45-year-old man is feared to have been swept away in the Wadlevi river in Nashik taluka. Resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode said the man was swept away on Saturday evening. A fire brigade team was sent to the spot.

The Nashik city received 37.5mm of rain on Saturday night alone. Since Sunday morning, light showers were reported from across the city and the district. The district, meanwhile, received an average of 22mm rain in the 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Sunday. In Igatpuri and Trimbakeshwar, Saturday’s heavy rainfall continued even on Sunday, helping boost the stocks in the dams. The water storage level at the Gangapur dam had reached 97%. The water resources department (WRD) has started discharge from the dam. On Sunday evening, the discharge was increased from 500 to 1,500 cusec. The Godavari water level in the Ramkund area of Panchavati rose after the water discharge started. The low-lying bridges — like the Ramsetu and others — and the site where the weekly bazaar is held were inundated. The river water level is still within the ‘safe’ mark, though the Nashik Municipal Corporation and the district administration have issued an alert to all residents of low-lying areas in Nashik city and in Chandori village of Niphad taluka. They have been told to stay away from the river as the discharge is likely to be increased. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded an alert of more rainfall over the next five days. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places. Over the next two days, moderate rainfall is expected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/1-feared-swept-away-as-heavy-rain-lashes-parts-of-nashik-district/articleshow/86146813.cms||Abhilash Botekar

When the report is ready, it will be sent to the state government to get the compensation,” Mandhare said after the Covid-19 review meeting conducted by district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal at Nashik on Sunday.

It is said that the meeting took place as Bhujbal and Kande argued at the Nandgaon taluka headquarters on Saturday. Kande had then demanded that Bhujbal intervene and order the collector to disburse funds from the District Planning Committee (DPC). During the press conference, Bhujbal pointed out that there was no provision to provide funds directly from the DPC. Mandhare stated that, during any kind of calamity, the primary responsibility of the administration is to rescue those affected for which the DPC fund can be used. However, for any further assistance, a proposal must be sent to the state government seeking approval to use the DPC fund. “We will complete the process,” collector sated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-to-seek-govt-aid-for-nandgaon-residents/articleshow/86146792.cms||Abhilash Botekar

In a reply filed in Delhi high court, the home ministry opposed a plea by Delhi Waqf Board that the premises should not be kept locked and its original character be restored. “The present premises has been kept under lock and key in view of the fact that the organisers of Markaz and the masjid are under investigation in an FIR... and the said case is under investigation wherein notices have already been served seeking details of plot/plots related to Masjid Banglewali Markaz, Kashif-ul-uloom madarsa, Basti Nizamuddin to provide ownership documents etc,” the reply says. The court had asked police and the Centre to file its reply to the plea to open Nizamuddin Markaz, where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid Covid-19 and which has been locked since March 31 last year. On Monday, the court posted the matter for November. It also asked when police intend to release the property. “Due to the pandemic, an FIR was registered... (and) you take possession as case property. It has to be handed over. It can’t be that the property is kept forever (subject to court orders)... You tell me from whom you took it. How long will you keep it locked as case property?” According to the Centre, “Since about 1,300 foreigners were found to be residing in the said premises and cases against them have cross-border implications and involves the nation’s diplomatic relationship with other countries, it is necessary and incumbent on the part of the respondent to preserve the said premises for the purpose of Section 310 of CrPC.” It added, “It is just and necessary that the case property in such a case is preserved in letter and spirit so that due process of law in dealing with such cases is followed.” Police have also claimed that according to orders, five people are allowed to offer namaz five times a day on the premises and there is no violation of any fundamental right of the waqf board or anyone else. On April 15, the court had allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at the Markaz during Ramzan on the “first floor above the basement” after following Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s Covid protocols. The waqf board has contended that even if the premises is part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out-ofbound area” is a “primitive method” of inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cant-reopen-markaz-as-it-is-part-of-probe-centre-to-hc/articleshow/86181470.cms||Abhinav Garg

A total of 86.82lakh doses have already been given in the first 12 days of themonth. At its current pace, Maharashtra will most likely be able to administerone crore doses by September 15, if not before.  With an increase in supply of dosesfrom the Centre, the state has clocked an average of 7lakh vaccinations inSeptember till now. “We are likely to cross the 1crore milestone in the first15 days of the month,” a state official said, adding it would be the fastestcrore achieved till now. The state plans to vaccinate over 2crore this month. Since the national vaccination againstCovid-19 rolled out in January, the state has managed to administer over 1croredoses each in July (1.21crore) and August (1.44crore).  The surge in supplies has also given riseto hopes that Maharashtra may after all be able to vaccinate its entire adult populationwith at least one dose in the next few months. The state has an estimated adultpopulation of 9.58crore of which 4.9crore have got at least one dose leaving another4.6crore to receive their first jabs yet. A cursory glance at the rate of vaccinationshows that it may be possible to cover the remaining population, although stateofficials are guarded about reaching that milestone.  Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary(health) said that a considerable number of doses would go to those due fortheir second shots. “The daily doses include both first and second doses, alldoses do not go towards the first dose. Further, the demand for a second dose willincrease with passage of time,” he said. State taskforce members have said that the authorities must now work towards reducing the disparity between districts.  Mumbai, which has also seen an uptickin vaccinations in September with an average of 1 lakh doses administered every day,stands a higher chance of covering all with at least one shot. The city hasadministered at least one dose to more than 82% of the estimated adultpopulation of 93.48lakh. Statistically, about 17lakh people are yet to gettheir first shots. Given that the city, including the private sector, has managedto vaccinate over 20lakh people each in the past two months, the single dose goallooks achievable.  “Yes, with the current range ofsupply, we may be able to vaccinate all adults with at least one dose in thenext two months. However, Mumbai’s coverage numbers also include 20% of MMRresidents, who may have got vaccinated here. So, we will have to vaccinate 20%more than Mumbai’s estimated population to reach everyone,” said Suresh Kakani,additional municipal commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-likely-to-give-1cr-jabs-in-15-days-its-quickest-yet/articleshow/86153681.cms||Sumitra Debroy

He used to sell it for Rs 10 crore and claimed to set up a deal where space agency NASA would buy it for Rs 500 crore. The accused has been identified as Bhawani Singh Shekhawat from Jaipur. Cops received a complaint from a west Delhi businessman, Sanjay Taneja, who alleged that a gang of 22 people had duped him of Rs 10.63 crore between March 2016 and September 2018, allegedly for facilitating the sale of radioactive article, which was purportedly approved by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Taneja was induced to invest for facilitation of this deal on the assurance of profit of Rs 500 crore. The amount was taken by the accused through bank transfer, cheques and cash in several tranches. An FIR was registered and the bank account statements were analysed and it was found that the alleged persons took money in the name of a company M/s Barclays Metal World (BMW). This was shown as a UK-based company and a prospective buyer of the radioactive material. The alleged people kept on delaying the sale on guise of testing of the material and kept on receiving money from the complainant for alleged maintenance of the radioactive material in various companies run by them. Huge amount was also received in cash. On verification, the purported foreign company was found as a single proprietorship dealing in metal scrap. Cops subsequently tracked down Shekhawat using technical surveillance. He was involved in six other cases of similar nature at Jaipur and his associates are still on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conman-promises-radioactive-glass-panels-for-luck/articleshow/86150729.cms||---

While rumours were rife that they had died of hunger and starvation, doctors involved in postmortem clarified that Jhelabai Choudhri (73) died naturally of old age, while her daughter Maya Pulgamkar died of gangrene. Jehlabai lived with her daughter Maya in ward no 5 of Kothari. Having not seen them outside since many days, neighbours checked their house and discovered their bodies. After cops were informed, the bodies were taken to rural hospital in Ballarpur for postmortem. Sources said that Jhelabai was old and weak, and was unable to move around. Her daughter Maya was suffering from gangrene after an injury on her leg. Its infection spread in her body and she was unable to move. Hence, they stayed at home and were not seen in the village for the last many weeks. Having no relative to take care of them, neighbours had arranged for their meals and set a tiffin from a mess for the duo. Doctors involved in postmortem refuted the rumours of death due to starvation and said that Jhelabai’s death was due to old age, while her daughter died of gangrene infection. Viscera of both the deceased has been sent to Chandrapur GMCH for forensic examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mother-daughter-duo-found-dead-at-home/articleshow/86148798.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Lucknow||High grain production to offset low MSP hike for wheat||Lucknow: The UP government has asserted that a Rs 40 per quintal hike in minimum support price (MSP) for wheat in 2021-22 — one of the lowest in a decade — won’t impact farmers as the quantum of grain production in the state has risen by over 35% in four years. Speaking to TOI, UP agriculture minister, Surya Pratap Shahi, said, production of wheat and paddy rose approximately from 28 quintals per hectare in 2016-17 to 38 quintals per hectare in 2020-21. “This is a key pointer to pro-farmer measures, including providing good quality seeds and fertilizer to farmers and associating them with technology,” he said, while allaying fears that a relatively low MSP hike for wheat may not go down well with the farming community in run-up to assembly elections next year. Shahi’s stand comes at a time when BJP faces heat from the farming community, which is up in arms against three farm laws. Government records show MSP increased from Rs 1,100 per quintal in 2010-11 to Rs 1,170 in 2011-12. It rose by Rs 100/quintal in 2016-17, by Rs 110/quintal in 2017-18, Rs 105/quintal in 2018-19, Rs 85/quintal in 2019-20 and Rs 50 in 2020-21. Wheat MSP rose by Rs 40 to Rs 2,015 per quintal from Rs 1,975 per quintal in the 2020-21 crop year. The cost of production of wheat is estimated at Rs 1,008 per quintal. MSP is the rate at which the government buys grain from farmers to protect them from panic buying. Currently, the government fixes MSP for 23 crops grown in both kharif and rabi seasons. Sowing of rabi (winter) crops begins from October immediately after the harvest of kharif (summer) crops. Wheat and mustard are major rabi crops. While 2% MSP hike for wheat is lowest in a decade, UP is the biggest wheat producer, accounting for one-third of the overall wheat production in the country. As per UP agriculture department records, annual average paddy production between 2012-17 was of 123.61 lakh metric tonnes. This went up to an average of 163.45LMT per annum in last four years. Likewise, wheat production went up from 288.14LMT per annum between 2012-17 to 369.47LMT per annum in last four years. The total food grain production in 2020-21 was 618.49 LMT, records show. On the procurement front, the state government procured 123.61 LMT of paddy between 2012-17. This rose to 214.56 LMT in four years. Likewise, 94.38 LMT of wheat was purchased from farmers between 2012-17, which went up to 209.67 LMT between 2017 and 2021. The UP government procured around 53 lakh metric tonnes of wheat in 2021-22, which was 33% higher than last year and around 700% higher than the produce procured in 2016-17. The procurement was, however, 14% of the total wheat production, which is comparatively less than Punjab and Haryana, where almost 70% and 80% wheat is procured by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/high-grain-production-to-offset-low-msp-hike-for-wheat/articleshow/86152746.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||50% vacancy in Delhi high court: Law ministry||NEW DELHI: Latest figures released by the Union law ministry reveal that Delhi has one of the largest vacancies in the country — over 50% — in its high court. According to the vacancy statement uploaded by the ministry earlier this month, Delhi High Court has a total of 31 vacancies, as against a sanctioned strength of 60. In effect, the court is functioning with 29 judges — with one more retirement due in November this year — at less than half its strength, with more than 50% of the posts vacant. This, despite the fact that taking into account the pendency of cases, disposal rate and present infrastructure, the high court has been sanctioned post of 60 judges for a smooth handling of flow of litigation in the capital. A comparison with other big high courts shows the problem of an unprecedented number of vacancies is unique to Delhi High Court. For instance, Allahabad High Court, the biggest in the country, has 92 judges out of the sanctioned strength of 160, and is functioning well above the halfway mark of 80. Similarly, Bombay High Court — with a sanctioned strength of 93 — has 61 judges working, much above the 50% figure. Same is the case with Punjab and Haryana High Court, which has 40 vacancies as against 85 posts. Lawyers point out the crippling effects of such a high vacancy may not be evident at present, because the courts are only taking up extremely urgent matters — that too of only 2020 and 2021 — for hearing in the current restricted manner of functioning. “Once the court reopens fully and pending cases are put back on the board of judges for adjudication, there may be over 100 cases listed before each judge everyday, since one judge would be handling a roster of two courts. Imagine the plight of litigants who are patiently waiting during these two years for their old cases to come up for hearing. At present old cases are being automatically adjourned while new cases are adding up to the pendency,” a bar leader said. According to the records, the last appointments made to Delhi High Court was in February this year, when the government cleared two of the six names recommended by the Supreme Court collegium in August 2020. Before that the last elevations to the high court from the bar was in 2018, when five lawyers were appointed as judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-vacancy-in-delhi-hc-law-ministry/articleshow/86150754.cms||Abhinav Garg

It is the highest number of people to be vaccinated in a single-day in the district.Chennai topped the state by inoculating the highest number of 1,85,370 people, while the district, which vaccinated 1,51,685 people, was placed second.The drive was initially scheduled for 12 hours starting from 7am to 7pm. However, it went on till 8pm and additional vaccine doses were supplied to the camps, where the demand was high.District collector G S Sameeran attributed the success of the mega vaccination drive to the concentrated efforts of revenue and health officials and support of civil society members.Vaccination camps were organized in 1,475 centres in the district on the day. When the drive began in the morning, the response wasn’t that encouraging. However, the turnout picked up in the afternoon and reached its peak in the evening.According to the collector, the district had inoculated 1.25 lakh people two hours before winding up the drive, for which roughly 3,000 revenue and health department staff were pressed into service. Rural areas saw the maximum number of camps at 1,016, followed by city corporation limits (308) and municipal limits (151).People in the rural areas, especially in the tribal settlements and villages bordering Kerala, largely benefited from the drive. A large number of people turned out at the centres to get inoculated, thanks to the week-long awareness campaign that was taken out by anganwadi workers.About 1,500 vaccine doses were administered at the camps on VOC park ground alone. Namma Kovai members, who managed 15 vaccination centres, five of them mobile ones, at the location, said it was in the evening that the turnout went up.C G S Manian, organizer, Namma Kovai, said the guest workers were the real beneficiaries on VOC park ground. “While some of them faced language issues, we could sort things out through our bilingual volunteers. This encouraged many of them to come in groups for vaccination.”N Dhanalakshmi, 74, was among the senior citizens who made use of VOC park centre to take her second dose. “I was initially hesitant to take vaccine, but agreed after my son took the first dose in June. While it was difficult to get the second dose because of the crowd at the vaccination centres, today I could get inoculated in a few minutes.”N Angalagan, 48, of Papanaickenpalayam, said the mega drive had ended his long wait for the second dose. “I had taken the first dose of Covaxin about three months ago. Then, there was a shortage of Covaxin. But today it was available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/more-than-1-50l-people-get-inoculated-in-a-single-day/articleshow/86150767.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Lucknow||UP: Ramjanmabhoomi complex final blueprint out, six temples around the ‘garbh griha’||AYODHYA: While Ram Lalla will be resplendent in the sanctum sanctorum, six temples of other deities will be constructed along the Ramjanmabhoomi periphery, as per the final blueprint of the 70-acre complex released by the Temple Trust. Work on the temple foundation is continuing a war footing and is expected to be completed by October-end or first week of November, paying way for construction of the ‘garbh griha’ which is scheduled to be opened to pilgrims by 2023-end. The six temples will be consecrated to the deities — Lord Surya, Lord Ganesh, Lord Shiva, Goddess Durga, Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma (second after Pushkar). Talking to TOI, Temple Trust member Dr Anil Mishra said, “These temples will come up on the periphery of the Ram temple. Along with Ram, worshipping these deities are important in Hinduism.” Construction of the base (plinth) of the super structure will begin from first week of November after multiple foundation layers are rolled out. During the temple construction committee meeting chaired by Nripendra Mishra late last month, it was decided that the excavated foundation area — 1.2 lakh sqft wide and 50-foot deep — will be raised to 107m above sea level with an additional rollout of four layers. Earlier, 44 layers of engineered fill material were being placed in the foundation. For in-situ placement of marble and carved stones, four towering cranes will be installed at four different locations. Top sources in the temple trust said, a seven-foot tall concrete raft will be erected once the filling exercise is over. Cement will be used for the first time in casting the raft. So far, cement was not used in the engineered filling material, which was churned out of stone dust and fly ash. Temple trust general secretary Champat Rai said, minimal use of cement will ensure less absorption of heat. The plinth of the super structure will be constructed with 3.5lakh cubic feet of stones of Mirzapur, where two private firms have been given the contract to cut and shape the pink stones. Sources said, erratic power supply in Mirzapur is slowing down the procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ramjanmabhoomi-final-blueprint-out-six-temples-of-other-deities-to-encircle-sanctum-sanctorum/articleshow/86152796.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Coimbatore||Online coaching classes posed challenges: Medical aspirants||Coimbatore: Just like last year, many of the students who appeared for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on Sunday, found the test to be moderate except for a few questions in Physics and Chemistry that were tough to crack.While freshers had to rely on online classes, be it for Class XII board exam or private NEET coaching this year, repeaters had an edge over them for having appeared for the test in the previous years and additional preparation.Appearing for NEET last year gave a fair idea about the test and its requirements for S Barjeesh Banu of Pollachi. She is confident of securing well above 254 marks, which she had secured last time. “Being a state board student, private coaching helped me prepare with state board and NCERT books, but the pandemic-induced online classes were a setback,” she said. “We tend to lose concentration in online classes when most of the preparation happens in isolation. This was unlike in offline classes where interaction was more and clearing doubts was easy. Biology-related questions were easy and some of the questions in Physics and Chemistry were hard.”T Hari Krishnan, a repeater from Udumalpet, who appeared for NEET for the third time, found questions Biology, Zoology and Botany easy. However, he could not attempt a few questions in Physics. While he opted for private NEET coaching twice in the last two years, he said he could not understand some concepts during the online classes. “I am expecting about 550 marks and hope to join a government medical college in the state,” he told TOI.S Ramya, a fresher from Ukkadam, found the test moderate. She didn’t opt for private coaching and chose to do self-study with state board and NCERT books. “I am not sure of making it to a government medical college for MBBS seat but want to try my luck in getting Naturopathy and Veterinary,” she said.More students from government schools are expected to get MBBS seats in government medical colleges this year. “A total of 372 students had opted for the free coaching of the state government this year against 270 last year. While 16 students could get seats in government medical colleges last year, we are expecting the numbers to go up this year, especially because of the 7.5% reservation for government school students in MBBS seats,” said Coimbatore district NEET coordinator T Moorthi.A total of 326 students who had registered for NEET from Coimbatore and Tirupur districts were absent. The test was held in eight centres in both the districts where a total 6,693 students appeared for the test out of the 7,019 candidates who had registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/online-coaching-classes-posed-challenges-medical-aspirants/articleshow/86150759.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Pune||80 acres in hand, but PMPML buses have no space to park||Pune: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has 80 acre land parcels in different parts of the city yet there is no space for parking 250 buses. These vehicles are parked on the roads making them susceptible to damage and thefts. The board of directors recently discussed a plan for the commercial exploitation of these land parcels for shopping centres, office spaces, hospitals and malls to generate non-fare revenue. Sources in the city transport body told TOI that even with 13 depots, the planning and the distribution of buses was haphazard and many buses did not have parking space. “At present, buses have to be parked near the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) building, near the Shivajinagar railway station and a few other places. Each month, we record two cases of theft of spares, especially batteries or even diesel, despite security being provided,” an official with the transport body said. A large number of buses parked near the PMC building had no place to be shifted to. “These buses belong to the Narveer Tanajiwadi depot which is small. It is the most profitable depot and some of its space has been given to the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited. The problem with the depots at Swargate and the Market Yard is the same. We cannot shift the buses parked near the PMC to a far-off depot as the buses need to be ready for commuters as early as 6am,” the official pointed out. Another official said they had sought space from the PMC. “The uneven size of depots is a problem too. For example, the Nigdi depot, which is far-off from the city stretches on nine acres, but there are only 200 buses parked there. Also, we have a fleet of buses which run on contract apart from our own buses and as per agreement, we need to give some of their buses spaces to park. The PMPML has a plan for re-development of all depots which is expected to solve the problem,” the official added. Transport activists said there are buses out in the open since long and nothing much has been done about it. “ The PMPML is increasing its fleet size but not looking at the issue of parking space. If they plan meticulously, this can be sorted out,” PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/80-acres-in-hand-but-pmpml-buses-have-no-space-to-park/articleshow/86150792.cms||Joy Sengupta

Apart from unanimously re-electing Kejriwal as the national convener, senior leaders Pankaj Gupta and ND Gupta were named the national secretary and national treasurer, respectively. The office-bearers were elected for a tenure of five years. A resolution was passed in AAP’s national council meeting in January this year, extending the tenure for the posts of national convener and secretary from three years to five years. Another resolution was passed to amend the party’s constitution, allowing a person to hold a post for more than two consecutive terms. The party said in a statement that upon the proposal of Kejriwal’s name as the national convener, the executive unanimously agreed to it. The executive decided that Kejriwal stood for the party and its ideology even in the most unprecedented times and it would be the wisest decision to elect him for the third time consecutively, the statement said. The decision comes at a time when AAP is expanding its presence outside the national capital, where it has won the public’s mandate thrice with Kejriwal as the chief minister. The party is preparing to contest in assembly elections in states like Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, Gujarat etc., apart from the municipal elections in Delhi next year. On Saturday, AAP’s national council had elected the new national executive in a meeting, which was presided over by Kejriwal. In the meeting, 34 new national executive members were elected, including Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Satyendar Jain, Imran Hussain, Rajendra Pal Gautam, Raghav Chadha, Atishi, among others. The first meeting of AAP’s newly elected national executive was held on Sunday through videoconferencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-re-elected-as-aaps-national-convener-for-3rd-time/articleshow/86150801.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Second vaccination dose coverage exceeding first shots from September 7||CHANDIGARH: Over the last six days, daily second dose vaccination has been increasing in the city. From September 7, daily second doses have exceeded first shots against Covid. Till date, 12,10,132 doses have been given, of which 8,51,003 were first doses and 3,59,129 were second doses. The vaccination drive started in the city on January 16. UT administration has been claiming 100% first dose coverage before any state or UT. However, Government of India has not accepted the data till date. “The UT is not even placed in the state/UT list of more than 85% coverage yet,” said an official in the UT health department. Demand for the second dose increased from last month as the dosing gap was increased from four and six weeks to 12 and 16 weeks in mid-May. “After most people completed their first dose, they fulfilled the criteria of enhanced dose gap in August,” said an official in the UT health department. Second dose coverage will take another three months or so but questions are raised by the fact that studies from several countries have observed waning of antibodies after complete immunisation. “These countries are proposing a booster shot, which is not affordable in developing countries like ours. Therefore, the sooner we achieve complete immunisation, the easier it shall be to reduce the chain of transmission,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/second-vaccination-dose-coverage-exceeding-first-shots-from-sept-7/articleshow/86148876.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The case pertains to the death of former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankar at the Chhatrasal Stadium after he and his friends were allegedly assaulted by Kumar and others on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. Chief metropolitan magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba had on August 6 taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed against the accused based on the material available on record. The magistrate court committed the case as the offence of murder was exclusively triable by the sessions court, said Kumar’s lawyer. In the chargesheet filed against 12 people, police had alleged that the brawl at the stadium was a result of a conspiracy hatched by Kumar, who wanted to “re-establish his supremacy” among other wrestlers. Kumar had asked Sonu and Sagar to vacate the flat, which was in the name of his wife, after a few months, which they refused, the chargesheet alleged. It added that this act by Sonu and Sagar was allegedly taken by him as a challenge to his authority. It said, according to the postmortem report Sagar’s death was due to cerebral damage because of blunt force/object impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stadium-brawl-sessions-court-to-hear-case/articleshow/86181564.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Prisons in UP are no longer fun centres for criminals, says CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said, Uttar Pradesh jails were no longer fun centres for criminals and have been turned into reform homes for prisoners, while inaugurating and laying foundation of a slew of projects totalling Rs 650crore in the twin districts of Sant Kabir Nagar and Kushinagar. Inaugurating the Sant Kabir Nagar district prison, built at a cost of Rs 126crore, and laying foundation of 122 development projects worth Rs 245 crore in the district, he said, “There was a time when governments would be a slave of mafias, today bulldozers run on their houses.” Yogi also said, 90,000 vacancies in government departments would be advertised soon. “Earlier, jobs were auctioned or mortgaged. If anyone tries that today, we get their houses auctioned. Now, youths are getting jobs on merit,” he added Inaugurating and laying the foundation of Rs 400-crore projects in Kushinagar district, the CM said, the airport in the land of Buddha will be inaugurated by the Prime Minister soon with a first international flight. Stinging Samajwadi Party again with his ‘abba jaan’ rhetoric, he asked — Did you get uninterrupted power and regular ration during the ‘abba jaan’ and Behanji governments? While the crowds applauded, he said, the state was enveloped in darkness then. “There have been no hunger deaths in last four-and-half years. People wearing hawai chappals and sons of farmers will travel by air,” he said. Attacking the Congress government, he said, “Corruption, unemployment and mafia were dominant in its regime. The Modi Government gave development to 135 crore people and worked with the agenda of ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. Earlier speaking at Sant Kabir Nagar, he said, “It has been 24 years since the district came into existence, but there was no development. Only politically-motivated announcements were made, nothing rolled out on the ground due to corruption, casteism and nepotism. There has been a dramatic change in the last four-and-half years and the district is now moving on the development path,” said the CM. This is the land of Baba Tameshwarnath and great Sufi saint Sant Kabir ji. Three years ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi established Kabir Peeth in Maghar. Work is now in its last stage and will be ready for inauguration,” the CM said. “We effectively controlled Covid-19. Imagine what would have happened if the pandemic had struck in SP, BSP or Congress regimes, particularly with the virus still on rampage in Kerala, Maharashtra and Delhi,” said Yogi. The government is providing a monthly financial aid of Rs 4,000 to Covid orphans and is also helping women in distress,” the CM said. “Once upon a time, the area was known for utensils of Bakhira. We are going to develop a cluster to boost this industry so that Bakhira utensils get global recognition,” Yogi said. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reiterated that youths, preparing for various competitions, will get a ‘competitive examination allowance’ and tablets with digital access. He also presented tailoring toolkits to five women under Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana at the function. “Once Khalilabad in this district used to be a big centre of handlooms. In such a situation, why can't it become a hub of readymade garments? If we link women with the market by giving them modern sewing machines, every house will start making readymade garments. In such a situation, we can even beat Bangladesh and Vietnam in production of readymade garments,” Yogi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-stings-sp-again-with-abba-jaan-remark-says-up-prisons-no-more-fun-centres-for-criminals/articleshow/86152810.cms||Arjumand Bano

---||Chandigarh||Mohali MC to spruce up parks, green belts under new policy||MOHALI: Mohali Municipal Corporation is all set to adopt a policy for maintenance of parks, green belts, center verges and chowks in the city. The government of Punjab has notified the policy for maintenance and upkeep of parks within municipal limits. The agenda for the adoption of the policy will be brought in the upcoming MC house meeting scheduled for Tuesday. The various aspects considered under this policy are maintenance of triangles, central strips, chowks for horticulture works like plantation, de-weeding and watering. Mohali MC may invite offers from registered companies for maintenance of triangles, central strips and chowks under its jurisdiction. Interested companies may take these up under their corporate social responsibility programme. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “The triangles, central strips and chowks are part of the overall city plan. Much of the work related to maintenance arises due to shortcomings in public behaviour such as littering of serviceable areas and lack of a mechanism for citizen participation. Therefore, it is desired that efforts be made to make the proposed triangles, central strips and chowks self sustained to provide a better environment to citizens through effective operation and maintenance.” Garg said that plantation of trees, plants and shrubs in designated triangles, central strips and chowks as well as their upkeep and maintenance would contribute to the aesthetic value of public space in the city and also promote citizens’ health. Under CSR, the company will have to water plants and trees regularly and conduct landscaping at intervals. Clearing of weeds, litter, unwanted plants, thorny bushes, lawn caring and trimming of plants and trees to desired shape and size are some of the other responsibilities involved. Application of pesticides, fertilisers as may also be required. Maintenance work shall be carried out by the company at its own cost. Mohali MC commissioner will be the nodal official for all purposes. This policy is applicable only for horticultural works. The MC will not give any payment, manpower and machinery to the said company for maintenance purposes. The company shall not utilise or permit to utilise triangles/central strips/chowks belonging to the MC for any purpose other than its maintenance as a green area. The company shall ensure that no encroachment is made in the triangles, central strips and chowks. Ownership control, possession and supervision of the triangles, central strips and chowks shall remain with the MC and the company will only have the right to display its name on a small board not more that 3'x1'6" in size on road side triangles and center strips as approved by the commissioner or officer empowered by him and on his behalf. Green belts become parking lots No lessons have been learnt from incidents like murder of a Mohali-based lawyer over the issue of parking. Years have passed but the MC has failed to provide proper parking spaces to residents. The result is rampant use of parks and green belts as parking lots in the city. Lack of space and absence of proper inspection by authorities has encouraged the use of parks as parking lots. Two years ago, the then MC commissioner ordered challaning of all vehicles parked on the streets outside houses or in markets, which were found to be obstructing the right of way of essential services like ambulances and fire brigade but very less has been done to check encroachment of public land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-to-spruce-up-parks-green-belts-under-new-policy/articleshow/86148902.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lokayukta orders illegal office razed, minister Anil Parab claims it’s not his||MUMBAI: The Lokayukta has ordered the demolition of an illegal office that had allegedly been in use by transport minister Anil Parab on an open space in a Mhada colony in Bandra (East). The order states that Parab in a letter to Mhada had said that neither the land nor the structure belonged to him and the allegations were made to defame him. In October, BJP politician Kirit Somaiya had accused Parab of illegal construction and in March filed a complaint with the Lokayukta. He had approached the Lokayukta after Mhada allegedly failed to act on his complaint. He had also filed a complaint with the Nirmal Nagar police station. “There is enough evidence, including press conferences conducted by Parab in that office, to show the structure belonged to him. He has disowned the structure but we shall ensure he is punished for erecting the illegal structure,” Somaiya said on Sunday. Following Somaiya’s complaint, the Lokayukta had directed the government to file a report on the alleged illegal construction. A hearing was conducted via video-conferencing on September 2 with Somaiya, principal secretary (housing) Milind Mhaiskar, Mhada vice-president Anil Diggikar and Mhada chief officer Yogesh Mhase present. In his complaint, Somaiya had pointed out that several illegal constructions had come up on the vacant land between Mhada buildings 57 and 58. Mhada had issued notices for demolition in 2019 and issued a notice to Parab, who was then a member of the legislative council, for unauthorised construction. After Parab’s letter, Mhada had withdrawn the notice to him. “I had informed Mhada that the land does not belong to me, and neither does the structure. Mhada has replied to me saying that the notice was issued to me by mistake,” Parab said on Sunday. In the hearing, Mhaiskar submitted that on account of a high court stay on demolitions in view of the rains and Covid, the structure could not be razed. The stay, which was till August 13, has now been extended till September 30. Diggikar informed Lokayukta Justice V M Kanade that all the structures would be demolished once the stay granted by the high court was vacated. The Lokayukta order said it had accepted the statements made by the officer and directed that the unauthorised structures be demolished after the high court vacated the stay. “Compliance report shall be submitted to this office within a month after the structure is demolished,” the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lokayukta-orders-illegal-office-razed-parab-claims-its-not-his/articleshow/86153712.cms||Clara Lewis

Police said the incident took place on the Mayur Vihar flyover and a case has been registered. The victim Pankaj Yadav, who lives in the Chawri Bazar, was going back home from Noida on Friday along with a friend in his car. “Around 10pm when I reached Mayur Vihar flyover, a motorcycle came out of nowhere and tried to stop my car,” Yadav said. As soon as Yadav stopped to inquire about the matter, he and his friend were pulled out of the vehicle by the men on the motorcycle. More men joined them, and around 8-10 people started beating them up. “The men claimed that I hit their friend’s bike, but it was a lie. I took out my phone to call the police, but they snatched it along with my wallet,” Yadav told police. “They took my car’s keys and made me and my friend sit at the back. They then took us to an isolated residential colony and searched our belongings,” the victim said. The robbers allegedly stole Rs 37,000 from them and thrashed Yadav to force him to transfer them more money to them in online mode. “I repeatedly entered wrong UPI password due to which they became frustrated and broke my car windshield, snatched my smartwatch and slapped us again,” he added. One of the robbers turned off their phones and threw them in the back of the car. However, Yadav and his friend managed to flee from the robbers and managed to make a PCR call. “We were very horrified, panicked and shaking out of fear and anger but couldn’t do anything,” he said. A senior officer from the East district said they had registered a case, and further investigation was going on. “We are scanning the CCTV footage of the area,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-men-beat-up-bizman-and-friend-on-mayur-vihar-flyover-rob-them/articleshow/86150834.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Coimbatore||Where bins pose big threat to commuters||Coimbatore: Dumper bins, if used properly, could keep a city clean and tidy. However, the city is a perfect example for how the bins, if used improperly, could create traffic bottlenecks and inconvenience both the motorists and pedestrians alike. And the city corporation doesn’t seem to be concerned about the same.Ideally, the dumper bins have to be placed on the roadside. But on many streets in the city, they are placed on the carriageway, posing a threat to the motorists. At some places, corporation sanitary workers do not seem to care to place the bins properly after emptying them. In some cases, they place the bins on the carriageway with their sharp edges facing the commuters.The improper placing of bins is not only causing threat to motorists, but also creating traffic bottlenecks. Residents say the bins often occupy the carriageway, even though there is adequate space on the side of the road to place the same.P Ariaravelan, a commuter, says a bin is often placed on the carriageway of the main road connecting Avarampalayam and Ganapathi. “Vehicles have to move carefully to avoid the bin. There is enough space on the roadside. If the surface there is uneven to place the bin, it could be flattened to place them. Instead, the bin is kept on the road, obstructing vehicular movement. The situation is the same on many stretches in the city.”Ayisha Begam, a resident of Gandhima Nagar, too says the bins are placed on many stretches without caring for the safety of road users. “If the bins are kept lengthwise alongside the road, they will occupy only less space. But even simple things are not being followed.” K Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, says as per the Indian Road Congress norms, bins should be kept some distance away from the carriageway. “There might be space constraints, but that isn’t a reason to place the bins on the carriageway. Regular commuters of a stretch might know the placement of bins and be careful to avoid them. However, those new to the area might end up hitting them. None of the bins have reflective stickers to avert such incidents as well.”When contacted, a city corporation official said all sanitary workers would be instructed not to place the dumber bins on the carriageway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/where-bins-pose-big-threat-to-commuters/articleshow/86150817.cms||V Devanathan
---||Coimbatore||Overflowing bins raise a stink||Coimbatore: Garbage overflowing from dumper bins is a common sight on many stretches in the city. According to the residents, this reflects the city corporation’s failure to strictly implement the door-to-door garbage collection. The garbage littered on the road is not only an eyesore, but also poses health risk to the people living nearby.The residents say the sanitary workers often turn up to collect waste in many places only twice a week. In the absence of daily collection of waste, they say they are left with no option but to dump the same in nearby bins.S Amsavalli, a resident of KRG Nagar at Ganapathy, told TOI that in her area waste collection takes place only two times a week. “While a few residents accumulate the household waste till the sanitary workers turn up, others dump it in bins, which start overflowing within hours after emptying them, as they are not sufficient to hold the waste generated from the area.”G Mohan, a resident of Shoba Nagar near Avarampalayam, says the situation isn’t any different in his locality, where people dump waste on the roadside. “There is only one bin in our area. People are hence forced to dump waste along the roadside, inviting stray dogs. The sight of dogs fighting with each other for food often scares the residents.”The residents have called on the city corporation to ensure daily collection of waste at their doorsteps. “There is no uniform timing for the door-to-door collection. This should change to ensure we are home when the sanitary workers turn up to collect the waste,” one of the residents said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/overflowing-bins-raise-a-stink/articleshow/86150849.cms||---

It is an attempt to inculcate the habit of segregating waste among the residents. Green compartment is meant for biodegradable and wet waste, yellow for recyclable waste like papers and glass, and blue for non-biodegradable waste.”The source said they wanted the dustbins to be different from the ones placed in other parts of the city as it was a model road. “The move has evoked positive responses from people.”P Paneerselvam, a resident, said he had seen the dustbins on the pedestrian pathway a few days ago and mistook them for cupboards for sale. “The corporation hadn’t installed them then. I checked one of them and found separate compartments. Only then I realized it was a dustbin.”Residents have urged the civic body to ensure that people do not litter the street. “Many people just throw waste on the road. The distinct look of the stretch would be spoiled if people are allowed to litter. Hence, the civic body should not stop its efforts by just placing the bins on the stretch,” one of the residents said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/db-road-gets-swanky-dustbins/articleshow/86150860.cms||V Devanathan

Police have registered a case and claimed that the incident was a gang war. Police said they received information from DDU Hospital that around 10pm on Saturday an undertrial prisoner, Sumit Dutt, lodged in ward number 2 of central jail 3 was admitted there. “The doctor informed us that Dutt had suffered stab injuries and was fit for giving a statement,” said an officer. Dutt told police that he was assaulted with sharp weapons by other inmates identified as Brijesh alias Kalu and Bilauta. “He received injuries on his thigh, abdomen and over the ribs. He was referred to Safdarjung Hospital,” said the officer. Brijesh also received a stab injury on his thigh and was referred to Safdarjung Hospital. “Legal action has been taken in the matter and a case under IPC sections 307, 324 and 34 has been registered,” the cop said. According to a senior police officer, both the injured were members of different gangs. “During investigation, we found that it was a conflict between two gang members inside the prison. The reason behind the clash was dominance inside the jail,” he added. Investigators said Brijesh was involved in 14 cases, including murder, robbery, snatching and under Arms Act. Dutt was also involved in 14 criminal cases. A Tihar official said, “Brijesh was lodged in the jail since 2002 and Dutt since 2011.” This was not the first time that such an incident was reported from Tihar. In August, a 29-year-old gangster, Ankit Gujjar, was killed inside his cell. A deputy superintendent of Tihar Jail number 3 was booked for his murder.

---||Coimbatore||Plea to increase seats for vocational students in constituent colleges||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu Agricultural Graduate Teachers’ Association has urged the state government to increase the number of seats reserved for students of vocational stream in affiliated colleges of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU).While only 5% of seats are allocated for these students in constituent colleges of TNAU, the association asked the government to extend the reservation to private agriculture colleges under TNAU, where students from vocational streams are not eligible to join. There are over 300 government schools and a few private and aided schools across the state that offer vocational streams with Agriculture Science as the main subject. Graduates in agriculture and horticulture programmes are recruited as teachers in these schools. Candidates who passed Class XII under vocational stream and studied Biology, Agricultural Science – theory, agricultural science – practical and Computer Technology as vocational subjects are eligible to apply for BSc (Hons.) Agriculture, BSc (Hons.) Horticulture, BSc (Hons.) Forestry and BTech (Agricultural Engineering). “While these programmes are offered by constituent colleges under TNAU, only 5% of seats are reserved for students from the vocational stream. Rest of the seats are filled with students in the science stream,” said M Madhavan, president of the association. “While these students are studying Agriculture Science as their subject, they should be deemed eligible to be enrolled in these programmes.”A senior TNAU official said the 5% reservation is in vogue from 1984 based on a government order. “Private colleges are unwilling to enrol students from the vocational stream as students who have got less marks in Class X are enrolled in the vocational stream in Class XI. Since they are considered academically weak, they find it hard to cope with the curriculum, which is why private colleges are hesitant to admit such students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/plea-to-increase-seats-for-vocational-students-in-constituent-colleges/articleshow/86150875.cms||---

The water quality report has been shared with 16 water body agencies, which are preparing an action plan for improving the health of wetlands. The DPCC report is based on the water samples collected from wetlands last year for a baseline survey and a new survey will be done to compare the readings. According to the report, some prominent wetlands failed to meet the standard parameters. The dissolved oxygen standard for a wetland is 4 mg/l or more, while the level of free ammonia should be 1.2mg/l. The report revealed that Bhalswa lake could not meet the required criteria as the level of dissolved oxygen was found to be at 2.1 mg/l. Similarly, Hauz Khas wetland (district park) met the dissolved oxygen criteria but failed to free ammonia level. It recorded ammonia of 3.8 mg/l. The report stated that there are 13 wetlands named Asola in South district and of these, eight failed to fulfill the required standard of ammonia. The Wetland Authority of Delhi has listed 1,040 wetlands and has allotted unique identification numbers to them. Of these, action plans for conservation of wetlands have been prepared for around 600 wetlands. “We have shared the water quality report with all agencies that maintain the wetlands. The action plans are being made on how they will improve the water quality. Efforts will be taken to improve the health of wetlands,” said a DPCC official. The official added, “We are conducting another survey of wetlands to compare it with the findings of the baseline survey to check if there is any improvement in the water quality. On the basis of the report, the wetlands will be prioritised and necessary action taken.” TOI had earlier reported that Delhi currently does not have a single notified waterbody. An official said the wetland authority would send recommendations to the state government for notification of waterbodies by March 2022 and the final notification process is expected to be completed by June next year. When a wetland is notified under Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, it gets legal protection and activities like dumping of waste, discharge of untreated effluents and encroachment will be prohibited in it, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/245-wetlands-in-delhi-dont-pass-water-test-dpcc/articleshow/86150957.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Delhi||Heroin unit busted in Delhi, drugs worth Rs 30 crore seized||NEW DELHI: A heroin processing unit was unearthed in west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar and contraband worth Rs 30 crore was seized by Delhi Police’s Special Cell. Two traffickers were arrested and raids were on to nab other members of the syndicate. DCP Pramod Singh Kushwaha said the seizures included 5.6kg heroin, 1kg phenobarbital and 10kg of other controlled substances. “Grinding and mixing equipment, utensils and other incriminating material used in processing and packing of heroin have been seized. A Swift car and scooty used in transporting drugs were also seized,” he added. The arrested men are Babu Lal alias Bablu (41) from Karala and Chigozie Foster Okafor alias David, a Nigerian currently residing in C-Block in Om Vihar in Uttam Nagar. The processing unit was allegedly functioning out of this rented accommodation. “After getting a tip-off, a team led by ACP Attar Singh and inspector Ishwar Singh busted the gang,” said Kushwaha. On September 8, police came to know that Babu Lal would come to a cremation ground in Mangolpuri late in the evening to deliver heroin to a contact. He was apprehended when he arrived in a Swift car. The search of his bag led to the seizure of 4kg heroin. A case under NDPS Act was registered and Babu Lal was interrogated. He revealed that he received the consignment from Chigozie after which the Nigerian was nabbed on September 10 from near a Delhi Metro pillar in Uttam Nagar with 1kg of heroin. Subsequently, a raid was conducted at his rented house, which led to the busting of the processing unit. During interrogation, Chigozie revealed that Babu Lal procured crude heroin or opium from various sources after which he processed it into pure/saleable heroin. “The crude contraband was treated with acetic anhydride for synthesis and left for 12 hours. The mixture was then heated with sodium carbonate and treated with other chemicals. The solid powder was extracted after drying and phenobarbital was added to it to enhance intoxication,” said a senior police officer. The investigation revealed that they were members of an international narcotics drug syndicate. “The module not only supplied drugs to small traffickers in Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, but also sent heroin to countries like UK, Sri Lanka, UAE, Nepal, Bangladesh and South Africa from Delhi through courier companies by using fake IDs,” Kushwaha said. Chigozie arrived in India in July 2019 on a six-month business visa. After expiry of his visa, he did not return to his country. He was initially associated with a fellow Nigerian in drug trafficking. After working with him for about six months, Chigozie developed his own network and began to operate independently. His passport showed visits to Nepal and UAE and its details were being verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-30cr-drugs-seized-as-cops-find-processing-unit-2-held/articleshow/86150930.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Bhupendra Patel's mission is to reverse setbacks suffered by BJP in 2017||By choosing Bhupendra Patel, a Kadva Patidar, for the post of Gujarat chief minister, the BJP high-command once again acknowledged the importance of this politically influential community. Patidars make up for nearly 13% of voters in Gujarat. With assembly elections 15 months away, Patel has a colossal task to reverse the setbacks suffered by the BJP in the 2017 polls, when it lost some 13 seats to Congress in its own bastion Saurashtra. Later, the saffron party did recover some losses, but it was mainly due to some senior Congress leaders like Kunwarji Bavaliya and Jawahar Chavda, crossing the aisle to grab ministerial berths in the Rupani government. Bhupendra PatelThe BJP regained significant electoral ground in the local body polls last year by winning all 31 district panchayats, nearly 180 of 260 taluka panchayats and all municipal corporations.  BJP leader received blessings from Deepak Desai, spiritual leader of Dada Bhagwan FoundationBhupendra Patel, the 59-year-old rookie politician, is said to be a moderate Patidar face. In contrast, outgoing deputy CM Nitin Patel who had bargained for the finance portfolio after two days of sulking in 2018, is considered inflexible over many issues. Bhupendra, who is on the board of some key community institutions like Sardar Dham and Vishwa Umiya Foundation, and others has decent acceptance among the Kadva Patidars, who have a huge population in north Gujarat and Ahmedabad. Besides Patidars, Bhupendra is closely associated with Dada Bhagwan Foundation, a spiritual organization, which has a large number of followers in Gujarat. In fact, he is fondly called ‘Dada’ by his supporters The former AUDA chairman’s selection also points to BJP’s discomfiture after Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) stellar show in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) elections earlier this year. AAP workers have also started an aggressive groundwork in north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Naresh Patel, president of Khodaldham Temple Trust, the influential Leuva Patel religious organization, had been vocal for a Patidar as a CM after Rupani’s departure. In fact, interacting with reporters in June, he had been critical of the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 situation while praising AAP’s Delhi government. He could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Ramesh Tilala, trustee of Khodaldham Trust, told TOI: "It’s a matter of pride that Gujarat has got a Patidar CM. However, we are a religious and a social organization which considers all communities equal. We hoist the national flag at our temple and devotees from all castes come to seek blessings of Maa Khodal." Recently, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, a Leuva strongman, had tried to assuage the community’s sentiments and described the relationship between Patidars and BJP like that of "an umbilical cord and navel." In Bhupendra’s elevation, the BJP has also sought to neutralize the potential impact of Hardik Patel, the feisty Patidar quota stir leader, who joined Congress and became its working president. The young Kadva Patel leader still has a significant following among the community youth and the BJP can ill afford to oversee the possibilities of him swaying votes in Congress favour in 2022. T G Jhalawadia, vice-president, Sardardham, said, "Bhupendrabhai has worked a lot for Sardardham and Vishwa Umiya Foundation and has made immense contribution to the community’s welfare. But he is a man of all communities, who believes in doing good for all people of Gujarat. So, he must not be seen as the leader of a particular community. He is a man of integrity and absolute honesty."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bhupendra-patels-mission-is-to-reverse-setbacks-suffered-by-bjp-in-2017/articleshow/86152944.cms||---
---||Nagpur||End over-exploitation of nature, wildlife trade to stop pandemics, G20 told||Nagpur: Ahead of the G20 Summit in Italy, global wildlife experts and change leaders have appealed to the G20 nations to acknowledge that the root causes of pandemics are over-exploitation of nature, including commercial trade of wild animals, and the conversion of wild habitat for commercial use – factors that also drive biodiversity loss and climate change. “As the world continues to reel from the harmful impact of Covid-19, it is imperative that our leaders urgently find ways to prevent new devastating zoonotic outbreaks,” said Andrey Kushlin, honorary member, Global Tiger Forum (GTF), and co-founder & co-chair, EndPandemics. The G20 will culminate in the Leaders’ Summit, which will be held in Rome on October 30 and 31. In an appeal, G20 leaders have been urged to reduce the risk of new pandemics by addressing their root causes, and three steps to global recovery and regeneration. Global experts and change leaders convened a Roundtable1 on September 2, 2021, co-hosted by the Vatican Covid-19 Commission, EndPandemics, and United for Regeneration to discuss specific recommendations that G20 leaders can take up at their summit in Rome next month. Steven R Galster, Roundtable1 co-chair, and Walter Link said, “These discussions were built on earlier expert proceedings, including the recently published roadmap to end pandemics, the Wildlife Conservation (WC20) declaration, and other reports, and were summarized by the roundtable co-chairs.” The Roundtable1 urged the G20 to acknowledge that Covid-19 has inflicted more acute harm to the planet than any terrorist act or natural disaster in the last 100 years, representing the greatest current threat to national and international security. The global experts urged to acknowledge that the annual cost of preventing pandemics is less than 1% of the cost of recovering from Covid-19. “All of these threats can be mitigated by investing in nature-based solutions and green recovery that also positively impact local communities,” they said. The G20 and other nations have already committed to environmental targets that, if implemented, will mitigate the risk of pandemic recurrence. The co-chairs of this Roundtable recommended a three-pronged strategy which includes preventing the risk of pandemics from the trade in wild animals; prevent the risk of pandemics caused by destructive land-use practices; and establish planetary health defence funding mechanism. “These three sets of actions enabled by a finance mechanism can save the global community trillions of dollars,” says Kushlin. WILDLIFE EXPERTS AGENDA FOR G20 * Create independent panel to determine legal options to end trade in wild animals including wildlife farming * Pause international and domestic trade in wild animals until independent panel concludes * Institutionalize campaigns to reduce commercial demand for wild animals * Adopt and implement 30x30 target of UN Biodiversity Convention’s post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure at least 30% globally of land areas and of sea areas are conserved by 2030 * Support UN Food Systems Summit 2021 recommendations for a sustainable food future, which includes increasing food production without expanding agricultural land; protect and restore natural ecosystems and limit agricultural encroachment and land-shifting * Incentivize regenerative agriculture practices because they strengthen biodiversity and mitigate risk of zoonotic outbreaks * Reduce and convert a portion of industrial agriculture subsidies to investments in regenerative agriculture, saving significant money, and mitigating pandemic risk * Mandate that any pandemic recovery and preparedness program shall include targeted funding for context-specific pandemic prevention solutions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/end-over-exploitation-of-nature-wildlife-trade-to-stop-pandemics-g20-told/articleshow/86150716.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

August recorded an increase of nearly 42% in passenger traffic compared to July (see box). “Airlines starting new flights to cities such as Ranchi, Tirupati, Thiruvananthapuram, and flights for Jaipur and Goa resuming has also helped. The new flights are witnessing almost full occupancy,” said an airport official. With weekends, however, seeing high passenger traffic, space constraints are unlikely to be resolved till the new terminal is ready. “Weekends in August recorded a high number of passengers and crowd control was a challenge, but we are managing,” said the official. According to another airport official, travelling on weekends seems to be a trend. August did not have major holidays but weekend passenger traffic increased. The new terminal building, which is expected to be commissioned by August next year, will solve issues related to crowd and parking, said the official. Even higher passenger traffic was recorded in the first week of September with the festive season starting. “There are regulations in place, the most common being the need for a negative RT-PCR negative or a vaccination certificate for both doses. However, that hasn’t stopped people from travelling,” said an airline source. Sources at the airport said the Indian Air Force has still not provided exact dates regarding the closure of the runway for re-carpeting. “We are expecting it to happen by late October or early November. The runway closure will affect traffic as well as airlines as the peak holiday season will have just begun,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/aug-sees-highest-number-of-flyers-at-pune-airport/articleshow/86150971.cms||Joy Sengupta

By 10pm on Sunday, about 2.5 lakh had already visited and nearly 10,000 were still waiting for a darshan of the 40ft Ganesh. As devotees surged at the two main entries from Khairatabad Metro station and Lakdi-Ka-Pul routes, Covid norms were lost in the sea of humanity. The minimum waiting time was about 1-2 hours. The queue started around 9am and continued to get bigger as the day progressed. About 20 volunteers and cops have the hard task of maintaining order. About 2.5 lakh visit #Khairatabad Pandal by 10pm on Sunday for a glimpse of the 40ft #Ganesha #GaneshaChaturthi… https://t.co/nIBWZMwces— TOI Hyderabad (@TOIHyderabad) 1631504565000The heavy crowd was most likely due to Sunday holiday and also because people were less afraid due to vaccination, said Raj Kumar, secretary of Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee. While last year celebrations were muted due to pandemic curbs, this year the rush has been massive, according to organisers. “Visiting the gigantic Khairatabad Ganpati is exciting. Every year I come with my family and take a framed photo of the idol back to our home We missed it last year due to Covid cases,” said Vishnu Vardhan, a grocer from Patancheru. A trip to the iconic Ganesh idol is also a priority for students. Sucharita, who attended NEET on Sunday afternoon, came to the pandal soon after with a wish for a good rank. “I believe that I have been securing good marks only because of Ganpati blessings,” she said. While another student, Vaishali, came along with her relatives for blessings to crack the exam for sub-inspector’s post. Not just from city, but many from districts and some from AP were in the queue. There were couples from Medak, Warangal and Nizamabad. “I got transferred to AP after bifurcation. But while here, I used to visit the pandal regularly every year,” said D Ramesh, a health staff from Eluru in AP.

---||Mumbai||Bldrs named in inquiry reports deny any role in trust land fraud||Navi Mumbai: Some of the people named in the deputy collector’s report of 2013 have denied their role in the trust land scam in Navi Mumbai. On January 10, 2014, the then Raigad collector had recommended to the Konkan divisional commissioner to file complaints against those named in the inquiry report, according to documents procured under the RTI by activist Rajeev Mishra. Over 2,700 acres in Panvel and Uran belonging to three trusts were shown to have individual ownership, allegedly by forging documents, and surrendered to Cidco in lieu of compensation and development rights over 12.5% of the plots. It was claimed that these trust plots were illegally released for commercial gains. Local builder Urmish Udani denied his role in the alleged scam. He told TOI, “The then Konkan commissioner had formed a committee to inquire into my role in the acquisition of land in 2011-12. I was not a party to it. Neither was I called for any clarification nor was I informed about the outcome of the report, which is highly biased and one sided.” “The inquiry report raised two main allegations against me; acquiring lands from Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust, Sri Swami Hatiramji Mutt trust and Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala Mumbai trust without the permission of charity commissioner and on the basis for fraudulent agreements,” he said, adding that “Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust is a family trust and no permission from the charity commissioner is required for land transactions. The Bombay high court had cleared it. Sri Swami Hatiramji Mutt trust land issue is sub judice.” An Uran court issued a succession certificate to Dosu Ardeshir Bhiwandiwala, being ‘only son’ of late Ardeshir Bhiwandiwala of Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala trust. “The land issue was inquired into and investigated by various departments since 2011, including economic offences wing-Navi Mumbai, Cidco, charity commissioner and the high court. Every inquiry/investigation cleared the land deals,” said Udani. “No such recommendation was made against me by the Raigad collector to the Konkan Divisional Commissioner on January 10, 2014,” claimed former talathi, Sanjay Sonawane. “I had written to the sub divisional officer, deputy collector (land acquisition) metro centre-1 and tehsildar of Panvel on November 14, 2020, to appoint a designated officer to file offences against those named in the two reports citing Navi Mumbai police commissioner’s letter dated September 2, 2020. No response was received,” said Ravindra Mathpati, deputy collector-Raigad, who was transferred in August 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bldrs-named-in-inquiry-reports-deny-any-role-in-trust-land-fraud/articleshow/86151167.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Chandigarh||Punjab University not ready for blended mode of education, committee formed||CHANDIGARH: Even as the University Grants Commission (UGC) has directed universities across the country to introduce blended mode (online and offline) for all courses, PU is not ready to take all courses online under the new system. University vice-chancellor Prof Rajkumar has constituted a committee of 17 members to implement the blended mode on the campus. Challenges were underlined in the very first committee meeting, with 50 out of 54 PU department representatives declaring that they didn’t have the infrastructure required to offer all courses in blended mode. Only departments like history, hotel management, Sanskrit and Vivekananda Studies of PU have agreed to the proposal. The UGC, in its 547th annual meeting on May 20, 2020, had decided to offer all courses at the university level in blended mode. Under the blended mode, 40% of the syllabus would be covered online and 60% would be covered offline. Most of the students associated with PU are from rural areas and the new system is not feasible for them. University authorities will take feedback on the issue from students and teachers soon. The high-power committee discussed all aspects of the UGC’s blended mode of studies in PU in detail and constituted a sub-committee of four members. It comprises Dr Rajat Sandhir, Prof S K Tomar, Dr Ashutosh and Dr Nandita. The committee will deliver a presentation on the blended mode before the high power committee within a month. According to PU professors, most departments do not have infrastructure required for online teaching. Due to budget constraints, it is not possible for PU to implement such blended mode in all departments at present. According to a committee member, a hasty decision could become a problem for the varsity later. There are about 75 departments, research centers and research chairs in PU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-not-ready-for-blended-mode-of-education-committee-formed/articleshow/86148971.cms||---

BMC is yet to begin work on a new wall. The families are still at the same spot where the retaining wall had crashed, killing neighbours doing heavy rain. TimesViewIt is appalling that over 70 families are still living at the spot in Malad where the retaining wall had crashed in 2019, killing neighbours amid falling rocks and streams of mud and water during heavy rain. Their dharna shows that the authorities have been turning a deaf ear to their problems. The government must direct the authorities, including BMC and forest department, to immediately rehabilitate the residents. Eligible residents must be given proper accommodation.While officials said 86 families were allotted flats at project-affected people (PAP) buildings in Mahul, 75 are still living in danger. “It is like a death trap and we live in fear. Only homes that were completely crushed or homes where people died were given new places in Mahul. There are still 75 families still living here. We don’t know when we will die. BMC and the government must provide us accommodation,” said Tejpratap Tripathi, who lives at Azad Nagar slum. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said he had urged BMC and forest department to move the remaining slum-dwellers to safer locations and rebuild the wall. “BMC’s hydraulic engineering department cleared a proposal to reconstruct the wall this week. But work is yet to begin. Residents must be shited to safer locations and the wall must be reconstructed,” Mishra said. Only when it rains heavily the families are moved to nearby Parekh Nagar municipal school. “They must be permanently rehabilitated in Malad itself, and not treated like cattle. Leader of Opposition Praveen Darekar has sought a meeting with all departments concerned,” Mishra said. Soon after the incident, then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi had appointed experts from non-government and social organisations to look into lapses. Portions of the wall that had begun to tilt were razed. Despite BMC spending Rs 21 crore to build the 2.3km long, 15-ft tall wall around its reservoir, it collapsed within two years of construction. In December 2019, the panel investigating the incident had not held anyone accountable. In its report, the nine-member technical investigation committee stated that heavy rainfall coupled with holes blocked by hutment dwellers resulted in the mishap. But the committee recommended that at Malad reservoir, on the upstream side of the storm water drain, the slope should be properly stabilized to avoid localised landslides. The topography of plots/properties owned by BMC shall be ascertained by the department concerned and, if required, slope stabilisation shall be carried out to avoid a mishap. According to forest department officials, 86 families were allotted flats in Mahul but eight eligible families could not be moved to Mahul due to high court orders barring new allotment of flats at Mahul for PAPs. Some allotted the flats refused to move to Mahul. The forest department had requested BMC to allot flats in other PAP buildings for the eight families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-yrs-later-70-families-hit-by-malad-wall-crash-yet-to-be-rehabilitated/articleshow/86152965.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The civic body has also issued notices to the owners of another 9,000 commercial and residential properties asking them to clear their property tax dues immediately from the date of receiving the notice. Pune accounts for a total 10.5 lakh properties of all types, including commercial, residential, among others. The tax paid by these properties forms a major source of revenue for the civic body. While the process for payment of property tax goes on throughout the year, the number of properties running up huge overdues also keeps changing. Civic officials pointed out that the 9,000 properties that have been served notices have run up dues worth Rs200 crore. “We are aiming at more recovery of dues, so this special drive has been initiated,” said Vilas Kanade, head of the PMC’s property department. PMC had introduced a special scheme for diligent tax payers, which helped in increasing the overall revenue of the tax department this year. The civic body has crossed the mark of Rs1,000 crore on Friday. It is nearly Rs 211 crore more than the corresponding period in the last financial year. This year, the income was Rs1,001.88 crore. PMC data showed that owners of 6,26,072 had paid the tax this year during the corresponding period (April 1 and August 27, 2021). According to PMC officals, the property tax was charged based on the annual ratable value of the property. The civic body gives two options for ths mode of tax payment, which includes offline as well as online. Octroi and local body tax were the main sources of income for PMC. But, after their abolition, property tax gives the highest revenue to the civic body. PMC earns around Rs1,400 crore to Rs1,600 crore per year via this tax, an official said. PMC officials said that the property department had decided to use the arbitration route to resolve the pending legal issues of property tax. The civic body has taken up 10 cases of property tax disputes that are in courts and they will be disposed off through arbitration. PMC hopes to generate Rs35 crore from this move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seals-10-properties-over-tax-overdues-issues-impounding-notices-to-9k-defaulters/articleshow/86151037.cms||---
---||Nagpur||City has authorized stands for just 8% of 22k autos||Nagpur: Even though over 22,000 autorickshaws are operating in the city, only 8% have authorized parking places within the corporation limits. As per information obtained from the traffic police and regional transport authority, there are 203 authorised autorickshaw stands across the city. They can accommodate only 1,826 autos for parking. Due to lack of parking for autorickshaws, the three-wheeler drivers are facing action from traffic police. Existing stands are insufficient. The drivers too are facing harassment from the authorities concerned. The traffic police are not allowing parking of more than 10 autorickshaws at one stand. Drivers are facing action from the traffic police if vehicles are stopped on roads. The claim of autorickshaw drivers too came true as TOI found that 10 zones of traffic police penalized 4,448 autorickshaws in the last eight months of this calendar year across the city police commissionerate limit for parking their three-wheelers in no-parking zones or on roads. Autorickshaw drivers said that most of their stands had been encroached by roadside hawkers. Recently, a delegation also submitted complaints to Nagpur city police. Convenor of Tiger Autorickshaw Sanghthana Vilas Bhalekar said most of the autorickshaw stands in the city have been occupied by roadside vendors. Despite complaints to traffic police, no measures have been initiated to free the stands. Citing an example, Bhalekar said that his autorickshaw union had made four complaints to the senior inspector (Cotton Market traffic zone) regarding encroachments at four autorickshaw stands, including Nanga Putla Chowk, Shahid Chowk (Itwari), Risaldar Akhada (Timki) and Teen Khamba Chowk (Timki). No action has been taken to free the encroached auto stands. “There is a need to make provision for stands to address this issue. The issue has been raised several times before the RTO but no efforts are seen to resolve this issue. We do not know when it will be addressed. Autorickshaw drivers are also demanding stands on the city’s outskirt areas like Besa, Godhni, Dabha, Sakkardara etc,” he said. However, citizens and motorists feel otherwise. According to them, auto-rickshaws park their vehicles haphazardly across the city and are adding to the traffic jam. Traffic jams can be seen at Variety Square, Rani Jhansi Square, near the Mor Bhavan bus stand and railway station. “Due to reckless driving and abrupt stoppages of these autos, several accidents takes place on a regular basis,” was the general opinion of motorists. Due to negligence of the police and poor implementation of law and order, these auto-rickshaw drivers hardly follow any rules and stop anywhere in the middle of the road to get a commuter. “Even many city bus shelters have been encroached upon by these three-wheeler drivers on several routes,” said Prashant Mane, a resident of Pardi. Due to the encroachment, city buses could not stop at designated shelters, causing traffic jam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-has-authorized-stands-for-just-8-of-22k-autos/articleshow/86142710.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This monsoon, the snake catching team of Panchkula municipal corporation (MC) caught over 37 snakes from across the district. These include the Ptyas Mucosa, Russell Viper and Cobra. For the first time, the team also caught a three feet long Common Indian Monitor Lizard. All the reptiles rescued from residential areas were released into the Morni forest area. The five-member snake catcher team of Panchkula MC said they caught over 37 snakes from Panchkula district alone in July and August. The snakes were caught after receiving information by local residents. The snake catchers’ team works in two shifts - morning and night - headed by Alfaz and Ali respectively. Ali, a 28-year-old expert in catching snakes, told TOI that they were working with the Panchkula MC to catch snakes and monkeys in the district. He said that snakes usually venture near humans in search of food. In the monsoon, snakes come out to eat frogs, rats, crickets and other insects and come in contact with humans while following their prey. Elaborating on the catch so far, Alfaz said his team caught 26 Ptyas Mucosa, three Cobras, eight Russel Vipers and one monitor lizard. Ptyas mucosa is a non-venomous snake and it likes to hide in dark places. Cobra and Russell Viper are venomous snakes and their bite can be fatal for humans. Alfaz said they also found a Common Indian Monitor Lizard over three feet long from a house. It was spotted by the house owner as it was hiding behind the washing machine. On the snake catching procedure, Ali admitted that it was both difficult and dangerous, with team members risking their lives every time. “As soon as we get a call, our team reaches the spot. We following due procedure while catching snakes and release them in the forest area of Morni, which is the right place for them to live.” The team members said most of the snakes were caught in trans-Ghaggar sectors, from near the mini-secretariat in Sector 1, Sports department in Sector 3, Amravati Enclave, Kalka and from near Raipur Rani. MC officials said snakes and other reptiles are part of the ecosystem and people should not kill snakes when they are spotted. Instead, they said, residents must inform the MC emergency number for snakes and a team would be sent immediately.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana Govt knocks HC door on PoP idols||HYDERABAD: With the high court (HC) banning immersion of Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) in Hussainsagar, the Telangana government on Sunday made an attempt to move a house motion, seeking permission to allow immersion of PoP idols in the water body this year. However, the court refused to entertain the motion and asked it to make the attempt on Monday instead. Animal husbandry and cinematography minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav has said by the time the high court delivered its decision on immersion of PoP idols, 35,000 Ganesh idols had already been installed at various locations in the city and it was not possible for the government to make alternative arrangements by constructing special ponds at such short time. Speaking to the media after having darshan of Khairatabad Ganesh on Sunday afternoon, the minister said: “We will request the high court to permit PoP idol immersion, keeping the sentiments of the people, for this year.” He said people have been celebrating all festivals with communal harmony and peacefully. “The government will assure the court that all PoP idols and debris in Hussainsagar will be removed within 48 hours of immersion. The government is committed to protect the environment and lakes,” Srinivas Yadav said. He said lakhs of people are likely to participate in the immersion procession across the city and all arrangements were being made for peaceful and safe immersion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-knocks-hc-door-on-pop-idols/articleshow/86151051.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Bhupendra Patel's civic stints won PM Narendra Modi’s praise||AHMEDABAD: He is fondly called ‘Dada’ by his peers and residents of Ghatlodia and Memnagar. In the seven years between 2010 and 2017 — five years as standing committee chairman Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and two years as AUDA chairman — Bhupendra Patel came to be known for his ability to pacify standoffs between the bureaucracy and the civic body’s elected wing. In 2010, soon after being elected as a councillor from Thaltej, he was elevated as AMC standing committee chairman. Back then, Ahmedabad was projected as the model for Gujarat’s progress by the then CM Narendra Modi. This was based on the implementation of Rs 2,700 crore worth of Jnnurm projects, Rs 1,100-crore BRTS project, the two phases of Rs 1,200-crore Sabarmati riverfront and social housing for weaker sections and last, but not the least, Ahmedabad’s entry into the Unesco’s tentative list of world heritage cities in 2011. "I remember him as an excellent negotiator between executive and elected wings of the AMC. He brought to the table a practical approach to dealing with people, budgets, and policy-making. It was a privilege working with him," says former municipal commissioner and Lokpal member I P Gautam. This led the BJP to continue with him as AMC chairman for four consecutive terms — the first in the history of AMC. His negotiating mettle was tested when development works in the newly acquired areas of new west zone — Prahladnagar, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Gota, Ghatlodia, Sarkhej, Sola and Jodhpur — were undertaken especially while new roads and drainage lines were being laid. In 2012, Patel won the then CM Narendra Modi’s appreciation when he suggested three consecutive impact fee cuts to popularise the building regularising scheme. "He was also the force behind enrolling several societies under PPP scheme for concretising private society roads and reparing street lights," says AMC councillor and water supply committee chairman Jatin Patel. Between 2015 and 2017 as AUDA chairman, Bhupendra Patel was pivotal in pushing forward several infrastructure projects, which includes flyovers, roads in Sanand and Bopal as well as infrastructure projects which helped BJP in the 2017 elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civic-stints-won-modis-praise/articleshow/86153013.cms||---
---||Pune||312 vishing call complaints reported this year in Pune||PUNE: As work from home, online deals and transactions take a deeper root in the pandemic-driven system, the number of vishing and calls by dubious callers has gone up significantly in the city. The Pune cyber police have recorded 312 complaint applications this year, so far, relating to such calls as against the 54 complaints they had received in 2020. Vishing is often described as a verbal form of phishing attack, which the criminals resort to online. The criminals verbally trick people into doing things they believe are in their best interests. “People are at home and spending more time on their computers and laptops, browsing e-commerce, business, insurance, dating and friendship websites, among others. Often people end up filling up online forms and then they start receiving unwanted calls from people posing as representatives of firms or call centres,” Pune cyber police inspector D S Hake said. “Some of these calls involve elements of cyberstalking or harassment while some others are intended at cheating the victim of money,”he said. The officer said that most often, the callers use servers, which are based abroad, to route their calls to the victim to ensure that they are not traced easily. In some cases, the callers use their personal phones. The police usually act on the complaints to trace the callers and act against them in cases where criminality is involved, he said. “The suspects usually claim to be representatives of companies, insurance firms, NGOs or government offices and tell their victims to pay for insurance or some business partnerships or to pay for some lucky draw to get a free tour or vacation at a foreign destination,” Hake said. “Some pretend to be NGOs and ask for donations. In majority cases, the suspects use services of the internet calls which, were routed from many servers located in the different countries,” Hake added. “It is very difficult to trace the callers, who routed calls from different servers to reach the complainants,” he added. “Though none of those who filed their complaint applications any faced financial losses, but these calls have taken away their peace of mind,” he said, adding, “But the primary intention of the callers is to get some money from the victims.” He said that most victims of such irritating or vishing calls are business persons from Pune city. “They click on several business websites to explore new avenues of the business or partnerships, but they end up sharing their phone numbers and other details with the fraudsters. They then receive calls from the suspects,” he said. “The suspects have either hurled abuses at the victims or have issued threats to the victims after they refused to pay them money,”the officer added. “Secondly, women and girls have received irritating calls from unknown phone numbers. The suspects obtained their phone numbers and other details on dating or friendship websites and make vulgar calls to them. We have identified some of these callers, who are from different parts of India,” he said. “Some of the victims have even blocked the suspicious numbers on their cellphones, but the suspects are calling them from the different phone numbers,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/312-vishing-call-complaints-reported-this-year-in-pune/articleshow/86151092.cms||---

In his complaint, Shadab said the father-son duo approached his father Shabbir in 2014, seeking a financial aid of Rs 50 lakh and agreed to keep their flat at Kamal Vishranti at TPS 3 in Bandra as security with an additional interest of 21% as profit on the borrowed sum. Shadab, however, got suspicious when they failed to repay the promised amount and asked the Narangs to transfer the flat kept as security in his name. But the duo said that the title of the flat was not clear and hence it cannot be transferred. Later, Shadab learnt that the flat too was already mortgaged with Tata Finance. He then approached the police. Speaking to TOI, Amit Narang said, “Shadab has managed to lodge a false case against us and we are challenging the said FIR in the court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khar-based-bldr-booked-for-cheating-dubai-bizman/articleshow/86153037.cms||Ahmed Ali

That’s what former bank employee Pabsetty Shekhar has built over 49 years of collecting Ganesh idols of all sizes from various continents, of all types of materials and with no two idols being similar. Even the pandemic didn’t stop his drive, with an 11-member Ganesh cricket squad from Kolkata walking into his museum recently. “My entire two-floor house is an exclusive museum dedicated to a rare collection of Ganpati idols,” said Shekhar who lives in West Marredpally. A Guinness World Records and Limca Book Of Records already under his belt, Shekhar is still chasing an ideal goal — 1 lakh idols. From about half inch to 12ft, the idols have been sourced from the U S, UK, Germany, Belgium, Turkey, Japan, China, Malaysia, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Korea, Borneo islands, Singapore, Indonesia, Tibet, Cambodia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Mongolia and Iran. The idols are made of gold, silver, bronze, brass, aluminium, precious stones and PoP. “The central attraction is the five-trunk brass idol I got it done from Bastar,” he said. A book and temple is on the cards too. “My book ‘Vishwa Vinayaka’ on Ganpati temples across the world will be out soon and royalty from it will be spent on charity. A ‘Panch Mukha Ganesh Temple’ is also being planned in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ganesh-of-all-shapes-sizeslord-over-this-house-in-city/articleshow/86151082.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad, Bengaluru push south India to top spot in office market||HYDERABAD: South India walked away with the lion’s share of office space leasing in 2020-21 -- led by Hyderabad and Bengaluru – with 66% of the net absorption coming its way. In comparison, the west (Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune) and the north (National Capital Region) managed to capture only 21% and 11% of the market, respectively, shows Anarock Property Consultants’ latest report, released on Sunday. While Bengaluru sealed at least 3.2 million square feet (sft)-worth of major deals, Hyderabad’s prominent office transactions stood at 2.3 million sft – both in Gachibowli – during this period. Together with Chennai, the southern region absorbed about 14.06 million sft of office space (small and bid deals included) in the financial year 2020-21, about three times that of MMR and Pune’s 4.5 million sft. NCR’s share was a mere 2.3 million sft. Reason for this demand: Robust growth of the IT/ITeS sector, affordable rentals and the startup boom in southern cities, states the report. “That apart, the manufacturing and industrial sectors are also driving demand here,” added Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Group. Given the rush of multinationals and local enterprises, it is no surprise that the region leads in new office supply too with Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai collectively comprising 63% of the national pie in 2020-21. In 2017-18, this share stood at only 40%, the report adds. Industry insiders say that investor-friendly policies of the state government, coupled with competitive rentals also play a key role in pushing Hyderabad to the top of the charts, along with Bengaluru. In fact, it offers the lowest leasing rates among most metros – at Rs 57 (average) per sft. In other big cities, the same ranges between Rs 60 and Rs 125 per sft. “The availability of grade A offices in these cities, particularly Hyderabad that has a pipeline of at least 20 to 30 million sft of high-end space coming up in the next two years, is also a factor working in its favour,” said an independent realty consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-bluru-push-south-india-to-top-spot-in-office-market/articleshow/86151101.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Interestingly, only 30 complaints have been received so far in 2021-22. According to a reply dated September 8, 2021, given by the Lokpal of India to an RTI query filed by Kerala-based RTI activist Govindan Nampoothiry, Lokpal’s total expenditure fell from Rs 16.40 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 13.57 crore in 2020-21. The expenditure by Lokpal’s office on salaries grew from around Rs 2.94 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 4.76 crore in 2020-21, on wages from Rs 4.07 lakh to Rs 9 lakh, on medical treatment from Rs 6.77 lakh to Rs 12.43 lakh and on professional services from Rs 12.45 lakh to Rs 33.17 lakh. As on August 21, 2021, two dozen officers and staff are working in the Lokpal of India. Domestic travel expenses of Lokpal, meanwhile, fell from Rs 8.53 lakh in 2019-20 to just Rs 36,002 in 2020-21, possibly on account of Covid lockdown and curbs announced in March 2020. Office expenses were slightly lower from Rs 5.26 crore to Rs 5.03 crore, though it was not clear how long the staff worked from home amid Covid restrictions. Expenditure by the Lokpal of India on rent, rates and taxes was sharply down from Rs 6.30 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 2.84 crore in 2020-21. Other administrative expenses too fell from Rs 7.19 lakh to Rs 6.42 lakh in the corresponding period, as did expenditure on minor work which dipped from Rs 1.51 crore to Rs 33.3 lakh. Nampoothiry, speaking to TOI, alleged that Lokpal had “become an expensive white elephant”. “It keeps adding new expenditure citing minor work, professional services and ‘other administrative expenses’ despite low productivity,” he stated. Of the 1,427 complaints received by Lokpal in 2019-20, the maximum were from UP (361), followed by Delhi (156), Maharashtra (138), Rajasthan (109) and Bihar (107). The states with the least complaints were Assam (5), Himachal Pradesh (8), Kerala (11) and Telangana (18).

The case pertains to the death of former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankar at the Chhatrasal Stadium after he and his friends were allegedly assaulted by Kumar and others on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over a property dispute. Chief metropolitan magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba had on August 6 taken cognisance of the chargesheet filed against the accused based on the material available on record. The magistrate court committed the case as the offence of murder was exclusively triable by the sessions court, said Kumar’s lawyer. In the chargesheet filed against 12 people, police had alleged that the brawl at the stadium was a result of a conspiracy hatched by Kumar, who wanted to “re-establish his supremacy” among other wrestlers. Kumar had asked Sonu and Dhankar to vacate the flat, which was in the name of his wife, after a few months, which they refused, the chargesheet alleged. It added that this act by Sonu and Dhankar was allegedly taken by Kumar as a challenge to his authority. It said, according to the postmortem report, Dhankar’s death was due to cerebral damage because of blunt force/object impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stadium-brawl-sessions-court-to-hear-case/articleshow/86181924.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||CBSE: Won’t provide question papers for standard IX & XI||NAGPUR: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has debunked reports that Std IX and XI exam question papers will be sent by them to all schools. A recent CBSE circular clarified that all such reports and messages circulating on social media are fake. Apart from forwarded messages on Whatsapp, there were reports of people putting up such information on their Twitter and Instagram posts while passing them off as ‘news’. While CBSE did not name any person or site, its controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj did not leave any doubt about the board’s stand. “It is clarified that it’s fake news and there is no such plan on the agenda of CBSE. It is reiterated that you do not believe any such information which is circulating on social media but is not available on the board’s website,” wrote Bhardwaj in the circular. A principal told TOI that their teachers had received such messages and it created confusion. “Parents get such messages from some group and blindly forward it in their class groups. Even if such message is sent for inquiry purpose only, it creates a lot of panic because parents want instant answers. For us, the only resource available are the emails which CBSE sends (circulars, notifications etc) or the board’s website. So if there’s no such information we have to say there’s nothing yet, but parents want to know whether something like this is being planned. Now, we can’t answer that and hence these rumours start to spread,” said the principal. With CBSE now issuing an official denial, schools can breathe easy. Another teacher said, “Actually, this should be the default reaction by CBSE, to immediately confirm or deny things. Else it just means dozens of questions from a hundred parents, and we have to weigh our words carefully when speaking. Because any unintended wrong information can set off another chain of events.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-wont-provide-q-papers-for-std-ix-xi/articleshow/86151098.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dahisar toll naka traffic snarls may be short-lived||MUMBAI: Motorists using the Dahisar check naka could get some relief in the coming days as multiple agencies will take steps for decongestion including removal of encroachments and constructing a bypass road. Cabinet Minister Aditya Thackeray on Sunday tweeted that he has been receiving complaints about traffic issues at the toll naka. One of the key reasons for snarls is potholes on the stretch and the absence of Fastag lanes. The toll naka is an entry point to North Mumbai and witnesses movement of lakhs of vehicles everyday. Thackeray said in his tweet that he has reviewed the situation with the BMC, the MMRDA, Mumbai Traffic Police and the MSRDC and initiated an action plan. The BMC's Jumbo Covid Care Centre had put up cabins which consumed a part of the service road. "A few extension cabins from the Covid Care Centre will be removed and the service road will be handed over," said assistant municipal commissioner of R/ North ward, Mridula Ande. Traffic Police said work to remove a welcome arch at the check naka has been on for two months and once the arch is removed, motorists can be accommodated. "The biggest problem is potholes on both sides of the toll naka, even beneath the welcome arch. Complaints of water logging and potholes on the Mira-Bhayander side seldom receive any response from concerned authorities," a traffic cop pointed out. TV actor Rajiv Paul said that he had been using the route daily to travel for shoots and that it was a mess in peak hours. "If I travel as early as 5.30 am, the route is clear from Malad to Naigaon and I am able to reach sets in half an hour. But post 8 am, congestion starts building and it takes almost two hours to use the same stretch. There are several hiccups including no dedicated FASTag (RFID Tag) lanes nor automated machines for providing toll payment receipts," he said. Sources said ongoing Metro construction is the reason FASTag conversion cannot be done. During lockdown, police nakabandis added to the snarls. "When it comes to long term planning, we are exploring the construction of bypass road parallel to the current south-bound stretch of Western Express Highway (WEH). There are some existing structures there and litigation is on. Once the matter is resolved, we will construct additional roads to further decongest traffic in the area," she added.

This comes a day after Congress leader Siddaramaiah opposing the same. The leaders from BJP and JD(S) have urged the district administration to drop the drive. Simha has suggested that the government agencies go for an appeal against the previous list prepared by the authorities. Speaking to reporters at 101 Ganapathi Temple in Agrahara here, which has been marked for demolition, Simha alleged that only Hindu places of worship are being targeted by the officials. “I’m questioning the district administration: how many mosques and churches have come up in the Narasimharaja constituency? In Kyathamaranahalli, how a mosque has come up in a residential area? In Periyapatna, I stopped the construction of a church. Why the district administration didn’t stop? How many such illegal structures demolished?” he asked. “This problem is not restricted to Mysuru district alone. In many districts, we can see this kind of development,” he said. Alleging that the Supreme Court’s direction is not followed by the Mysuru district administration in true spirit, he claimed that the officials were carrying out the drive like thieves — they come during night and demolish the temples. “None of the steps prescribed by the state government in 2010 has been followed while taking up the drive. They are carrying it out like thieves during nightfall. The government agencies concerned must go on an appeal to the apex court against the ongoing drive. They must modify the list of places of worship marked for demolition,” he said, adding that he will impress upon chief minister Basavaraj Bommai to intervene in the matter. Early in the day, former minister and Chamundeshwari MLA Devegowda told reporters that the district administration must act against lake encroachment first “as it is important”. Demolishing temples is hurting the sentiments of the people, he said, adding: “Hindus have an emotional bond with temples. Demolishing them is like kicking into the hearts of people.” According to documents, 93 places of worship, “built illegally in public places in the city”, have been identified for demolition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/politicians-across-party-lines-join-hands-to-oppose-razing-of-places-of-worship/articleshow/86148914.cms||---

Vikas Todarmal of the Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigade told TOI that the fire broke out around 3.30pm in a flat in 24K Opula housing complex at Pimple Nilakh. “The residents Kumar Milani and his mother Rakhi (45) tried to put out the fire, but failed. They ran out and alerted the residents,” Todarmal said. The fire brigade too was immediately informed. “By the time we reached the spot, the residents had already evacuated the building,” Todarmal said. He said the mother and son were in a hospital. “They sustained minor burns on their right hands and face,” Todarmal said. Fire officers Suryakant Mathapati and Pratap Chavan with help of firemen used the building’s fire fighting system and doused the fire. “Except for two bedroom, the four-bedroom flat was completely damaged in the fire,” Todarmal said. He said the woman’s elder son told the fire officer that the fire may have been caused due to the oil lamp in front of the Ganesh idol in the living room of their flat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-her-son-sustain-burns-in-fire-inside-flat/articleshow/86151202.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad Confidential||No Delhi belly for KCR, BJP left biting nailsChief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao recently spent a record nine days in the national capital and returned to Hyderabad only on Thursday evening. This is probably for the first time that the TRS president has spent so many days in the national capital after becoming CM. His extended stay in Delhi led to some speculation in political circles about his motives. Not surprisingly, BJP leaders spent a lot of time biting their nails given that KCR met PM Modi, Union ministers Amit Shah, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Nitin Gadkari. On the one hand local BJP leaders were targeting KCR and on the other hand KCR was hobnobbing with the BJP’s top leadership. So, will this be the beginning of TRS vying for a bigger slice of the national political pie ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls? Let’s wait and watch. What is Kaushik Reddy’s shelf life? Not everyone in TRS is upset about governor Tamilisai Soundararajan delaying Kaushik Reddy’s nomination to the legislative council. Many in the party, who were aspiring for the seat, seem to be enjoying Kaushik’s discomfort over the delay. Many TRS leaders could not digest that Kaushik, who is just 37, was KCR’s pick. They are hopeful that if the governor rejects his file, the party leadership will have a rethink and consider other names. Kaushik himself would be aware that his relevance in the party would ebb after the Huzurabad by-poll. A sultan among bureaucratsSandeep Kumar Sultania from the 1992 IAS cadre seems to be a favourite officer of the government, given the number of important portfolios he controls. Except for chief secretary Somesh Kumar, no other IAS officer has as many important departments to deal with. Sandeep, who is secretary of education, panchayat raj, rural development, and energy, is often difficult to reach, sources say. Many officials wonder why Sultania has been given so much power. Is there a dearth of talent in Telangana’s bureaucracy? Race on to replace Rachakonda CPMahesh Bhagwat seems all set for a higher position after being Rachakonda police commissioner for more than five years. The move seems imminent after V C Sajjanar was moved out of Cyberabad. Among the probables looking to replace Bhagwat are Rachakonda additional CP G Sudheer Babu, inspector general (north zone) Y Nagi Reddy and additional CP (law and order) Hyderabad DS Chauhan. Bunking bureaucrats under scannerThe government is closely watching collectors of districts surrounding Hyderabad. Some of them have been frequenting Hyderabad for ‘personal reasons’ instead of staying at their headquarters. A little bird tells us that one collector was transferred for clocking too many hours in the state capital. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar was reportedly told some collectors come to office around noon and leave for Hyderabad around 3 pm at least twice a week. Well, it seems the chief secretary doesn’t like bunking babus. Hope floats for wannabe IAS officers, or does it?Over 40 aspirants of non-state civil service have been eagerly waiting to join the IAS cadre for the past two months. Telangana notified four IAS vacancies in June to elevate the Group I and senior officers. There is a long list of aspirants given that the exercise has been taken up for the first time after the formation of Telangana. Sources say the state government is sitting on the file and has not completed the short-listing process. In the past as well, the government had notified the posts and then quietly buried the file. Let’s hope the latest file sees the light of day. Headless HMDA crawls onHyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), which controls over 7,000 sq km, is being managed by an in-charge metropolitan commissioner (MC) for close to three years. After B Janardhan Reddy was moved out of the planning body in 2019, municipal administration special chief secretary Arvind Kumar has been holding additional charge. During that time, HMDA has not even been able to integrate master plans despite working on them for four years. HMDA has many important responsibilities like planning, auctioning of government land and taking up land pooling schemes. There must be someone in the bureaucracy who can dedicatedly handle the key responsibility, no? TailpieceA DCP in a city commissionerate has set a new trend in lobbying for postings. This officer has come up with a novel way by requesting potential contenders to a post to back off for some time. When they heard, “Sir, I heard you are eyeing a post I am after. Please give me time for six months,” the officers whom he approached were left chuckling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-confidential/articleshow/86151187.cms||---
---||Pune||Realtor, 2 others booked in Rs 2.4cr cheating case||Pune: Two-wheeler dealer and realtor Gautam Pashankar, his daughter, Rinul, and an estate broker have been booked by the Pune police after business development and management consultant Narendra Patil (42) lodged a complaint accusing them of cheating him of Rs2.40 crore over a deal for two flats in a housing project in Kharadi. Patil also accused Pashankar of assaulting him in the latter’s office when he demanded a refund after realising that the realtor had sold the two flats to third parties. He claimed to have then suffered a fracture to his right leg in the assault, which, he said, took place on June 8, 2020. The alleged assault happened a little over four months before October 21, 2020 when Gautam Pashankar (66) had gone missing from near his home along the Ganeshkhind Road and was traced 34 days later to a hotel in Jaipur. Pashankar’s son Kapil, who is now looking after the family’s business, refuted all allegations levelled by Patil and told TOI, “A false complaint has been registered against my father, sister and the broker.” Senior inspector Anita More of the Shivajinagar police told TOI on Sunday, “We have registered a case for offences under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 326 (causing grievous hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 34 (common intention) of the IPC on the basis of the complainant’s verification and statement recorded with us. Besides, the complainant’s bank statements; evidence of cheques issued by the realtor towards refund but were returned by the bank for insufficient balance; and medical certificate relating to the injury suffered in the alleged assault.” Patil, who stays at Panchavati in Pashan, has stated in the FIR that the estate broker showed him the two 3BHK garden flats in January 2019 following which he signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pashankar the same month for purchasing them at a total consideration of Rs2.87 crore. He said he had paid them Rs 2.40 crore in cash and was issued allotment letters. Patil said, “In the first week of June last year, I learnt that the two flats were sold to third parties and I approached the builder for a refund. They gave me two cheques totally worth Rs1.90 crore towards part repayment of money, but both these cheques were returned by the bank owing to insufficient balance. I have initiated a case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act against them for this and the same is pending before a city court.” He said, “On June 8, when I against visited Pashankar at his office in Shivajinagar, he picked up an argument and assaulted me. After my leg was treated, I approached Pune police commissioner with my complaint. The crime branch investigated it and then the complaint was sent to the Shivajinagar police in March.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/realtor-2-others-booked-in-rs-2-4cr-cheating-case/articleshow/86151277.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Delhi||Will file separate chargesheets in riot cases clubbed together: Cops||New Delhi: Delhi Police has told a city court that it would separately investigate three incidents related to the northeast Delhi riots after its reply was sought on how the incidents that took place on different dates and blocks of the area had been clubbed in a single FIR. Police, in their status report, told additional sessions Judge Vinod Yadav that they would file separate chargesheets in the three complaints, which were earlier clubbed together. Earlier, an FIR was registered on March 4, 2020, based on five written complaints made by different complainants— Mohd Razak, Mohd Israr, Alishan, Mohd Shahid and Shamim Alam. The court noted that, of the five complaints, two pertained to the incidents of rioting at C-block, Bhajanpura on two different dates— February 24 and 25 last year (made by Mohd Razak and Mohd Israr); two others detail out the incidents of rioting at D-block, (complaints by Alishan and Shamim Alam); while the last complaint was concerned with the incident of E-block (made by Shahid). In the status report, police stated that the complaints regarding incidents of rioting in each block had been separated and would be investigated separately. “Scrutiny of the complaints revealed that complainant Mohd Razak was running a shop at C-Block .... Mohd Israr was running a shop at C-Block…. Alishan was running a shop at D-Block…. Mohd Shahid was running a shop in E…. Shamim Alam was running a shop in D…. Now, complaints mentioned at serial No.1 & 2 (C block) were clubbed in one incident and those mentioned at Serial No.3 & 5 (D block) were clubbed in separate incident and complaint mentioned at Serial No.4 of E-Block will be investigated separately. For all these three incidents, separate chargesheets will be filed,” the report stated. Police further informed the court that the development took place pursuant to directions given in this regard by DCP (North East). “On a query raised by this court to learned special public prosecutor as to how incidents of rioting that took place on different dates and in different blocks (C, D & E Blocks) of Bhajanpura, have been clubbed in the instant case FIR and chargesheet, a 'status report' has been filed at this stage, inter alia stating therein that the complaints with regard to the incidents of rioting that took place in D and E blocks of Bhajanpura will be separated from this chargesheet and separate ones will be filed in respect thereof…,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/will-file-separate-chargesheets-in-riot-cases-clubbed-together-cops/articleshow/86182023.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||Charges added in Sakinaka rape-murder, women's group wants state shelter for victim's children||MUMBAI: Even as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes put pressure on the state to add charges in the brutal rape-murder case at Sakinaka, a post-mortem on the victim has shown that a major injury was caused by the insertion of a pointed object into her private parts and that it had reached up to her abdomen. The 32-year-old woman died on Saturday, almost 36 hours after being sexually assaulted in a parked tempo allegedly by a driver known to her. A delegation of National Commission for Women also demanded that her underage children be moved into the state’s care at once. The police on Sunday added provisions under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to the case. “The family of the victim will get an immediate compensation of Rs 4.25 lakh. . We met the family in the presence of the police and members of the state social welfare department,” said Arun Halder, vice-chairman, National Commission for Scheduled Castes. Halder further added that the family would be eligible for relief of an equal amount when the police file a chargesheet in court. The Act provides that the state take care of expenses for education of all children of the victim, provide a government job to at least one when s/he is of legal age and provide them with a house. During a marathon meeting that was held on Sunday, superiors instructed personnel from each of the 93 police stations in city to scan isolated stretches in their jurisdiction and ensure that not a single complaint of a crime against a woman goes unreported. The victim’s post mortem was carried out at the state-run JJ Hospital, Byculla, on Saturday. One of the experts said that her death was caused by “complications following injuries”. The autopsy was video-graphed, and her viscera have been preserved for histopathological analysis. “The victim also had other minor injuries on the body,” a source from the hospital said. A delegation of the National Commission for Women met the director general of police and gave instructions that night patrolling be stepped up and that a mechanism be devised for moving to safety vulnerable women who are living on the streets. “This crime is a result of an absence of fear in the minds of criminals with respect to the police machinery,” said member of the National Commission for Women, Chandramukhi Devi. She added that the appointment of members to the State Commission for Women should be done on a priority basis so that they could help the victim’s family claim compensation from the Nirbhaya Fund. “After speaking to hospital doctors, we gathered that the Sakinaka case is as gory as Delhi’s Nirbhaya gangrape case. The background of the woman is of no consequence. Every woman should feel safe,” said Chandramukhi Devi.

Additional sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted relief to Tinku and said his right to defend himself would get prejudiced if he was not admitted bail at this stage in the case, which related to alleged vandalism of Illiyas’s house and shop in Gokalpuri during the riots. “He (Tinku) has been in judicial custody since 31.08.2020. I find substance in the submissions of learned counsel that presence of applicant is necessary for effective preparation of his defence and facilitate him to participate in the trial. His right to defend himself shall get prejudiced if he is not admitted bail at this stage. Therefore, without going into the controversy and keeping in view the aforesaid fact(s), the applicant deserves bail,” the judge said. The court granted him bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with one surety of like amount and directed him not to tamper with evidence. Advocate Rajeev Pratap Singh Tomar, appearing for Tinku, claimed that his call detail record showed that he was not in Delhi during the alleged incident.  Tomar added that the alleged video of the incident was shot when Tinku, along with other co-accused people, were helping police in clearing the road during the riots. Special public prosecutor Nitin Rai Sharma, appearing for police, had opposed the bail plea and said the accused was arrested based on his disclosure statement in another case in which he was arrested. He added that, in the alleged video, which was recovered by police in another case, Tinku could be seen allegedly being part of the riotous mob.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-to-man-already-freed-in-five-similar-rioting-cases/articleshow/86182153.cms||---
---||Amritsar||124 years on, Saragarhi valour immortalised in UK||BATHINDA: In well recognition and tribute to the heroes of the battle at Saragarhi, a life-size bronze statue of Havildar Ishar Singh was unveiled at Guru Nanak Gurdwara at Wednesfield, a suburb of Wolverhampton town in UK, on the battle’s 124th anniversary on Sunday. In the fierce battle, 21 Sikh soldiers and a Muslim cook of 36th Sikh Regiment (now 4 Sikh) fought bravely with exemplary courage against 10,000 Afghan tribesmen before laying down their lives as last stand. The bravery has been immortalised by setting up of a 10-feet-tall bronze statue of Havildar Ishar Singh atop a six-feet-tall plinth having names of all martyrs been inscribed. The battle of Saragarhi was fought on September 12, 1897, when brave hearts stood firm against onslaught of Pathan tribesman at observation post of Saragarhi for communication in between Fort Lockhart and Fort Gulistan, in North-West Frontier Province, now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. It turned out as the first instance that such a monument has come up in UK with the efforts of the sangat and Wolverhampton city council. Akal Takhat Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh was present at the unveiling of statue that was also attended by Army officials from the UK. Wolverhampton councillor Bhupinder Singh Gakhal, who is considered person behind setting up of Saragarhi monument, said, “We used to hear about the heroic tales of the valour and gallantry of warriors and now setting up a monument in the memory of braves in our backyard could not be described in words. We are indebted to the sangat and the Wolverhampton council for ensuring this to happen and providing us a place to feel proud of.” Akal Takhat Jathedar Giani Harpreeet Singh said that it is moment of pride and proud for Sikhs community across the world that a monument to epic battle has been put up in England. The way Sikh soldiers fought have raised head of community. The Saragarhi has no parallels as this was only instance in history of warfare, where 21 soldiers were posthumously awarded with Indian Order Merit (IOM), the highest award given to any Indian soldiers at that time that is equivalent to present day Param Vir Chakra. Proud moment for Sikhs: JathedarAkal Takht jathedar Harpreeet Singh said Sikhs across the world could celebrate the establishment of a monument to the epic battle in England.

---||Delhi||How Jamia Hamdard stayed on top in pharmacy in NIRF||NEW DELHI: Jamia Hamdard has maintained the top position in National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) for pharmacy for the third consecutive year. The varsity’s vice-chancellor outlined that its strong academia-industry partnership, several patents, consultancy work and a 100% placement record have helped it stay on top. Jamia Hamdard is an institute of higher education in the capital deemed to be a university. The varsity earlier had an intense competition with National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Mohali, for the top spot. But now, in 2021, its competitor is in the fourth position. The second and third positions are Panjab University and Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. However, the overall ranking of the Jamia Hamdard university is 64, a drop from 37 in 2020. M Afshar Alam, the vice-chancellor, told TOI, “One important factor is we have excellent interaction with the industry. Our academic-industry partnership is robust. We also have many patents, and the faculty is involved in a lot of consultancy work. Our placement record has been 100%, and we have received huge grants from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), ministry of Ayush and others.” Alam added that the faculty of Jamia Hamdard had received the best teacher award from the All India Council for Technical Education, which helped its perception. Out of the total 100, it has a 90.75 score for parameters. “The alumni also play an important role in this,” he said. Another parameter where the university has scored well is the quality of publications. Out of the total 40, it has received 39.59. Even on the metric of examinations and the number of PhD students graduating from the university, it has the perfect score of 15. It also has a good score in the faculty-student strength. The one parameter where Jamia Hamdard has not fared well is outreach and inclusivity. On the inclusion of economically and socially challenged students, it has just scored 1.6 out of the total 20. It also has a poor score on the number of students from outside the state. In this, it has scored 13.55 out of 30 marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-jamia-hamdard-stayed-on-top-in-pharmacy-in-nirf/articleshow/86149257.cms||Shradha Chettri

A yellow alert (heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places) was issued for Mumbai for September 13-14, for Thane and Palghar there was an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places very likely). The impact may include localized inundation/flooding of low-lying areas and urban areas, disruption to road, rail, air and ferry transport and uprooting of weak trees, and collapse of old and unmaintained structures. On Sunday there were short spells of intense rain, with IMD Colaba recording 8.4mm and IMD Santacruz 8.8mm in the nine hours ending 5.30pm. In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Sunday IMD Colaba and Santacruz recorded 29.4mm and 21.2mm respectively. IMD said enhancement of rain in the city and adjoining areas was due to a well-marked low pressure area over north-west and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal. “It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas of north Odisha-West Bengal coasts during the next 12 hours. It is likely to move west-northwestwards across north Odisha and north Chhattisgarh during subsequent 2-3 days,” said IMD, adding that the active rainfall is likely to continue for 3-4 days. Meanwhile, the total stock in lakes supplying the city’s water needs touched 96.63%. The total stock stood at 13.98 lakh million litres. With rain picking up pace again, there is a chance of stock in lakes reaching their full capacity.  The lakes need to have total stock of 14.47 lakh million litres to reach 100% capacity.

In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Sunday IMD Colaba and Santacruz recorded 29.4mm and 21.2mm respectively. IMD said enhancement of rain in the city and adjoining areas was due to a well-marked low pressure area over north-west and adjoining west central Bay of Bengal. “It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining areas of north Odisha-West Bengal coasts during the next 12 hours. It is likely to move west-northwestwards across north Odisha and north Chhattisgarh during subsequent 2-3 days,” said IMD, adding that the active rainfall is likely to continue for 3-4 days. Meanwhile, the total stock in lakes supplying the city’s water needs touched 96.63%. The total stock stood at 13.98 lakh million litres. With rain picking up pace again, there is a chance of stock in lakes reaching their full capacity.  The lakes need to have total stock of 14.47 lakh million litres to reach 100% capacity. BMC supplies 3,800 million litres of water to the city daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/weatherman-says-expect-heavy-rain-in-city-thane/articleshow/86153328.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Pune||Pune: Phursungi water supply project on slow track; corporators want funds||PUNE: A water project expected to cater to thousands of residents in Phursungi and Uruli Devachi is on a slow track. Local elected representatives have cited lack of funds and demanded that the administration make provisions for funds to complete the remaining work of laying distribution lines which could reduce the hardships of residents. The project also includes laying of the main pipeline from the Cantonment water works. Local corporator Ganesh Dhore said the pipeline work is in the last stages, but the project may get delayed because of inadequate distribution lines. He said a meeting will be held with the civic chief next week to decide on fund allotment and execution plan. Ashok Haware, a local resident, said, “Phursungi and Uruli Devachi were merged into city areas four years ago. But the water problem still persists. Many areas still depend on tankers to meet their water requirement. .” Dhore said that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) spends over Rs6crore annually to supply water through tankers to both the areas. “The administration will not have to incur annual expenses if the funds are provided for the water project.” The project was sanctioned when both the areas were outside the PMC limits. Hence, the PMC did not allot any funds for the project. “We raised the issue at the recent PMC general body meeting. The mayor has assured a separate meeting to discuss the issue,” Dhore added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/phursungi-water-supply-project-on-slow-track-corporators-want-funds/articleshow/86151329.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||HC extends stay on Rs 25k costs imposed on police||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday extended its stay on the Rs 25,000 costs imposed on Delhi Police by a trial court in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots. Justice Subramonium Prasad posted the matter for November 15, while stating that the interim order continues, after the cops said it had not received the reply of complainant Mohammad Nasir. The high court, thereafter, granted Nasir a week’s time to bring the reply on record. HC was hearing the police’s plea challenging the trial court order calling its investigation into the case as callous and farcical and imposing a cost. HC had on July 28 stayed the imposition of Rs 25,000 fine but refused to interfere with the trial court strictures against police investigation, saying it could not expunge the remarks without a hearing. The trial judge had passed the strictures on Delhi Police’s refusal to register an FIR on the complaint of one Mohammad Nasir, who lost his left eye after suffering a gunshot injury during the riots. The high court had earlier issued notice on Delhi Police’s plea against the trial court order and sought the response of the complainant. In its challenge to the trial court order, police said the imposition of fine, which was to be recovered from the station house officer of Bhajanpura police station and his supervising officers, was unwarranted and uncalled for. The cops contended that the July 13 order of the trial court was in violation of principles of natural justice as it was passed without giving any opportunity to the DCP to make his submissions, and that very serious remarks were made against the investigation agency even prior to the commencement of trial. In the order, additional sessions Judge Vinod Yadav had pulled up the cops for lack of efficacy and fairness in the investigation in the case and said that it had been done in a most casual, callous, and farcical manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-extends-stay-on-rs-25k-costs-imposed-on-police/articleshow/86182210.cms||---

Locals had installed the idol, which were found to be missing. Residents said that small children installed the idols by collecting money from each house in the locality. The residents happily donated money to the children, and helped them to put the pandal and decorate it. On Saturday night, the idols of Ganesha and Gowri were stolen, while children were sleeping inside the pandal. The residents wondered how the deities made with mud could be stolen in such a heinous manner, and what the miscreants hoped to achieve by committing the crime. “It is tough to believe that deities, which were installed by small children were stolen. The children and locals are deeply saddened due to this incident,” said residents. “The thieves must be traced, and punished,” urged residents. Residents helped the children to install new deities, by pooling money, which brought back smiles to their faces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/ganesha-gowri-idols-stolen-from-pandal-in-mandya/articleshow/86148604.cms||---
---||Delhi||NCR board plan to redefine Delhi's green cover may hamper conservation, worry experts||NEW DELHI: With the NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) contemplating two categories for the existing Natural Conservation Zones (NCZ) — forests and green cover — experts feel areas that currently enjoy protection as forests will reduce in size. Under the proposal, while forests will remain protected, certain non-forest activities will be permitted in green-cover areas. The NCZ areas in Delhi include the Aravalis, which form a part of the Southern Ridge, lakes, riverbeds and water-recharge areas. Vimlendu Jha, former independent member of the Ridge Management Board, said that forest cover in NCR was less than 4% of total land area and so the move to redefine forest and green cover zones would need to be thought through. “Once we ease the governance and legal protocols of conservation, it's going to be a free run. Conservation will be gravely hit,” he said. “We need to do more to protect ourselves from climate change, rapid urbanisation and the growing threat to public health due to deteriorating water and air quality. We mustn’t auction off our natural resources. Jha noted that a green cover was as critical as a forest. “But even a forest remains undefined in some NCR states.” said Jha, apprehensive that the two-zone proposal could lead to people taking advantage of that ambiguity. Environmental activist Diwan Singh, who launched a satyagraha to remove encroachments from the Yamuna floodplain in 2007, pointed out that even after the Supreme Court asked for the Ridge to be treated as a forest area in 1994, its extent was yet to be demarcated, leaving the forest open to exploitation. The grey area opened up by defining forest area differently from green cover is likely to lead to similar exploitation, Singh felt. “If the protection for green area veered towards the strictness marked for forests, we would have appreciated it,” the eco-activist said. “But this isn’t the case here. In fact, it is the opposite. Such departures from strict conservation goals will harm the ecological balance of the NCR region.” Yamuna activist Manoj Mishra expected Haryana to face the bigger impact since the Aravalis are yet to be declared a ‘forest area’. “The impact on the national capital will likely be far less,” he said. “But at the same time, it is inadvisable to loosen existing safeguards at a time when climate change is hitting cities hard.” Some experts said they awaited further clarity, with the draft proposal yet to be cleared by the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan before final approval. Forest officials also felt the definition of a green cover needed to be clarified before the impact could be ascertained. “There will certainly be some impact because forest areas enjoy tougher protection. Once we learn what a green cover constitutes, we will have a better idea,” said one of the officials. Another forest official argued that there already are definitions of forest and green cover in the India State of Forest Report, released by the Forest Survey of India every two years. “If the same definition is accepted, forest cover in Delhi may not suffer,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ncr-board-plan-to-redefine-city-green-cover-may-hamper-conservation-worry-experts/articleshow/86149303.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Nagpur||NIT seeks user change of PU land, ground ‘to help a builder’||Nagpur: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has sought change in reservation of sprawling playground and public utility (PU) land of Nelco Gruhnirman Sahakari Sanstha, allegedly to allot the PU land to a builder. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started the process to change the reservation, citing a proposed tribal girls hostel by NIT. However, NIT officials say they have developed two tribal girls hostels already, and there is no proposal for another one. TOI had on September 4 reported NMC starting process to change reservation of 1.24 hectare playground in the layout at Trimurti Nagar in mouza Parsodi citing NIT’s proposed tribal girls hostel. The civic body invited suggestions and objections on the proposal to change reservation of PU land from parking to residential. The PU land is 0.4 hectare (43,056 sq ft), with change in reservation proposed for 0.33 hectare (36,199 sq ft) to residential, and remaining 0.067 hectare (7,212 sq ft) land left as parking. In a letter to NMC, NIT itself had said a woman is demanding change of reservation. As per norms, NMC, as planning authority, has to study the proposal before beginning the process. But no study was done, said NMC sources. Layout resident Janardhan Sonkusre told TOI, “NIT wants to hand over our layout’s PU land to a builder. We got compound wall constructed from NMC funds and saved the PU land from encroachments. We collected money from plot owners and ensured development for walking and fitness activities. There are no norms to allot PU land to a private person. PU land belongs to entire layout.” He said NMC should set aside the ongoing process and instead change reservation on PU land from parking to garden or playground, and NIT should develop it as it has collected development charges. Sonkusre said the woman mentioned in NIT’s letter owns a plot adjacent to the PU land. “She complains that she got less land from NIT due to tangent. Therefore, she is demanding PU land,” he said. A visit to the plot reveals the woman’s plot is in possession of a builder — Badal Matey, with a board showing a proposed construction site. Matey denied any plan to take over PU land. “NIT by mistake imposed reservation of parking on the woman’s plot, which is in my possession. Therefore, we requested NIT to change reservation on the plot. We have nothing to do with PU land,” he said. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said a proper study will be conducted before taking any decision. NIT officials said they submitted a proposal to NMC, and the decision vests with NMC. NIT officials told TOI the proposal to develop tribal girls hostel on playground was of 2013, and hostels have already been constructed at two other places. Today, no proposal for tribal girls hostel is pending with NIT. Layout plot owners said NMC should set aside the process to change reservation immediately. “We developed the playground. It is open space and cannot be used for any other purpose. All plot owners use it daily for walking, fitness and recreational activities. Now it is clear NIT does not require the land for tribal girls hostel. It seems builder is driving the proposal,” they said. IN A NUTSHELL * NMC invites suggestions and objections for changing reservation of playground for construction of tribal girls hostel * Same notice proposes change in reservation from public utility land to residential * Both lands are situated in Nelco Society * NIT officials say no tribal girls hostel project pending, projects already executed in other places * Plot owners say NIT wants to allot land to a builder * Plot owners demand NMC should set aside entire process||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-seeks-user-change-of-pu-land-ground-to-help-a-builder/articleshow/86151351.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Delhi students in doubt over home or school choice||NEW DELHI: Home or classroom? The choice isn’t automatic. Now that schools have reopened, students aren’t quite sure which is better: going back to school or studying from the comfort of home. The decision has got nothing to do with Covid-19 either. While they miss the school environment and their friends, online classes give them time for much more leisure than school ever did. Of course, the undecided youngsters are those mostly belonging to families that can afford the infrastructure for digital education; most government school students are eager to leave behind their privations and get on with offline classes. Tarush Varma Mookerjee, Class X student at Delhi Public School, Sushant Lok, Gurgaon, said, “I want to meet my friends for sure and I miss the peer atmosphere of school, but I have got used to the comfort of home learning. It’s also less tiring for us with online classes and there is energy left for other things.” But Mookerjee realises that not all students may think in this manner. “I understand it must be very difficult for many students who don't have access to a support structure at home,” he said. Another Class XI student, Eva Tewary of Srijan School, Model Town, said studying from home left her with time for dancing, reading novels and spending quality time with her grandparents. “Not having regular school for over a year now, I definitely miss my friends and teachers. However, learning is undoubtedly more convenient in the online mode because it gives me more time for self-study and leisure activities,” said Tewary. Tewary’s friend, Sarah Sahajwani, however, gave her vote to classes in person like earlier. “I really want to go back to school not just because of all the fun and happy times with our friends there, but also because studying from home has been a little too comfortable for us. That is why we have often taken assignments and exams for granted. Personally, I can see the difference in the level of work I did when in school and at home and the former was better,” said Sahajwani. Also plumping for school is Juneli Tamang, Class X student at Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan. “Yes, I want to return to school because with the teachers in front of me, I find it easier to pay attention to lessons,” said Tamang. But the school is yet to send parents the stipulated protocols for resuming classes and her parents are not too keen on sending her to school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-in-doubt-over-home-or-school-choice/articleshow/86149337.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||India||Gujarat BJP heeds ‘ab ki baar, Patidar CM’ demand||GANDHINAGAR: By choosing Bhupendra Patel, a Kadva Patidar, for the post of Gujarat chief minister, the BJP high command has once again acknowledged the importance of this politically influential community. Patidars make up for nearly 13% of voters in Gujarat. With assembly elections 15 months away, Bhupendra has a colossal task to reverse the setbacks suffered by the BJP in the 2017 polls, when it lost some 13 seats to Congress in its own bastion of Saurashtra. Later, the saffron party did recover some losses, but it was mainly due to some senior Congress leaders like Kunwarji Bavaliya and Jawahar Chavda, crossing the aisle to grab ministerial berths in the Rupani government. The BJP regained significant electoral ground in the local body polls last year by winning all 31 district panchayats, nearly 180 of 260 taluka panchayats and all municipal corporations. Bhupendra, the 59-year-old rookie politician, is said to be a moderate Patidar face. In contrast, outgoing deputy CM Nitin Patel who had bargained for the finance portfolio after two days of sulking in 2018, is considered inflexible over many issues. Besides Patidars, Bhupendra is closely associated with Dada Bhagwan Foundation, a spiritual organization, which has a large number of followers in Gujarat. In fact, he is fondly called 'Dada' by his supporters. The former AUDA chairman’s selection also points to BJP’s discomfiture after Aam Aadmi Party’s stellar show in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) elections earlier this year. AAP workers have also started an aggressive groundwork in north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Naresh Patel, president of Khodaldham Temple Trust, the influential Leuva Patel religious organization, had been vocal for a Patidar as a CM after Rupani’s departure. In fact, interacting with reporters in June, he had been critical of the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 situation while praising AAP’s Delhi government. He could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Ramesh Tilala, trustee of Khodaldham Trust, told TOI: “It’s a matter of pride that Gujarat has got a Patidar CM. However, we are a religious and a social organization which considers all communities equal. We hoist the national flag at our temple and devotees from all castes come to seek blessings of Maa Khodal.” Recently, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, a Leuva Patel strongman, had tried to assuage the community’s sentiments and described the relationship between Patidars and BJP like that of “an umbilical cord and navel”. In Bhupendra’s elevation, the BJP has also sought to neutralize the potential impact of Hardik Patel, the feisty Patidar quota stir leader, who joined Congress and became its working president. The young Kadva Patel leader still has a significant following among the community youth and the BJP can ill afford to oversee the possibilities of him swaying votes in Congress’ favour in 2022. T G Jhalawadia, vice-president, Sardardham, said, “Bhupendrabhai has worked a lot for Sardardham and Vishwa Umiya Foundation and has made immense contribution to the community's welfare. But he is a man of all communities, who believes in doing good for all people of Gujarat. So, he must not be seen as the leader of a particular community. He is a man of integrity and absolute honesty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-bjp-heeds-ab-ki-baar-patidar-cm-demand/articleshow/86155234.cms||---

The PWD will paint the British era monument and will install granite flooring. “We could not initiate brushing work of granite due to lack of oxygen supply. We faced difficulty in applying lacquer paint to the main monument earlier,” said a senior official of the PWD on condition of anonymity. The department has completed the floor work and has painted the monument. “The total cost of the work is Rs 6 lakh, which is allocated from the fund of MLC Anant Gadgil,” the official said. The memorial, spread across 5000sq ft, was built in the memory of soldiers from Maharashtra who had lost their lives fighting in World War I. About 1.8 million Indian soldiers fought in Central Asia and North Africa and around 74,000 Indian soldiers lost their lives. On February 4 every year, the troops and veterans of the Maratha Light Infantry (MLI) of the Indian Army observe the ‘regimental day’ at the memorial. They conduct a wreath-laying function to commemorate the sacrifices of the soldiers. “This is a sacred place for the Maratha soldiers. It has got a huge significance,” said Lt Gen DB Shekatar (retd) who commanded 6th battalion of the MLI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pwd-rolls-out-renovation-works-at-maratha-war-memorial-in-pune-cantt/articleshow/86151359.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Kolkata||Kolkata connects with seniors on Grandparents’ Day||KOLKATA: Right from the churches to schools and NGOs, the rhetoric on Sunday veered around Grandparents Day. The second Sunday of September is traditionally dedicated to grandparents to spread awareness among families and the youth to cheer the senior members of the family and shake them out of their loneliness. Messages were sent out to parishes by the Church of North India and the Roman Catholic Church to remind the parishioners about their responsibilities towards the elderly. School e-notice boards were full of loving messages from grandchildren on Sunday and programmes are lined up from Monday till the end of the month to bring in grandparents to the online classes for celebrations dedicated to them. Many schools are also sending gifts to grandparents. Schools like DPS Newtown, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, The Heritage and St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, have lined up programs from Monday. Songs, dances, plays and messages have been rehearsed for live streaming. At DPS Newtown, right from nursery onwards children will perform for grandparents, telling them how special they are in every milestone that they have reached so far. “We are making children dress up as grandchildren and grandparents in plays that have special messages for the seniors. We are looking forward to their reactions,” said Rai Mukhopadhyay, headmistress of the school. The Heritage and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy have events lined up later this month. Some community initiatives, focussed towards the elderly, like Aarambh, were launched on Sunday, where seniors will get a free platform to gather, perform, chat and share, said Debapriya Dutt, who has been working among seniors for a long time. In his message to parishioners, Bishop Paritosh Canning, the head of the Kolkata Diocese of the CNI reminded parishioners that according to the Bible, grey hair is a crown of glory gained by living a righteous life. “It is our duty to keep them in good health, away from loneliness and be in their company in these troubled times,” Bishop Canning said. Archbishop Thomas D’Souza, had directed all parishes to celebrate grandparents day on July 25, much ahead of the official day. On Sunday, vicar general, Dominic Gomes reiterated the message, asking the youth of all parishes to visit grandparents and take charge of their wellbeing, continuing with the July 25 pledge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-connects-with-its-seniors-on-grandparents-day/articleshow/86149457.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Overall the paper was moderately difficult, say academics, though a few individual questions were tough. Academic Sameer Phale said, “Biology was from NCERT, so those who had prepared from there would do very well. However, I felt that physics section was quite tough. In fact, it was tougher as compared to the last two years. I spoke to my students and they also felt that physics subject was tough. For chemistry, I would say that today’s paper was moderate.” Academic Narendra Wankhede too agreed that compared to other subjects physics was tough. “Comparatively it was tough but overall I felt it was okay. Yes, we found that it took a long time for students to complete the physics section. Biology and chemistry did not pose much of a challenge for students. Physics will be the deciding factor for MBBS admission,” said Wankhede. He also felt that cut-offs may go down by 5% as compared to last year. NEET is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) and is a pen-paper test. NEET is the gateway exam for admission to MBBS, BDS, BAMS, BSMS, BUMS, and BHMS courses. The test pattern of NEET-2021 consisted of two sections. Each subject had two sections; section A had 35 questions and section B had 15 questions. Of these 15 questions, candidates could choose to attempt any 10. Each question carried four marks. For each incorrect answer, one mark will be deducted from the total score. The result is expected by the end of the month and it will be displayed on the website: https://neet.nta.nic.in// and thereafter candidates may download their score cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neet-2021-overall-a-moderately-difficult-paper/articleshow/86151384.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Delhi||Students and faculty of Delhi University medical college oppose Covid care facility||NEW DELHI: Students and faculty members of University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS), a medical college under Delhi University, have written to the President of India and the Delhi government against the building of a proposed Covid care facility on the campus.  They say the area is a designated space for a playground for the medical students of the college. It is also a designated bird diversity hotspot, they claimed and urged the government to relocate the facility. On Monday, the students and faculty members along with several staff of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital protested against the proposed facility and held placards with slogans like “Save Central Field”, “Don’t leave the campus peeled” and others. In a letter sent to different authorities, the teacher’s association stated, “We appreciate and support this initiative of developing Covid-dedicated infrastructure in east Delhi. However, we find that the proposed site of the building will damage the rich biodiverse green area of the complex, when in fact there is availability of land (under Delhi govt) in the nearby areas. The proposed site is already a playground, which is an essential feature of a medical educational institution.” Satendra Singh, vice-president of the association, said, “UCMS is the only medical college, which has a playground for the students. It is an important guideline of the medical council so we don’t want the students to be deprived of it. The area also houses a nursery, which has some rare cacti. We are worried that building the facility will also compromise on the safety of women nursing students.” Ramansh Bandhu Gupta, the students’ union president, said, “We support the making of a Covid-dedicated hospital in the area, but request the government to consider the biodiversity loss and medical recognition of the college. We urge them to relocate the hospital.” The protesters said a Covid management facility near Ramlila Ground is under-utilised. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office has forwarded the letter to the directorate of higher education for appropriate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-and-faculty-of-du-medical-college-oppose-covid-care-facility/articleshow/86182340.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Amritsar||Saragarhi battle: In Ferozepur, tributes paid to mark battle’s anniversary||BATHINDA: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh virtually paid tributes to the soldiers of the historic Saragarhi battle on its 124th anniversary. A state-level martyrdom day function was organised at Gurdwara Saragarhi near Ferozepur. Chief minister recalled the valour of the 22 soldiers of the 36th Sikh stationed near Samana ridge (now in NWFP Pakistan), who laid down their lives after a fierce battle following an attack by nearly 10,000 Afghans on September 12, 1897. Recalling the epic battle, Captain Amarinder said in order to quell the disturbances in the Pathan areas, four columns of the then British Indian Army were sent by General Lockhart. Of these, 36th Sikh (Now 4 Sikh) comprising 21 Sikh soldiers and a cook, was assigned the task of defending Saragarhi, which was an observation post for ensuring communication between Fort Lockhart and Fort Gulistan. “In the morning of September 12, 1897, Pathans hailing from Afridi and Orakzai tribes attacked the Saragarhi. The pathan demands for surrender were rebuffed strongly by Havaldar Ishar Singh. Soon the attack ensued prompting Ishar Singh to send signal to his superior Colonel Houghton who asked them to hold positions,” said Captain Amarinder, adding as the battle continued every Sikh soldier fired 400-500 rounds of ammunition. According to Captain, all the efforts to send help to the besieged soldiers were unsuccessful owing to large number of tribal pathans. “At last, Sepoy Gurmukh Singh sent the last signal to Colonel Houghton and picked up the gun to fight and all soldiers were martyred,” he said. Sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi said the martyrdom of the Sikh soldiers was recognised all over the world, including by Queen Victoria and the highest gallantry award at that time, Indian Order of Merit (IOM), equivalent to Param Vir Chakra, was awarded to every martyr. MLA Ferozepur (urban) Parminder Singh Pinki demanded that a langar hall should be constructed on the 2.5 acre of forest land to which the chief minister asked the deputy commissioner to send a detailed proposal. The MLA also urged the Prime Minister to extend Rs 11 crore assistance in the proper upkeep of the Saragarhi Gurdwara. Chairman Saragarhi Memorial Management Committee and deputy GOC-cum-station commander Brigadier V Mohanty said, the UNESCO had included Saragarhi among the eight greatest battles of the world. The detailed project report regarding the war memorial of Saragarhi is ready, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/saragarhi-battle-tributes-paid-to-martyrs-on-124th-anniversary/articleshow/86151414.cms||---

---||Trichy||HC seeks registry report on narcotic drugs in custody of special courts||Madurai: Taking into account that serious allegations were levelled against police officials for using ganja seized in previous cases to foist cases on people under NDPS Act, Madras high court directed the registry to submit report on contraband in the possession of special courts under the jurisdiction of the Madurai bench. Justice B Pugalendhi directed the special courts which deal with cases under NDPS Act to inspect the storage locations and ascertain whether the contraband is intact and in safe custody. The judge also sought a report from the special courts on cases pending year-wise till date and details of pending applications seeking permission to destroy the contraband. The judge sought for the details by taking into account the submission of the special public prosecutor appearing for NIB-CID who stated that the applications filed seeking permission for destruction are pending with special courts thereby causing delay. The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed seeking bail or anticipatory bail in cases booked under NDPS Act. The judge observed that the total quantity of ganja involved in these cases approximately comes to 3,848 kg. This quantity in the petitions filed in a month exposes the volume of the contraband in circulation within a few districts and warrants serious consideration. The judge said that the state public prosecutor fairly submitted that pursuant to the orders of the Supreme Court, destruction of contraband was carried out in January 2019. However, the destroyed quantity is unknown. Thereafter, no further destruction was not carried out. Hence, the judge sought a report with details including number of cases registered for possession of commercial quantities of ganja in the last 10 years and how the contraband is preserved; the quantity of contraband destroyed in 2019 and whether the remaining quantity is in safe custody. The case was adjourned to September 16 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hc-seeks-registry-report-on-narcotic-drugs-in-custody-of-special-courts/articleshow/86151427.cms||---
---||Delhi||No waterlogging in Delhi in a few years, assures CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: After inaugurating the newly redeveloped stretch of Chandni Chowk on Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Aam Aadmi Party government had inherited a bad drainage system from the previous governments. “Delhi government will completely overhaul the city’s drainage system as part of a massive plan, but it will take some time to improve the drainage that has been in a bad condition for years. I can assure that in a few years, there will be no waterlogging during rains, but this will take some time,” Kejriwal said after the inauguration. The CM’s assurance comes a day after many parts of the city faced major waterlogging following a record downpour. After inaugurating the redeveloped and beautified 1.4km stretch from Red Fort to Fatehpuri mosque, Kejriwal announced that street food stalls would be allowed to remain open in the area till midnight. “We have noticed that pedestrians come here at night to experience the deep-rooted legacy of these streets. We plan on further extending services of street food stalls to develop the area into a night tourism spot. People will be able to enjoy themselves here even after the markets shut till around midnight,” said Kejriwal, adding that the beautification project had been a great success. Kejriwal said whenever someone talked of Delhi, they remembered Chandni Chowk for sure, but the area’s image was that of broken roads, traffic jams and electric wires hanging all around. He added that Delhi government had carried out the redevelopment and beautification project in the last three years and people were loving it. “Not just local residents, but people from across Delhi are coming to see Chandni Chowk now. The traffic problem of the area has been resolved, CCTV cameras have been installed and electrical wires are now underground. Chandni Chowk has become one of the most beautiful and important tourist spots of Delhi. We have plans to develop Chandni Chowk as a tourist spot,” said the CM, adding these plans would be finalised in the coming days. Urban development minister Satyendar Jain said, “All the major problems of the area, like roads and overhanging wires, have been dealt with. We will further give the entire area a facelift and a splendid look. We will soon operate electrical vehicles that match the look of the area for the convenience of people.” He later tweeted that the redevelopment work was a glimpse of how Delhi government would make the entire city the most beautiful in the world. Movement of vehicles on the stretch is restricted from 9am to 9pm. The road has facilities like toilets, water ATMs and dustbins for pedestrians to walk without inconvenience. Seating bollards and sandstone seats have also been installed and adequate lighting and CCTV cameras have been installed as safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-waterlogging-in-capital-in-a-few-years-assures-cm/articleshow/86149843.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Petitioner S Vengatesan of Madurai, a goods vehicle driver, said his daughter Shanmugapriya had secured 92.8% marks in Class X and 91.54% in Class XII and has been preparing for NEET for two years determined to become a doctor. She had applied for the test by uploading her details online. However, on Saturday, they were shocked to see the photograph of a male candidate called Alex Pandian and his signature on the admit card she downloaded. Though his daughter sent an e-mail to National Testing Agency (NTA) seeking to correct the details, there was no response. Justice R Suresh Kumar observed that a perusal of the admit card shows that all details such as her name, roll number, gender, category, application number and father’s name have been printed correctly as uploaded by the petitioner’s daughter, but for the photo and signature which were strangely of a male candidate. This shows that it is her admit card. Such a mistake could not have emanated from Shanmugapriya but only at the side of NTA, the judge said. Taking into account that she was a bright student, the judge passed the interim order directing NTA and authorities at the exam centre to permit the girl to appear for NEET without raising any objection. Following the court’s direction, Shanmugapriya was allowed to appear for the exam at a centre set up at Solamalai College of Engineering in Madurai. The judge adjourned the case to September 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-allows-girl-who-got-admit-card-with-wrong-photo-to-write-exam/articleshow/86151455.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man slips in rainwater, electrocuted, say kin||NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man died after he accidentally touched an electric pole in south Delhi’s Maidan Garhi on Friday. The deceased, identified as Mahender, worked as a labourer and resided in the Bhati Mines area of Maidan Garhi. According to police, they received information about a man getting electrocuted after an electricity pole late of Friday night. “During enquiry, it was found that Mahender was electrocuted after he came in contact with an electricity pole near his house. He was rushed to AIIMS, where doctors declared him brought dead,” an officer said. Later on Saturday, a BSES staff visited the spot and cut the supply to the pole. Mahender’s relative, Balbir, said that rainwater had accumulated on the street on Friday. “Mahender was going to his friend’s house when he accidentally slipped and touched a live wire attached to the pole,” the relative said. Residents rushed to help him but they, too, suffered electric shocks. “Locals put all-out efforts to save Mahender. He was rushed to hospital where he was declared dead,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kin-man-slips-in-rainwater-electrocuted/articleshow/86149858.cms||---

Earlier the issue persisted only during monsoon. However, now the manholes overflow all the time, a resident said. “It just shows that the underground drainage (UGD) system is not able to bear the heavy load, which is why it overflows at night as well,” said Ravi, a resident of Anna Nagar. K Janarthanan of Periyar Street said that they complained to the Madurai Corporation officials and they sent a vehicle to clear it up, but just after a few hours, the sewage water starts to overflow again. At 2nd main road in Gomathipuram, a small puddle has formed with sewage water. President of the Gomathipuram-Thendral Nagar residents’ welfare association, D Raghavan said that the existing UGD in Gomathipuram was laid in 2000, when there were just 600 houses, now there are over 1,500 houses in the area. “A UGD system should be upgraded every ten years, but this system has not been upgraded for 20 years, and the corporation should stop giving new connections till the system is upgraded,” he said. A Rs 291 crore project had been planned to provide a new UGD system for 15 wards in the northern part of the city. “This has only been on paper for long,” said S Asokan, a resident of Tahsildar Nagar. The problem persists in other parts of the city also including Gandhi Street in Bethaniapuram and Nataraj Nagar in Kochadai in ward 22. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said that he would look into the issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sewage-overflowing-from-manholes-in-madurai-irk-residents/articleshow/86151505.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Bhagwant Mann's supporters continue to campaign for him||JALANDHAR: Even as Aam Aadmi Party’s lone Lok Sabha member and Punjab unit president Bhagwant Mann has stopped meeting party workers now, his supporters in the state continue to campaign on social media for him to be declared the party’s chief ministerial candidate. Even acrimony is palpable in the tone of quite a few of his supporters and they are not refraining from taking digs at party supremo Arvind Kejriwal. After Kejriwal lectured his party workers on Saturday that they should not hanker for posts, several supporters of Mann are pointing out that the CM is holding two posts himself and even the party constitution has been amended to facilitate his continuation as party convener. They are also saying that on one side he lectured party volunteers but on the other, leaders from traditional parties were being inducted and being directly made party candidates. They cited recent such examples. For some days, Mann’s supporters from different parts of Punjab kept on rushing to his place in Sangrur to express solidarity with him, as an unannounced campaign to impress upon the party high command to declare him CM candidate is on. These turn outs at his place were seen as show of strength by his camp. Mann has also been maintaining distance from daily party activities, unlike the past when he would appear the most active face at party events. As the campaign picked up momentum, this apparently did not please the central party leadership. AAP insiders revealed that his camp was conveyed that the pressure tactics could have adverse impact. On September 7, Mann announced that due to meetings of parliamentary committees he would have to go Delhi and he announced to discontinue meetings with volunteers from September 8. However, his supporters have not given up. Several of them are making it clear that no other CM face would be accepted and Mann is the only choice if party wants to win in Punjab. A split is also visible among party workers on social media as a section arguing to go with central party leadership’s decision.  Several have commented on Mann’s Facebook page that he should not give up as party needed him to win in Punjab. Though AAP’s central leadership has been maintaining silence on the issue, a shift in tone of Mann’s supporters is clear. Unlike earlier times, when they would express unquestioned faith in Kejriwal, they have started questioning him also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mann-supporters-continue-to-campaign-for-him/articleshow/86151479.cms||IP Singh

---||Delhi||Rain to continue this week in Delhi||NEW DELHI: After Saturday’s spell of heavy rain, which saw Delhi cross the 1,100 mm mark for monsoon rainfall this year, the city recorded another rainy day on Sunday. While the conditions were overcast throughout the day, most parts of the capital only recorded drizzle and light rain. IMD has forecast rain next week, too, but said heavy showers were unlikely with a spell of light rain more likely throughout the week. Safdarjung — Delhi’s base station — received 41.1 mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period till 8.30am on Sunday. Over the next nine hours, it received 0.8 mm of rainfall, taking the seasonal rainfall figure to 1,141.8 mm between June 1 and September 12. The last time Delhi recorded more rainfall in the monsoon season between June and September was in 2003, when Safdarjung received 1,051.7 mm of rainfall, IMD data revealed. Palam, Lodhi Road and Ridge stations also received “very light” to “light” rainfall on Sunday, recording 2.4 mm, 0.4 mm and ‘trace’ rainfall, respectively, between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Ayanagar was the only station to receive “moderate” rainfall of 36.3 mm in the same period. “Delhi will continue to see some form of rain activity this week, however, for the most part, it will consist of light showers,” said a met official. So far this September, Safdarjung has received 385.5mm of rainfall till 5.30pm on Sunday. This is the highest September monthly rainfall recorded so far since 1944, when 417.3mm was recorded in the month. Forecast for Monday shows light rain, with a maximum and minimum of 33 and 25 degrees Celsius, respectively. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, remained in the lower range of the “satisfactory” category after Saturday’s downpour, with the air quality index averaging 60, as per the CPCB index. Agencies forecast the air quality to remain in a similar range for the next three days, with rain expected to continue this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-to-continue-this-week-but-met-sees-light-showers/articleshow/86149866.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Manja injures cop on Maa flyover||KOLKATA: A Kolkata Traffic Police sergeant who was on his way to report for duty at the Avishikta Crossing on EM Bypass on Sunday morning was severely injured on the Maa flyover after a kite thread cut through his neck despite wearing a helmet. He has been identified as Rupam Saha, presently posted with the Purba Jadavpur traffic guard. The incident took place around 8.15am when he was riding his personal scooterette, going from Park Circus towards Science City near Vishwakarma Building under Beniapukur police station. Saha was later treated and discharged from a private hospital off EM Bypass. "He insisted that he take up duty at the Avishikta Crossing after his release," said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. “He did not call up his colleagues in the East Traffic Guard instead, he himself rode to the private hospital with the help of other motorists,” said an officer at Lalbazar. This was the latest of the series of accidents involving the manja used to fly kites. While this is the 15th such incident this year, two other cops were injured earlier by these threads since the beginning of the lockdown. This is the first time that a sergeant himself has been injured in a kite string accident, claimed traffic police sources. “The KMDA which has set up nets is working on a 900 metre stretch on the Science City- Park Circus flank in the second phase. Ttraffic is shut on this lane between 11pm and 5am at for this reason. The six-hour block is likely to continue till September 22. The netting is being taken up to height of 4 metre and then another layer is coming up at 5 metre and is expected to reach bridge number 4 in due time. Bikers should have a safer ride after this,” said an officer from the southeast division. Among the major suggestions police made to the KMDA to stop kite thread accidents Maa flyover was to set up wire nettings across the entire flyover stretch (instead of only one accident prone stretch) and increase the wire height considerably to ensure that two-wheeler riders do not manage to fall off the flyover even in case of an accident. KMDA had earlier taken a pilot project on a stretch of 25 metres near bridge number 4 consisting of vertical poles and three layers of horizontal wires. “It has been observed that this ilot project was successful in preventing two-wheeler accidents. We are planning to give a similar proposal for AJC Bose Road flyover,” said an East traffic guard officer. “Under such circumstances, we have also sought two major modifications on how these nets should be put up. We have recommended that additional three layers of wires may be installed to cover the lower portion closer to the railing to stop any chances of riders falling over. Similarly, the iron bars installed to set up the wires may be wrapped with retro-reflectors to warn riders, especially in the upcoming winter season when visibility drops,” said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/manja-injures-sergeant-on-maa-flyover/articleshow/86149560.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Rain damages portion of Delhi-Meerut Expressway||NEW DELHI: The recent heavy rain in the National Capital Region has damaged some portions of the newly built greenfield stretch of Dasna-Meerut on Delhi-Meerut Expressway. Commuters complained of several damaged portions on the extreme left lanes on both the carriageways, which have been barricaded to warn the commuters. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to start tolling on this stretch of the expressway soon. “When the commuters will pay a higher toll charge than any NH stretch since it’s an expressway where slow moving vehicles won’t be allowed, the NHAI has to ensure smooth drive throughout the corridor. The authority should also see what has gone wrong in this newly built stretch,” said Praveen Kumar who travelled from Delhi to Meerut on Sunday. NHAI officials said it usually takes one or two monsoons for stabilisation of the earth embankment and for green vegetation on these portions. “But the recent rains have been beyond anyone's expectations. We are working hard to repair the damaged portion. The main six lanes have not been impacted at all. The damages have been on the embankments and the paved shoulders of the expressway,” said an official. Officials said the entire repair and restoration work will be completed soon. “We need around 7 days of dry spell. But all efforts are underway to undertake immediate restoration,” another official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-damages-portion-of-meerut-e-way/articleshow/86149869.cms||---
---||Madurai||HC: Recite Tamil hymns, not just Sanskrit, at consecrations||Madurai: Every language spoken by the people is God’s language and it is impossible to believe that God understands only one language, Madras high court has observed while ordering that Tamil hymns/verses should be primarily recited at consecration ceremonies along with those in Sanskrit. A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and B Pugalendhi observed that various kinds of religions and beliefs are in existence in different countries. The places of worship change according to the culture and religion, but only the local language is being used for doing heavenly service in these places. “However, in our country, it is made to believe that Sanskrit alone is God’s language and any other language is not equivalent. No doubt, Sanskrit is an ancient language with enormous ancient literature. The belief is spread in such a way that only if the Sanskrit vedas are recited, the Gods will listen to the prayers of the devotees,” observed the judges. Referring to various ancient literatures showing the importance given to Tamil hymns at temples, the court said therefore it cannot be said that only one language alone is God’s language. The theory that God understands only one language cannot be believed, the judges said. If Tamil hymns cannot be used in temples situated in Tamil Nadu, it cannot be used anywhere else. Observing that the practice of reciting Tamil hymns had slowly vanished in the state, the judges ordered that they should be primarily recited during consecration ceremonies at temples along with Sanskrit hymns. The judges directed the state government to constitute a committee of Tamil scholars and devotees to identify and consolidate important and ancient Tamil hymns composed by saints such as Nayanmars, Alwars, Arunagirinathar, Pattinathar. The committee should consult with experts and all other stakeholders connected with temples and file a report to the government. On receipt of the report, the state government shall take a decision regarding the date from which consecration ceremonies would be conducted in Tamil or by giving equal importance along with Sanskrit, said the judges. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed last year by D Ponnusamy of Chennai who sought a direction to conduct the consecration ceremony of Pasupatheeswarar Temple in Karur district in Tamil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-recite-tamil-hymns-not-just-sanskrit-at-consecrations/articleshow/86151489.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Moderately tough NEET could push cut-off down||CHENNAI: Expecting an easy question paper like last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, medical aspirants from the state said they were surprised by the tough physics questions in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) 2021 conducted on Sunday. Candidates said biology was easier and chemistry moderately difficult. Experts predict a slight dip in scores compared to the previous year. Around one lakh candidates from 18 cities in the state took the test at 224 centres that adhered to strict Covid-19 protocols. In Chennai, of 17,992 registered students, 800 were absent (attendance 96%). Likewise, Salem (96.1%), Trichy (96%) and Coimbatore (98.7%) recorded good attendance while Madurai city had 88%. J S Dharani from Chennai said the physics paper was the toughest so far in NEET. "NTA has not considered the pandemic situation. Out of 45 questions in physics, 35 were tough as they were based on calculations. The choices were also very close and tough," she said. Kushal Seervi from Chennai, who is writing the exam for the second time, said he left a few questions in physics fearing negative marks. "It will be very difficult to score full marks," he said. B K Lokesh said the additional options were tricky and so students needed more time. Students said the biology section was easier as the options were vastly different and students can identify correct answers easily. M Jayashree, from a government school in the city, said biology questions were easier as they were direct. "Physics questions were largely based on calculations and choices were similar. Fearing negative marks, I skipped some questions," she said. N Prasanth from Madurai said the arrangements for the exam were smooth. “Covid-19 safety was a bit of a concern for my family but the safety measures in place were reassuring. The exam also went on without any disruptions and instructions were clearly explained. Wearing masks for hours was a bit tough but still it was manageable and I was able to concentrate,” he added. B Pavan Kumar, deputy director of FIITJEE, Chennai, said the question paper was lengthy and many students could not answer all the questions. "Due to the tough paper, students can expect better rank compared to last year. For example, a student with 650 marks out of 720 in NEET got a rank around 2,000 last year. This year students will get 1,600 rank for the same mark," he said. P Prameela, academics director, Narayana Educational Institutions, said the paper was not like the NEET 2020 paper, which was easier. "It was a concept-based paper and lengthier. We are not expecting full marks this year and a score above 650 may get below 100 rank this year," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/moderately-tough-neet-could-push-cut-off-down/articleshow/86151561.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Centre, state conspiring to end cooperatives in Pb: SAD||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has said that the BJP-led Union government and Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab government were conspiring to end cooperative societies in the state to ruin farmers. The SAD added that the decision of the state government to reduce DAP fertilizer share to farmers through societies from 80% to 50% was a clear indication that the Congress government was implementing the hidden agenda of the BJP. Party’s kisan wing president Sikander Singh Maluka said it was shocking that instead of working for strengthening the cooperative structure in the state, the Congress government was working to completely eliminate this sector. He said the cooperative societies were the backbone of the farming community. “This sector provides subsidised fertilizers and other services to farmers already facing the brunt of high input cost of farming,” he added. Maluka said that instead of providing relief to farmers, both Centre and state governments were working against farmers. He said due to the reduction in manufacturing of fertilizers from 5.5 lakh MT to 1.25 lakh MT, lesser supply available in the market. “The shortage of supply is directly related to the reduction in the Rs. 8,000 per tonne subsidy which was being denied to manufacturers.” The SAD leader said the cost of inputs for farming had shot up and the marginal farmers were most affected. “ The decision of the state government is nothing but implementation of BJP’s agenda to create atmosphere to hand over the agriculture sector to corporates and others private players.” He also reminded the government that more than 80 % of farmers were directly associated with cooperative societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-state-conspiring-to-end-cooperatives-in-pb-sad/articleshow/86151547.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police start evicting Kalakar Street hawkers||KOLKATA: Police has started evicting hawkers and vendors occupying the footpath around Kalakar Street from Saturday to keep traffic moving on the Burrabazar-Posta segment. The KK Tagore Street and Vivekananda Road traffic flow has been hit due to the Posta flyover demolition work. This, police says, will reduce traffic pressure on MG Road. “The idea is to reclaim the footpath for pedestrians. This will allow more road space for traffic. However, it will be a long term plan and will need some time to be fully executed,” said an officer. Thc cops have bigger plans for Panayapatti Road. The road which acts as a link between MG Road and Brabourne Road, and which presently is being used by thousands of traders and buyers coming in from north Kolkata to exit central Kolkata, has been cleared of encroachers to ensure free movement of smaller vehicles. On Saturday, the cops also launched a plan to remove the parking on this road to a portion adjacent to Brabourne Road. “However, with heavy rains, we stopped the experiment. From next Monday, we will be using these changes extensively,” claimed a police source. Police sources said reopening the entire Strand Road was expected to ease pressure on MG Road. “Though it has helped us a lot, there are still certain challenges while endorsing the one-way measures. East bound traffic of KK Tagore Street now takes a compulsory left turn from KK Tagore Street/Rabindra Sarani Crossing (Ganesh Talkies) further north via Rabindra Sarani. Similarly, Nimtala Ghat Street, from BK Paul to Rabindra Sarani, has been made ‘one-way’ during execution of the work. With no new road option in sight, we are trying to maximise the use of road space,” explained an officer at Lalbazar. Earlier this week, almost three months after a 250-metre stretch of Strand Road North was shut for the demolition work of Posta flyover, Kolkata Traffic police reopened the entire stretch last Monday. This meant vehicles, including route buses and trucks, took the stretch between Mirbarai Ghat Street Crossing- KK Tagore Street crossing on Strand Road for the first time since June earlier this year. Even loaded pedal vans have been allowed back and have been asked to stick to the extreme left lane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-on-hawker-eviction-drive-at-kalakar-street/articleshow/86149610.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

We are not expecting full marks this year and a score above 650 may get below 100 rank this year," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/moderately-tough-neet-could-push-cut-off-down/articleshow/86157594.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Moderately tough NEET could push cut-off down||CHENNAI: Expecting an easy question paper like last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, medical aspirants from the state said they were surprised by the tough physics questions in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) 2021 conducted on Sunday. Candidates said biology was easier and chemistry moderately difficult. Experts predict a slight dip in scores compared to the previous year. Around one lakh candidates from 18 cities in the state took the test at 224 centres that adhered to strict Covid-19 protocols. In Chennai, of 17,992 registered students, 800 were absent (attendance 96%). Likewise, Salem (96.1%), Trichy (96%) and Coimbatore (98.7%) recorded good attendance while Madurai city had 88%. J S Dharani from Chennai said the physics paper was the toughest so far in NEET. "NTA has not considered the pandemic situation. Out of 45 questions in physics, 35 were tough as they were based on calculations. The choices were also very close and tough," she said. Kushal Seervi from Chennai, who is writing the exam for the second time, said he left a few questions in physics fearing negative marks. "It will be very difficult to score full marks," he said. B K Lokesh said the additional options were tricky and so students needed more time. Students said the biology section was easier as the options were vastly different and students can identify correct answers easily. M Jayashree, from a government school in the city, said biology questions were easier as they were direct. "Physics questions were largely based on calculations and choices were similar. Fearing negative marks, I skipped some questions," she said. N Prasanth from Madurai said the arrangements for the exam were smooth. “Covid-19 safety was a bit of a concern for my family but the safety measures in place were reassuring. The exam also went on without any disruptions and instructions were clearly explained. Wearing masks for hours was a bit tough but still it was manageable and I was able to concentrate,” he added. B Pavan Kumar, deputy director of FIITJEE, Chennai, said the question paper was lengthy and many students could not answer all the questions. "Due to the tough paper, students can expect better rank compared to last year. For example, a student with 650 marks out of 720 in NEET got a rank around 2,000 last year. This year students will get 1,600 rank for the same mark," he said. P Prameela, academics director, Narayana Educational Institutions, said the paper was not like the NEET 2020 paper, which was easier. "It was a concept-based paper and lengthier. We are not expecting full marks this year and a score above 650 may get below 100 rank this year," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/moderately-tough-neet-could-push-cut-off-down/articleshow/86157595.cms||---

The victims lost money as their accounts started getting debited due to repeated withdrawals from ATMs in Bihar, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. CCTV footage in the city captured an ATM fraudster using a four-wheeler. At least four people are behind the ATM skimming, a fraud wherein criminals steal information from the cards inserted into the ATM machines with a microchip and a small camera to read their passwords. Despite alerts from the cyber cell, police stations are yet to register FIRs in most cases. No concrete action has been initiated from them to unearth the gangs involved in attaching skimmers or such cloning devices in the ATM machines located in the MIDC, Hingna and Wadi stretch in the outskirts of the city. It's learnt that several ATM users started getting messages in their registered mobile phones about amounts being debited from their accounts. The bewildered citizens rushed to block their ATM cards; many approached police stations. The citizens were told to approach the cyber crime cell of the crime branch. As the victims made a beeline at the cyber cell, their complaints were traced before being referred to police stations for registration of FIR. Recounting his ordeal, retired public works department (PWD) engineer Vilas Admane — who lost Rs69,000 in the fraud — said he had withdrawn Rs9,000 on August 25 from a State Bank of India ATM at Saraswati Complex near Hingna Road T-point. “On August 30, someone thrice withdrew Rs10,000 from my wife's account but my son, who had received messages from the bank on his cellphone, thought that it was me,” said Admane. "The crooks withdrew more cash on different occasions from my account using the ATM information, before we could realize it and block the card," added Admane, who did not receive any calls from either Ranapratap Nagar, MIDC or Hingna police station. MIDC station senior inspector Umesh Besarkar said he had received information from the cyber cell but the station was planning to take details from the banks too, regarding the debit transactions through the ATMs, and file a composite FIR common to all. “There is no delay. We are working on the details,” said Besarkar.

The legislator, who took the BJP membership in the presence of union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and state party chief Madan Kaushik, is the second serving MLA to defect to BJP in Uttarakhand in just a week. Earlier, independent MLA from Dhanaulti Pritam Singh Panwar — a minister in the previous Congress government — had also joined the BJP. Rajkumar was with the BJP but joined the Congress in 2017 after he did not get a BJP ticket to fight elections. After joining the ruling party on Sunday, Rajkumar, praised the BJP government for developmental works like Char Dham all-weather road. He also said that “Congress had made Dalits dependent on sops, but the BJP has worked to make them self-reliant." CM Dhami, meanwhile, said that Rajkumar was a grassroots leader and his induction into the party would improve its chances in the upcoming polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cong-mla-joins-bjp-2nd-legislator-to-defect-in-a-wk/articleshow/86147680.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Trichy||DPR work begins on Rs 425cr Uyyakondan revamp plan||Trichy: The river conservancy (RC) division of the public works department (PWD) has commenced preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) on preventing sewage discharge into the Uyyakondan irrigation canal that is passing through Trichy city. Estimated at a cost of Rs 425 crore, the plan is to revamp the entire 79km canal to ensure seamless flow of water. An 8-km stretch of the waterbody within the city limits will get special attention to make it clean and suitable to address domestic needs. The Chola-era contour canal, a distributary of the Cauvery, originates from Pettavaithalai and ends near Boodhalur in Thanjavur district, irrigating more than 30,000 acres of land. Fencing both banks of the channel are planned for the entire stretch to prevent encroachments. “Since water is not flowing till the tail-end area, we will have to remove the steel bridges across the canal. Some of the RCC bridges accessed by the public might be strengthened,” an official source with PWD said. At Raja colony, Anna Nagar, Palakkarai, Alwarthope and Thiruverumbur in the city, the canal faces heavy pollution as households in at least 18 locations have been discharging sewage and sullage into it. The PWD has planned two solutions to save the canal from pollution. One is to establish a parallel baby canal to collect sewage, from where wastewater will be pumped to the sewage treatment plant (STP) or a proposal to establish pipelines parallel to the canal to collect and pump wastewater to STP. “We will complete the DPR in the next few days. Civil work to revamp the canal may continue for two years,” a PWD official said. The DPR will focus on revamping the entire stretch of the canal, which include modernisation of sluices, head sluices and regulators. At least 130 structures in the canal will be overhauled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dpr-work-begins-on-rs-425cr-uyyakondan-revamp-plan/articleshow/86151597.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kolkata||Cops go ‘live’ with tips against cyber crime||Kolkata: Concerned over the rise in frauds at ATMs, on social networking sites and on e-commerce sites during the pandemic, the detective department organized its first Facebook Live on Monday. Words of caution against online bank fraud by anti-bank fraud OC Neelkanta Roy set the tone for the event. The cyber cell, which helmed the second part of the programme, covered digital crimes, such as cheating in the name of providing food coupons, Whatsapp and Facebook hacking and tricking bank details out of unsuspectinhg citizens. The emphasis was on ensuring OTP protection and passwords. “Nowadays, the devices you are using for high-value bank transactions are being used by kids for online lessons. So, following basic internet rules is important,” said an officer. Warning against downloading apps without studying their sources, police asked to be careful while uploading photos online. “Update your computer software,” said the police. Officers asked those duped to call on 8585063104 and inform about the losses immediately. Police have listed nine methods used by cyber crooks and put up advisory against each of them. The south division launched the pilot project on Friday and tweeted the list. First, said cops, no one should rely on customer care numbers found on a search engine but contact the official websites. “Do not click on links from unknown numbers or emails. Do not receive VoIP calls or video calls from unknown numbers. Be careful with online transactions. Try to pay on delivery when ordering from new websites. Most calls about SIM, ATM blocks or KYC updates are fake. Be careful on the use of crypto currency and bitcoin. Never share your OTP and do not fall for implausible ads,” said an officer. The event registered 623 viewers—one of the most-attended Lalbazar events —with 44 shares and 237 comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-go-live-with-tips-against-cyber-crime/articleshow/86180227.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

There are allegations that over three times are being quoted for the signboards than the market rate. An independent councillor has announced that he will file a police complaint and approach the Punjab and Haryana high court demanding action. He has also demanded from the council authorities to stop making payment to the agency that have provided the boards or get ready to face criminal liability. In all, 465 signboards have been put up in the town and according to councillors every board has been shown to have cost Rs 7400. Three times winner councillor Hem Raj Garg said these board have cost the council Rs 2000-2,100 per board and the rate has been inflated by Rs 5,300-5,400 per board thus increasing the cost of all the boards by Rs 25 lakh. He also said 300 more boards are yet to put up. Meanwhile, Congress leader Kuldeep Singh who is claiming party ticket for upcoming assembly elections, said “Municipal council is working against the zero corruption tolerance policy of Congress and defaming chief minister Amarinder Singh government. I will file complaint with Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and the CM,” He also offered to donate some sign boards to municipal council by getting prepared at Rs 2,000 per board to get the authorities ashamed and will ask not to embezzle tax payers hard-earned money. Barnala municipal council president Gurjit Singh Ramniwasia avoided talking to TOI though he has on record said every board cost them Rs 7,400. Municipal council executive officer (EO) Mohit Sharma when contacted denied any wrongdoing. He said, the agenda was passed in the house meeting before he had joined as EO. But I am told better quality material has been used for signboards and work has been done in transparent manner but some persons are unnecessarily raising the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/signboard-scam-barnala-mc-says-rs-2000-board-bought-for-rs-7400/articleshow/86151594.cms||Neel Kamal

On Sunday, the association members submitted a request to municipal administration minister K N Nehru at Srirangam regarding this. The association comprising temple priests and workers from Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam and three other Vaishnavite temples in Thiruvellarai, Woraiyur and Anbil localities sought the state government to allow traditional rights to the temple workers for performing various religious services in the four temples. “We are not opposing the government orders or decisions, but we are placing a request with the government not to alter the existing system as handed down by tradition in the four temples,” B Jegannathabhattar, secretary, welfare association for temple service workers in Srirangam and sub-temples. Around 330 such temple workers are involved in the four temple services in the district serving various religious works.

AAP’s Aman Arora claimed the Congress and the Akali Dal had been rejected by the people of the state and barred from entering the village and cities. “Seeing the opposition of the people, both these parties want to create terror among the people at the time of elections by imposing the President’s rule in Punjab at the behest of PM Modi,” he alleged. Condemning the “atrocities” on the farmers in Moga, the MLA claimed the attack on the farmers protesting peacefully by the “goons of the Akali Dal’s constituent Student Organisation of India (SOI)” was a well-planned conspiracy of Sukhbir Badal, which makes it clear that SAD wanted to disturb the peace and harmony of Punjab and get the President’s rule imposed in the state. He said the clash between BJP and the Congress workers in Ludhiana was also a part of this episode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-badals-want-to-spoil-atmosphere-at-behest-of-modi-aap/articleshow/86151634.cms||---

What stood out in some central districts including Trichy was the offer of gifts by civic bodies which prompted many to take the shot. Madurai district saw an overwhelming response with 1.15 lakh people getting the jab with some sites running out of vaccine stock. In Trichy district, 1.06 lakh people took the shot with about 18,200 of them in the city. “Our target was 95,000 but we achieved more than 1,15,000 beneficiaries in a single day, which is a mile stone as on the previous day we vaccinated only 10,000. Since we brought the vaccination closer to homes through polling booths, many were eager to come forward and get vaccinated,” said Dr S Senthil Kumar, DDHS, Madurai. Trichy corporation had mobilised 400 premedical staff to organise the drive at 126 locations on the lines of oral polio vaccination (OPV) drive. This apart, vaccination centres were organized at bus stands, railway junction and airport. K Abishekapuram zone had announced prizes for residents taking the jab at its vaccination centres. Prizes such as free tokens to dine at hotels, silk saris, Android smartphones and gas stoves were announced by the civic body through lot-based selection. Officials said free gifts lured some residents even from other zones to take the jab at K Abishekapuram. Periyanayagipuram village near Peravurani in Thanjavur saw panchayat president Muthuraman providing stainless steel plates to villagers who got vaccinated. Three people who got vaccinated with the first dose in the panchayat received cash awards of Rs 1,500, Rs 1,000 and Rs 500. Pattukkottai revenue division also rewarded top-performing village panchayats in vaccination by awarding cash prizes to the respective panchayat chiefs. “We have managed to vaccinate 18,200 people with 17,000 doses received. All the 126 locations exhausted the vaccine stock,” P M N Mujibur Rahuman, commissioner, Trichy corporation said. In Karur, a total of 61,724 people took the jab on Sunday. In Madurai, vaccination sites were organized at 1,500 locations — 900 in rural and 600 in city limits. “We were able to finally get the Covid-19 vaccine in this drive quickly at a nearby place,” said K Tamilarasi, a 34-year-old resident of Narimedu. Another beneficiary said he was pleasantly surprised to walk into a PHC and get vaccinated. With local body officials and resident welfare associations also chipping in to create awareness, the drive saw good response at grassroots level. Some of the southern districts which had been vaccinating less than 10,000 a day on average saw more than 50,000 get the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/overwhelming-response-in-south-central-districts/articleshow/86151686.cms||---

The fresh water from rivers and lakes was filled into utensils before the rituals were carried out. The women and girls surrounding the symbolic ‘Gauri’ sang songs and played the traditional ‘jimma-phugadi’. Other women devotees installed idols of ‘Gauri’ besides the idol of Lord Ganesha at home. “It is the choice of women to either bring the idol or the symbolic Gauri home. However, the enthusiasm to bring Gauri home always remain high,” said Ashwini Patil, a resident of Ravivar Peth. The two sisters — Jyeshta and Kanishta — of Lord Ganesha arrive on the third day of the 10-day festival. The idols are decorated by women. Some women choose to decorate idols in traditional attire while some choose fancy clothes. Women also prepare the symbolic ‘bhaji-bhakri’ meal for ‘Gauri’ on first day.

---||Dehradun||New appointments to pacify Sikh farmers ahead of polls?||Dehradun: Three key posts in Uttarakhand — the governor, the chief secretary and the head of the minority commission — are now held by members of the Sikh community, prompting political observers to say that the appointments made by the BJP are meant to mitigate the damage caused to the party's image by farmers’ protests in Terai region, which has a significant number of Sikh farmers. Sikh farmers in Uttarakhand’s Terai region -- which includes Udham Singh Nagar and the plains of Nainital district -- have lended support to the farmers’ agitation against farm laws in west UP. Political experts said the recent appointees have been carefully selected so as to pacify the miffed Sikh farmers in Terai where the BJP’s internal assessment suggests that the party may fare badly. “The recent appointments carried out by the BJP clearly show an aim to control the possible political damage in Terai by the farmers’ protests. There is a substantial population of Sikhs in Udham Singh Nagar district who are currently unhappy with the ruling party,” said SMA Kazmi, a political analyst. Notably, R P Singh, a Sikh MLA from Delhi, was made the co-election in-charge for Uttarakhand by the BJP. Political experts said the appointment of Lt General Gurmit Singh (retd) as the new governor of Uttarakhand was also meant to send a message to both Punjab and Uttarakhand which are going to polls early next year. Significantly, Udham Singh Nagar has nine assembly seats. Analysts said leaders from the region have also been given key posts in the government. While Pushkar Singh Dhami who hails from Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar was appointed CM recently, Ajay Bhatt, MP from the Nainital-Udham Singh Nagar seat, was made minister of state for defence and tourism in the Union cabinet by PM Narendra Modi. “It’s evident that the BJP has been focusing on the Kumaon region in the forthcoming assembly elections. This is because Kumaon is the stronghold of their main opponent, former CM Harish Rawat,” said Kazmi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-appointments-to-pacify-sikh-farmers-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/86147713.cms||---

Speaking to media persons at Bathinda on Sunday, Mann said, “Undue delay has been caused in holding of SGPC elections in Punjab and these should be held at the earliest without making any further delays as the Shiromani Akali Dal is controlling the august house without elections for a long time. The panthic groups should assemble at Amritsar on September 18 and should seek holding of the elections without causing any more delays”. Mann also termed blanket bail given to former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini in all cases as unfortunate. He said, “With it, the eluding justice in cases of sacrilege and subsequently killing of two Sikh protesters in police firing at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, will be further delayed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mann-calls-for-congregation-of-panthic-groups-to-demand-sgpc-polls/articleshow/86151679.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Surge in Puja shoppers, cratered roads, showers bring weekend traffic to crawl||KOLKATA: The traffic on weekend evenings slowed down to a crawl, resembling the roads on weekday peak hours. A sudden surge in Puja shoppers heading to malls, markets and stores, potholed roads and intermittent showers added up to lead to the travel woes, said police and KMC officials. Shopping hit a feverish pitch with large crowds turning up at malls, stores and big markets over Friday, Saturday, and Sunday ahead of Durga Puja, now less than a month away. The spike in the number of shoppers posed a challenge for traffic police who had a difficult time managing the sudden surge in cars to the hubs and demanding parking space around them. Jam on Jawaharlal Nehru RoadThe scene was particularly bad in Gariahat, Prince Anwar Shah Road, Lindsay Street, S N Banerjee Road and Hatibagan. Kolkata Traffic Police officers pointed to the difficulty they faced in keeping the vehicles moving, something that was not witnessed last year when fear of the pandemic had forced many to stay indoors. But now that many have been vaccinated, people have started stepping out in numbers for customary Puja purchase, throwing Covid caution to the winds, police said. The poor condition of roads added to travel woes as potholed stretches slowed down vehicles even in parts, where the crowds thinned. “Repairing the roads that are in a mess due to the heavy rain is urgently required. But we cannot take it up till there is a dry spell,” said a KMC roads department official. KMC now must revise its three-week timeline for road repairs before October 5. A crater on E M BypassAt Gariahat, police tried to keep shoppers off the road, but with the crowd swelling between 5pm and 8pm, pedestrians spilled on to the streets and led to jams. Elsewhere, police used manual traffic signalling. Off Prince Anwar Shah Road, residents of Jodhpur Park complained of a two-wheeler mess in the lanes. On Jawaharlal Nehru Road near New Market, police did not allow any taxi or app cab to park. But traffic still moved slowly due to the sheer volume of traffic. But shop owners complained that with hawkers encroaching on parking space on Bertram Street, Lindsay Street and Humayun Place, shoppers either left or had chauffeurs drive around in circles. Asok Gupta, president of SS Hogg Market Traders’ Association, said nearly 10,000 shoppers turned up on Saturday, far more than that last year. At malls, such as South City and Acropolis, the parking lots filled up by afternoon. This meant, those who arrived later had to find a parking slot outside or ask the chauffeur to do the rounds till they found a place. Though additional cops were deployed at all shopping hubs, the bumper-to-bumper traffic still made flow a challenge. South City and Acropolis drew 1.75 lakh and 70,000 people over the three days. The shopping frenzy gave rise to anxiety over the virus spread. While malls still maintained Covid-safety protocols and trying to ensure all patrons are masked, the use of masks were nowhere to be seen at Gariahat, Hatibagan and Bertram Street, where shoppers jostled for space as they walked down rows of shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/surge-in-puja-shoppers-cratered-roads-showers-bring-weekend-traffic-to-crawl/articleshow/86180301.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: 42% hospitalized Covid patients had neurological symptoms during illness||CHANDIGARH: Neurological symptoms have been significantly reported in hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Punjab, with about 42% of infected individuals reporting these during illness, according to a study conducted at different hospitals. In the study "Neurological manifestations of Covid-19 hospitalized patients in the state of Punjab", the data of a total of 1,000 hospitalized cases reported between November 2020 and April 2021 was analysed. From the most common neurological symptoms such as headache and hyposmia (loss of smell), serious complications like seizures and stroke have been noted among hospitalized patients in the state. Experts have called for constant monitoring of critically ill patients to see any progression of neurological symptoms. Of total participants, 62.5% were male and 37.5% females while the most common comorbidities seen in patients were hypertension 34.8%, diabetes mellitus 18.8%, ischemic heart disease 8.2% and cerebrovascular disease 5.2%. As many as 672 patients, which accounts for 67.2% of total participants, exhibited neurological symptoms. The most common neurological symptoms exhibited by patients were headache 313 (31.3%) and dizziness 112 (11.2%), followed by hyposmia 52 (5.2%), encephalopathy 78 (7.8%) and more serious complications like seizures 18 (1.8%) and stroke 28 (2.8%). A total of 36 patients presented with encephalopathy, whereas 78 (7.8%) developed encephalopathy during the hospital stay. The other common presenting manifestations were fever 945 (94.5%), cough 643 (64.3%), and dyspnea -- difficult or laboured breathing -- 476 (47.6%). The results of the study reveal that neurological manifestations were the presenting feature in 58 (5.8%) cases while at least 42% of the patients develop neurological involvement during illness. The study found that many Covid patients who presented with vascular and inflammatory neurological diseases like stroke, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and facial nerve palsy had mild or no respiratory symptoms. Thus, the experts recommend that all patients presenting with acute neurological illness be screened for Covid-19 during the pandemic The researchers stressed that infected patients with comorbidities are at risk and monitoring of neurological symptoms is of utmost importance as it will not only indicate negative and positive progression of their condition, but will also help in preventing the worsening of the patients’ health. Finding of the research has been published in a special edition on Covid-19 of Bangladesh Journal of Medical Science. "The patients who present with new‐onset focal neurology, with or without the presence of coryzal symptoms, should be reviewed and treated with the suspicion of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. All this monitoring will allow the early detection of Covid-19 infection and, therefore, will lead to the prevention of deterioration of the disease," concluded the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/42-hospitalized-covid-patients-had-neurological-symptoms-during-illness/articleshow/86151669.cms||Vinod Kumar
---||Ranchi||Babulal Marandi’s aide held in UP for sexual harassment||RANCHI: The absconding political advisor of Jharkhand’s first chief minister and current BJP leader, Babulal Marandi, was arrested from Itwa district of Uttar Pradesh by a team of Ranchi police on Sunday morning. Marandi and BJP have termed the arrest as vendetta politics. The political advisor, Sunil Tiwari, has been absconding since August 16 after his former maid, a 20-year-old girl, filed a police complaint against him for sexual harassment. Based on her complaint, Argora Police here had filed a case against Tiwari under sections 376 (1), 354, 504 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (2) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on August 16. After filing the case, the Ranchi Police set up three teams to track down and arrest Tiwari. Police sources said the complainant, who was working at Tiwari’s house, had accused him of inappropriate behaviour and sexual harassment. Police also filed a case of child labour against Tiwari after they found that he kept underaged children at his house while investigating the girl’s complaint. On September 8, state labour superintendent Avinash Krishna filed an FIR under Section 14(1) of the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition) Act, 1986, against Tiwari on the directions of the Child Welfare Committee after the police were informed that a group of children stayed in Tiwari’s house and worked there. Talking to TOI, Ranchi SP (rural) Naushad Alam, who is also in charge of SP (Ranchi city), said, “Tiwari has been arrested by a team of Ranchi Police and he is likely to be produced before a magistrate on Monday. Once the team gets a transit remand from the magistrate in Uttar Pradesh, he will be shifted to Ranchi as per the procedures of the law.” On being asked if Tiwari was admitted to any hospital after his arrest, Alam said he does not have any such information as of now. Tiwari’s counsel and senior advocate R S Majumdar said, “We had applied for an anticipatory bail petition which was to be heard on Monday and the case’s sequence was number nine on the day’s list. Tiwari is a lawyer and his record said he was a whistleblower in a rape case against chief minister Hemant Soren which was filed by a Mumbai-based woman in 2013.” Meanwhile, BJP has termed the arrest as an act of vendetta politics by the Hemant Soren government and said Tiwari has been targeted by the state government as he had moved the Supreme Court on July 29 this year to fast-track the case filed at the Bombay high court against Soren. Former chief minister Babulal Marandi also termed the arrest as a political vendetta and said they had known that the “Soren government will do something like this against his men after it failed to intimidate Tewari”. “Suspecting that he will be embroiled in a fake case, Tiwari had written a letter to DGP of Jharkhand and the chief secretary on July 19 — more than 25 days before a case was registered against him — that he might be implicated in a fake case as he is a petitioner in cases against the incumbent chief minister. However, no action had been taken up in Tiwari’s requests,” Marandi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/babulals-pol-adviser-held-from-up-bjp-cries-foul/articleshow/86150143.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Basukinath Temple plans daily langar services soon||Ranchi: Basukinath temple, a revered shrine of Lord Shiva in Dumka district, is eyeing to become Jharkhand’s Golden Temple (in Amritsar, Punjab) by dishing out langars for its devotees daily. The Dumka district administration is working out a plan in this regard along with an overall revamp of the shrine area to draw religious tourists round the year. Dumka deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla said they have made plans for langar but emphasised that it is still at a nascent stage. Shukla said the idea was conceptualised during his meeting with representatives of the Basukinath Panda Dharmrakshani Sabha earlier this week. Talking to TOI over the phone on Sunday, Shukla said, “Besides the Baba Baidhyanathdham temple in Deoghar, Basukinath, too, is an important place for Lord Shiva where several devotees come mainly during the month of Shravan every year. Now, our idea is to ramp up the overall facilities and cleanliness in and around the Basukinath temple so that it attracts national and global tourists.” Another official maintained that the administration is working on the revamp plan keeping next year’s Shravani Mela in mind. “Our other plans include giving a facelift to Kalkatiya Dharamshala, revamping the kanwariya path from Lathiyajoriya to Basukinath temple, beautification of the Shivganga and adding more dharamshalas in the area,” he said. Manoj Panda, a key office-bearer of the Basukinath Panda Dharmrakshani Sabha, who was part of the meeting on the Basukinath’s revamp, said discussions were held on the langar services and said the modalities are being worked out for the post-Covid period. “During the meeting, we all hail the idea. Such facilities exist in major shrines across the country where everyone irrespective of caste, creed and economic status enjoy the ‘prasad’. If the government and the administration manage to it roll out, it will certainly provide a new dimension to the temple,” he said, stressing that a proper revamp of the temple by increasing the facilities have long been demanded by many, the majority of whom are solely dependent on the temple for their livelihoods. “About 600 families of priests and thousands of others like hoteliers and shopkeepers are dependent on the Basukinath temple for their earnings. But since the outbreak of the Covid-19, everyone is staring at a life of penury after the loss of their livelihood. We hope things to improve soon in the post-Covid period,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/basukinath-temple-plans-daily-langar-services-soon/articleshow/86150272.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra must approach SC again to get OBC data from Centre: Nana Patole||NAGPUR: Congress Maharashtra unit chief Nana Patole said the state government must approach the Supreme Court again and ask the Centre to share empirical data related to other backward classes (OBC). The apex court had last week said local body polls can’t be delayed by the state government as they are under the State Election Commission’s purview. Talking about the Supreme Court order, Patole said it’s time for the state to again approach the country’s top court. “The state must get OBC related data from the Centre, through the Supreme Court,” said Patole. “Our stand is very clear, OBC community must not be deprived of benefits in the upcoming local body polls. In fact, the all-party meet in Maharashtra has already agreed on this,” said Patole. The MLA from Sakoli hinted that the central government must look at increasing the reservation limit. “Opposition leaders are talking about Indra Sawhney case but then the Parliament is the supreme law making body in the country. It has the authority to make constitutional changes. And if by doing so some backward communities benefit, then so be it.” said Patole. In the same OBC reservation context, Patole also questioned the retention of Ashutosh Kumbhakoni as the state’s advocate general even after the change of government in 2019. “He has been losing multiple cases while representing the state, so I feel that reasons for this need to be investigated. Usually, when government changes, so does the AG, but this time it has not happened,” said Patole. “In 2017, on the basis of a circular, the then government did not let Nagpur Zilla Parishad polls go ahead. Kumbhakoni was the AG at that time,” said Patole. “Actually, after local body term expires, they cannot continue and an administrator has to be appointed. But at that time Nagpur ZP continued to operate for two years while the matter was in court. On what basis did they do so? And now we are being asked to hold polls without OBC reservations,” said Patole. In reference to Kumbhakoni being the state’s AG in both scenarios, Patole said the state government must ‘look into it’. “It does give rise to some suspicion and it is our duty to bring such issues to the government’s notice,” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-must-approach-sc-again-to-get-obc-data-from-centre-patole/articleshow/86151701.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Ranchi||Now, PTR starts groundwork to relocate three villages from core area of reserve||Ranchi: The management of Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR) is gearing up to relocate three villages from the core area of the reserve to improve the ecology and the prey base for tigers, leopards and other carnivores. PTR sources said the residents of three villages, namely Kujrum, Latu and Henar, have agreed to the reserve’s proposal to relocate and accept the monetary compensation. Mukesh Kumar, deputy director of PTR, told TOI: “The paperwork for initiating the rehabilitation and relocation of the villagers is underway. The residents have agreed to relocate. Things have begun moving in the right direction.” The state department of forest, environment and climate change has been pushing PTR management to control the human encroachment, poaching and left-wing-extremism in the reserve for long. Growing human presence, vanishing prey base and cattle grazing are leading to an increase in biotic pressure of the reserve. For example, the villagers’ livestock graze through PTR’s core area, which, in turn, substantially depletes vegetation for the herbivores such as elephants, Indian Gaur, deer and other endangered species which reside in the reserve. D S Srivastava, veteran wildlife crusader and a member of the outgoing state wildlife board, said grazing of domesticated livestock was posing the greatest threat to PTR. “There are 189 villages and 32,000 households in PTR (including buffer area), which have around 1.50 lakh domesticated cattle. If each animal consumes at least 15kg of vegetation per day, how can the reserve’s natural habitat be restored?” Srivastava had said. In 1974, PTR had 37 tigers and in 2018, did not have a single tiger. Meanwhile, the PTR management has identified the beneficiaries for compensation where every male member of a household who is above 18 years will be considered a beneficiary. Each beneficiary will be paid Rs 10 lakh for purchasing land and up to Rs 5 lakh for building a new home. A senior official in PTR said, “The compensation amount will be paid jointly by the Centre and the state government on a cost sharing ratio of 60:40 basis. Apart from that, CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority) funds will also be utilized for the same. We have already received Rs 26 crore for the same.” The PTR management said the families have zeroed in on two forest lands for relocation. While one patch of land is located in Latehar, the other is in Palamu. In total, the two plots measure 300 hectares. “We have already moved the state departments of land records and revenue for de-notifying the plots from forest land status,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/now-ptr-starts-groundwork-to-relocate-three-villages-from-core-area-of-reserve/articleshow/86149972.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Jainam Shah, a BE (computer science) has discovered a more than 50,000 digits long PRP number. Based on the number of PRPs, Jainam and his project partner Tapashree Trivedi are ranked among top 150 discoverers globally. A PRP or a probable prime is a number whose primality can neither be proved nor disproved by anybody. “It is only up to certain smaller digits that you can find out whether the number is a prime number or not. If there are larger digits, the task becomes difficult. Such numbers are considered as PRP,” said Dr Vishwas Raval, who guided the students in the discovery. “Prime numbers are mainly used in encrypting data before they are transmitted through IT networks. If the prime number is long enough, it becomes difficult for hackers to crack it and this provides more security for data transmission,” said Raval, explaining the importance of this discovery in the world of computer science “I got PRP at 1,54,951 iterations. This probable prime is 79,209 digits long,” he said “I used super computer Param Shawak to find this out and I used data parallelism to find PRP in less time,” he added. “If the same process is done on a personal computer, it may take nearly a month and six days. On a supercomputer, it requires a maximum of six days. But through data parallelism on the super computer, I could do it in only eight hours,” said Jainam, who verified the number using PFGW and PERL softwares. According to Henri & Renaud Lifchitz’s PRP top record, which maintains record of probable primes discovered globally, the probable prime discovered by Jainam is ranked 9,340 in terms of number of digits as on August 18. “After a certain digit, it is challenging to find a probable prime number. It has been done in limited time by our student using the supercomputer facility that has been provided to us by GUJCOST. He is a wizard,” said head of department professor Apurva Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/longest-prime-number-places-msu-computer-engg-among-top-discoverers/articleshow/86149428.cms||Prashant Rupera

Salaries of government employees who have not been vaccinated yet will also be withheld, the authorities said. As part of the protocol, the administration has also decided to speed up the vaccination drive ahead of the upcoming festival season. The administration will also not allow any seller and buyer, who have not been vaccinated, to enter weekly haats and markets. SDO Mahendra Kumar said, “Both shopkeepers and customers at the weekly bazaars will have to show their vaccination certificates to enter the areas. We have deputed medical teams to hold camps at haats and bazaars. People who arrive there without vaccine will be asked to do so. In public places like banks, we have medical teams to inoculate visitors.” Simdega DC Sushant Gaurav has asked all BDOs and circle officers in the district to complete the vaccination process on priority basis. He asked them to tag all eligible beneficiaries with mobile vaccination vans and hold meetings with the rural task force to review the vaccination figures at the village level. He said, “We have set a target of administering the second dose to 64,062 people in September. Random vaccination and check-ups are also being done for employees of all government departments and if any of them are found not vaccinated, their salary will be withheld.” A total of 3,02,221 people have been inoculated so far in the district. “We are happy that no new Covid-19 case has been reported last week. In the district, 7,193 positive cases were reported of which 92 died. At present, we have no active case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-jab-no-entry-simdega-admin-to-shoppers-visiting-haats/articleshow/86149920.cms||K A Gupta

NFIR national spokesperson Somnath Malik said, “The central government’s decision to hand over railway assets and trains to private players is not in the interest of the nation and railway workforce. Employees will hold massive demonstrations and rallies during the week.” Malik said the monetization policy indicates the sale of mega public assets with railways, road transport, power, telecom, warehousing, mining, aviation, ports, stadiums and even urban real estate. “While framing the policy, the government forgot that these vital assets belong to the country and are not personal property. NFIR terms the government action as anti-people and anti-poor. It is going to cost them dearly,” he added. Malik said NFIR was surprised that the government had “failed to recognize the role of IR”, which is the lifeline of the nation as it provides services to all sections of the society, especially the poor. The federation reminded the government that over 2.30 crore people travel by trains daily. IR transported over 1,233 metric tonnes (MT) freight in 2021-2022 amid the pandemic and ensured uninterrupted supply chain. Malik said, “Instead of rewarding IR and its workforce, the government intends to monetize its assets to benefit a few individual monopolists. The government has also failed to take note of how privatization of railways in many countries has proved disastrous, compelling those countries to review and rollback the decision.” Another point Malik highlighted was the hike in fares by private players which could hit the middle class of society. At present, IR is reportedly foregoing over Rs50,000 crore per year to fulfil social service obligations and this loss is not compensated by the government. “If railways is allowed to take decisions for generating more earnings it will be able to earn more and develop its systems. NFIR contends that it would be highly improper to allow private operators to run trains using railway tracks, stations, signalling etc,” said Malik. The NFIR leader added, “Railway production units have emerged as the most efficient units capable of manufacturing rolling stock of global standard and are cheaper than the international market. It would be unwise to propose corporatization of railway production units, as such action would harm the nation.” NFIR, while opposing the privatization, corporatization and monetization of railways, called upon railway employees to rise against the government decisions and stand united to “launch a sustained struggle” to save the railways and the nation, Malik told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nfir-to-launch-weeklong-protest-against-rly-monetization-from-today/articleshow/86151753.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Forum thwarts member’s bid to grab society space||By: Jehangir B GaiThe Joglekar family had purchased flats in Andheri Flyover Co-op Housing Society, constructed by New Happy Home Builders. In individual agreements with flat purchasers, the builder had reserved the right of ownership of common places such as passages, staircase, terrace, parapet walls, compound and lift for advertising. The open spaces, along with advertising rights, were taken over by the Joglekars from the builder. The society opposed Joglekar and the builder. The dispute went to co-operative courts, which restrained Joglekar from putting up hoardings. Joglekar realized he would not be able to get advertising rights unless conveyance was executed in such a way that the society would accept the builder’s right to retain the open space. So a draft conveyance given by the builder excluded common spaces, but the society refused to sign it. Meanwhile, an attempt was made to resolve the issue with the assistance of the section officer, housing and special assistance department, Government of Maharashtra, but the builder insisted on retaining the right to open spaces recorded in individual agreements for sale of flats. To exert pressure on the society into signing the conveyance as offered by the builder, the Joglekars filed a complaint before Mumbai Suburban District Forum, accusing the society of deficiency in service. Even though the complaint was filed against the society and builder, it was dropped against the latter. The society pointed out how execution of the conveyance, as drafted by the builder, would be illegal as it would deprive the society of open spaces, while benefiting the Joglekars of grabbing society property. During pendency of the complaint, the society obtained deemed conveyance by approaching the office of the registrar of co-operative societies. In a order on August 26, delivered by Preethi Chamikutty, the district commission observed that draft conveyance deed provided by the builder contained encumbrances which gave exclusive rights to the Joglekars to part of society property. The commission concluded that refusal to accept the conveyance was proper, and in the interests of the society and its members. The commission dismissed the complaint, holding that there was no deficiency in service by the society.

The seats are almost entirely occupied as soon as the train crosses Sitabuldi station. Every other passenger takes a selfie before sitting down, seemingly to capture their first ride in a Metro train. A kid shoots the entire journey on his mobile phone as others spot familiar landmarks of the city from the window. Passenger traffic is at its peak since it’s a Sunday, say Metro officials. If weekends are slack for Metro or suburban train services elsewhere, the traffic easily jumps by 30% on a holiday in Nagpur. It’s been a month since Metro rail services resumed for public after Covid struck. “The trains have some rush only on weekends as families come for a joyride,” says staff. Taking a ride on both the routes, TOI came across families, couples and youngsters out for leisure, among others who were travelling for some work or the other. TOI had also travelled from Zero Mile station to the airport last Wednesday, when a fair number of passengers were seen. A number of them were not on a joyride that day; they found the train a faster option. Earlier, the Covid protocol allowed only government and medical staff to travel in the Metro. Even now, only those fully vaccinated can board the train. The booking clerk at Zero Mile station asked for proof of being vaccinated. Upon boarding, TOI not only saw children but also youngsters who had not been vaccinated. Majority of the passengers agreed that they were not vaccinated, and that no one had stopped them from boarding either. At Sitabuldi station, TOI was not asked for a vaccination proof at the ticket counter. There was a queue at all the counters. A Metro staffer managing the crowd said they were not insisting on any vaccination proof. Commenting on the situation, a Nagpur Metro Rail Corporation spokesperson said while the rules are being followed, it is up to the public to cooperate. A staffer moved around, asking people to put on masks on the Khapri route. “My office is in Dharampeth and I prefer to take the Metro,” said Prakash Wagh, an astrologer who boarded from Vasudev Nagar, near Hingna, on Sunday. He was going to receive his family returning from Amravati. “They will reach the Sitabuldi station and we’ll come back by the same train. On weekdays, sometimes I am the only passenger,” he added. Sitting on the opposite seat, Syed Irfan said, “My home is in Kamptee and I work at a food joint in Hingna. I got a call that my son has got fever so I am rushing home. I can reach Sitabuldi quickly through the Metro and will take an autorickshaw for the rest of the journey.” Some of the students having their exams also found the Metro convenient. Back on the Zero Mile to Khapri route, Pramod Wadate (in his fifties) and his wife were busy clicking pictures of the sights and scenes. “We have come just to get the feel,” he said. Wadate, who teaches at a college in Mohpa, said he had to drive to college each day. “It would be really useful if a train goes to farther locations like Mohpa or Kalmeshwar,” he added. Two girls who boarded at Vasudev Nagar on the Lokmanya route got down after a couple of stations. “We prefer commuting by the train on a regular basis,” said one of them. As the journey ended, most passengers on the Khapri route boarded the same train on the way back. At Lokmanya Nagar in Hingna, the numbers reduced on the return journey. In A Nutshell Metro rail running on Kasturchand Park-Khapri and Sitabuldi-Lokmanya Nagar (Hingna) routes Around 5,000 passengers ride the Metro daily Staff says the number jumps to around 8,000 on Sundays Covid curbs hampering passenger flow, an official says Once complete, Metro may need around one lakh daily passengers to viably operate||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/metro-chugs-along-no-red-signal-for-those-not-vaccinated/articleshow/86151811.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Met dept pins hope on low pressure in Bay of Bengal to cover Aug rain deficit||Panaji: A low pressure system has formed in the Bay of Bengal and meteorological experts are hoping that it will intensify into a depression and bring rain to the Peninsular region. “The present low pressure system in the Bay of Bengal may turn into the first monsoon depression of the season in a couple of days, which can bring in lots of rainfall into peninsular India and central and north west parts of the country, too,” he said. If this happens, the September rainfall may help cover the August deficit, meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar said. Goa and the surrounding areas received poor rainfall in August as no convection systems formed in either the Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal leading to the peak monsoon month ending on a deficit note. “Goa had one of the largest deficits in the month of August. The monsoon started reviving over Goa from August 28 and still continues to do so. One of the reasons for the revival of the monsoon over the west coast of India, and Goa in particular, is because of the low pressure regions and systems which form in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal,” Kumar said. Presently, Goa has received 4% excess rainfall for the season, the overall rainfall over the Indian subcontinent rainfall for this season is at a 6% deficit. Usually, we get several depressions, or monsoon depressions as they are called, over the north Indian Ocean, which result in copious monsoon showers, he said. Usually the maximum number of monsoon depressions form in the peak months of July and August and create several active monsoon conditions. But, this season, the only time we had active monsoon conditions was during the initial onset of monsoon, Kumar said. However, from September 1 to 12, plentiful rainfall has been experienced over all homogenous regions. The south peninsula rainfall received about 56% excess, followed by central India at 49.3% and north west India at 12.9%. The only regions with a deficit were the east and north east regions (about 44%). The country as a whole has an excess of 18.1%. “When we compare this with August, central India had the largest deficit of 38.7% followed by north west India by 30.6% and even the south peninsula region by 11%. Only east and north east had excess rainfall during August at 2.5%. The country as a whole had a very large deficit of 24%,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/met-dept-pins-hope-on-low-pressure-in-bay-of-bengal-to-cover-aug-rain-deficit/articleshow/86151837.cms||Nida Sayed

While amending the act, the state has also dropped reference to Daman and Diu from the act and rules. The Goa, Daman and Diu Barge (Taxation on Goods) Act, 1985, has been amended and whereever the expression ‘Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu’ occurs, the expression ‘State of Goa’ will be substituted. The changes are based on the recent amendment introduced in the monsoon session of the state legislative assembly. The Goa Barge (Taxation on Goods) (Amendment) Act, 2021, was passed July 29 and Goa governor P S Sreedharan Pillai gave his nod on August 31, said secretary law department Chokha Ram Garg. “In Section 4 of the principal act, in sub-section (1), for the words ‘monthly return’, the words ‘quarterly return’ shall be substituted,” the amendment states. As per law, the state government levies a tax on goods carried in barges in Goa’s inland waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/barge-owners-to-file-quarterly-returns-now/articleshow/86151894.cms||---

The samaj demanded that the government immediately implement the bill by taking the governor’s assent. President of the Goa Dhangar Samaj Seva Sangh, B D Mote, said 140 Dhangars from Sattari had applied for the government’s Atal Asra Yojana in 2014, but their applications haven’t been approved yet due to non-ownership of land. The scheme requires that ownership of land be proved if one seeks financial assistance to build a new house or to reconstruct or repair an existing one. “Apart from the Morlem panchayat, Dhangars have around 415 houses in 11 panchayats of Sattari. All households will get land ownership, and hence the Goa government must implement the bill,” Mote said. People from the Dhangar community said they would be able to apply for many schemes and secure their habitation if they are given ownership of their houses. “Across Sattari, people from the Dhangar community are living on government land, as the government’s name is mentioned on the Form I & XIV, which provides information about the occupancy of the land concerned. Once the bill is implemented, the houses will be in the names of the respective Dhangar families,” Valpoi-based lawyer Ganpat Gaonkar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhumi-bill-could-benefit-over-400-dhangars-in-sattari/articleshow/86151959.cms||Afaq Khan

Debris from the nearly 5m-high wall blocked the Margao-Quepem road bringing traffic to a halt for around an hour. The heritage structure was demolished a year ago to make way for a four-storey building and the wall was the only surviving marker dating to colonist era. Even after Liberation, prisoners continued to be housed in four cells at this jail, which later became the Quepem police station. The police station presently functions out of the WRD godowns near government college, Quepem. Locals requested that the remaining portion of the wall be broken down to avoid further disaster as it is in a dilapidated state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/portuguese-era-wall-at-quepem-falls-due-to-rain/articleshow/86152000.cms||Johnny M

While the activists had alleged that the report of the expert committee formed based on NGT orders were faulty and malafide, the tribunal refused to accept this submission. The Tribunal said that expert committee findings have to be put on a ‘higher pedestal and appreciated as documentary evidence’. “It is a well settled position of law, a report/opinion of the expert committee is put on higher pedestal and of course it needs to be appreciated like any other documentary evidence,” the Tribunal said. The appeal was filed stating that the construction at Goa Velha was carried out by damaging salt pans and mangroves. The activists asked for the construction to be demolished and the land to be restored to its original state. The activists said that while an inquiry committee, set up on orders of the Tribunal in 2014, stated that three of the constructions were in violation of laws, the same inquiry committee submitted a second report later the same year where they contradicted their original findings. But the Tribunal found that the inquiry committee found in its second report that the GCZMA had granted permission for the construction by considering the width of the nearby river as the CRZ line. The committee raised the issue as to which is to be considered as the CRZ line, the Tribunal noted. The inquiry committee found that site plans had a different CRZ line and the permission granted by GCZMA for construction had considered a different CRZ line. The committee noted that the CRZ line was drawn in 2005 by the GCZMA when granting the permission and the construction was carried out based on this permission. Therefore, the construction cannot be said to be in the no development zone of CRZ. The panel said that only a cemented platform and jetty existing in the no development zone of CRZ should be removed, which was eventually demolished. The Tribunal noted that its subsequent committees also did not find any violations. The 2017 committee also found that there was no disturbance to mangroves at the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-disposes-plea-against-goa-velha-building-complex/articleshow/86152065.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, BKU Ugrahan chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan said: “The protest against the three controversial farm laws is at a crucial juncture. We are in a big fight against a mighty government. At such a time we cannot afford to lose support of those who presently are enemies of BJP... The traditional parties have their cadres in every village of Punjab. They are presently supporting us, but by opposing them, we may lose their support and also prepare ground for confrontation in villages. This won’t be in favour of the struggle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wont-oppose-activities-of-any-party-other-than-bjp-says-bku/articleshow/86155306.cms||Neel Kamal

State advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that the government will act on it within three months. The GHAG has stated that the failure of the chief town planner to prepare heritage bye-laws for the Aguada fortress resulted in “egregious errors in restoration effortresss undertaken” where under the guise of “repairing” foreign materials and antithetical to the heritage structure have been used. “UUPVC roofing material has been used throughout the fortressress, traditional roofing material of Mangalore tiles has been replaced and cement washes on the walls have been carried out,” GHAG stated. “The restoration and beautification of the same with Azulejo tiles as recommended and stated in the Environmental Impact Assessment Report has not been carried out. Instead, the entire stream, and its environs have been destroyed and obliterated,” GHAG represented by Heta Pandit and Cezar Pinto said. The petitioners are seeking that the TCP prepare heritage bye-laws and site plans in respect of each protected monument and protected area and to make them available on its official website expeditiously. It also wants the TCP to develop a website to host information related to construction, re-construction, repair, renovation, awareness, capacity building, and to publish details of its activities. The GHAG has also demanded that GTDC reverse the damage caused and restore the heritage characteristics and facets of the fortress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-act-on-heritage-concerns-over-fortress-aguada-govt-tells-court/articleshow/86152313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Paswan passed away on October 8 last year in a Delhi hospital. Sources said Modi sent the message after a telephonic conversation with Chirag late night on Saturday. Posting the PM’s letter on twitter, Chirag said, “This letter gives me and my family strength in this time of sorrow. I hope your (PM’s) love and blessings will be with us.” Chirag tweeted that the PM respected the work done by his father and had summarised the late Dalit leader’s entire life in his own words while showing his affection towards Paswan. In his heartfelt letter, PM Modi said it was an emotional day for him. “I miss him (Ram Vilas Paswan) as a friend. I also sense the loss that Indian politics has suffered because of his death,” the PM, in his one and a half page letter wrote, calling his former Cabinet colleague a great son of the nation and a strong voice for social justice. “Those youths who want to serve the country through the political route must take lessons from the life of Ram Vilas Paswan. Even after reaching the top, he was always available and cordial for his fellow workers. He believed in dialogue and cordial relationship. This is the reason he had such good relationship with political leaders,” the PM wrote. Among the ruling alliance, while BJP was represented by deputy CM and several other ministers from the party, its ally JD(U) kept its distance from the occasion. Instead, chief minister Nitish Kumar paid tributes to the late Dalit leader through a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chirag-thanks-pm-for-praising-paswan-senior-on-first-barsi/articleshow/86155356.cms||---
---||Goa||Task force to revamp city public transport||PANAJI: In a bid to improve the state’s transportation system and encourage startups to develop solutions for urban mobility, a task force in pursuit of the Centre's Transport4All (TTF) challenge has been constituted by the state government. Undertaken as part of the smart cities mission, the aim is to bring together transportation stakeholders, citizen groups, and startups to bring in digital innovations that improve public transport in the state. Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) has been asked to steer the Transport4All digital innovation challenge by bringing on board agencies, NGOs, and citizen groups to ensure “seamless coordination” for the challenge. The task force will understand the concerns and needs of all stakeholders through surveys and consultations, based on which the various problems will be identified, said an official with the directorate of urban development. Startups will then be encouraged to come up with solutions that can help address the concerns of commuters and those who use public transport. The idea, said an official, is to ensure that solutions developed by startups work for all stakeholders. The task force will also oversee the rollout of the technology solutions on a pilot basis and evaluate their impacts before wider implementation. In April, the Union ministry for housing and urban affairs launched the Transport 4All challenge for all smart cities and state capitals. The aim of the challenge is to revamp informal transport services, and prioritise digital innovation. Smart cities and startups will receive guidance to develop and test various solutions, learn from them, and scale them to build people’s trust in public transport and enhance their mobility. Transport director Rajan Satardekar has been appointed chairman of the task force. The other members are representatives from CCP, North Goa deputy collector, Panaji traffic cell, PWD, TCP, Kadamba Transport Corporation, Goa college of engineering, and Imagine Panaji. Representatives from the Goa auto-rickshaw association, all-Goa taxi union association and Panaji urban living lab are also on the task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/task-force-to-revamp-city-public-transport/articleshow/86150623.cms||---
---||India||FCRA approval for 6 NGOs suspended||NEW DELHI: The home ministry has over the past one-and-a-half months suspended the foreign funding licence of six NGOs, which includes Christian evangelist groups and Islamic charities allegedly linked to religious conversion or funds misutilization, citing violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. With these actions, the total number of organisations whose FCRA registration has been suspended so far this year has gone up to nine. While the FCRA licence of Markazul Ighasathil Kairiyathil Hindiyya, a big Kerala-based NGO linked to influential Sunni leader Sheikh Aboobacker Ahmed, was cancelled on August 27 over “misutilization” of funds, misrepresentation of facts, and non-filing of annual FCRA returns in 2019-20, Odisha-based People’s Organisation of Empowerment of Tribals and Heavenly Grace Ministries as well as Madurai-based Russ Foundation were issued suspension orders under FCRA on August 28. One of the directors of Russ Foundation home was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sexually assaulting a 10-year-old inmate. In July, Lucknow-based Al Hasan Educational and Welfare Organisation saw its FCRA nod being suspended over alleged activities related to forced religious conversions. Haryana-based Mewat Trust for Educational Welfare also had its FCRA licence suspended for 180 days, though the reasons are not yet clear. Earlier on June 8, 2021, the FCRA registration of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, an NGO led by well known commentator on northeast Sanjoy Hazarika, was suspended, as was that of Bengaluru-based Centre for Wildlife Studies on April 8, 2021. Another evangelist NGO that had its foreign funding licence suspended is Holy Spirit Ministries, which operates out of Andhra Pradesh. The suspension of FCRA registration disables an NGO or association from receiving foreign contributions unless with the prior nod of the ministry. The FCRA bank accounts of the NGO are also frozen, preventing the organization from using funds parked in them. The affected NGO may make a representation to the MHA against the suspension, which unless revoked remains valid for 180 days and is followed by a permanent cancellation of the FCRA registration. The home ministry list of NGOs whose FCRA licence was suspended in 2020 mentions seven organisations — Vedruna Seva Mandal based in Gujarat and evangelist associations Ecreosoculis North Western Gossner Evg, New Life Fellowship Association, Don Bosco tribal Development Society, Evangelical Churches Association, Rajnandgaon Leprosy Hospital and Clinics and Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fcra-approval-for-6-ngos-suspended/articleshow/86155395.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||Report finds ‘glaring similarities’ with 2010 Mangaluru accident||MUMBAI: The Air India Express Kozhikode crash in August last year had ‘glaring similarities’ with the Air India Express Mangaluru that occurred in May 2010, said the recently released final investigation report into the Kozhikode accident. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in its 281-page Kozhikode final report made over forty references to the Mangaluru accident and the recommendations issued later by its court of inquiry. “Ten years later, it was once again a similar tabletop aerodrome, the same airline, the same type of aircraft that landed off an ‘Un-stabilised Approach’ and touched down past half the runway and resulted in another major disaster,’’ said the Kozhikode accident final report. The International Civil Aviation Organisation Annex-13 which lays down standards and practices for carrying out aircraft accident investigations states that the sole purpose of an investigation should be to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. The court of inquiry appointed into the Mangaluru crash therefore had made several recommendations. But the Kozhikode investigation team found that a number of salient recommendations were not wholly addressed. Among the recommendations ignored was that of having adequate pilots based permanently in important stations. For instance, though Air India Express operates maximum flights out of Kozhikode airport, it had posted only one captain as against 26 first officers, the Kozhikode crash report said. The commander of the ill-fated Kozhikode crash flight was scheduled to fly the next day morning. Had he diverted the aircraft to another airport, he would not have been available to operate the next day’s flight and he was aware that there were no additional captains at that base, other than himself to operate that flight, the report said. Another critical aspect was assertiveness training for first officers. In the Kozhikode accident, the co-pilot failed to take over the controls from the commander, though the latter continued with the unsafe descent to land. With regards to airport infrastructure recommendations, ten years later, neither does the Mangaluru airport nor does the Kozhikode airport have runway centre line lights. The airports don’t have a soft area beyond the paved runway surface to stop an overrunning aircraft. As for the aviation regulator, its flight inspectors were required to carry out frequent flying checks on sectors involving flights to table-top runways. But the Kozhikode investigation team found no flying checks were carried out by DGCA from January 2019 to June 2020 on these critical airports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/report-finds-glaring-similarities-with-2010-mangaluru-accident/articleshow/86155361.cms||Manju V
---||Kozhikode||Calicut crash shows why infants at risk||MUMBAI: The Air India Express Kozhikode accident has brought to the fore a long-ignored issue — the safety of infants onboard flights. The Air India Express aircraft had hurtled towards the end of the tabletop runway from where it dropped into a deep gorge, crashed into the airport perimeter wall and broke into three. During the eventful landing, ten infants sat on the laps of their parents. Their only safety net, their parent’s arm grip. Three out of them died, another three had serious injuries. The accident, that occurred in August last year, has highlighted the need for a ‘child safety restraint system’, the kind advocated by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and in use in countries like the US. A child restraint system (CRS) is a contraption of belts that a parent can fasten onto the seat back, through which the passenger seat belt can be pulled in to secure an infant safely onto the seat. But for this, the parent would need to buy a separate seat for the infant. Currently, Air India Express and some other Indian carriers do not allow the purchase of a separate seat for an infant. Said an airline official, requesting anonymity: “Some parents might not want to spend and buy a separate seat for the infant, given that accidents are a rare occurrence. But CRS can keep infants safe during turbulence as well. Those who wish to buy a separate seat should have that option.” Directorate General of Civil Aviation Arun Kumar said: “We have just seen the AIX Kozhikode accident report. An appropriate call will be taken in due course.” The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) team collected feedback from the parent of a deceased infant. The infant — although placed on the lap — was not held firmly as the crew made no announcement of the impact. Therefore, during the frontal impact of the crash, the infant was displaced from the lap and was thrown in the cabin and, as a result, received fatal injuries, it said. Air India Express does not have provisions for child/infant restraint system and they rely solely on lap-held infants without any supplemental restraint, it added. US aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration — in its ‘Flying with Children’ page — says: “The safest way to secure an infant or child on board an aircraft is in a state-approved CRS, in a dedicated seat... The use of CRS provides an equivalent level of safety to infants and children as that afforded to adult passengers wearing seat belts. “Proper use of occupant restraints is one of the most basic and important factors in surviving an accident, it says. “It is not possible for a parent to physically restrain an infant or child, especially during sudden accelerations and/or decelerations, unanticipated or severe turbulence or during impact,” it said.The ICAO manual on the Approval and Use of Child Restraint Systems (Doc 10049) contains guidance for countries to develop regulations and approval processes enabling the use of CRS.

---||Goa||Short, but eventful football career||The josh was high when Goa hosted the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy for the first time in 1972. In the quarterfinals against Karnataka, Goa were already a man down, and with the scores tied 1-1, the home team stared at a surprisingly early exit. The pressure was immense, nothing quite like the closing stages when rival forward N Ulaganathan latched on to a through ball and was one-on-one with goalkeeper EN Sudhir. For the India forward, this was easy picking. He simply lobbed the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper. It seemed like game over at 2-1. But, wait, it wasn’t. Sudhir took a few steps backwards, flipped and punched the ball over the goal, much to the delight of the crowd who could scarcely believe their eyes. “I don’t know how I did that,” says Sudhir, recalling the match played almost 50 years ago. “The crowd thought it was a goal. There was silence, and when they realised that the ball was over the bar, the scenes were unbelievable.” Once in a Sait Nagjee tournament in Kerala, Inder Singh met a similar fate. The legendary India forward was within handshaking distance of goal but Sudhir dived even before the striker could release the ball, pulling off an improbable save. For the former Vasco Sports Club goalkeeper who made Assagao his home, such acrobatic saves came naturally. “As a kid, I was very naughty, climbing trees and jumping from one branch to the other. At home, I used to throw the ball sideways on the wall, and then jump on the bed, stretching my hand out to make a save,” says Sudhir. Like most great goalkeeping stories, this one too started accidentally. At the St Joseph's High School in Kozhikode, Sudhir was enthusiastic about scoring goals, rather than stopping them. But when nobody volunteered to guard the goal for the school team, the physical education teacher handpicked him for the role. Sudhir turned out to be a marvellous choice as he saved almost everything that was thrown at him. Since then, there was no looking back, whether it was with St Philomena College, Mysore University or Young Challengers. His football journey, though, got a push only after he landed in Goa in 1971. Sudhir had come here on a recommendation from a friend to join Sesa Goa, among Goa’s top football teams in the seventies. Sudhir met senior officials, but somehow the job offer wasn’t enticing enough. “I didn’t accept the offer and instead sought time to speak to my father. The same evening my friends took me to Vasco and while walking near the railway station we bumped into (Vasco SC player) Sathyan,” says Sudhir. Before anyone knew, Sudhir was at the club headquarters where chief patron BM Parkkot and his nephew TK Unny convinced him to sign for the club, explaining how he’ll be comfortable here with several other Kerala players like Sathyan, TK Chathunny, George Rosemond, J Raphael, Shivraj and V Bharathan. What a signing he turned out to be. Sudhir won the Police Cup on debut for Vasco. The next year, the club won a bagful of trophies during their tour of Kerala as locals – who had seen him play for Young Challengers -- cheered the star goalkeeper’s heroics under the bar. It was only at the Rovers Cup in Mumbai that Vasco stumbled. Sudhir was again at his best, but could do nothing to stop P Kannan from scoring the decisive goal for Mohun Bagan. Sudhir’s performances earned him a place in the India team for the Asian Youth Championship in Tokyo and he quickly made a jump to the seniors, representing the country at the Pre-Olympic qualifiers (1972), Merdeka Cup (1973) and more famously the Asian Games at Tehran in 1974. After three years at Vasco, Sudhir moved to Mahindra and Mahindra in Mumbai. In Maharashtra too, just like Kerala and Goa, he emerged as the best, representing the state at the Santosh Trophy, a rare feat for a footballer to represent three states in just five years. Football wasn’t financially rewarding, so Sudhir decided to quit the sport and take up a job in Qatar in 1976. “Deep inside I was not too happy at Mahindra because I wasn’t given what was promised to me. Besides, unlike today, the game wasn’t rewarding enough,” says Sudhir. The star goalkeeper had a short five-year career at the top in Indian football, leaving many to wonder what may have been had he continued. Sudhir, though, has no regrets on a career that was short, but eventful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/short-but-eventful-football-career/articleshow/86151046.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The former Union minister, who was among the signatories of a letter to Sonia that sought an organisational overhaul, said anyone who persisted with “institutionalising” the G-23 after the reform process had kicked off would only be doing it for “vested interests”. “Some of us put our signatures only for reform of the party from within and to rebuild the party, not to destroy it… Some of our leaders misused the G-23…. If they (some leaders) persist (with G-23) that means there is a vested interest for a few of them to work against the Congress party, which we don’t subscribe to and rather oppose it,” Moily told PTI. He added that anyone who continued to use G-23 was doing a “great disservice” to the Indian National Congress and its legacy, and that such actions would help Congress’s rivals. “She (Sonia Gandhi) is active and taking decisions, such decisions are needed,” Moily said to the news agency. The former minister voiced support for poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s induction into Congress and said those opposing his entry were “anti-reform”. Moily also described Congress as the “fulcrum of the strength of the politics of this country”, saying that while the party lost elections a few times, it would not lose forever. Reacting to NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s statement that Congress was like a ‘zamindar’, Moily said the NCP chief had himself said Congress was the only party in power in multiple states that could take on BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/g-23-irrelevant-as-reform-in-congress-underway-m-veerappa-moily/articleshow/86155457.cms||---

As per data provided by the National Testing Agency (NTA), 2,483 females and 882 males registered to answer the test from Goa. An attendance of more than 95% was witnessed, despite many parts of Goa receiving heavy rainfall on Sunday. The exam was scheduled to take place from 2pm to 5pm. However, to facilitate social distancing, students’ entry into examination centres was planned in a staggered manner and exam halls began taking in students from as early as 11am. Students had already been warned that 1.30pm is the last timing to enter the exam hall. However, like across the country, in Goa too, on Sunday, a few students were seen reaching exam centres later than the assigned time. Students said that unexpected rainfall delayed them. Sources at the exam halls said that most students who reached late in Goa were accommodated as far as possible. “The invigilator begins explaining the norms by 1.40pm. Though the last timing to report to the exam hall was 1.30pm, students were accommodated up to 1.40pm, considering factors like rain and other exigencies. But those who report at 1.55pm cannot be permitted. Students were aware of the timing restrictions well in advance,” an official at one exam centre said. To be able to maintain social distancing, the number of students were restricted to 12 per examination hall. Frisking was carried out using electronic devices before students were allowed to enter the exam centres. The examination centres were upped from 10 last year to 15 in 2021, though the number of students registered for the exam this year had dropped. The smallest centre in Goa this year accommodated 250 students and the largest seated 660 students, sources said. NEET (UG) was a pen and paper exam. Students answered the exam through a computer readable sheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/3k-plus-answer-neet-across-15-centres-in-goa/articleshow/86151062.cms||---

Fatorda police nabbed him on Saturday while he was committing theft of a mobile phone from the tool box of a scooter parked near Jawaharlal Nehru international stadium. The accused is alleged to have confessed of stealing Rs32,000 in cash from a scooter parked at Mapusa market on September 7. The incident was recorded on CCTV camera. Police constable Kaskerand who was patrolling the area noticed the accused fiddling with scooters parked near the stadium and kept watch. The constable observed the accused opening the tool box of a scooter and removing a mobile. While at the police station, Seema Bansode filed a complaint at the Fatorda police station that the lock of tool box of her scooter had been cracked open and her mobile was stolen while she was on her regular exercise. After a body-search of the accused two mobile phones, one electric tester, one wallet containing an ATM and Aadhaar card were recovered. During interrogation, the accused confessed to his crimes in other parts of Goa and was remanded to seven days police custody for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/man-caught-stealing-phone-from-scooter/articleshow/86151118.cms||---

Goa energy development agency (GEDA) has invited tenders for design, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of the power plant, including operation and maintenance for five years. The 40 kWp grid-connected solar rooftop power plant will be set up on the third floor of the secretariat building at a cost of Rs 30 lakh. The grid-connected rooftop solar power plant will be connected on net metering basis, where the surplus power generated by the building will be supplied back to the power grid. GEDA has stated that the contractor will not be allowed to puncture the RCC roof but must design and erect the plant without damaging it. The agency stated that the installation of the solar plant must be done on a metal sheet, which will cover an elevated truss framed structure which will be erected on the flat roof on the third floor of the building. “Till March this year, Goa had over 250 solar prosumers-consumers and producers of solar energy. More than 60% of these are domestic consumers and the rest commercial and industrial consumers,” an official said. Several state and central government departments, agencies and educational institutions have also set up solar power plants including GEDA, Goa University, PWD offices, NIT, MPT, and Raj Bhavan, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-invites-bids-for-rooftop-solar-plant-at-assembly-complex/articleshow/86151152.cms||---

But then I was shocked by the odd reaction of several people. They pulled a face and cautioned me that I’d have to face financial burden and what not. I didn’t like it and wanted to send a message as a father. I am proud that I have a daughter,” Anchal said. Anchal decided to celebrate it in a big way – the way he could. “I am a small vendor with limited earnings. However, I wanted to prove that every parent should feel proud that they are lucky to have a girl child,” said Anchal. On Sunday, he put up three stalls in Bima Kunj Road in Kolar locality and spread the word that free pani puri would be available from 1pm to 6pm. No other message went more viral in the area. Hundreds turned up. Swamped by the crowd, Anchal made repeated appeals to them to follow Covid precautions, asking those in queue to wear masks and stand at a safe distance until their turn comes. Few heeded his request in the rush for free pani puri. “This is bad. I have done this for a noble cause but several people refused to listen to me. I was not expecting such behaviour from people,” Anchal told TOI, looking at the jostling crowd. Once they knew why he was distributing free pani puri, people were stunned. Many stepped forward to congratulate him, both for having a daughter and sending a message to society. “People should understand that he has done it to spread a good message. However, many didn’t bother to follow Covid caution,” said a visitor, Sushil Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bhopal-pani-puri-wallah-is-blessed-with-a-girl-and-you-are-invited/articleshow/86155481.cms||Ramendra Singh

The order, which came into effect from September 6 under Section 144 of CrPC was issued by South Goa district collector Ruchika Katyal. The collector has issued the order based on a report of South Goa superintendent of police stating that fear of disturbance of communal peace and harmony in the state of Goa is not ruled out in case of Mutalik and his associates entering the state.

---||Goa||Bacterial infection resurfaces in Goa’s state fish||PANAJI: Goa’s state fish, the mullet continues to suffer from an infection called Epizootic Ulcerative syndrome (EUS) as few specimens with the skin disease surface randomly in the catch in some areas. Compounding this is the lack of continuous research that has concealed the problem. This condition affecting mullets and a couple of other estuarine fish species had been reported in the past. “It is purely organic pollutants like sewage which fuel growth of Pseudomonas, a bacteria that infects skin, gills, the mouth and fins of the fish,” Joe D’Souza, a retired professor of Goa University (GU) said. The microbiologist had studied the first outbreak of EUS with a GU student, S Kudchadkar and had later published the findings. Fishermen in Mandur have reported scattered incidences of EUS. “Several mullets in the catch have abrasions or bloody patches near the gills and other parts,” Agusto Pereira, a sluice gate operator at Mandur said. The fisheries department is however unaware about this syndrome. “No cases have been reported to the department and it is difficult to speak about its causative factor,” director of the department of fisheries, Shamila Monteiro said. The ulcerative syndrome was reported near prawn hatcheries in St Estevam and Chorao around early 1990s. Pearl spot fish was affected by skin diseases while it also hit the mullet species in Telaulim in Tiswadi, Shiroda in Ponda and Curtorim in Salcete. The EUS strikes the fish mostly during monsoon when fertilizers and organic run-offs leach into the water and spread out with the flow. The catch looks unfit for consumption and has to be dumped. “The percentage of population affected is not known but it happens mostly in areas where water polluted by industrial and other sources stagnates for longer periods in water bodies,” retired chief scientist, biological oceanography, NIO Baban Ingole said. In 2014 another episode of pollution triggered by similar conditions caused mass mortality of tisreo (clams) at Musher, Betul. A three-member team comprising D’Souza and Mahesh Prabhu, a water treatment specialist had conducted a microbiological analysis and found that pollution had lethally impacted the bivalve population. “The bacteria Pseudomonas and fecal coliform together scavenge on the oxygen and render the water anaerobic, suffocating the clams to death,” the study stated. The study attributed the cause of toxic pollution to massive influx of sewage, dumping of dry ice and other waste released by more than 200 fishing vessels and around 2,000 fish workers at Cutbona jetty. “More comprehensive studies are needed to study the EUS problem as Pseudomonas bacteria has become resistant to pollution,” D’Souza said. In recent weeks mullets are showing signs of recovery as the monsoon season comes to a close.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bacterial-infection-resurfaces-in-goas-state-fish/articleshow/86151246.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||India||Varun writes to CM Yogi seeking 400/quintal SAP for cane farmers||NEW DELHI/ LUCKNOW/BAREILLY: A few days after tweeting support to farmers protesting against the new farm laws, BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi demanded that sugarcane's state advisory price (SAP) for the forthcoming crushing season in UP should be raised to Rs 400 per quintal. The demand, seen in the light of his sympathy for farm unions who are preparing to campaign against BJP in the UP polls, seems to indicate that the MP is not on the same page as his party. The state government has kept the SAP unchanged for the past three years after effecting a hike from Rs 305 to Rs 315 per quintal in 2017. Varun’s observation vis-a-vis cane growers comes as CM Yogi has suggested strict action against millers defaulting on payment of cane dues to the farmers. Talking to TOI, a day after he shot off the letter on Saturday, the MP, said, “The last few years have been an economically tumultuous time, more so for our farmers who have borne the brunt for many things. As a public representative who has written on rural economics and worked with farmers for years, I felt the requests I made to the UP CM are fiscally affordable and can be immediately actualised and would go a long way in normalising government-farmer relations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/varun-writes-to-cm-yogi-seeking-400/quintal-sap-for-cane-farmers/articleshow/86155491.cms||---

Goa also received praise from the Prime Minister and Union ministers for achieving the cent per cent first dose coverage. “Well done Goa! Great effort, powered by a collective spirit and the prowess of our doctors as well as innovators,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted on Friday. The health department in its Covid vaccination bulletin released on Sunday evening indicated 6,468 persons were vaccinated during the day of which 1,152 persons received their first dose and 5,316 their second dose. According to statistics with the health department, 40.3% of Goa’s eligible population (age 18 and above) is vaccinated with both doses and 57.12% partially vaccinated with one dose only. Till date, 97.42% have received at least one dose of the vaccine with 30,851 persons unvaccinated and yet to receive even a single dose of the vaccine. At the health ministry’s last press briefing on action taken, preparedness and updates on Covid-19 on September 9, the Union health secretary had stated that nine states and Union territories of Sikkim, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Ladakh, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep, Uttarakhand and Mizoram had given the first dose of the vaccine to more than 85% of its eligible population. Goa had not featured on the list. The data shared revealed that of these, Sikkim, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Himachal Pradesh had each administered the first dose to 100% of its population, while Tripura, Ladakh, Daman and Diu Lakshadweep and Uttarakhand had reached 89% of its eligible population with the first dose and Mizoram 86% of its population. The state government had announced September 10 and 11 as vaccination holidays to give the health workers a break. Vaccinations at government health centres resumed on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-goa-claims-100-have-taken-1st-jab-1152-unvaccinated-take-shot-on-sunday/articleshow/86151320.cms||Lisa Monteiro

They have demanded that the permits be revoked. “We’re shocked to learn that the Cabinet has recently granted approval for the acquisition,” said joint secretary of Goencho Ekvott, Olencio Simoes, calling the decision “undemocratic”. “The CM has overlooked Goan sentiments and Goan demography by merely working as an agent for the crony capitalist of Gujarat rather than as the chief minister of Goa ,” he added. Simoes said that in May 2020, 60,117sqm was acquired in Majorda, then on July 15 8,104sqm was acquired for the special project connecting Hospet/Hubli/Tinaighat/Vasco da Gama. Now additional land for double-tracking has been acquired for the Kulem to Margao section of South Western railways in Guirdolim and Sanguem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revoke-permits-for-railways-land-acquisition/articleshow/86151356.cms||---
---||Goa||Stakeholders fear Goa will lose charter tourists to Egypt||Panaji: With the Centre yet to grant a request by Goa’s tourism sector for air bubble arrangements with select nations, tour operators in the state fear that any further delay in an announcement will rob them of charter tourism opportunities as Egypt, which is a big draw among Russian tourists, is already open for business. As a result, tour operators are apprehensive that Russian travellers who otherwise visit Goa, will choose Egypt this time as there has been no indication about when India will lift restrictions on international commercial flights. Incidentally, Russia is one of Egypt’s chief markets. “It is about a month since Egypt opened up, but there has been no sign so far about when we are going to open. Accompanied by a representative of a major Russian tour operator, we had a meeting with tourism secretary J Ashok Kumar last week and though he assured us that there may be some announcement by mid-September, we are keeping our fingers crossed,” Ernest Dias, chief operating officer at Sita Travels told TOI. Of the 2.5 lakh charter tourists that Goa receives, 65-70% are from Russian destinations. Naturally, trades in Goa that survived purely on charter tourists over the past few years are anxious. While starred hotels earned business after the first wave of the pandemic subsided last year, medium and small hotels that relied on budget charter tourists remained shut. President of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) Nilesh Shah said it does not make any sense for small hotels to start operations if charters do not resume. “Over the past year, the sector has repeatedly requested the government to announce the possible date of restarting commercial international flights. Besides Egypt, so many international destinations have started opening, but with restrictions in place. India must also follow suit,” Shah said. A tour operator said other destinations are employing unique ways to dispel the fear of Covid-19 among potential travellers and they’ve been getting a reasonable amount of footfalls too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stakeholders-fear-goa-will-lose-charter-tourists-to-egypt/articleshow/86151382.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Goa||‘Frontline work not reason to deny mother custody’||Panaji: In a child custody battle, a Panaji court has rejected the father’s argument that weekend custody be given to him as the mother is a Covid warrior and there is serious risk to the child’s health. “I do not agree with the above submission for the reason that if the above view is taken, it would amount to depriving the respondent of her natural responsibility of nurturing the child only for the reason that she is a Covid warrior. This would be totally unjustified and shall act as a discouraging factor for the respondent to work as a frontline warrior,” senior civil judge, Ram S Prabhu Dessai stated. The court noted that the family with medical professionals is far better placed to take care and nurture the child during the tender years. Referring to the argument that it is custom that the child be taken to the temple of the family deity, the court held that this is not advisable in the interest of the child during the pandemic. “The health and wellbeing of the child should prevail over everything else. Therefore, in my view no direction can be given to the respondent to accompany the applicant with the child to the temple for performance of any such ritual, at least for the time being,” the court said. Regarding Ganesh Chaturthi, the father submitted that the festival is celebrated in his ancestral house where other members of the joint family also visit. “Therefore, I find that the child should not be exposed on the pretext of attending Chaturthi celebrations. This condition also equally applies to the respondent and she is the person who should ensure that the child is not exposed to any outdoor activities during the festive season,” the court held. The HC in April granted the father visitation rights three times a week for two hours. However, the father approached the Panaji court asking for daily visiting rights and weekend custody of the child, stating that the child was being deprived of the love and affection of the father and paternal grandparents. The Panaji court held that the HC’s arrangement is sufficient to create bondage between the father and child and will serve the purpose for the time being till the pandemic ends. The court held that if the father is granted weekend custody, it may disrupt the child’s arrangement, who is settled at one place in a familiar environment and is being breastfed by the mother. Day custody will also cause inconvenience as the child would have to travel nearly 30km||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/frontline-work-not-reason-to-deny-mother-custody/articleshow/86151439.cms||---

A case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder was registered on Saturday against the 35-year-old wife of the deceased. The man died on May 12 after the car he was in crashed into a container trailer ahead of their vehicle. The couple’s two children were in the rear seat at the time. The wife had claimed that her husband was at the wheel when he suffered a heart attack. Now, the dead man’s sister has alleged that the wife is responsible for the death of her brother. The man’s sister has now alleged that the wife was at the wheel, not the man. She has also said that the wife has an extra-marital affair and had, therefore, “deliberately crashed the car into the trailer on the side where the man was seated”. She has claimed that the wife wanted to acquire the dead man’s property. The man’s sister has stated in the FIR that she suspects foul play and, therefore, enquired with her brother’s five-year-old daughter who was present in the car with her six-year-old sibling at the time of the accident. The sister of the deceased has said in the FIR that the little girl said that her mother was driving the car and her father was asleep in the adjacent seat. The FIR also states that the driver of an autorickshaw, in which the man was taken to hospital, is a witness to the wife driving the car. The FIR further states that after the man was declared dead at a hospital in Navi Mumbai, the wife summoned her family doctor to the hospital and the family doctor certified that the man died of cardiac arrest. It also adds that the wife insisted that a post-mortem not be done and took custody of the husband’s body and later had it buried. A police inspector from Navi Mumbai said, “We will get permission to exhume the body and will seek a forensic report to verify the cause of death.” The police have invoked a section that deals with giving of false information as the wife of the deceased is alleged to have driven the car. The police said that the wife is the nominee for her husband’s insurance policy worth around Rs 50 crore. A fortnight ago, the wife had accused her father-inlaw of sexually abusing her son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/four-months-after-navi-mumbai-man-died-of-heart-attack-kin-accuse-wife-of-murder-body-may-be-exhumed/articleshow/86155531.cms||George Mendonca

The court has also observed that the income tax department could have only continued with the proceedings against the person’s legal heirs if the same notice was served during his lifetime. The case had come up before the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. The Nagpur office of the income tax department had sent a notice to Mahadeo Shambharkar, a government official, on the grounds that an income to the tune of Rs 1.5 crore from the sale of land had escaped tax. The notice was issued on March 2021. However, Shambharkar had passed away two and a half years ago. The land deal took place in 2015-16. Soon after the first notice, the counsel, on behalf of his legal heir, intimated the department that Shambharkar was no more. Yet another notice was sent. “After the first notice was sent in March, we had intimated the department about the assessee’s death but another notice was sent in July,” said Ram Heda, the counsel for his son, Bandu Shambharkar, who moved the court. The court on Thursday quashed the notice, said Heda. Shambharkar died on January 27, 2019. Nine days before his death he was served a notice under section 133(6) of the income tax which deals with calling of information from an assessee. The officer had sought information about the land deal from Shambharkar who passed away in a short period of time, explained Heda. This notice did not deal with the reopening of returns. Over two years later, another notice under section 148 which deals with the reopening of the returns, was issued. By that time, Shambharkar had passed away. Explaining the court’s stance, Heda said, in this case even as the notice seeking information was issued during Shambharkar’s lifetime, the intimation for reopening of returns was sent after his death. In that case the proceedings cannot be continued against his son who is the legal heir. The court has directed the income tax department to issue a fresh notice to the legal heirs in line with the law. Heda said now the case has been barred by limitation. Till March 2021, returns of the previous four years could be opened. However, now it has been reduced to three years. This may now time bar the case which is related to the assessment year of 2016-17, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-court-quashes-i-t-notice-to-reopen-returns-against-dead-man/articleshow/86151506.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Goa||Matoli: An informal lesson in indigenous ecology||Keri: The indigenous communities of Goa once foraged forests for food and medicinal plants. The ‘matoli’ is an ecological tradition stemming from these practices. During Ganesh Chaturthi, a wooden frame laden with wild and seasonal produce forms a canopy for the idol of Lord Ganesh. This canopy is known as the ‘matoli’. “During Ganesh Chaturthi, our joint family comes together and decorates ‘matoli’ with seasonal fruits, flowers and wild herbs. We take the effort to collect a variety of floral wealth and to decorate the matoli with natural produce. Students and researchers visit our ancestral house to enjoy the matoli and to understand ecological knowledge related to it,” said Shrikant Satarkar from Rayat in Curti, Ponda. The matoli tradition evolved as a way of expressing gratitude to Lord Ganesh, the favourite son of Mother Earth Parvati. It symbolises the symbiotic relationship between the people and the forest. There was a time when people had to follow various rules while collecting forest produce to ensure sustainability. There were strict norms on how and when a fruit or leaf was to be harvested. In 1886, Lopes Mendes in his book ‘A India Portugueza’ made one of the earliest mentions of ‘the image of Lord Ganesh placed in an oratorio decorated with precious jewels and surrounded by lights, flowers and fruits’. Braganza Pereira in his book ‘Ethnography of Goa, Daman and Diu’ (1940), while describing the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi, makes mentions about the ‘matoli’ tradition of Goa. “Our forefathers, in order to respect the new fruits of the monsoon season, place them in a decorative canopy and worship the precious creations of Mother Nature. The ‘matoli’ tradition was an informal way of imparting education about plants through culture. There is a need to tap the potential of this ecological tradition to educate the younger generation,” said Govind Shirodkar, an officer at the directorate of art and culture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/matoli-an-informal-lesson-in-indigenous-ecology/articleshow/86151567.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The former engineer, who was in charge of J&K, died due to Covid-19 when the second was at its peak. NHIDCL’s direction to Apco Shri Amarnathji Tunnelway for “urgent compliance” for installing the former engineer’s bust has stumped many. The communication issued on Saturday to the company said the MD, NHIDCL during his official visit to Z-Morh project on August 26 directed the concessionaire to place a bust of the ex-executive director at Z-Morh portal “before the visit of the road transport and highways minister which is scheduled on September 26, 2021.” Sources said any such direction requires prior permission of the road transport ministry and it was unprecedented to ask a private player to put a bust. “If the government agency wants this, it should have done it on its own. Second, the reason for installing such a bust has not been explained. There was an SC order in 2013 which had banned the installation of statues of public figures and construction of any religious structure along roads,” said a source. The NHIDCL is implementing two tunnel projects in J&K at Zojila and Z-Morh. Over a dozen engineers working with the road transport ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL died due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-firm-orders-contractor-to-install-ex-officers-bust-at-tunnel/articleshow/86155514.cms||Dipak K Dash

The bill was first introduced on September 12 a quarter of a century ago by the H D Deve Gowda government, but hasn’t still been made into an Act. It seeks to reserve a third of the seats in Parliament and state assemblies for women. Trinamool spokesperson Derek O’Brien posted on Twitter: “Today makes it 25 years since the WOMEN'S RESERVATION BILL was introduced in #Parliament. 25 years. No Bill passed. MO-SHA’s BJP even promised it in their 2014 Manifesto. FAIL.” In a video that Derek posted, he argues that India ranks 145 out of 193 countries on the percentage of women in Parliament. Derek, in the video, claimed there is 25% representation of women in legislatures across the world, while the national average is 13%. In BJP, the number of women MPs is around 10-11%, he said. In contrast, close to 40% of Trinamool’s MPs in both Houses of Parliament are women, said the party’s national spokesman. Trinamool has been among the most aggressive proponents of women’s reservation bill. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has introduced several social schemes — including Lakshmir Bhandar monthly income scheme and Swasthya Sathi health insurance scheme — aimed at women. Among party legislators in Parliament, 41% are women MPs in Lok Sabha and 31% in Rajya Sabha. “If BJP is serious about the bill, why don’t they bring the legislation in the Lok Sabha in Parliament’s winter session that will begin in November. It has a majority on its own. And several opposition parties have already said they will support the legislation in Parliament,” a senior Trinamool MP said. While several parties, including Trinamool, Left Front constituents, Congress, BJD and DMK, have been vocally advocating for the bill, there are divergent views even in the opposition block. RJD and SP have argued against the bill. Those opposing the bill say a reservation-based approach overrides merit and limits a voters’ choice to only women candidates. However, it is also argued that with the women electorate now crossing the 50% mark in several states or inching towards it, more women lawmakers are necessary proportionate to the voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-slams-bjps-failure-on-womens-quota-bill/articleshow/86151367.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Uttar Pradesh govt claims spark war of words in Bengal||KOLKATA: An advertisement released by the Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday sparked a war of words between Trinamool Congress, BJP and Congress. The ad showcasing the Yogi Adityanath government’s development displays the Maa flyover with iconic yellow taxis and landmark luxury hotels easily identifiable as being in Kolkata. “Transforming UP for @myogiadityanath means stealing images from infrastructure seen in Bengal under @MamataOfficial’s leadership and using them as his own! Looks like the ‘DOUBLE ENGINE MODEL’ has MISERABLY FAILED in BJP’s strongest state and now stands EXPOSED for all!” TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted. “Mr. @narendramodi is so helpless to save his party that other than changing CMs, he has also had to resort to using pictures of growth & infrastructure seen under @MamataOfficial's leadership, as his own. #BengalModel > #BJPRuledStatesModel Mr Modi?” Mukul Roy, who has returned to the TMC after winning a Bengal assembly seat on a BJP ticket, tweeted. While TMC MP Mahua Moitra advised the Yogi government to change its ad agency, MP Mimi Chakraborty said, “They have ended up in showcasing projects of the state they criticize the most. Their infrastructure narrative surely does not have anything of their own.” “They can also showcase rural roads in Bengal that were made spending Rs 2,058 crore while in UP it was merely Rs 950 crore. The positive side to the blunder of the UP government is the message that imitation is the best form of flattery,” said TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien. Bengal industries minister Partha Chatterjee called Adityanath, a monk of the Goraksha Peeth, by his old name. “When even Ajay Bisht can’t help but use pictures of #BengalModel for his own publicity,” he tweeted. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is in charge of UP, took to Twitter to accuse the BJP government of displaying “fake flyovers and factories” in their advertisements to claim development in the state. Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya, however, said that a mistake might have been made by the agency. “Mistake and stealing are not synonymous. It must be a mistake made by any government official. The UP government does not need to showcase Bengal’s projects,” Bhattacharya said. “I don’t know which flyover is in question. There are hundreds of flyovers in the country and the UP government may look into it. They can move court if they want to,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh.  Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said that “fake propaganda peddlers latched on to an advertorial error”. “The UP Govt doesn't need to borrow (that too an image) from a state on the verge of bankruptcy due to mismanagement of its administration,” Adhikari tweeted. “TMC’s knee-jerk reaction to the advertisement proves they don’t have anything else to flaunt. Even if it is indeed the image of Maa flyover, it was nothing but a mistake and does not take away Adityanath’s credit for accelerating UP’s growth,” West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uttar-pradesh-govt-claims-spark-war-of-words-in-bengal/articleshow/86151364.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||CBI arrests 4 BJP men for TMC worker’s May 4 murder||Cooch Behar: In a first since it started probing post-poll violence in Bengal, CBI on Saturday night arrested four BJP workers in connection with the murder of Trinamool Congress worker Shahinoor Ahmed at Tufangunj in Cooch Behar. TMC dubbed the arrests as an “eye-wash”. A total 11 persons were arrested by CBI over the last 24 hours in connection with post-poll violence in Cooch Behar — the constituency of minister of state for home affairs Nisith Pramanik. The subdivisional court at Tufangunj sent the four accused to 14 days’ judicial custody. The CBI had prayed for police custody of the accused, but could not produce the case diary. The defence lawyers objected to that. On May 4, two days after Assembly poll results were declared, Ahmed’s body was found inside a bush in the Kilakhana area of Tufangunj. Locals alleged that Shahinoor and one Prosenjit were having dinner when four BJP supporters joined them. After dinner, they were attacked, resulting in severe injuries. A few days ago, a team of CBI investigators had visited Tufangunj to question family members of the victim. Malati Rava, Tufangunj MLA and national vice-president of BJP’s women’s wing, said: “We have confidence in the CBI and we want a proper investigation into post-poll violence cases. Some of our workers were arrested, but they have been framed. The CBI should arrest the real culprits.” TMC leader Girindranath Barman, however, termed the Tufangunj arrests as an “eye-wash”. “The NHRC and CBI are trying to show themselves as neutral by arresting the four BJP workers,” he said. In another case at Dinhata in Cooch Behar, the CBI on Sunday arrested seven persons in connection with the murder of Haradhan Roy — a BJP worker who was murdered on May 3. Family members had alleged that Roy was taken to Rajaghora river that day where he was found smeared in blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbi-arrests-4-bjp-men-for-tmc-workers-may-4-murder/articleshow/86151314.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||No one a vaccine ‘outsider’ in Kolkata, more jabs given than residents||KOLKATA: Over 63.5 lakh people have received at least one vaccine dose and 19.4 lakh both doses in Kolkata, whereas the city’s eligible population is 32.4 lakh, the data suggesting that a significant number of people from outside the city chose to get jabbed within the city limits. With 4.7 crore of its seven-crore eligible population vaccinated with at least one dose, Bengal’s vaccination percentage — 67.5% — appears skewed, when compared with Kolkata’s, where, if the total number of doses administered is taken into account, it’s nearly double the eligible population. Senior health officers tracking the vaccination rollout in Bengal ascribed this to several factors, all interlinked. Larger hospitals and KMC-run clinics have been vaccinating a large floating population, which is in Kolkata for work, medical treatment and even for the sole purpose of getting vaccinated. Earlier, because of the Bengal elections, large numbers of central forces and poll officials were vaccinated in Kolkata. Now, workers — including healthcare workers — who are returning to work in Kolkata after easing of restrictions are also taking their second doses in Kolkata. “Kolkata has a huge floating population, which comes during the day for work and leaves in the evening,” said former mayor Firhad Hakim, now the chairman of the board of administrators, KMC. “The city is as much theirs as it is for me or you. We don’t discriminate based on their home region or district. We vaccinated whoever came and sought immunization. It is great as long as they are residents of our state or, for that matter, of our country.” The floating population theory is also borne out by the fact that a high percentage of those being vaccinated in Kolkata are men, associated with more mobility than women. In Kolkata, 35.4 lakh of the former and 28.1 lakh of the latter have received jabs. The corresponding figure for the state is 2.5 crore and 2.2 crore. “From central force personnel during the elections, to people from the districts who came to the city for work, they were all vaccinated in the city,” said a senior health officer, adding, “Our mandate was simple — to increase the number of vaccinated people. We tried to optimise the use of vaccines to counter the possibility of infection.” Pulmonologist Arup Haldar, who is attached with a private hospital that also runs vaccination clinics, said: “Since a hospital is not a desired destination during the pandemic, many who came for regular check-ups or emergences at our hospitals also scheduled their vaccination on the same day. Most of them were from the districts, with many even from other states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-one-a-vax-outsider-in-kol-more-jabs-given-than-residents/articleshow/86153270.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Power output, profit at record high for WBPDCL||Kolkata: The West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL) has generated 23,874.2 mega units (MU) in 2020-21, the highest since inception, and registered a record profit of Rs 252 crore in the same period despite the pandemic and lockdown. Its Bakreswar and Santaldih plants were ranked third and eighth respectively by Central Electricity Agency. The jump in profit was achieved by checking inefficiencies such as reducing oil consumption, unit tripping and tube leakage, and cutting down on demurrage payable for delay in coal handling. The reduction in oil consumption saved Rs 90 crore. The demurrage reduced significantly to Rs 3.5 crore in 2020-21 against Rs 25 crore in 2019-20. WBPDCL also achieved the best ever auxiliary power consumption (APC) of 8.5%, making it yield an additional revenue of Rs 54 crore. More than 100% ash utilisation has been achieved at Santaldih, Kolaghat and Bandel power stations during the financial year. “We have been able to drastically reduce boiler tube leakages and unit tripping, thereby saving Rs 23 crore and Rs 37 crore respectively,” said WBPDCL CMD P B Salim. “Thermal plants are run by workers, so we tried to motivate them, instil a sense of ownership so that they can take pride in the company and excel. We have also started conferring employees with awards and certificates, which have generated healthy competition and helped the company reduce its loopholes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/power-output-profit-at-record-high-for-wbpdcl/articleshow/86151449.cms||Dipawali Mitra

The Supreme Court in August had directed eight states — Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka – to fill up vacancies in the commissions within six months. Nabanna started the process of appointment accordingly, an official of the PAR department said. An official said after the retirement of former DGP, GMP Reddy, in May, the panel comprised chief information commissioner (CIC) Basudeb Banerjee and ex-IPS officer Raj Kanojia. The official added that former CIC Sujit Sarkar had once proposed appointing five commissioners to reduce pendency. CIC Banerjee said the appointment of four more commissioners, as the SC had directed, would greatly help in handling cases. He said the panel had held meetings with the state government for a bigger office so that the new appointees could be accommodated, as the current one at Khadya Bhavan complex was too small. He added that due to the pandemic, the process of appointment of three commissioners, which had been initiated earlier, could not be executed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-appoint-4-new-information-commissioners/articleshow/86151611.cms||---

Around 40,000 additional beds with ventilators in ICUs are being added as part of the large-scale augmentation of Covid-health infrastructure across the country. “Each district hospital will get at least five more ventilators. Many districts have already started getting deliveries,” a senior official told TOI. The Centre is also conducting a programme for skill development to ensure more healthcare workers and technicians are trained to operate ventilator-assisted ICU beds. “The problem is not focused around the availability of ventilators. With local manufacturing of ventilators, the supply issue has been addressed but even as we procure more ventilators, human resource management and training is crucial,” the official said. The preparedness is based on estimates from previous surge. The government is calculating for hospitalisation of 23% of those infected based on a study of second wave and keeping in mind high viral load of Delta variant, officials said. Read AlsoCovid third wave could peak between October-November; intensity expected to be 1/4th of second wave: ExpertNEW DELHI: A third wave of Covid-19 in India will be less severe than the second and could peak anytime between October and November, recent projections have shown.

---||India||Why inoculating all Nilgiri tribals is a big feat in India’s vaccine drive||NEW DELHI: The successful vaccination of a largely vaccine-hesitant community of tribal groups in the Nilgiris district, who received their first dose of shots, is a small but not insignificant part of India’s efforts to cover vulnerable groups and protect them from the highly infectious disease. The Tamil Nadu government is now on course to administer the second dose to all adults in the 27,000-strong community before any possible third wave, keeping in view that Covid-19 cases among particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) during the second wave became a cause of concern. The risk to these small population groups, prompted the state government to launch a special drive in May-June to give 21,351 adult PVTG members their first shot. As of September 1, 20.5% of those eligible for the second have been vaccinated and the district administration hopes to cover all those eligible over the next two months. The vaccination story in Nilgiris was marked by severe hesitancy in the beginning. According to district collector, J Innocent Divya, targeted advocacy to quell myths and door-to-door outreach made these tribes come around. Home to a population of about 7.29 lakh people, Nilgiris district has 27,032 tribal people from six tribes that are part of the 75 PVTGs in India. These tribal groups include Irulas, Kotas, Paniyas, Kattunayakans, Kurumbas and Todas. In terms of numbers, Todasare is the smallest group with a population of just about 1,500. The latest data on vaccination in the district show that 97% of all 5.93 lakh eligible people in the district have taken their first dose and 24% have received their second shot as well. The district collector said vaccinating the tribal population has been a priority as close-knit communities are not only vulnerable to rapid spread of infection but controlling infection through social distancing and home isolation is a big challenge. The health department launched a special drive to counter vaccine hesitancy arising out of misplaced beliefs and fears. “The district administration along with NGOs carried out door-to-door visits and held camps early in the morning before the tribals left for work. Vaccination was carried out till late in the evenings. Local dialects were used during advocacy and we first vaccinated the members of the tribal council to build confidence among the community,” the DC said. She also said camps were organised the very next day in hamlets where advocacy campaigns were held. Northay Kutten Toda, an ST Council member said that the pastoral community which is known for its Toda embroidery, is now eagerly awaiting the second jab. “Even women in their late 80s have come forward to take the vaccine. We are going to have a camp for the second dose very soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-inoculating-all-nilgiri-tribals-is-a-big-feat-in-indias-vaccine-drive/articleshow/86155618.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Gurgaon||In a first, Gurugram markets to set up vax camps||GURUGRAM: The health department has decided to set up vaccination camps across Gurugram’s market areas from Monday. For the first time in the city, recipients will be able to walk into these session sites in the evenings. The timing for the vaccinations has been decided from 4 pm to 8 pm. The department is planning to carry out the sessions at five sites across the city. Also, both first and second doses of Covisheild will be administered at these sites. This decision to set up the camps in marketplaces was taken by the health department to increase the pace of inoculations in the city. Earlier, the evening sessions were only carried out within the premises of hospitals. “We have selected three sites for the vaccination drive at market areas for now. We will select two more soon. The three sites are Galleria market, Mahavir Jain mandir chowk bus-stand and Hanuman mandir in Sadar Bazar. These sessions will have 100 first and second doses daily,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Notably, no pre-registration is required and anyone above 18 years can get vaccinated at the camps free of cost. A team for AEFI cases will be at the site and an ambulance will be on standby. The CVC is linked with the nearest government hospital. Meanwhile, the district is gearing up for a mega vaccination drive. On Monday, Gurugram will have 203 session sites. Of these, 197 sites will give Covishield doses, while Covaxin will be given at five sites. Sputnik V will be administered to recipients at one site. Gurugram aims to vaccinate 1.4 lakh recipients in the three-day mega vaccination drive. The state government has asked the districts to complete their first dose target during the mega vaccination drive. For districts that have already completed their first dose target, the focus will be on the second jab. The targets of the drive have been set for each district in Haryana. They have been asked to divide the targets over three days. On Sunday, as many as 2,328 people in the 18-44 age group got vaccinated. In the 45-plus category, 322 people took the shots. In all, 2,662 jabs were administered. A total of 619 first doses and 2,043 second doses were given to recipients in the city on Sunday. According to the revised projected data, the total population of Haryana stands at 3,03,98,334 and its eligible population for vaccination is 1,90,69,418. Out of them, the first dose has been administered to 1,33,65,641 recipients. This means, 57,03,777 recipients are yet to get the first dose. 3 new cases in cityThe city on Sunday recorded three new Covid cases, taking the caseload to 1,81,113, of which 51 are active cases.

---||World||9/11 papers reveal Saudi link, not conclusive on complicity||The FBI on Saturday released a newly declassified document related to its investigation of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US and allegations of Saudi government support for the hijackers, following an executive order by President Joe Biden. The partially redacted 16-page document released by the FBI on the 20th anniversary of the attacks detailed contacts between the hijackers and several Saudi officials, but it did not draw a definitive conclusion whether the government in Riyadh was complicit in the attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Earlier this month, Biden ordered the department of justice to review documents from the FBI’s probe into the attacks for declassification and release. Relatives of the victims have been pushing for years for more information about what the FBI discovered in its probe and have contended that the documents would show Saudi Arabian authorities supported the plot. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom has long said it had no role in the attacks. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment sent out of hours late on Saturday. A US government commission in 2004 found no evidence that Saudi Arabia directly funded al-Qaida, the group given safe haven by the Taliban in Afghanistan at the time. It left open whether individual Saudi officials might have. The families of roughly 2,500 of those killed in the attacks, and more than 20,000 people who suffered injuries, businesses and various insurers, have sued Saudi Arabia seeking billions of dollars. In a statement issued on September 8, the embassy said Saudi Arabia has always advocated for transparency around the events of September 11, 2001, and welcomes the release by the US of classified documents relating to the attacks. “As past investigations have revealed, including the 9/11 Commission and the release of the so-called ‘28 Pages’, no evidence has ever emerged to indicate that the Saudi government or its officials had previous knowledge of the terrorist attack or were in any way involved,” the embassy’s statement said. In a statement on behalf of the organisation 9/11 Families United, Terry Strada, whose husband Tom was killed on September 11, said the document released by the FBI on Saturday put to bed any doubts about Saudi complicity in the attacks. “Now the Saudis’ secrets are exposed and it is well past time for the Kingdom to own up to its officials’ roles in murdering thousands on American soil,” the statement said. Biden has taken a tougher stance with Saudi Arabia than his predecessor Donald Trump, criticising the Kingdom over its human rights record while releasing a US intelligence report implicating Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The prince denies any involvement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/9/11-papers-reveal-saudi-link-not-conclusive-on-complicity/articleshow/86155697.cms||---
---||World||In spotlight over role in Taliban win, Pakistan tries to shift focus to Kashmir||ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: At a time when it is yet again under sharp international glare for engineering Taliban’s successful takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan on Sunday released a 131-page dossier against India, accusing it of grave human rights violations in J&K and alleged that it was “hosting and running terror camps of ISIS”. The dossier was presented at a press conference in Islamabad jointly addressed by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, NSA Moeed Yusuf and human rights minister Shireen Mazari. Citing the document, foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar blamed India for “patronising ISIS”. He alleged that evidence suggested that India was operating training camps in Gulmarg, Raipur, Jodhpur, Chakrata, Anupgarh and Bikaner. “By injecting these state-trained ISIS fighters, India may try to establish linkages of the freedom movement with international terrorism in order to malign the freedom struggle of Kashmiris,” he claimed. Pakistan has — in support of its claim that Taliban 2.0 is a reformed and mellowed version of the group that had ruled Afghanistan brutally, turning the country into a sanctuary for Islamic terrorists, including slain al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden — been claiming that the West should be concerned about ISIS. Qureshi said the decision to compile the dossier was taken due to the alleged actions of Indian authorities after the death of Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani and their treatment of his family. The secessionist Islamist leader, an ardent supporter of Pakistan, died on September 1 after a prolonged bout of agerelated ailments. Indian authorities have released video to show that that he was buried as per Islamic rites. To a question why India’s alleged involvement in fomenting terrorism from Afghanistan wasn’t addressed, the NSA opined that one reason was India’s interests with the world such as being a counterweight to China.

---||India||In spotlight over role in Taliban win, Pakistan tries to shift focus to Kashmir||ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: At a time when it is yet again under sharp international glare for engineering Taliban’s successful takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan on Sunday released a 131-page dossier against India, accusing it of grave human rights violations in J&K and alleged that it was “hosting and running terror camps of ISIS”. The dossier was presented at a press conference in Islamabad jointly addressed by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, NSA Moeed Yusuf and human rights minister Shireen Mazari. Citing the document, foreign office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar blamed India for “patronising ISIS”. He alleged that evidence suggested that India was operating training camps in Gulmarg, Raipur, Jodhpur, Chakrata, Anupgarh and Bikaner. “By injecting these state-trained ISIS fighters, India may try to establish linkages of the freedom movement with international terrorism in order to malign the freedom struggle of Kashmiris,” he claimed. Pakistan has — in support of its claim that Taliban 2.0 is a reformed and mellowed version of the group that had ruled Afghanistan brutally, turning the country into a sanctuary for Islamic terrorists, including slain al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden — been claiming that the West should be concerned about ISIS. Qureshi said the decision to compile the dossier was taken due to the alleged actions of Indian authorities after the death of Kashmiri separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani and their treatment of his family. The secessionist Islamist leader, an ardent supporter of Pakistan, died on September 1 after a prolonged bout of agerelated ailments. Indian authorities have released video to show that that he was buried as per Islamic rites. To a question why India’s alleged involvement in fomenting terrorism from Afghanistan wasn’t addressed, the NSA opined that one reason was India’s interests with the world such as being a counterweight to China.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra blows poll bugle on her visit to Rae Bareli, Amethi after 2 years||LUCKNOW: After a gap of over two years, Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited her mother Sonia Gandhi’s constituency Rae Bareli and adjoining Amethi on Sunday. Supporters from the two Gandhi bastions queued up outside the Bhuyemau Guest House in Rae Bareli since morning to catch a glimpse of their leader and meet her. Priyanka stopped at the Sankatmochan Hanuman Temple at the entrance of Rae Bareli and paid floral tribute to the deity. Some elderly persons and the temple priest blessed her and prayed for Congress’s good show in UP elections. Around 11am, Priyanka reached Rae Bareli guest house and held deliberations with party workers across different levels such as panchayat, nyay panchayat and wards representing the six assembly segments of Rae Bareli. “I urge you all to dedicate your time, energy and effort to the party 24X7 till elections. Forget everything else and immerse yourself to oust the BJP government,” Priyanka reportedly told the cadres. She said the public sentiment was against the BJP which had failed to deliver to people from different walks of life on every count. “People are sick and tired of this government which has failed them on every single count of quality life. We must work and position ourselves as an option before them,” said a Congress worker quoting Priyanka. Priyanka, who is also the party’s UP incharge, said the Congress leadership will roll out the campaign plan soon and added that the contribution of each worker towards the party’s Pratigya Yatra was important to bolster Congress’s prospects in 2022 elections. Sources said Priyanka asked the workers to counter BJP’s Hindutva card among the people. “She asked us to convey to the public that even Congress has faith in Lord Ram and Krishna and its cadres also visit temples and follow rituals. But unlike the BJP, we do not use our gods for vested interests,” said a block level functionary of Congress. After meetings in Rae Bareli, the Congress leader visited Dodarpur village of Tiloi in Amethi to meet a family which lost three children in a wall collapse incident recently. Earlier, Priyanka took to social media to attack the Yogi government and accused the UP CM of using fake ways to sing paeans to his government. “They give fake advertisements, fake jobs of lekhpal were offered to youth, now giving fake pictures of flyover and factories and claiming fake development. Neither do they have any understanding of the people`s issues nor do they have anything to do with it. The government is of fake advertisement and false claims,” she tweeted referring to the recent controversy in which a UP government advertisement allegedly showed the image of a flyover in Kolkata as one in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/priyanka-blows-poll-bugle-on-her-visit-to-rae-bareli-amethi-after-2-yrs/articleshow/86152694.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||World||US falling to lowest vaccination rates among world’s wealthiest democracies||Japan initially struggled to get its Covid vaccination programme into full gear, but now that it has, the percentage of its population that has received at least one dose has edged past the level achieved in the US — leaving Americans last for that category among the world’s seven wealthiest large democracies. The turning point came on Thursday, when Our World in Data, a project by the University of Oxford in England, reported that just over 62.1% of Japanese people were at least partially vaccinated, compared to 61.9% of Americans. For the moment, the US retains a slightly larger percentage of fully vaccinated people than Japan, 52.7% compared to just over 50%, according to Our World in Data, ranking sixth out of the G7 nations, after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy. But the US appears all but certain to fall to last place among the G7 nations shortly, given the rapid pace of achieving full vaccinations in Japan and the extremely slow rate in the US. Between July 24 and September 9, the full vaccination rate in the US grew by around 4%, while in the same period Japan lifted its level by 25%, a jump that doubled the size of its fully vaccinated population. Using doses made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Japan is administering over a million vaccine doses per day, some 300,000 above the US average, even though the US population is more than 2.6 times the size of Japan’s. In Japan, new cases have fallen sharply from a peak of 23,083 on August 25 to 11,347 on Friday, though Japan did confront a dramatic rise in new cases in July and August, coinciding with the Olympics. In the US, cases spiked starting in early July. Canada leads the G7 countries in vaccination rates, with almost three-quarters of its population at least partially vaccinated as of Thursday, according to Our World in Data. France, Italy and UK follow, with percentages between 70 and 73. Germany’s rate is just ahead of Japan’s, at around 65%. The US vaccination curve has leveled dramatically since an initial surge in the first half of this year, when the vaccine became widely available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-falling-to-lowest-vaccination-rates-among-worlds-wealthiest-democracies/articleshow/86155842.cms||---
---||World||Suspected China sub near territorial waters: Japan||TOKYO: Japan’s defence ministry said on Sunday that a submarine believed to be from China was spotted in waters near its southern islands, as maritime tensions persist in the Pacific. The submarine remained submerged, but the ministry said it believes the sub is Chinese because a Chinese Luyang III-class guided missile destroyer is near the submarine. The submarine moved northwest off the eastern coast of the Amami Oshima Island, about 700km northeast of the disputed East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but also claimed by Beijing, the ministry said. Tokyo has complained of numerous intrusions by Chinese vessels into its territorial waters and near disputed islands in recent years. China has often reacted angrily to US ships sailing through disputed areas of the South China Sea in what Washington calls displays of freedom of navigation. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, visiting Vietnam during a Southeast Asia trip, said those two countries should refrain from unilateral actions regarding South China Sea that could complicate and magnify disputes. Sunday’s announcement said Japan’s navy identified the vessels in a contiguous zone, which is outside territorial waters where vessels are required to identify themselves. Japanese defence minister Nobuo Kishi instructed his staff to “gather information and maintain vigilant surveillance with a sense of urgency,” the ministry said in a statement. China’s defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment and officials at the Chinese embassy could not be reached for comment on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/suspected-china-sub-near-territorial-waters-japan/articleshow/86155847.cms||---
---||World||Taliban fighters take over Afghan warlord’s glitzy mansion||KABUL: Taliban fighters have taken over the glitzy Kabul mansion of one of their fiercest enemies — the warlord and fugitive former vice-president Abdul Rashid Dostum. Now in the hands of rank and file Taliban fighters, the opulent villa has given the austere fundamentalists a peek into the lives of Afghanistan’s former rulers, and they say the luxury is the proceeds of years of endemic corruption. Along a corridor with a thick apple-green carpet, a fighter sleeps slumped on a sofa, his Kalashnikov rifle resting against him, as exotic fish glide above him in one of seven giant tanks. The fighter is part of the personal security detail of Qari Salahuddin Ayoubi — one of the new regime’s most powerful commanders — who installed his company of 150 men in the mansion on August 15, the day Kabul fell. The luxury of the mansion would be unimaginable for most ordinary Afghans. Huge glass chandeliers hang in large halls, soft sofas furnish a maze of lounges and an indoor swimming pool is finished with intricate turquoise tiles. It even boasts a sauna and a fully equipped gym. It is an out of this world experience for the new occupants, who for years sacrificed creature comforts for rebellion — living on their wits in the plains, valleys and mountains of rural Afghanistan. But the new head of the household — now the military commander of four provinces — makes it clear his men will not get used to the luxury. “Islam never wants us to have a luxurious life,” Ayoub said, adding luxury comes in paradise, “the life after death”. A notorious figure in Afghanistan’s recent history, the mansion’s owner, Dostum, is widely suspected to have profited from the corruption and embezzlement that discredited the former government. When Kabul fell, his stronghold was overrun and the 67-year-old fled to Uzbekistan. The Taliban have good reason to hate Dostum. In 2001, he was accused of killing over 2,000 fighters — locking many in containers in the middle of the desert where they suffocated. But commander Ayoubi rejected any desire for revenge. “If other people who had been oppressed like us came here, you would not have seen the chairs and tables. They might have destroyed them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-fighters-take-over-afghan-warlords-glitzy-mansion/articleshow/86155856.cms||---
---||Chennai||Sunday vaccination drive exceeds target, 28.9 lakh get jab at 40,000 camps in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu on Sunday vaccinated nearly 10 times as many people as it usually does in a day, with the count touching 28.9 lakh by nightfall. The government had set up 40,000 special camps across the state to meet its target of 20 lakh vaccinations on Sunday. With this, 66% of the state’s population has taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Totally around 4.02 crore people have been inoculated till date, said Chief Minister MK Stalin, congratulating the state healthcare team for its efforts. The public were wooed to Sunday’s vaccination camps through a multitude of measures ranging from reminders, gifts from local bodies to 18 IAS rank officials overseeing operations. The planning that went into it was similar to that of a polling day - this time to exercise the public's right to life. The highest number of vaccinations were reported in Chennai (1.85 lakh). Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) had organised eight camps in each of the 200 wards in the city. GCC also plucked out details of unvaccinated groups of people in a cluster, for instance a housing society or gated community, and mobilised people from these locations to the camps. Just like election eve, chits akin to voting slips were given to people who were asked to come for the jabs. Fever survey and anganwadi workers, self-help groups and others went door to door and spread the word on the camps. Reminder messages were also sent to 3 lakh people who were eligible to take their second dose in Chennai. In Trichy, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Kancheepuram, local bodies had announced cash rewards and gifts for those coming forward to take the jab. Prizes such as free tokens to dine at hotels, silk sarees, android smartphones and gas stoves were on offer. Coimbatore, Tirupur, Trichy, Thanjavur, Madurai and Thiruvallur districts also vaccinated more than one lakh people each on Sunday, said health secretaryJ Radhakrishnan, TN Health Secretary. "Initially there were many suspicions raised over the state's ability to vaccinate people in such large numbers. But Sunday's effort has proved our capacity and we have requested the Centre to sanction more doses," he said. Some camps in southern Tamil Nadu ran out of vaccines. Many who needed a second dose of Covaxin had to return home disappointed. Health Minister Ma Subramanian said that names and contact details of such people were collected, and they would be vaccinated on Monday. The state received another 4.5 lakh doses of Covaxin on Sunday evening. "Steps would be taken to conduct such camps at least once in ten days when doses are available," said Subramanian. Uttar Pradesh is the only other Indian state to vaccinate more than 25 lakh people in a single day. It has crossed the 30 lakh-mark twice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sunday-vaccination-drive-exceeds-target-28-9-lakh-get-jab-at-40000-camps-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86155887.cms||---

The metropolitan said even though the rise in the use of narcotic substances is a major social issue in Kerala, by using the term ‘jihad’, the Pala bishop has given rise to the suspicion that he was trying to associate this menace with a particular community. “Even though jihad is an Arabic expression, there is a minority community which uses that expression. When the bishop clubs narcotic abuse with that community, he raises the suspicion that he was trying to raise this issue on the lines of the Sangh Parivar agenda,” Metropolitan Yuhanon Mor Meletius said. He said the Christians, particularly the clergy, should be more judicious and discreet when making statements on public issues. “We must not overlook the fact that if our children are consuming narcotic substances, it also means that we have not groomed them well. What is the point in blaming others for this predicament,” Metropolitan Yuhanon Mor Meletius said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-orthodox-syrian-church-thrissur-diocese-metropolitan-refutes-pala-bishops-statement/articleshow/86155889.cms||---

Police said S Dhanush of Koolaiyur village in Salem district took the extreme step, “apprehensive about taking NEET” held on Sunday afternoon across the country. Chief minister M K Stalin, while condoling the youth’s death, said, “Our legal battle against NEET begins now.” He assured that a bill would be passed in the state assembly on Monday, the last day of the budget session, to get “permanent exemption” from NEET. Stalin said he would write a letter to all the state CMs to get their support for NEET exemption, which was “a national issue". He said some students like Dhanush ended their lives due to fear of facing the exam. Police said Dhanush had been preparing for NEET for the past two years. He had taken the examination twice earlier and failed in both attempts. According to preliminary inquiries, Dhanush told his parents that he would fail this examination too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/neet-politics-simmers-after-tamil-nadu-youth-kills-self/articleshow/86155939.cms||Senthil Kumaran

Zomato had entered the segment last year during the lockdown on account of the pandemic, but exited the business on the recovery of its food delivery business. The company also said that it believes that its investment in Grofers will generate better outcomes for its shareholders than in-house grocery efforts. Zomato has invested $100 million (Rs 745 crore) for acquiring a minority stake in grocery delivery platform Grofers. In an email to its grocery partners, Zomato said, “Store catalogues are very dynamic and inventory levels change frequently. This has led to gaps in order fulfillment, leading to poor customer experience.” A Zomato spokesperson said, “We have decided to shut down our grocery pilot and, as of now, have no plans to run any other form of grocery delivery on our platform. Grofers has found high-quality product market fit in 10-minute grocery and we believe our investment in the company will generate better outcomes than our inhouse grocery effort.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-to-stop-grocery-delivery-over-service-gaps/articleshow/86155937.cms||---
---||India||Efforts for FTA with UK, Oz gather pace||NEW DELHI: The government is stepping up its efforts to speed up free trade agreements (FTAs) with ministerial level consultations with Australia and the UK lined up this month. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal will be in the UK for talks with his counterpart Elizabeth Truss this week, while Australian trade minister Dan Tehan is scheduled to be in the capital towards the end of the month to take forward the dialogue. Although discussions are still in an exploratory phase, the Centre has started marking out the red areas, many of which may prove to be contentious as the talks progress. For instance, in an interview, the UK chancellor of exchequer Rishi Sunak had indicated to TOI that his government was keen on services being liberalised by both countries. While India’s interest is in Mode IV — visas for its tech professionals, doctors and nurses — for the UK, the pitch will be opening up of legal services and such “taboo areas”. When it comes to some of the earlier no-go territories, such as lower duties on Scotch, signals are that India will be more accommodative in its stand than earlier, hoping that it will manage to get the UK to offer easy access for Indian textiles and engineering goods. Similarly, when it comes to Australia, the government is willing to engage on sectors like coal where imports for power plants are in any case taking place. But dairy is a sector which has proved to be a red zone, as was seen during the aborted negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, where India pulled out at the last minute. For Australia, dairy has been a key area of interest, but India has been wary of cutting tariffs, especially on products such as skimmed milk powder, given its likely adverse impact on the domestic economy. Unlike the large farms in Australia, the Indian dairy sector has millions of small farmers. What complicates matters further for talks with the UK, Australiaaswell astheEuropean Union is the fact that nearly half the goods exported by India are already in zero-tariff category, with these countries having their defensive interests in some of the items where customs duty are in place. Although it is early days, the stance taken by negotiators also evolves as talks progress, depending on what the other side is willing to put on the table. Besides, the discussions for the free trade agreements also need to be seen in the context of the new geo-political alignment taking place in the post-Covid world. Given that ties with Australia have strengthened in the last few months as Canberra has signalled that it wants to rely less on China, the government is hoping to clinch what is called an early harvest scheme by December, covering around half the tariff lines. But with elections due in Australia, it is unlikely that the trade deal can be ratified by Parliament until at least the second half of the year. In any case, the government’s keenness for such an agreement is not shared by some of the other sides, such as the European Union, which is another focus partner for a trade and investment treaty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/efforts-for-fta-with-uk-oz-gather-pace/articleshow/86155878.cms||Sidhartha

The leaders would be coming twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays. The company’s chairman Rishad Premji on Sunday tweeted, “After 18 months, our leaders @Wipro are coming back to office starting tomorrow (twice a week). All fully vaccinated, all ready to go – safely and socially distanced. We will watch this closely.” Senior leadership includes delivery heads, function heads, GMs, VPs and above. The company declined to provide the number of executives who would be back. Premji also shared a video about the Covid-related safety protocols that have been put in place at the office. In a separate statement, Wipro said that for all other employees, workfrom-home has been extended until October 31. It also said that over 70% of ‘Wiproites’ based in India have taken at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Other IT majors have also been showing indications of returning to office. Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat was in India earlier this month, marking the first visit by a major global IT CEO. The visit brought Capgemini India leaders into the company’s offices. TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan said last week that it expected the majority of its employees to return to office by the end of this year. Infosys expects 20-30% of employees coming to work from office over the next six months, depending on the nature of projects, client requirements and individual preferences. But all of this assumes that pandemic cases do not rise. Companies will initially have employees coming only for a few days in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wipro-brass-back-in-office-today/articleshow/86155968.cms||---

These two taxiways were inaugurated on Thursday. Air India's Boeing-787 Dreamliner was the first aircraft to use the newly built taxi way, which was given a water cannon salute. A senior official from Airports Authority of India (AAI) said the parallel taxi track on the northern side of main runway 07/25 has been extended to about 1,200 metres from the existing 300 metres. This will help planes moving in and out of the remote bays, located on the northern side of the main runway, without entering the main runway. By doing so the departures can take place without much delay. Under the old system, the aircraft would be made to cross the main runway to use the taxi track on the south side of the runway or on rare occasions to use the runway itself. The new taxiways will help the airport to use the parking bays located on the northern part of the airport more efficiently. The new taxiways will also result in reducing the runway occupancy time of the aircraft for the secondary runway during the maintenance of main runway, as the arriving aircraft can now use the new taxiway ‘R3’ to vacate the runway. The new taxi tracks will help in the better utilisation of the secondary runway. Also, the defence aircraft movement can be done unhindered from the northern side of the runway. Work on these new taxiways began during the pre-covid time and due to various factors, the completion was delayed. This is part of the mega project, which included demolition of old terminal and construction of new terminals, construction of multi-level car parking, which can accommodate 1,200 cars at a time and the taxiways work, said the official. The AAI had planned a total of four new taxiways of which two were inaugurated. Work on two more new taxiways are in progress. While one is expected to be ready within two months, the fourth one will be ready by March next year. The mega projects are expected to be completed by next year, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-taxiways-to-help-planes-reach-terminals-faster-at-chennai-airport/articleshow/86156004.cms||P Oppili
---||Business||Vaccine only way for eco recovery: FM||CHENNAI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday underlined the need for vaccination to not just help avert a possible third wave of Covid infections but also to step up economic activity, describing it as the only medicine that allows people to go about their business. “Vaccination has been going on smoothly in the country and, so far, 73 crore people have already received jabs... Through the programme, people were able to conduct business, traders were able to procure products to run businesses, boosting the economy, or farmers were able to do farming. So, vaccination is the only medicine,” she said at the centenary year celebrations of the Tuticorin-based Tamilnad Mercantile Bank (TMB). Sitharaman’s team of economists in the finance ministry has repeatedly pushed for a ramp-up of vaccination for faster economic growth. On Sunday, the FM said that the support through viability gap funding will also help bolster the healthcare system to deal with a possible third wave. “Through the report by TMB, we are able to see that they take the schemes announced by the ministry to the beneficiaries (such as hospitals)… Not only public sector banks, private sector banks should also follow,” she said while asserting that every individual is entitled to banking service. The FM also said that public sector banks appeared to be stable now. “The problems faced by the banking sector affects the business dependent on the banks too. With increased bad loans leading to the government bailing out the banks through developmental or growth finance, the banks’ energy and resources were diverted towards recovery of loans,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vaccine-only-way-for-eco-recovery-fm/articleshow/86156011.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Coimbatore, which continued to report the highest number of fresh cases (212), had a TPR of 2%. Erode, where the TPR has increased significantly from 1.1 % last week to 1.6% now, reported 160 new cases. During this time period, the number of samples tested daily in Chennai declined from 22,000 to 20,000 and TPR remained below 1%. The district had 197 fresh cases. Similarly, in the neighbouring district of Chengalpet (113 new cases), the TPR was unchanged at 1.3%. Among those who died on Sunday, 20 of them had comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension and only three were aged below 50. TN's case fatality ratio has hovered around 1.3% for the past four weeks. A recovery rate of 98% during these weeks has helped TN to reduce the number of active cases gradually. At present, 16,473 patients are undergoing treatment at hospitals or their homes. This was above 20,000 on the same day last month. TN's active case ratio is 0.6%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1608-new-covid-19-cases-22-deaths-in-tamil-nadu-coimbatore-remains-hotspot/articleshow/86156042.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: CPI blames CPM for defeat of its candidates in election||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI has find fault with the CPM in the defeat of their candidates in the recently held assembly elections. The election review report of the CPI has said that there was severe erosion in the CPM vote bank in constituencies like Haripad and Paravur where CPI candidates tasted defeat. The report also said that in many constituencies where the CPM had candidates, they did not cooperate with the constituent partners in the campaigning. It pointed out the elections in the constituencies like Kasaragod, Uduma, Trikaripur and Konni for this. The report pointed out that in these constituencies even the election committee meeting was not convened. In Haripad where the then opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala was the Congress candidate, there was severe vote erosion in the CPM vote bank, the report said. The LDF could not lead even in the CPM-dominated panchayats like Kumarapauram and Trikkunnapuzha. This shows that there has been huge erosion of votes here. Similarly, in Paravur where Congress’s V D Satheesan had contested, the CPI candidate did not get enough support from the CPM local leadership. In Chathannoor constituency where the party candidate G S Jayalal had won, there was considerable dip in the votes polled for the LDF candidate. For the defeat in Karunagapally constituency also the party passed the buck on the CPM. The CPM votes were not polled in several booths where the party has strong roots, the report alleged. CPI which observed that the entry of Kerala Congress (Mani) has not done any good for the LDF in the assembly election, however, has found that the KC (M) lost several seats since the CPM votes were not polled there. The report said the defeat of Jose K Mani in Pala was due to personal reasons and it was not political. This report assumes significance since the CPM had in its election review report had pointed put that the CPI had fielded a weak candidate in Paravur against V D Satheesan. The CPM was also all praise for the role KC(M) had in the LDFs impressive performance in central Travancore region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-cpi-blames-cpm-for-defeat-of-its-candidates-in-election/articleshow/86156091.cms||---
---||Faridabad||8,000 hectares of Aravalis in Faridabad not part of NCZ: Haryana govt||GURUGRAM: Around 8,000 hectares of the Aravalis in Faridabad are not part of the Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ), the Haryana government has pointed out. This is likely to pave the way for constructions in the green area, an issue that has led to several court petitions by environmental activists. In a letter to all the districts, principal secretary (town and country planning) AK Singh has said that the protected Aravalis should be defined according to a 1992 notification by the Centre, which says that the “specific areas” of the forests are limited to Gurugram in Haryana and Alwar in Rajasthan. “It has been noted that in the revenue record, there is no term namely ‘Aravalli’, rather there is only mention of ‘Gair Mumkin Pahar’. Accordingly, some of the districts have identified the areas recorded as ‘Gair Mumkin Pahar’, in revenue records, under NCZ by considering the same as ‘Aravalli' and simultaneously highlighted the same for decision by state level committee for NCZ,” the letter said. It further said, “On this issue the attention was drawn towards the minutes of the meeting held under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, Haryana in March 2017, wherein on the issue regarding identification of Aravalli, the following is recorded: ‘…Government of Haryana may consider this notification in old district Gurugram only and areas specified in the notification dated 07.05.1992 may be considered as Aravalli. Definition of Aravalli may not be extended to other Haryana sub-region areas which are not defined in the Aravalli notification dated 07.05.1992 unless the same is done by MoEF&CC through a similar notification. So only ‘specified areas’ in old district Gurugram existing on 07.05.1992 may be part of ‘confirmed NCZ’.” The letter by Singh is based on findings of a “ground-truthing” exercise that was started in 2014 to identify areas that had been left out of the NCZ and those that were included inadvertently. Environmental activists raised objections to the state government’s decision. “Instead of protecting the Aravalis, the Haryana government is protecting the interests of real estate developers. This is coming at the expense of wildlife and its habitats, air quality and ground water recharge. The government is trying to undermine the decision of the NCR planning board (which said Aravalis are spread in the entire region). This is a brazen attempt to open up Aravalis for real estate,” said Lt Col Sarvadaman Singh Oberoi (retired), an activist. In a meeting with the state government in 2016, the NCR planning board had also referred to the Centre’s 1992 notification of the Aravalis only in Gurugram and Alwar. The board had then said that the Centre’s delineation could be extended in the “entire NCR region”. The order has taken many activists by surprise too. They pointed out that several Supreme Court judgments on mining in Faridabad were based on the premise that the activity was banned in the Aravali hills. In a recent verdict, the apex court had also ordered the demolition of 10,000 houses that had come up illegally in Khori village in the Aravali hills of Faridabad. “There are so many documents showing that the Aravalis exist in other districts too. There are district gazette plans, the forest department’s working reports, the mining department’s documents and most importantly, the Supreme Court’s judgments banning mining. How can the Haryana government question its own documents?” asked RP Balwan, a former forest conservator of Gurugram. The Haryana government has spent years deliberating on the definition of “forests”. In December 2016, it had agreed with the NCR planning board on the issue of forests. In 2017, the board had referred to the December 2016 meeting with the government and said that “specified areas (i.e. the land categories of Gair Mumkin Pahar or Gair Mumkin Rada or Gair Mumkin Behed or Banjad Beed or Rundh) as given in the MoEF’s notification dated 07.05.1992 are to be included while identifying/delineating Aravalli in entire NCR, by the participating states”. A senior official in the housing and urban affairs ministry said the Centre’s notification was based on certain Supreme Court judgments regarding mining activities. He added that since they could not reach a specific definition of the Aravalis in previous meetings, they had resorted to the 1992 notification. The fresh directive of the government, the officials pointed out, thus counters the decision reached at the 2016 meeting between the Haryana government and the NCR planning board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/8000-hectares-of-aravalis-in-faridabad-arent-part-of-ncz-says-haryana-government/articleshow/86156995.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Worker loses all fingers on a hand, claims machine faulty||GURUGRAM: A 22-year-old man working at a factory in Ashok Vihar lost all five fingers of his right hand after it was sucked inside a die-cutting machine, which he claimed was faulty. Balendra Singh was rushed to a small clinic, from where his brother Satyender took him to a private hospital. Singh was eventually referred to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. The accident took place on September 9. Singh, who had arrived from Pratapgarh in UP six months ago, had started working in the Ashok Vihar factory after a few days. He claimed he had been repeatedly asking his employer, Yogendra Singh Rathore, to change the die-cutting machine, but to no avail. Die cutting machines are used to make different shapes of paper or cards. As these machines use a combination of rollers and cutting plates, they should be handled only by trained workers. However, most workers in factories in the city are forced to handle these machines without even basic training, sources said. “The machine was quite old. My brother had told the factory owner the machine was faulty and could lead to accidents. But he was instead asked to continue working or leave the job. We are poor people. We have few options,” said Satyender. Thursday’s accident comes almost a month after a 19-year-old contractual worker lost his right palm in a power press accident at a factory on Sohna Road on August 8. That worker had also claimed he was forced to work both day and night shifts for four days at a stretch. Satyender alleged Rathore also tried to hush up the matter by paying them money. “I didn’t accept any money from him. My brother has lost his fingers. No amount of money can compensate for the loss,” he added. There were also allegations that no worker in the Ashok Vihar factory was given safety equipment while on duty. “Tomorrow, if there is a fire in the factory, there is no emergency exit. No worker is given any safety gear,” Satyender said. Following a complaint by him, an FIR has been lodged against Rathore at Sector 5 police station under sections 279 (endangering human life) and 338 (causing grievous hurt to any person) of the IPC. Rathore, however, dubbed the allegations against him “baseless”. “The machine wasn’t faulty, He is lying,” he said. The factory owner also denied paying any money to Satyender to hush up the matter. “I didn’t bribe him. It was me who took him to the doctor,” said Rathore, who has 12 workers under him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/man-loses-right-hand-fingers-to-faulty-machine-in-factory/articleshow/86150106.cms||Sagrika Kissu

According to the complainant, because of her age she was unable to do most of the daily chores at home and had therefore, suggested that a help should be hired. “That is when my daughter-in-law lost her cool and misbehaved with me,” she said. Ayush Mittal, the woman’s son, has alleged that his wife, Kavita, got enraged and started beating up his mother. The family was already having an argument which escalated after Kavita assaulted her mother-in-law. The family for quite some has been facing some problems because of which they lived separately in the same building with the the elderly couple living upstairs and Ayush along with his wife and two children downstairs. The son has alleged that his wife has been pestering his mother for years. The incident was captured in a video clip that has gone viral. The clip shows Kavita slapping her mother-in-law who is crying, and lashing out at her father-in-law, Anshul, when he attempted to interfere. An FIR has been registered at Rajendra Park police station and the woman has been booked under sections 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC. The family has alleged that the elderly woman has faced injuries but the police has denied such reports saying that the victim has not suffered any grave injuries and is doing fine. “We are investigating the matter right now. The video is viral but we would listen to the other side as well,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/woman-booked-for-assaulting-mother-in-law/articleshow/86152191.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||Tau Devi Lal stadium to get Gurugram's second government swimming pool||GURUGRAM: Even as its only government-run swimming pool lies defunct, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has approved a plan to build another facility, at the Tau Devi Lal sports complex at its core planning cell (CPC) meeting earlier this week. The construction of the indoor, all-weather facility is set to be completed in a year once the work begins for around Rs 30 crore, officials said. The project is likely to come as a relief for swimmers in Gurugram, many of whom currently travel around 20 kilometres to go to Talkatora stadium in Delhi for practice. “The proposal for the swimming pool at Tau Devi Lal sports complex has been approved in the CPC by the chief executive officer (CEO) of the GMDA, and we will now be examining the layout to determine where it can be provisioned. First, the expression of interest (EOI) will be prepared, following which tendering will begin. It will be made on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis,” a senior GMDA official said on Sunday. Though a plan for a second public swimming pool in the city had been in the pipeline for “some time”, so far, a decision on “how it should be made” had not been finalised, officials said. Currently, the city has only one government-run swimming pool at Kamla Nehru Park, which is being renovated by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). “This is a very big project and will provide relief to swimmers in the city, who currently have to go to Talkatora stadium for practice, which puts both a physical and a financial strain on them. They also waste a lot of time commuting. Once the swimming pool at the sports complex is ready, swimmers from Gurugram can practice here all year round,” the GMDA official added. Local residents and people associated with the sport, however, said they were unsure when the plan will actually see the light of day. “Gurgoan is a very old city but has expanded massively over the past few years in terms of both area and population. However, there has not been a simultaneous increase in sports facilities or infrastructure. There should be a minimum of two or three swimming pools in different locations in the city so that everyone can access these facilities,” a former district swimming coach, who did not wish to be named, told TOI. The GMDA proposal sounds good, the former coach said, adding, “But it often takes years for these files to move and the work to be done. We don’t know how long it will be before the formalities are completed and the pool is operational.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/tau-devi-lal-stadium-to-get-gurgaons-second-government-swimming-pool/articleshow/86150168.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The minimum temperature dropped to 21.6 degrees Celsius, three notches below the season’s normal and the maximum remained at 30.6 degrees Celsius. While a short but intense spell was observed in some parts of city, no reports of waterlogging were reported. According to the IMD’s observatory, the city received 4.8 mm rainfall during the day. According to IMD officials, the rainfall activities are likely to be subdued for the next 3-4 days but few isolated places will witness light rain. “The wet spell is likely to be subdued for the next 3-4 days with a possibility of scattered light rain at isolated places during the same period. However, another spell is likely to begin from September 17 due to depression over the Bay of Bengal,” the IMD official said. Meanwhile, the relative humidity index oscillated between 97% and 98% during the day. So far in the monsoon season, Gurgaon has received surplus rains with 48% and recorded 700 mm of rainfall as compared to normal of 472.3 mm. In the past 12 days, the city witnessed 229% excess rainfall. According to the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature in the next six days is likely to hover between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature will settle at 23 and 25 degrees Celsius. The city air quality index remained in the satisfactory category with a reading of 54, slightly up from Saturday’s 51. Meanwhile, after Saturday’s spell of heavy rain, which saw Delhi cross the 1,100 mm mark for monsoon rainfall this year, the city recorded another rainy day on Sunday. While the conditions were overcast throughout the day, most parts of the capital only recorded drizzle and light rain. IMD has forecast rain next week, too, but said heavy showers were unlikely with a spell of light rain more likely throughout the week.

---||Noida||Noida: One-third of students had no internet access in pandemic, say parents||NOIDA: Around 30% of children studying in 1,646 government and private schools in Gautam Budh Nagar faced disruptions in their studies without access to mobiles, internet and laptops or smartphones during the coronavirus pandemic. While no official survey has been undertaken in the district so far, official estimates and parents’ association, citing feedback from parents and schools say nearly 5-10% of students enrolled in private schools also switched to government ones due to insufficient or loss of family income and inability to pay fees. According to Dharamveer Singh, the district inspector of schools (DIOS), of late there has been a lot of students’ migration from private to government schools. This, he said, was mainly an aftereffect of the pandemic. “Insufficient family income or higher fees are among the main reasons why about 5-10% of private school children shifted to government ones. Education of about 30% children, mostly from lower-middle to low-income families in semi-rural and rural areas, suffered in the absence of gadgets to attend online classes,” Singh said. Dropouts from schools, however, have remained low. Several children belonging to migrant families, who had left the district during the pandemic, are gradually returning back and re-joining school, the DIOS said. “However, now that the schools are reopening, initiatives are being taken to ensure recovery of classes missed. We expect children to benefit from it,” Singh said. He added that a versatile model of teaching-cum-studies was introduced during the pandemic and it was likely to continue for some time. Manoj Kataria, founder of GB Nagar Parents’ Welfare Society (GPWS), meanwhile, said there were many students in government schools who dropped out because their parents shifted to their native places and they didn't have gadgets to continue classes from there. “But parents of almost all private school students, including those studying in big-budget schools (where the annual fee is Rs1 lakh or above) or low-budget schools (where the annual fee is less than Rs80,000) in the city or in remote areas, have shifted their wards to smaller or government schools,” he said. According to Kataria, the main reason for the migration was financial stress and the inability to pay fees. “We did a Google survey recently to understand how many parents consented to reopening schools in the current situation. We found that about 30% to 40% private schools, which are recognised up to class 8 (mostly running out of rented buildings), were not functioning as they were waiting for students to return,” Kataria said. District programme officer Atul Soni, meanwhile, said of the seven children orphaned due to the pandemic in GB Nagar six were school-going. DIOS Singh maintained that a 100% fees waiver for orphaned children have been arranged by the officials in cooperation with schools. “It’s heartening to note that not a single school opposed this move and agreed to extend a fee waiver,” Singh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/30-kids-didnt-have-access-to-internet-gadgets-studies-hit/articleshow/86152300.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Jaipur||Lewd video: Suspended woman constable arrested in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Rajasthan police on Sunday arrested the suspended woman constable based on a video of her sexual activities with suspended RPS officer Heera Lal Saini in a swimming pool in presence of her minor son. Both Saini and constable were booked under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) and the IT Act. They were accused of child molestation when the video shot on the constable’s phone went viral. The case was handed over to the special operations group (SOG) because the agency has expertise in investigating cyber offences. A senior official of Rajasthan police told TOI that Saini was staying with the constable and her son at a resort in Udaipur. Cops detained him from there on Thursday night and took him to Ajmer for investigation, including medical examination. He was brought to Jaipur on Saturday and sent to police remand till September 17. An official said the videos were reportedly recorded inside a hotel in Ajmer. “It appears that the constable’s minor son had accidentally posted the video as a status on some social media account, from there it was quickly circulated,” the official claimed. Saini was posted as circle officer (CO) Bewar in Ajmer district before he was suspended by DGP ML Lather. “It was a serious offence because a minor was involved in the case therefore we had to take prompt action to send a strong message,” an official said. While both Saini and the constable were suspended soon after the video emerged, a vigilance inquiry is underway against both of them. The incident came as a major embarrassment to the Rajasthan police. Two other RPS officials and two SHOs were also suspended because of their inept handling of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lewd-video-suspended-woman-constable-arrested-in-rajasthan/articleshow/86156156.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Heads set to roll in state BJP over assembly poll debacle||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: If the common vibe shared by senior leaders of the state BJP is anything to go by, several heads are set to roll in the mandalam, district and state-level committees of the party in the coming days. The core committee meeting held in Ernakulam on Sunday is learnt to have resolved to act tough against leaders who were ‘inactive’ or ‘ineffectual’ during the state assembly election. The 11-member core committee discussed the major points raised by five fact finding committees that interacted with the party cadres and leaders after the party drew a blank in the assembly poll. According to sources, at least a couple of district presidents, a few state office-bearers, and scores of mandalam committee presidents are likely to face the axe, in view of the widespread criticism from the party workers against the organizational lapses in the election. The party workers, according to the fact-finding report, were of the view that the rejection of nomination papers of some candidates, even in Kannur district where the party is engaged in direct fight with the CPM, sent out a wrong message to the public and disheartened the ordinary workers. The core committee acknowledged the criticism of the workers that untimely and unwise statements made by senior leaders like O Rajagopal and Kummanam Rajasekharan in the run up to the election and the defiant stand of Sobha Surendran before the finalization of candidature did affect the prospects of the party. The committee also noted the feelings of a preponderance of workers that the party lost the grip over the election as state president K Surendran contested from two constituencies. Based on the feedback from the grassroots-level workers, the core committee concluded that the soft Hindutva approach should be aggressively pursued by the party without fail as it assessed that the politics in the state is fast moving towards a communally polarized one. The meeting decided to actively support and protect the interest of the Christian churches even while it felt that both the soft Hindutva approach and the pro-Christian stand did not help the party to win votes, but indirectly helped the CPM politically. However, the committee felt, the short-term setbacks need not deter the party from following the most ‘desirable’ political approach that could only help the party in the long run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-heads-set-to-roll-in-state-bjp-over-assembly-poll-debacle/articleshow/86156170.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||Over 300 kids lost either one or both parents to Covid in Gzb||Ghaziabad: At least 316 children lost either one or both of their parents due to Covid-19 pandemic in Ghaziabad, a survey conducted by the district administration has found. As per official records, 25 children have been orphaned during the pandemic while 263 lost their fathers to the infection and 28 others lost their mothers. So far, the administration has extended financial assistance to about 100 children while as many others will get the same this week, officials said. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta on Sunday said the survey report has been submitted to the district administration for further action. “Detailed guidelines have been issued by the state government to provide relief to such children. The social welfare department, under the chief development officer, is monitoring this relief work,” Gupta added. Earlier, the state government launched the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's Child Service Scheme for arranging maintenance, education, and medical facilities for such affected children. District probation officer Vikas Chandra said, “Forms of all children have been filled up and about 100 children have been given monetary assistance, so far. According to the government’s order, an amount on the basis of Rs 4,000 per month for the next three months has been deposited in their legal guardian’s bank account. Next time, a consolidated amount for the next six months would be deposited.” The district administration has sought funds to pay the next instalment, officials said. Children studying in class IX and above would be provided with a laptop. Chandra added that there is also a provision to admit students to Atal Residential Schools and Kasturba Gandhi Residential Schools. As per the criteria of identifying beneficiaries (up to 18 years), the victim must be a resident of Uttar Pradesh and should have lost an income-earning parent whose annual income is not more than Rs 2 lakh, Chandra informed. To avail the welfare scheme benefits, one has to submit RT-PCR positive test report, blood report or CT scan of their parents as proof. Even as those people who had died due to post-Covid complications are being considered under the scheme, officials said, adding that all children of a family will be able to get the benefit of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/over-300-kids-lost-either-one-or-both-parents-to-covid-in-gzb/articleshow/86152450.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Kolkata||Scientists from across globe raise a toast to Kolkata||KOLKATA: Leading science museum professionals and science communicators from across the world, including Israeli Moshe Rispon, American Marilyn Hoyt and German Hans Martin Hinz, feel Kolkata that has been home to legendary scientists like Jagadish Chandra Bose, Meghnad Saha and Satyen Bose should be celebrated for catalysing the science museum and science centre movements in India. It was Bengal’s second CM Bidhan Chandra Roy and city-based industrialist G D Birla who had joined hands to set up the Birla Industrial & Technological Museum (BITM). A decade later, Jadavpur University alumni and ex-president of International Council of Museums (ICOM) Saroj Ghose and his classmate Rathindra Mohan Chakraborty played a key role in setting up a science centre. Ghose later went on to establish the first science city in Kolkata. BC Roy’s exposure to Deutsche Museum in Munich and Science Museum in London led him to request GD Birla to help set up a science museum in Kolkata. The Birla family that then resided in the mansion where BITM is now housed, was already planning to shift to a sprawling bungalow complex next door on Gurusaday Dutta Road. The Birla patriarch donated the mansion to the government of India to set up BITM. It was then handed over to the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research that set up the museum in 1959. The Visvesvaraya Industrial & Technological Museum (VITM) was donated by industrialists in Bengaluru in 1965. “At the time BC Roy conceived a science museum, there were no experts in the field. So he brought in Amalendu Basu, a patents examiner at the Kolkata office who used to study scientific inventions while scrutinizing patent applications, as the planning officer. Basu got hold of catalogues from the few science museums that were there around the world. He then recruited me, a 22-year-old fresh JU graduate, in 1958. He also recruited a couple of retired people. A year later, this team set up BITM with seven galleries. India’s scientific research and cultural affairs minister then was Humayun Kabir, also from Bengal,” recalled Ghose, who is called the father of the science centre movement in India. While there were only science museums at the time, the big change happened in 1968-69 when the Exploratorium opened in San Francisco, followed by the Toronto Centennial Science Centre (TCSC), later renamed Ontario Science Centre. From display of scientific objects and historical artefact, they ushered in the concept of education-based centres where one could carry out open experiments. In 1970, Ghose went for doctoral thesis to the Smithsonian institutions in Washington DC and would travel to the Exploratorium whenever he got an opportunity. Around the same time, Ghose's class-friend RM Chakraborty who was in charge of VITM received a scholarship to go to Ontario for nine months and he spent time at TCSC. “Both of us were tremendously excited about the prospect of how science could connect with the masses. So when an opportunity arose in 1978 to set up a large museum in Mumbai, we decided it would be an experimental and educational science centre. That is how the Nehru Science Centre came into being,” recounted Ghose. Nearly 50 science centres have been set up since. At the same time, the government also decided to set up an umbrella organisation for science museums and centres in the country. Amalendu Basu, BITM former director Samar Bagchi and Ghose then came up with the name National Council of Science Museums (NCSM).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scientists-from-across-globe-raise-a-toast-to-kol/articleshow/86150448.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Alwar youth run over by car, FIR filed against cow vigilantes||ALWAR: A 17-year-old youth in Alwar was run over by a speeding car suspected to be driven by members of a cow vigilante group on Sunday early morning. The incident took place sometime around 7am on Chopanki-Tauru road on the interstate borders of Rajasthan and Haryana. The victim, identified as Sabir, a resident of Sare Kalan village, was jogging alongside the road with his friends when a car run over them. Sabir was killed while one of his friends have sustained injuries. The family has alleged that the accused had deliberately murdered Sabir. The victim’s family filed an FIR at Chopanki police station naming seven persons with ties to Gau Raksha and Bajrang Dal. The accused identified in the FIR are -Anil, Mintu, Himanshu, Pushkar, Soun, Rahul and Abu. The victim’s uncle in his FIR to the police alleged that about five days ago Sabir and his friends had confronted Anil for driving recklessly on the same road. Anil had allegedly warned Sabir that he will mow him down if the latter is seen running or exercising on the road ever again. He also claimed himself to be associated with Gau Raksha dal and Bajrang Dal. Police have booked all seven named in the FIR under Sections 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and, 143 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC. Meanwhile, officials are also examining if the vehicle that hit Sabir was chasing another vehicle allegedly driven by cattle smugglers. “It is suspected that there were two vehicles involved in the incident, one was chasing another before the incident took place,” an official said wishing anonymity. One of the youths who were present at the spot told cops that a speeding minitruck that had cattle in it, had hit him. He said that he saw two other vehicles chasing the truck. Cops suspect it was likely that one of these vehicles may have hit Sagir. Several members of local Meo organisations gathered at the spot and demanded justice for the victim. Local activist and leader, Sher Mohammad alleged that Sabir’s death was due to gau rakshaks. “Everyday self-styled gau rakshas race through the road on suspicion of chasing cattle smugglers due to which such incidents have become common. Police need to act tough on those who violate the law,” he said. SP, Bhiwadi, Ram Murti Joshi said that the body was handed over to the family after the post-mortem. “The family members have given an FIR in which they have alleged the involvement of members of some right-wing groups from Tauru (Haryana) who killed Sabir following a scuffle that took place a few days ago,” Joshi said, adding that a police team was constituted to investigate the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-alwar-youth-run-over-by-car-fir-filed-against-cow-vigilantes/articleshow/86156261.cms||---
