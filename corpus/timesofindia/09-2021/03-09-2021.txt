Not just to visit the temple on top of the hills, but also to just soak in the view and hang out with friends and family. The recent horrific gang-rape that took place recently, however, has made people a bit wary of being at their favourite hangout lately. Bangalore Times visited the foothills during the evening and found that the rules put in place as part of Covid-related restrictions over the last year has visitors following new norms. Take for instance the fact that people are not allowed to go up the hills post 6 pm. However, the restrictions ensure a definite lack of people movement around the area post 6 pm – which could ensure both safety as well as an open ground for miscreants. Students Chinmayee and Akhila Yadav, who were at the foothills during our visit, say, “The place where the gang-rape incident took place is at quite a distance away from hills. It is a completely secluded area. We have been visiting the hills regularly for the last seven years, and until recently, we felt this was the safest place. However, since there are restrictions in place now, with no entry up the hills post 6 pm, visitors are around only during the day.” An IT employee, Dhanalakshmi, who was visiting the foothills, adds, “I usually spend time with my friends near Nandi temple where we also get food items like churmuri and cut fruits. On any of my visits, I haven’t come across even an eve-teasing incident, and that has given my friends and me the confidence to come here regularly so far." The monsoon is one of the best season to visit the hills, considering that the entire range is covered in greenery. Soumya and Umesha, a young couple we met at the foothills tell us, “When lockdown was imposed for close two months the hill remained out of bounds. It is unfair that we are put through even more restrictions because of such incidents. Though, as long as there is continuous movement of vehicles and people, we feel we may not be at a risk of falling prey to such incidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/post-rape-incident-visitors-to-mysurus-chamundi-foothills-stick-to-safe-hours/articleshow/85864404.cms||Vinay Lokesh

It will have a range of about 100km. The requirement for what the army calls "loitering munition" will be fulfilled by 'SkyStriker' drones to be made and supplied by Bengaluru-headquartered company Alpha Design-led joint venture (JV) involving Israeli firm Elbit Security Systems (ELSEC). The contract signed on Wednesday is worth around Rs 100 crore. According to Elbit systems’ website, SkyStriker is a cost-effective loitering munition capable of long-range precise tactical strikes. The drone improves performance, situational awareness and survivability by providing direct-fire aerial-precision capabilities to maneuverable troops and special forces. The ‘suicide drone’ as some describe it — as it crashes into the target with the explosives — is an autonomous system that can locate, acquire and strike operator-designated targets with a 5kg warhead installed inside the fuselage. Its electric propulsion offers a minimal acoustic signature, allowing covert operations at low altitude, making it a silent, invisible and surprise attacker. Col (retd) HS Shankar, CMD, Alpha Design, told TOI: "Location details (GPS) will be loaded onto the drone before launch. Upon launching, it will hover around the area, pick-up the target, relay the information back to ground control equipment and strike only after getting clearance. Ground control can change targets after the launch, and even call it back in case a mission has to be aborted." The Alpha-Elbit JV has already exported about 100 such drones — manufactured based on Elbit’s technology — and has orders for another 100 exports. Alpha owns 51% in the JV. Radars & Friend-Foe FinderAside from the army contract for its JV, Alpha Design has independently bagged two more defence contracts from the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the past week. The first is for six Very High Frequency (VHF) radars. The IAF already has long-distance surveillance radars — P18 radars — that can capture targets beyond 200km procured in 1980 and 1990s. Given their age, the IAF was looking at whether it should upgrade the P18s or procure new ones at the same cost and decided to buy new ones. Under the emergency procurement powers, the IAF issued EOIs and RFPs which got responses from four companies: defence PSU BEL and three private firms Alpha Design, Astra Microwave and Data Patterns. While all four firms met the technical requirements, Alpha emerged as the lowest bidder (L1) and bagged the Rs 200+ crore contract signed last week. The second, also an IAF contract, is for around 60 Identification of Friend-or-Foe (IFF) systems that will be integrated with ground radars. This technology was developed by the Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) under DRDO and transferred to three firms: Alpha, BEL and Data Patterns. All of them had built prototypes that were approved by authorities concerned but Alpha emerged as the L1 firm to bag the Rs 80+ crore contract, signed on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-to-get-100-sky-strikers-for-balakot-type-missions-from-bengaluru/articleshow/85879001.cms||Chethan Kumar

As per norms, post-mortem is mandatory in case of unnatural death. The family has demanded a judicial inquiry in the matter. “We were on our way to Civil Hospital when we were stopped by some policemen and asked to return home. They said we would face charges if we got the post-mortem done and that they had received ‘orders from above’,” alleged Sushil’s son Sahil (23). Police refuted the claims, saying no one stopped them from getting the post-mortem done. “This is a false accusation. Had he (Sushil) been injured, there would have been a medico-legal report (MLR), but there was none,” Karnal DC Nishant Singh Yadav. The family, however, said while there was no MLR on the day of the lathicharge, it was done the next day, by which time Sushil had died. Sushil, a marginal landholding farmer owning two acres of land, had reached home in Raipur Jattan village at 8.30pm after the lathicharge. Sahil told TOI he was barely able to stand and his shirt was covered in dirt and blood. He didn’t eat anything and took a painkiller with turmeric milk and fell on the charpoy to sleep, he added. “He had bruises on his body. He was feeling dizzy, so I suggested we take him to hospital but he said many farmers had been beaten up, most of whom were old. He said if his condition didn’t improve, he would see the doctor in the morning,” said Sahil. However, the next morning when his wife Sudesh went to check on him, he didn’t wake up. “I cried for help and called my son. I had never imagined he would leave us like this,” she said. Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, core committee member of SKM, claimed the farmers were lathi-charged four times. “The cremation was done so hurriedly that the family couldn’t wait for us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pressured-to-cremate-farmer-say-kin-dc-calls-it-a-false-allegation/articleshow/85879039.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Woman sues KSRTC for not halting at stop, wins Rs 8,000||BENGALURU: A woman passenger took Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to consumer court after the bus she boarded for Tumakuru from Bengaluru didn’t halt at the stop of her choice and dropped her 400 metres away. The utility has been ordered to pay her a compensation of Rs 8,010 for the inconvenience caused. On the morning of October 24, 2018, Vijaya Bai L, 33, a resident of Urdigere Hobli in Tumakuru, took a KSRTC bus from Bengaluru to Tumakuru to visit her sister’s residence. Despite informing the conductor and driver that she wanted to get off at the HMT bus stop in Tumakuru, the driver failed to stop the vehicle. Following a plea by Vijaya, the bus slowed down and halted 400 metres away from the spot. On disembarking, she found the area was barricaded and she couldn’t cross over to the other side of the road. She was forced to take two autorickshaws by paying Rs 10 and Rs 50, respectively, to reach her destination. Following the unpleasant experience, Vijaya called the KSRTC helpline for relief but in vain. Finally, she approached the Tumakuru District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission with a complaint against KSRTC for deficiency of service. The consumer court on July 29, 2019 ordered Tumakuru divisional controller of KSRTC to refund Rs 10 towards Vijaya’s auto fare and pay compensation of Rs 10,000 and litigation cost of Rs 5,000 along with interest. However, KSRTC appealed against the verdict before Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Bengaluru and litigation began. The corporation’s attorney said the bus Vijaya travelled on was a non-stop passenger with limited stops and, therefore, the request that she be allowed to get off the vehicle in the middle was unjust. But judges of the state forum stated that KSRTC hadn’t provided the bus driver’s version and it is to be noted that the conductor had issued a ticket for HMT bus stop to Vijaya Bai. Moreover, with no consideration for a woman passenger, the driver and conductor dropped her in the middle of the road and she had trouble finding her way to her destination. However, considering the views of KSRTC, the judges in a verdict on July 28, 2021, reduced the compensation amount to Rs 5,000 and the litigation amount to Rs 3,000, but ordered that Rs 10 will have to be paid to the woman passenger within 60 days of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-sues-ksrtc-for-not-halting-at-stop-wins-8000/articleshow/85879057.cms||Petlee Peter

Accused history-sheeter Mohammed Hameed of Ullala Upanagar was arrested on Wednesday by a special team comprising an ACP and three inspectors when he arrived in the city to arrange for finance. Hameed, who is facing more than 15 criminal cases since 2013, purchased ganja from Andhra Pradesh and sold it here through his associates, said deputy commissioner of police (west) Sanjeev Patil. Hameed’s younger brother Mohammed Sadiq is also in custody. In 2013, Vijayanagar police had arrested Hameed on drug-peddling charges. After getting bail, he remained elusive. “Thinking it would be risky for him to operate in the city, Hameed shifted base to Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. From there, he operated a drug mafia and extortion racket in west Bengaluru via his aides,” a police officer said. Hameed would visit his wives and children in the city once a month, but return quickly to his hideouts. “His frequent travel and regular changing of hideouts were the main reasons behind our failure to trace him...,” the officer said. Recently, cops raided the houses of Hameed’s associates.  “We nabbed over a dozen of his associates, cutting down his activities and income. Facing a financial crisis, a desperate Hameed was forced to enter the city and we successfully laid a trap for him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rowdy-cum-drug-peddler-on-the-run-for-8-yrs-caught/articleshow/85879076.cms||---

Airfares have up to doubled till September 10. Apart from pent up demand for tourism, a host of mega events including IPL 2021 in the UAE from September 19, Dubai Expo 2020 from October 1 and ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 from October 17 have led to a sharp rise in travel there. While the T20 final is in Dubai on November 14, the India-Pakistan fixture at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on October 24 is bound to sizzle the desert. Abu Dhabi on Thursday announced that fully vaccinated tourists (Covishield in India’s case) arriving in city from Sunday (September 5) will not need to quarantine. Apart from a pre-departure RT-PCR test, fully jabbed tourists will need to take another test on arrival in Abu Dhabi and then after a certain number of days. Due to all these factors, leading Delhi-based travel agent Anil Kalsi said "flights to Dubai are full." Dubai schools are reopening by September 10 which is also leading to the rush, said a senior airline official. Travel portal ixigo says average return fares from Indian metros to the UAE have upto doubled in the first 10 days of this month (upto September 10), from the spot fares seen between April 1 and 10, 2021. Delhi-Dubai-Delhi has gone up from Rs 16,233 then to Rs 30,261 now; Mumbai-Dubai-Mumbai has risen from Rs 15,059 to Rs 29,471; Bengaluru-Dubai-Bengaluru from Rs 17,778 to 31,942 and Hyderabad-Dubai-Hyderabad from Rs 17,029 to Rs 31,276, says ixigo for spot fares upto September 10. "Fares for bookings made 15-20 days in advance for travel towards the end of September will be 30-35% less than the (current spot) fares," it said. UAE, the biggest international destination for Indian travellers, had imposed restrictions from April-end during the deadly second Covid wave and is now lifting the same gradually. The biggest opening came last week with UAE’s National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority announcing that from August 30, application for tourist visas will be open to people from all countries if that they are fully vaccinated with one of the WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccines. Abu Dhabi government media office site on Thursday announced removal of quarantine for vaccinated (with WHO-recognised jabs) from Sunday (September 5). "Before travelling, vaccinated tourists must verify their vaccination certificate via the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (ICA) website or app. Before boarding, they need to present a negative PCR test result received within 48 hours of departure. Vaccinated tourists arriving from green list destinations must take a PCR test on arrival, and another on day 6, if staying in the emirate. When arriving from other destinations they must take a PCR test on arrival, and further tests on day 4 and day 8, if staying in the emirate. The protocol applies to fully vaccinated tourists who have received a WHO approved vaccine and who are aged 16 years and above," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/post-reopening-rush-to-uae-sends-spot-airfares-soaring/articleshow/85879582.cms||Saurabh Sinha

About 4% or 38 acres and 12 guntas of the encroached land has been recovered by BBMP since the beginning of this year. A survey, covering 204 of the 210 waterbodies, undertaken in 2015-16, had determined the extent of encroachment. Only 20 lakes were encroachment-free. While 28 had only government encroachments, 131 were taken over by both government and private parties and six by slum-dwellers. Nineteen were being used for other purposes. Nothing much was done to clear the encroachments till this year due to procedural reasons, Palike officials said. According to them, the extent of encroachment must have gone up now. Special commissioner (lakes) Shankar Reddy B said: “We have started resurveying the lakes again. With the tahsildars assigned by the government specifically for the purpose, the process has been expedited. We’ll set a deadline in the next 15 days.” Reddy said BBMP does not have the new count of encroachments yet as the survey began only five months ago. BBMP is also in talks with the revenue department for relocation and rehabilitation of slums from certain lakes, he added. The lands were recovered with joint efforts of the lake department of BBMP, police and citizen groups. They have been fenced off by the civic body. Mohan Krishna, chief engineer, department of lakes, BBMP, said they’re re-surveying the lakes to mark boundaries and spot new encroachments. “In the past five years, not many encroachments have been removed because most lakes were not transferred from BDA to BBMP. It was mostly in 2017 and 2019 that a significant number of lakes was transferred to BBMP,” he added. Officials said a few lakes are under litigation as the encroachers have approached the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-4-of-grabbed-lake-land-recovered/articleshow/85879843.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

According to Gopala Reddy, sub-inspector, Bagepalli, they swung into action after receiving information about bones and horns being transported to a remote village. Police kept a close watch on vehicles moving on the Bengaluru-Hyderabad national highway and spotted three trucks moving one behind the other on the night of Tuesday. When the drivers failed to provide convincing answers, officials seized the cargo weighing about 40 tonnes. The horns and bones were to be powdered and mixed with fodder for cattle. Police are on the lookout for the owners of the vehicles and also the person who placed the order. Drivers Sadakath Ali, Toufiq and Basheer Ansari are in judicial custody. Police have taken steps to bury the horns and bones in a forest after obtaining permission from the court. They are investigating all angles, including illegal cow slaughter, Reddy said. Recently, Bajrang Dal activists had intercepted a truck ferrying 26 cattle, including seven buffaloes and 19 oxen, near Kyasamablli in Kolar district. These animals were also being transported illegally from Andhra Pradesh, police found during investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cattle-horns-bones-weighing-40-tonnes-seized-three-arrested/articleshow/85879856.cms||Ranganath Krishnaswamy

The extended family of over a dozen people went to his samadhi in Koppal district’s Kushtagi taluk and held a solemn event with Spandana cutting the cake on Wednesday morning.

The PM’s direction came at the last meeting of the Pragati where he reviewed progress of eight infrastructure projects— six rail and road projects (three each) and two relating to the power sector. The minutes of the Pragati meeting held on August 25 with regard to the Bhanupali-Bilaspur-Beri New Rail Line project says, “Environment and forest, railways and road transport and highways ministries in consultation with law and justice ministry should identify decisions of courts, NGT etc., related to land acquisition, forest or other clearances which are causing delay in infrastructure project. The cabinet secretary should monitor such exercise. A list of delayed projects due to such court decisions including loss incurred to the exchequer may also be prepared.” Several infrastructure projects have been held up across the country due to pending court cases over land acquisition and environmental issues like the Char Dham highway project in Uttarakhand. The PM also directed the railway ministry to devise a hybrid system while planning and building rail tunnels in hilly areas so that road tunnels can also be built together. Sources said this integration will reduce project cost. Earlier, the PM had directed both the road and railway ministries to work together on this aspect while chairing a review of infrastructure sectors. The minutes also mention that a list of projects delayed substantially should be prepared and those responsible identified, as reported by TOI on August 28. “The cabinet secretary should prepare a list of projects which are delayed substantially and identify responsible authorities, agencies and officials for such delay. The list may be submitted within a week,” the minutes said. Sources said though timely completion of infrastructure projects has been the focus of the government, this has become all the more important with the Centre setting an ambitious target to monetise completed projects. For example, the projection to monetise 26,700 km of completed NHs by 2025 to generate Rs 1.6 lakh crore is based on the stretches that are scheduled for completion over the next three years. The government has also set up an informal group of ministers to monitor progress with regard to the decisions taken at Pragati meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prepare-list-of-infrastructure-projects-delayed-due-to-court-decisions-and-assess-extra-government-expenses-pm-to-departments/articleshow/85880149.cms||Dipak K Dash

The jet took off just before 10 a.m. from the Robertson Airport before crashing into the building at Trumpf Inc., a manufacturing company, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie said. “It appears there was some type of mechanical failure during the takeoff sequence that resulted in the crash behind us,” he said. The plane, a Cessna Citation 560X, was headed to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo, North Carolina, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Two pilots and two passengers aboard the plane were killed, McKenzie said. Their names were not immediately released. The crash set off chemical fires inside the Trumpf building, Gov. Ned Lamont said. Everybody who was inside the Trumpf building has been accounted for and there were no serious injuries, McKenzie said Lamont said authorities were in the process of identifying those who died on the plane. He said there was nothing left of it when first responders arrived. “It was just a ball of fire, an explosion, and then the chemical fires afterwards,” he said. “I think they are still trying to identify who was there, identify the next of kin before we can say anything else. I just know it was incredible. The thing was filled with jet fuel.” Farmington is in central Connecticut, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of the state capital of Hartford. McKenzie said an intense fire burned for over 20 minutes. Caleb Vaichaus, who works near the crash site, said he ran to the scene after hearing a loud explosion and seeing billows of black smoke from the Trumpf building. “I ran straight toward it to see if I could help. I got as close as I possibly could and the flames were extremely hot and the fire was just getting bigger,” he told WTIC-TV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/four-passengers-on-small-jet-dead-after-it-crashes-on-takeoff/articleshow/85880133.cms||---

CJI N V Ramana said, “The print and television media are generally responsible and have a regulatory mechanism in place for effecting corrections. But everything shown in a section of media, especially the web-based ones, carry a communal overtone. There is no control”. During the resumed hearing on a more than a year-old petition filed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind complaining about circulation of fake news and biased reporting during the pandemic to vilify Tablighi Markaz, a bench of the CJI and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna took the lid off its pent-up grievances against web portals and web channels allegedly indulging in irresponsible as well as motivated reporting to damage reputations and spread communal disharmony. "There is no regulatory control over fake news and slandering by web portals and YouTube channels. They can publish anything they want without verification or paying heed to facts. If you go to YouTube, there are many channels circulating fake news. Anyone can start a YouTube channel and circulate whatever they want. There is no regulatory mechanism for these channels and portals," said the CJI, and asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta whether the Centre has put in place any regulatory mechanism against people misusing the right to free speech. Mehta said, "The real contest is between freedom of speech and the right of citizens to get correct news and information. Through the framing of the new Information and Technology rules, we have tried to strike a balance between the media’s right to free speech and the citizens’ right to correct information. The rules mainly intend to stop circulation of fake news and hold the web portals and channels accountable for the content disseminated by them". The SG said the new IT rules have been challenged in several high courts and requested the SC to transfer all pending petitions in HCs to itself for an authoritative ruling on the validity of the impugned rules that intend to subserve media’s right to freedom of speech and citizens’ right to authentic news. But, the CJI had not yet finished conveying his concern over the present scenario involving the web portals and channels. "They write vituperatively against judges, institutions and whomever they dislike. And when asked to bear accountability for their reports, they never respond. They say they have a right to publish whatever they wish to. There is no control," Ramana lamented. Mehta said there is a growing tendency among a section of web portals to tarnish the image of individuals and institutions through irresponsible reporting. "Through the new IT rules, the government intends to fasten accountability on the media and the reports they publish. We have attempted to strike a balance between freedom of speech and the right to correct news through a three-tier mechanism. First, the aggrieved person can make a complaint to concerned media; second, the media is mandated to take corrective measures or give response to the complaint within 15 days; thirdly, if no corrective measures are undertaken or the complaint remains unheeded beyond 15 days, the authorities can initiate proceedings," he said. The SC asked the SG to ensure that the Union government filed its fresh counter-affidavit in two weeks detailing the steps taken for stopping fake news and irresponsible reporting. SC also said that it would list the Centre's plea for transfer of all petitions in HCs challenging the new IT rules to the apex court along with the main petition filed by Jamiat Ulama.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/youtube-channels-portals-have-no-accountability-supreme-court/articleshow/85882078.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The 40-year-old actor was rushed to Cooper Hospital in Mumbai, but hospital authorities said he was dead when brought in. Sidharth is survived by his mother and two sisters. His friends and colleagues expressed shock and grief while grappling to come to terms with the news. Sidharth began his career in showbiz as a model and was runner-up in the Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest in 2004. He made his acting debut with the show Babul Ka Aangann Chootey Na in 2008 and followed it up with serials like Jaane Pehchaane Se... Ye Ajnabbi and Love U Zindagi. However, it was his performance as Shiv in Balika Vadhu that made him immensely popular and a household name. He then made his Bollywood debut with Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014), which saw him share screen space with Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt. He had a successful stint on the reality shows that he participated in. While he experimented with dance on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6, he went on to win season seven of Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi. Sidharth, known to be a private person, surprised many when he agreed to be a part of Bigg Boss 13. A decision that brought him into the spotlight like never before. Not only did he win the season, but his popularity hit the roof with his fans, who call themselves ‘Sidhearts’ and putting out posts about him leading to viral trends. Talking about his decision to be a part of the show, in an interview with us in May this year, he had said, “I feel good about my decision because, I wasn’t keen on it. I remember that one day I was just sitting by myself and thinking, ‘What is it that scares you about entering the house?’ I asked myself, ‘Is there something that you are ashamed of ? Is there a side to you that you don’t want the world to see?’ And my answers were ‘No’ to all these thoughts in my head. That’s when I told myself if you are so comfortable with yourself, then what’s the problem, just go out there, have a good time and come back. So, there I was.” Right after the win, Sidharth told us, “I had this kind of audience before, but it was for the roles that I would play. Now it’s for Sidharth Shukla. It feels so much better.” #GoneTooSoon: Television and film industries mourn Sidharth Shukla’s demiseHis equation and banter with Bigg Boss co-contestant Shehnaaz Gill became a talking point, with fans lovingly coining the name ‘Sidnaaz’ for them. While there were rumours about them being in a relationship, they never spoke about it. Post the show, the two did a few music videos together. And recently, they were seen in Bigg Boss OTT and Dance Deewane. During one of the shows, he had said, “My Bigg Boss journey wouldn’t have been the way it was without Shehnaaz.” Unlike many reality show contestants, whose fame dissolves over a period of time, Sidharth’s popularity only amplified. Sidharth topped the list of The Times 20 Most Desirable Men on Television 2019 and 2020, consecutively. The makers of Bigg Boss got him on the show as a special guest in season 14 as well. Moving on from reality shows, the actor turned his attention to the digital world and debuted with Broken But Beautiful Season 3 this year. Like his TV ventures, his character, Agastya Rao, was loved and appreciated by the audience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/television-star-sidharth-shukla-dies-at-just-40/articleshow/85882573.cms||---

Meanwhile, the remnants of the system walloped parts of the Northeast, dumping record-breaking rain in a region that had not expected a serious blow and killing at least 26 people from Maryland to New York. Eleven people in New York City drowned in basement apartments. New Orleans fared better than many other places because it was protected from catastrophic flooding by the levee system that was revamped after Hurricane Katrina. The power was back on before dawn in parts of the city’s business district and other downtown neighborhoods. Utility crews also restored electricity to several hospitals in Jefferson Parish and near Baton Rouge, officials said. Some streets were cleared of fallen trees and debris, and a few corner stores reopened. The city’s main airport reopened to commercial flights for the first time since the hurricane. Delta was first airline to return, to be followed Friday by United Airlines and later by other carriers, officials said. The overwhelming majority of homes were still dark. In seven parishes, at least 95% of customers remained without power Thursday. Only 35,000 of the 405,000 homes and businesses in New Orleans and Jefferson Parish had power Thursday morning, according to the poweroutage.us website. Statewide, 917,000 customers were without electricity, down from about 1.1 million at the height of the seventh named storm to hit Louisiana since the summer of 2020. “This isn’t our first rodeo, but it’s our worst rodeo,” said Kirt LeBouef as he wiped away tears while looking at the damage to the Little Eagle restaurant in Golden Meadow, a 75-mile (120 kilometer) drive down the narrow highway from New Orleans toward the Gulf. LeBouef’s family has owned the crawfish restaurant since 1920. Power should be restored to most customers around Baton Rouge area by Sept. 8. after workers finish assessing damage, Entergy Louisiana President Philip May said Thursday. Damage assessments are not as far along in the harder-hit regions, so Entergy said it has no timetable for getting service to those areas, which include New Orleans. In addition to the power outages, the storm tore apart water systems At least 600,000 customers had no running water. Hundreds of thousands of other homes and business were being told to boil their water before using it. Gasoline shortages were also a problem for people trying to run generators and waiting in drive-thru lines for food and water. The lines for gas stretched for blocks in many places from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. President Joe Biden also ordered the release of extra fuel from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure a steady supply. He said he would also provide utilities with satellite images to help restore power. “We know that there is much to be done in this response on our part,” said Biden, who was getting hourly updates on the recovery. “We need to get power restored. We need to get more food, fuel and water deployed.” Ida knocked out Port Fourchon, the primary hub to support drilling at offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil on its way to refineries. Port leaders said the damage to structures where the powerful eye came ashore was not as bad as feared. “The majority of them are still good, and we can get things back up and running,” said Chett Chiasson, executive director for the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, who did not give an exact estimate on reopening the facilities. The president was scheduled to visit Louisiana on Friday to survey the damage from Ida, which hit Sunday with 150 mph (230 kph) winds and was tied for the fifth-strongest hurricane ever to strike the mainland U.S. At least 10 deaths were blamed on the storm in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, including two 19-year-old Pike Electric employees electrocuted Tuesday as they were restoring power near Birmingham, Alabama. Officials on Thursday classified the deaths of three Louisiana nursing home residents as storm-related. Investigators from the Louisiana Department of Health were kicked off the property Tuesday, the agency said. Outside New Orleans, neighborhoods remained flooded and residents were still reeling. More than 1,200 people walked through some of Ida’s hardest-hit communities to look for people needing help, according to the Louisiana Fire Marshal’s office. Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said 25% of the homes in his parish of 100,00 people were gone or had catastrophic damage, and up to 40% more had severe damage from winds that blew at over 100 mph (160 kph) for 12 hours. “This storm is more than just a New Orleans event. Lafourche took the brunt of this storm,” Chaisson said at a briefing. Evacuees considering returning home to Terrebonne Parish were warned by emergency officials on Twitter that “there are no shelters, no electricity, very limited resources for food, gasoline and supplies and absolutely no medical services.” Louisiana’s largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, was considering opening a field hospital somewhere in Terrebonne or Lafourche parish because the shuttering of most of the hospitals in the area removed about 250 to 300 beds. A spokesperson for Louisiana Gov, John Bel Edwards said the governor’s office was in discussions with local leaders “to make sure we can restore health care to the parish, and that does include discussions of a field hospital.” But the plans were not final.. Hard-hit areas in southeast Louisiana were also under a heat advisory Thursday. Forecasters warned that combined heat and humidity could make some areas feel like 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/flights-resume-and-some-power-restored-4-days-after-ida/articleshow/85883101.cms||---

---||India||Only fully vaccinated should attend mass gatherings: Government||NEW DELHI: The government has urged people to avoid mass gatherings and added that if attending them is essential then full vaccination should be a prerequisite especially during the upcoming festive season. The Centre has also warned against lowering the guard amid reports of a continuous surge in Covid-19 cases in some districts. “Mass gatherings should be discouraged, particularly in the upcoming festival season… Full vaccination should be a prerequisite if it is absolutely essential or it becomes critical to have a gathering of some people,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said on Thursday. The government aims to cover majority of the adult population with at least one dose of Covid vaccine before October when chances of spreading infection are to be higher amid festivities. Average daily vaccinations increased to more than 80 lakh doses in the last week of August with the help of improved supply of jabs, while over one crore doses were administered twice during the week. The monthly average of daily doses also jumped to 59.29 lakh in August, up 36.5% from a daily average of 43.41 lakh in July and over 200% from average 19.69 lakh doses per day given in May. With vaccination getting a major push in the last week of August, many smaller states and Union Territories have achieved or are nearing 100% coverage of adult population with the first dose. While Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Dadar & Nagar Haveli have already covered 100% of 18 plus population with the first dose, others like Tripura, Ladakh, Daman & Diu, Lakshdweep and Mizoram have got over 85% coverage, officials said. Keeping in mind the upcoming festival season, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “We have not seen the conclusion of the second surge in the country and therefore, we have to be on guard. We have to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Though the trajectory of new cases is declining in most states, some districts are still reporting a rising trend. Around 42 districts – concentrated mostly in Kerala and Maharashtra, along with some in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh – are still reporting more than 100 new cases daily. Kerala – with more than 2.30 lakh active cases – alone accounted for 69% of the total fresh cases recorded last week. Though the spread is limited to particular geographies, the Centre is concerned that rapid transmission of virus can result in new mutation that can lead to a wider spread across other states. “The risk of mutants will remain in future. The tools to prevent it like wearing of mask, avoiding large gatherings, testing and vaccination are in our hands,” NITI Aayog member health Dr V K Paul said. “We have to be careful, particularly in the context of the festival season and the change in weather… Even as we accelerate our vaccination programme, our precautions against the virus must continue,” he added. The government also urged people to embrace vaccination as it can protect against severe infection and death, and also continue to wear masks even after vaccination. In August, a total of 18.38 crores of doses were given, up from 13.45 crore in July. “That’s a huge achievement and would not have been possible without very effective and optimal participation of all healthcare workers, state governments and Union Territory administrations,” the health secretary said. Overall, 66.95 crore doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in the country till Thursday 8pm. Even though the country’s overall weekly positivity rate is showing a decline, 39 districts – mostly in Kerala and in some north eastern states -- reported over 10% weekly Covid positivity rate in the week ending August 31 while in 38 districts it was between 5 and 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/only-fully-vaccinated-should-attend-mass-gatherings-government/articleshow/85882971.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Cow only animal that inhales, exhales O2: Judge||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court judge who asked for the cow to be declared India’s “national animal” while denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter has said in the same 12-page order that “scientists believe cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen”. Written in Hindi, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav’s order claims it is a tradition in India to use ghee made of cow milk in each oblation during a yajna because “this gives special energy to sunrays, which ultimately causes rain”. Justice Yadav’s observations about the cow’s supposedly unique respiratory process and other extraordinary qualities mirrors former Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s 2019 statement that unlike any other mammal, the cow exhales oxygen rather than carbon dioxide. “Panchgavya which is made of cow milk, curd, ghee, urine and cow dung helps in treatment of several incurable diseases,” states the order denying bail to the cow slaughter accused from UP’s Sambhal. Quoting Arya Samaj founder Dayanand Saraswati, Justice Yadav says a cow, in her lifetime contributes milk to over 400 humans but her meat can feed just 80 people. “Jesus Christ said that killing a cow or an ox is like killing a human.” Since a cow’s existence is integral to Indian culture, consuming beef cannot be considered a fundamental right of any citizen, the order says to build the argument that Parliament should bring a law to declare it the national animal and deter people who talk about harming it. “The right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat cow-beef can ever be considered a fundamental right. Right to life can’t be snatched away merely for another’s pleasure of taste, and that the right to life is above the right to kill. The right to consume cow-beef can never be a Fundamental Right,” the order states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cow-only-animal-that-inhales-exhales-o2-judge/articleshow/85883348.cms||---
---||India||Not must to send accused to custody after chargesheet: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: A fortnight after ruling that each and every accused need not be arrested in a routine manner at the time of filing of chargesheet, the Supreme Court on Thursday passed another important verdict and held that it was not mandatory that an accused be sent to custody by the trial court after filing of chargesheet, particularly when the accused was out on bail and had cooperated in the probe. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said custody of an accused may not be necessary in all cases after filing of chargesheet and the trial court should not send accused to judicial custody in all cases in a routine manner that would unnecessarily curtail liberty of a person . It said that chargesheet being filed and cognisance being taken cannot be a ground to arrest an accused who has not been arrested throughout the probe by the investigating agency. The court passed the order on a plea of Amanpreet Singh who is an accused in a chit fund scam and was issued non-bailable warrants for not personally appearing before a trial court in Odisha. Senior advocate Maninder Singh along with lawyer Prabhas Bajaj, appearing for Amanpreet, contended that the accused had cooperated with the CBI throughout the probe and the agency also never sought his arrest and the trial court and the HC had wrongly rejected his regular bail plea. Referring to a Delhi high court verdict passed in 2004, the former additional solicitor general told the bench that in case court or magistrate exercises the discretion of issuing warrant of arrest at any stage, including the stage while taking cognisance of the chargesheet, he or it shall have to record the reasons in writing that the accused has either been absconding or shall not obey the summons or has refused to appear despite proof of due service of summons upon him. He said that the general principles of law laid down by the Delhi high court deserve to receive the imprimatur of the Supreme Court. Agreeing with his submission, the bench said some principle needed to be laid down to ensure that liberty of a person is not curtailed and passed a detailed order and also granted relief to Amanpreet. A bench led by Justice Kaul had in August held that arrests should not be done in a routine manner when accused is cooperating in probe and there is no reason to believe he/she will abscond or influence the investigation. While interpreting Section 170 of CrPC under which trial courts insist on arrest of accused, the SC said it does not impose an obligation on the Officer-in-charge to arrest each and every accused at the time of filing of the chargesheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-must-to-send-accused-to-custody-after-chargesheet-supreme-court/articleshow/85883473.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||From next year, NIOS to be first to offer online Boards||NEW DELHI: The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) is set to become India’s first education board to offer Board exam online from 2022. Following disruption of personal contact classes due to the pandemic and to mitigate any future academic losses for its 40 lakh learners, it has also launched the first of its kind virtual school — catering right from learning, practical simulation in virtual labs, accessing resource materials via its digital library to online examinations. NIOS is the only education board in the country that delivers secondary and senior secondary education in 14 languages. Due to the Covid situation, NIOS too could not conduct its Board exams as well as on-demand exams in 2020 and 2021. Annually it conducts Board exams for around five lakh candidates. However, keeping in mind the digital divide, NIOS will opt for the hybrid mode keeping both online and offline options open for the time being. Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh, director (academics), said, “We are keeping the option of offline exams open due to the digital divide, as one of the main objectives of NIOS is to reach the unreached. Out of the six lakh villages in the country, 25,000 villages have no internet connectivity so far. Also the latest data showed that only 11% of the children have access to online classes. But we will gradually progress towards only online mode for the Board exams.” From 2022, the assessment system will also go online. “Along with physical classes, even the exams could not be conducted and there is no clarity as to when the situation will normalise. Also, to maximise use of technology, it was decided to assess students through remote proctoring online exams,” added Singh.Speaking about the new online schooling system — NIOS Virtual Open School — Singh said, “Handholding of the learners used to be done through personal contact programmes in study centres. Due to the pandemic, the personal contact programmes could not happen. Now, on the dynamic virtual schooling platform, students can not only access the learning content, but can ask questions to the mentor who will be in a position to clarify the doubts.” Self-learning materials will also be made available in audio and video mode. The virtual school will also allow students to perform practicals through simulation in the virtual labs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/from-next-year-nios-to-be-first-to-offer-online-boards/articleshow/85883501.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

The impact of the storm was still being felt in the northeastern United States as Amtrak and other rail services were canceled. United, the largest carrier at the New York area airport, had canceled more than 200 flights nationwide, according to Flightaware, an aviation website. Rival American Airlines has also experienced delays and cancellations at the Newark airport, while Delta Air Lines said it has seen roughly 80 cancellations across New York City area airports. Flooding killed at least 21 people, swept away cars and submerged New York City subway lines after torrential rains. Flooding halted traffic on some major roads and highways in Northeastern states. The New York State Police said traffic was diverted because of flooding on some highways and exit ramps. Some major Philadelphia-area roads also flooded. Amtrak said all passenger train service between Washington and Boston was canceled for the remainder of Thursday. The railroad said Empire Service was canceled between Albany, New York, and New York City. Nearly all New Jersey Transit rail service remains suspended except for the Atlantic City line. New Jersey Transit bus service is continuing but riders were told to "expect significant statewide delays, cancellations and extensive detours due to severe flooding and multiple vehicles blocking roadways." In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees subway, bus and commuter rail, said "service across our system is extremely limited as we work to recover from last night's heavy rainfall and flooding."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/united-airlines-resumes-flights-at-newark-new-jersey-airport-after-flooding/articleshow/85883541.cms||---

In India, while Delta continues to be the dominant variant, cases infected with Delta plus variant have increased to 300, officials said. However, the vaccines have been found to be effective against the variant, ICMR DG Balram Bhargava said. In a letter to all states and Union Territories (UTs), the government said considering reports of new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and rising number of Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (Vols) globally, seven countries have been added in the list of countries whose travellers will have to get another RT-PCR test done upon landing at Indian airports apart from the one they need to get before embarking on the flight. Times ViewScientists are still finding out whether the new variant from South Africa can pierce the vaccine shield or not. If it does so, it could hurt the anti-Covid fight globally. This is a good pre-emptive move by the Indian government. Safety first is always a good motto in such situationsThese seven countries are South Africa, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe. In earlier guidelines issued in February, passengers from only the United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East had to get the RT-PCR test done again upon landing at Indian airports. Coronavirus live updatesThe Centre has also asked states and UTs to ensure strict compliance to these guidelines so that the import of Vols and VoCs to India from other countries may be prevented.

"The impact of mutants, whether it is about severity of disease or about transmissibility, is something that we understand systematically and INSACOG has huge capacity and it has been strengthened over time. The screening of international travellers from a genetic sequencing point of view is one of the most critical protocols and pillars," NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-amid-reports-of-new-mutants-curbs-put-on-foreign-arrivals/articleshow/85883577.cms||---

The girl who lived on a footpath until literally yesterday, passed her Class X (SSC) exam by studying under a lamppost near Azad Maidan in Mumbai and then went on to join a top-notch city college has just realised her dream of having a roof over her head. Asma moved into a 1BHK flat on Thursday and will stay here for at least three years. TOI had reported about the girl’s plight and how she had braved the odds to clear the school public exam despite the odds. Only recently, TOI had published a photo of the girl studying on the footpath, ducking under a plastic sheet as it rained. From the footpath to a home, Asma Sheikh moves to 1BHK in MumbaiA few months ago, a bunch of people from abroad decided to help Asma. Moved by the circumstances of the bright girl, these do-gooders from countries in the West collaborated with one another and chipped in Rs 1.2 lakh to help Asma live in basic comfort for at least three years until she completes her graduation and takes up a job to support herself and her family. The money will be used to pay the rent, electricity bills and for the family’s basic needs. The girl is currently a student of Class 12 (arts) at K C College, Churchgate. “My dream is complete (sic),” a smiling Asma trilled as she entered the flat on Mohammed Ali Road. “I am so happy...” is all she managed to say. Asma, who lived on the footpath where her father sold lemon juice, stepped into the house with her parents and younger brother. Once in, she plonked on a cushioned seat in the furnished home, looked around, taking in the sights of her new world. Her brother romped about excitedly, sank onto a mattress even as their mother looked on incredulously at a house with a roof, walls and doors. Asma shot into the limelight after she passed the SSC exam last March. One of the key persons who facilitated her entry into the new house is a Spaniard, German Fernandez, who came across her story on social media. “I was touched on reading about this girl,” Fernandez said. “Education can help transform the quality of a person’s life.” Evidently, the teenager’s love for studies has helped rewrite her family’s fate.

The results won’t have any immediate impact on state politics, but they could be an important indicator of people’s mood ahead of the zilla and taluk panchayat polls, which are expected to be held by the year-end. They may also provide some early hints of the strategies parties are working on for the 2023 assembly polls. In the run-up to the civic polls, BJP and Congress invested considerable resources to woo voters, sending senior functionaries to the three municipalities to plan and oversee campaigns. There is a direct fight between the two parties in Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburagi. In Belagavi, however, Maharashtra Ekikarana Samithi and Aam Aadmi Party are also in the fray. The BJP campaign focused on highlighting the works taken up under the Smart City project and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance. Opposition parties tried to grab voters’ attention by raising issues such as high prices of fuel and commodities, alleged deficiencies in Smart City works and slow progress. BJP is under some pressure to win all three corporations. Hubballi-Dharwad is particularly crucial because it has been the party’s stronghold for more than two decades and it is the hometown of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, Union minister Pralhad Joshi and senior BJP member Jagadish Shettar. This is Bommai’s first electoral test after taking office. Victory will further boost chances of him being the party face in the 2023 assembly polls. Momentum for ZP, TP pollsA Congress win will raise the confidence of its senior members and party cadre, providing momentum for the panchayat elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/polls-for-3-nk-civic-bodies-to-be-held-today/articleshow/85884379.cms||---

EOU’s additional director general N H Khan said a DA case was lodged against Ahmad with the EOU police station in Patna on Wednesday and search orders were obtained from the court concerned. Ahmad was charged with accumulating property disproportionate to his known sources of income through his links with some illegal sand mafias during his stint as sub-divisional police officer of Paliganj in Patna. The searches started early morning at one of Ahmad’s flats in an apartment on Ashiana-Rajeev Nagar-Digha road in the state capital and his ancestral house at Pirade village under Inarva police station area in West Champaran district. Each raiding team was led by a DSP-rank officer. The EOU sleuths seized documents pertaining to huge investments in share market and real estate made by Ahmad. The officials associated with the investigation said Ahmad used to invest money with the help of a close relative, who is on the radar of the EOU. “Evidence of money laundering has also been found. Documents related to purchase of agricultural land at his native village in West Champaran district have also been recovered from his ancestral house,” an investigating officer told this newspaper after the searchers were over late in the evening. The bank accounts of the police officer in question have been frozen and lockers will be operated later on. “The search operation is over and the scrutiny of the seized documents will be done by the investigators,” the officer said. Sources said Ahmad’s investment in share market was worth several crores. Ahmad has been booked under Section 13(2) and Section 13(1) (b) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and amended Act 2018. Ahmad was among the four DSPs who were removed from field assignments in July after investigation carried out by the EOU on the directive of the police headquarters and the home department found the allegations of their links with illegal sand mining mafia to be true. The probe teams, in their reports, claimed the police and administrative officers posted in four districts – Patna, Bhojpur, Aurangabad and Saran – were hands-in-glove with the sand mafias and amassed wealth disproportionate to their known sources of income. On August 28, four DSPs – Tanveer Ahamd (Paliganj), Sanjay Kumar (Dehri-on-Sone), Anup Kumar (Daudnagar) and Pankaj Kumar Rawat (Bhojpur) – were issued show-cause notices by the home department and asked to submit their replies within 15 days. Action was initiated against altogether 42 officers, including two former SPs – Rakesh Kumar Dubey (Bhojpur) and S K Porika (Aurangabad) – in connection with illegal sand trade thriving under their jurisdictions. The EOU later initiated the process of collecting information about their assets. Ahmad is the second senior officer against whom a DA case has been lodged. Earlier, a similar case was lodged against Sunil Kumar Singh, the then SDO of Dehri-on-Sone in Rohtas district and searches were conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-premises-of-tainted-cop-in-patna-west-champaran/articleshow/85876774.cms||Ramashankar

The first-of-its-kind park will have a restaurant, a swimming pool, and walking tracks for the visitors. Environment, forest and climate change (EFCC) minister, Neeraj Kumar Singh, told this reporter on Thursday, “With a view to checking the monkey menace in several urban areas, we have decided to provide a natural habitat to them. We will trap the monkeys and shift them from different localities to the new park.” He added, “The monkey park will attract tourists from different parts of India and Nepal.” The EFCC department has decided to consult environmentalists, wildlife experts, and veterinary doctors for setting up the monkey park. “Wildlife lovers and researchers will be able to observe and study the behaviour patterns of the monkeys easily,” Neeraj said, adding that an artificial pond would be created and shelters constructed in the first phase. According to sources, the monkey park will come up on a 10-acre land on the premises of Renu Van which will be developed in memory of Phanishwar.

Health department officials suggested to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy that Vinayaka Chaviti celebrations should be restricted to avoid crowding in the name of celebrations, procession and immersion. The decisions were taken at Thursday’s review meeting on Covid-19 at the CM’s Tadepalli camp office. Jagan, after returning from a two-day tour of his home district Kadapa in the afternoon, took stock of the situation with health department officials, who felt that erecting pandals for the Ganesh festival should be avoided to prevent crowding in public places. They also suggested that processions and idol immersions should also be restricted in view of the perceived third wave. The chief minister cautioned officials to take appropriate steps without hurting the sentiments of devotees. He also advised them to explore other possibilities of having a healthy and safe Ganesh festival, which include putting restrictions on the size of idols, pandals and immersion processions. He also asked officials to continue the prevailing night curfew in the state for a few more weeks as part of the preventive measures to check the spread of Covid-19, and keep regular watch on public places to avoid mass gathering. He told them to restrict crowds at weddings and other celebrations or events, besides insisting on wearing of face mask and sanitisation. The chief minister further instructed officials to fill up all vacancies in government hospitals and strictly implement biometric attendance for the staff. He wanted them to make sure that all medical services are made available to people at every hospital in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-mulls-restrictions-on-mass-gathering-during-ganesh-festival/articleshow/85876708.cms||Gopi Dara

He also described Bihar CM Nitish Kumar as a puppet of the BJP who has “compromised with the ideologies of Rammanohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan”. Talking to mediapersons at the Sadaquat Ashram here, Digvijaya hit out at the central government over various issues, including unemployment, price rise, farm laws, Pegasus and launch of National Monetisation Pipeline scheme. Raising the issue of National Monetisation Pipeline, he said, “An able son keeps what he has inherited by his ancestors intact. However a ‘nalayak’ or prodigal son sells what he inherits and even takes loan to eat butter. PM Narendra Modi used to say that Congress has done nothing in 70 years. I want to ask what are they selling now? They even want to sell off Bharat Petroleum which earns an annual profit of Rs 8,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore.” He added various initiatives of the previous Congress governments, such as Right to Education, Right to Food and Right to Information, helped the common people. Digvijaya also slammed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and accused it of trying to dilute the Constitution. “Politics is done on the basis of ideology. While Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan believed in socialist ideology, RSS believes in ideology of communalism. Since 1925, it has been concentrating on its agenda of working against the poor, suppressed, farmers and workers,” he added. Digvijaya also raised the issue of removal of chapters on Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia from the postgraduate syllabus of political science in JP University. “By parting with the ideologies of JP and Lohia, Nitish has surrendered before the RSS and BJP,” he said. Reacting to Digvijaya’s allegations, BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel said the country’s economy was on the recovery path and several schemes launched by the Centre have helped the people in rural areas. “The income of farmers will double by next year. Monetary benefits are now being directly transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. The entire world is listening to us and credit for this goes to the PM,” he added. Patel said the RSS always works for the suppressed section of the society. “The basic principle of the RSS is ‘antyodaya’. It works for the benefit of the person at the lowest strata.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/digvijaya-accuses-centre-of-selling-countrys-assets/articleshow/85876039.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Allahabad||Unable to find clothes that fit? AU scholar has a solution||Prayagraj: Buying your favourite outfit can be a Herculean task at times. The fraught process of finding a comfortable fit isn’t easier as ready-made outfits being manufactured in India follow the European and American size. Now, a doctoral research scholar of the department of family and community sciences of the Allahabad University has come with a solution. After a detailed study of anthropometric measurements of 3,000 women, Hina Kausher has developed an Indian sizing system, which promises to be a boon for the ready-made industry. “As part of an initiative undertaken under my former department head and present vice-chancellor of AU Prof Sangita Srivastava, sizes have been designated as a petite, medium, large and extra-large. Moreover, by knowing only the height and weight, rest dimensions can be found out through the new system, which will soon be patented,” informed Kausher about the work that has recently earned her the DPhil. “An effort has been made to translate all the information into an algorithm so that if two measurements are known, ie height and weight, other body sizes can be calculated. It will also prove advantageous in making make mass-produced garments along with preventing fabric wastage,” said Kausher whose study has been published in Indian Journal of Home Science in June 2021. The Indian ready-made garment business is the largest segment of the Indian textile and apparel industry accounting for approximately 50% of the total industry. “Manufacturers and retailers also have to suffer loss in terms of fabric wastage. This sizing system will work as a commercial tool among manufacturers, retailers, and customers,” the AU VC said. This system helps to provide size specifications to manufacturers, design development, pattern grading, and market analysis. Moreover, production numbers and the proportion of sizes to be produced can be found out by a sizing system. Consequently, accurate production planning and material control can be achieved, she added. When the industry uses these sizing, the clothing will be as per Indian women measurements and will not require alterations, Prof Srivastava said. The difference between the height of European, American, and Indian women is significant. The waist-to-hip ratio in order to project the most beautiful should be 0.81 (the size of waist to be divided by hip in inches). The physical constitution of Indian women is different in terms of bust, waist, hip, and height measurements compared to their American and European counterparts, the researcher explains. The mannequin which wears the readymade apparel in the display windows is also misleading women as its height and waist do not match the height and waist size of Indian women. Also, because of body type being in contrast, the dress worn by the mannequin will never project the same look to the wearer as it does on the mannequins, Kausher added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/unable-to-find-clothes-that-fit-au-scholar-has-a-solution/articleshow/85875367.cms||---

Fierce battle is being witnessed in WhatsApp groups where both UAG and UF members and supporters are posting videos of their parties and each group is claiming they have support of more members than the other. However, ever since September 1, UAG supporters are also circulating a video in which it is being claimed that UF’s president post candidate D S Chawla had hurt religious sentiments. Along with the video, a message too is being circulated which mentioned, “Listen to the own deeds of Daljit Singh Chawla, who defamed a famous personality like Gurmeet Singh Kular. Chawla wants to mislead members in the name of turban, some time ago in the office of UCPMA, Chawla disrespected the turban. What are the circumstances under which you (Chawla) stepped off the stage at UCPMA’s annual general meeting (AGM), when you were given full time to speak on stage.” Some UAG members and supporters are also raking up the issue that Chawla is faking his back injury sustained due to the attack on him during AGM in their support of their claims they are circulating a video in which Chawla is being seen riding a bicycle out of UCPMA’s office. Chawla, meanwhile, is also circulating several videos against UAG in which he is claiming that the video of him driving the bicycle is old and was taken at the time of him taking charge of the association. Chawla also claimed that during AGM of UCPMA an attempt was made to kill him and his turban was tossed only because he raised voice against the wrongdoings that took place in the UCPMA before he took over as president in 2019. In the video, Chawla has also claimed that when he took over UCPMA office was in a shambles and moreover his predecessors had left huge liabilities on him but he slowly and steadily overcame all the problems and made the association debt free, but his rivals were not able to digest his success. Tight police security in place for tomorrow election The voting for election of eight officer bearers of UCPMA will take place on Friday from 9am till 5pm and a total of 1,664 members are eligible to vote. Meanwhile, Ludhiana police has issued a letter to the presiding officer of elections to ensure that CCTVs are working at main gate, voting room and other locations of the association.

The figure amounts to nearly 84% of the eligible population (18+ years) for the vaccination. According to the AMC data, the city has 68 lakh residents, out of which 42 lakh are eligible for Covid vaccine. Moreover, out of the total, 13.14 lakh, or about 31.5%, have got both the doses. The data reveals that wards in western city parts such as Jodhpur, Paldi, Navrangpura, Stadium and Bodakdev have more than 50% eligible residents getting fully vaccinated – the share much higher than their eastern city counterparts. In comparison to the overall state, the figure for both first and second doses is higher for Ahmedabad – in Gujarat, 71.8% (3.54 crore out of 4.93 crore eligible population) have got the first jab, and 24.5% (1.21 crore) have got both. “Around 84% of the people of the city have received their first dose,” said Dr Bhavin Solanki, AMC medical officer. “Nine urban health centres have achieved more than their target, as people from other areas also went there to get vaccinated. For example, at Tagore Hall, we would not only get people from Paldi but also from Vasna, Navrangpura etc. Thus, the numbers for Paldi will be higher.” Interestingly, the three lowest coverage areas are also from western city parts. Chandkheda has the lowest coverage of the first dose at 29.8%, followed by 30.9% in Vasna, and 47.2% in Maktampura. The rest seven fall in eastern city parts – Behrampura (33%), Jamalpur (33.6%), Gomtipur (39.8%), Vastral (40.9%), Amraiwadi (56.4%) and Indrapuri (60.2%). Ahmedabad city, along with Surat, is generally on top of the daily vaccination figures for the state with an average 45,000 to 55,000 daily vaccinations. The state health department has given a push to the vaccination – especially covering the 18-44 years age group for the first dose – since mid-August with daily 5 lakh-plus vaccinations for the state. A senior AMC officer said the requirement for an 84-day gap between doses is the reason for the lower numbers for the second dose, and many people who have finished the 84-day period are not coming forward to get their second dose. "Several companies got their employees vaccinated in areas such as Thaltej, Bodakdev, Navrangpura, etc. irrespective of their domicile," said a senior official. "We have also found the inverse correlation between vaccination and socio-economic profile/ awareness."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/84-of-eligible-popn-in-abad-got-first-dose-of-covid-vaccine/articleshow/85880005.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Special judge for speedy trial for cases under POCSO Act, GS Ramesh Kumar, pronounced the conviction and sentencing against the accused Pujari Gopi. The incident happened on March 23, 2016, when Gopi (20) lured a class V student under the guise of catching fish from a nearby pond. The accused then took her to the pond at around 9 am and after trying to catch a few fish, he took her to an isolated place and allegedly raped the girl. The girl informed her mother about the incident, who lodged a complaint with Venkatagiri police who registered a case under sections 366A and 376 of IPC and under sections 3 and 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The case was pending before the sessions court for three years before it was transferred to the newly set up POCSO court for a speedy trial.

The last time the rupee was at 72 levels was in June. The currency was the strongest against the dollar on February 24 this year when it closed at 72.33. Similar to the equities market, the gain in the rupee has been sharp and sudden with an appreciation of 1.5% in five trading sessions. Dealers said that the domestic currency was buoyed by positive sentiment in the equities market. Sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors are expected to result in an assured supply of dollars, although the current account has come under pressure with rising imports. Dealers said that some chunky inflows are expected from international bond issues by banks and corporates (see graphic). Axis Bank on Thursday said that it has raised $600 million (Rs 4,380 crore) through the sale of sustainable additional tier-1 (AT1) bonds. The dollar-denominated, Basel III-compliant AT1 notes were finally priced at 4.1%, 30 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) lower than the initial price guidance. This marks it as a highly successful return for Axis Bank to the international bond markets after a 4-year hiatus. This is the second ESG AT1 bond (referring to environment, social and governance impact) from Asia. Up to 47% of the bonds were allocated to sustainability-focused investors. Adani Green Energy also raised $750 million by issuing three-year bonds at 4.4%. Both Axis Bank and Adani received multi-billion-dollar bids for the bond offering. According to Emkay Global Financial Services lead economist Madhavi Arora, while the bond issues, foreign portfolio investment inflows and general weakness in the dollar after the US Fed meeting have been positive for the rupee, a surprise factor has been the RBI’s hands-off strategy. She added that this strategy could be because the central bank does not want to add to liquidity in the money markets by purchasing dollars. Also, selling dollars at higher levels could be a treasury strategy for the RBI to make some profits. Finally, a stronger rupee takes the edge off imported inflation. Besides the sizeable forex reserves, what puts the RBI in a comfortable position is the fact that India’s macro-economic fundamentals have improved with better growth prospects and the twin deficits being much better than expected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rupee-regains-72-level-on-bond-issues-inflows/articleshow/85882711.cms||---

Actis’s 26% stake in Tril IT4 was bought by Tata Sons’s wholly owned arm Tata Realty and Infrastructure. Tata Realty and Actis didn’t reveal the size of the “cash deal”, but said the exit offered “excellent” returns to the London-based private equity fund. Before the transaction, Tata Realty held 74% in Tril IT4 (formerly Albrecht Builder), which was established in December 2014. In fiscal 2021, Tata Realty’s share of profit in Tril IT4 was Rs 17 crore. Tata Realty and Actis, however, continue to be partners in two other commercial properties in India — Intellion Park in Gurugram, and Intellion Park in Navi Mumbai. Actis owns 26% in each of the office buildings, with Tata Realty owning the balance. Last fiscal, Tata Realty received a capital infusion of Rs 1,200 crore from Tata Sons. The realty and infrastructure company, spearheaded by Sanjay Dutt, posted a loss of Rs 96 crore on a turnover of Rs 125 crore in 2020-21.

Sebi is pushing the housing finance firm to relook at a deal to sell a Rs 4,000-crore stake to private equity investors led by Carlyle on the grounds that valuation norms have not been followed. “It has been brought to our notice that Sebi has filed an appeal (no. CA5052 of 2021) to the Supreme Court of India against the order of SAT. The company is examining the appeal filed by Sebi,” PNB Housing Finance said in a notice to the stock exchanges. On August 9, SAT delivered a split verdict over PNB Housing’s share allocation to Carlyle Group. This followed an interim order where SAT had restricted PNB Housing from disclosing the results of shareholder votes on the deal. Sebi had asked the housing finance companies to call off the voting. However, following an appeal by the company, SAT allowed the general body to vote on the proposal.As a result of the split decision, the interim order asking the company not to reveal the outcome of the voting continues to be in force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pnb-hsg-deal-sebi-moves-sc/articleshow/85882758.cms||---

The cash was given to the police station for safekeeping by a local wine shop. Though the alleged theft happened on Sunday, it came to light on Thursday when cops found that the money was missing. “Cash collection during weekends is usually kept at the police station for safekeeping since banks are closed on Sundays. The money is later deposited in the account of Andhra Pradesh State Beverage Corporation,” a police officer said. The prime suspect behind the theft is constable Janardhan Naidu, who works as the station writer. Cops said Janardhan suddenly stopped coming to work from Monday without giving a proper reason and later they found that the money was missing when the wine shop staff came to collect it. Upon reaching Janardhan’s house, cops found that he was absconding and his mobile phone was switched off. Police said Janardhan was depressed for some time due to some family dispute. They have not registered a case yet as they are yet to ascertain if he was the one who stole the cash. A manhunt has been launched to trace him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rs-16l-stolen-from-nuzvid-ps-constable-main-suspect/articleshow/85879462.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Autonomous colleges gear up for UG classes in 10 days||Kolkata: While it has just been three days since most colleges started their second phase of undergraduate admissions after publishing the first merit lists, autonomous colleges are already gearing up to start their online classes in the next 10 to 14 days. St Xavier’s College (Autonomous) Kolkata, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira and Ramakrishna Mission Residential College in Narendrapur and Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, are autonomous institutions which have to conduct admissions complying with the criteria set by the education department but can decide on some dates on their own. The classes will be held online as on-campus lessons have been suspended since March 2020 due to the pandemic. At St Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata, the inauguration of the first semester is scheduled on September 10 for humanities, science and commerce. “The online classes for the first semester will start soon after. We expect the classes to commence by September 12,” said Reverend Father Dominic Savio, principal of the college. At Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, first semester classes will start by the middle of September, said an official. Principal Swami Kamalasthananda said the admission process was in its last stages and the exact date will be finalised in a few days. “We are on the verge of wrapping up our admission process. Many students in flood-hit areas did not have access to the internet but they were meritorious. We arranged for them to reach the nearest Ramakrishna Mission facilities to fill up their forms, which caused some delay in completing the process,” said Swami Kamalasthananda. Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, too, is planning to start online classes by the end of the second week of September. “The induction session will start by the end of the second week of September. Online admissions to undergraduate courses are underway,” said Swami Mahaprajnananda, vice-principal of the college. Government and government-aided colleges will complete the admission process by September 30 and start first semester classes by October 1, according to the guidelines of the higher education department. Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, will, however, commence online classes for the first semester on October 1. “Classes for the first semester will begin on October 1. The method of teaching will be online,” said Swami Shastrajnanda, principal of the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autonomous-colleges-gear-up-for-ug-classes-in-10-days/articleshow/85879249.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The vehicle of the police station was also damaged in course of stone-pelting. The injured policemen were initially taken to Sonbarsa PHC from where they were sent to Sitamarhi. On getting information about orchestra and dance groups performing to celebrate the birth of a child at Bhaluaaha village, the Kanhauli police patrolling party reached the spot. The police team asked the villagers to stop the orchestra as no permission was sought from the police station and Covid-19 norms were also flouted. The spectators were infuriated on hearing this and resorted to stone and brick pelting. The dancers fled from the scene taking advantage of the darkness. Cops from Sonbarsa, Sahiyara and Bhutahi police station rushed there to rescue the Kanhauli police team. So far 15 spectators and villagers have been arrested in connection with the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/6-policemen-injured-in-sitamarhi-attack/articleshow/85876736.cms||---

Warning for heavy rainfall has been issued for several districts in north Bihar for Friday as well. Patna Meteorological Centre has, on the other hand, predicted rainfall at a few places on Friday and Saturday, especially in north-east Bihar, including Kishanganj, Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria, Purnia and Katihar on Sunday and Monday. Rainfall is very likely at many places in south-east Bihar as well, including Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Khagaria and Jamui on Sunday and Monday. The rainy spell in the region has been attributed to favourable position of monsoon trough line. As per a bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Thursday afternoon, the monsoon trough line was passing through Naliya, Udaipur, Guna, Gonda, Gopalpur and then eastwards to east-central Bay of Bengal on Thursday. “As a result, most places in north Bihar and south Bihar are likely to witness thunderstorm, lightning and light to moderate rainfall over the next 24 hours,” he said. He added that warning for heavy rainfall has been issued for districts in north Bihar like East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur, Sheohar, Madhubani Darbhanga, Supaul, Araria and Kishanganj. The official said light to moderate rainfall occurred at few places in north-east Bihar and at one or two places in rest of the state in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bihar has received 16% surplus rainfall in the monsoon season till date.  As per data available on the website of IMD, the state has received 944.6mm rainfall from June 1 to September 2 against the normal average of 815.5mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-heavy-rainfall-to-occur-in-state-on-september-5-6/articleshow/85876331.cms||---

The move is aimed at solving the psychological problems of the inmates which occur due to various reasons during their confinement in jail and help them lead a normal life. Banka jail superintendent Sujit Kumar Roy said that the need for counselling was felt after the authorities came across prisoners suffering from depression and anxiety, fear psychosis, low self-esteem, irritable behaviour, social stigma, fear of relationship issues with family members, sleep disorder besides other health issues. The counselling unit consists of jail doctors, psychological experts including psychiatrists besides jail officials. Every Saturday has been fixed for counselling sessions. “Mental and behavioural disorders among the prisoners are a major challenge and this sometimes culminates in suicide, murder or aggressive outbursts with other inmates or jail staff. The prisoners will be provided counselling by professional mental health experts. At present there are 23 prisoners who have severe mental disorders. The inventory of the inmates who are in need of psychological counselling is being prepared,” the superintendent said. In the last few years, prevalence of disorders have markedly increased in prisons due to several reasons such as overcrowding, isolation from social network, insecurity about future, delayed judicial proceeding and poor mental health services in prison. Psychiatrist Dr Gunjesh Kumar, along with his team of counsellors, have started screening the prisoners afflicted with psychological disorders.  “A counsellor works to change the mindset of people having a history of criminal behavior. By working on mindset, counsellors can train minds to find more positive responses to the challenges they face in life, helping them avoid falling back into crime. IT is definitely a service to humanity,” Dr Gunjesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/counselling-unit-set-up-for-banka-jail-inmates/articleshow/85876461.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Patna||Keep Covid at bay by wearing masks, cleaning hands: Doctors||PATNA: Several schools in the city may have resumed offline classes with full capacity, but health experts advise them to ensure that the students maintain distance, wear masks, keep their hands clean, and stay home if they feel sick. This, they say, will help keep the third wave of the pandemic at bay. Dr Nigam Prakash Narain, a paediatrician, urges everyone to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, which includes proper sanitization and social distancing, inside schools. “Covid cases among children climbed at an alarming rate after schools reopened in the USA recently. Hence, educational institutes in Bihar should instruct kids with symptoms like cold, fever or cough to stay home and get in touch with doctors immediately,” Dr Narain suggests. He adds, “Only a limited number of students should be allowed in a classroom.” Another paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, asks all school principals to think of ways to protect children from Covid-19 during offline classes. “Parents should ensure that their kids wear masks properly so that their mouths and noses are covered. They should also make sure that all adults in their families get themselves vaccinated and do not transfer the infection to children,” he says. The doctor also urges all the schools to get their faculty members and non-teaching staff fully inoculated. People, who are not vaccinated, should not be allowed to enter any school because they can spread the Covid-19 infection among children. Vaccinated people, on the other hand, have a very low chance of transmitting the virus. Dr Shah, however, claims that kids may not develop severe illnesses due to Covid-19. “Kids’ immune systems seem better equipped to eliminate the virus than are adults’. They may only develop mild symptoms,” he adds. An additional professor at the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, also advises children to follow two important safety protocols — sanitisation and social distancing — to stop the transmission of the virus. “We may not witness a massive surge in the number of fresh Covid cases during a possible third wave of the pandemic if everyone sticks to these guidelines,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/keep-cov-at-bay-by-wearing-masks-cleaning-hands-doctors/articleshow/85876978.cms||Faryal Rumi

The father said he made the complaint after noticing some discrepancies in the police investigations. “I admit that I did not suspect any foul play in my daughter’s death till the time I saw the photos (of the semi-nude body) and then read post-mortem report. Now I have realised that there was foul play. Therefore, I lodge a complaint at your police station that an unknown person/s have murdered my daughter by forcibly drowning her in shallow beach seawater, holding her in such a position to cover mouth and nostril till she dies of drowning in water,” the father said in his complaint to Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo. tnn In the complaint, the father has cited the post-mortem report which, he said, indicates that the body was lying on its back with the face up, whereas in the photos of the body the deceased girl is seen lying face down, which shows somebody changed the position of the body. “This means that the body was not floating in the water. This is because a dead body floats in the face down position,” he said. He also said that the post-mortem report states that the stomach is empty. “This means my daughter was not drowned in deep seawater. Otherwise she would have swallowed water in her stomach. On the other hand, sand has gone in vocal chords, which means she has drowned in seawater on the beach,” he said in his complaint. The father also cited the presence of some injuries on the body. “Since they are not deep bruises, they are not caused by hard objects, wherein they are possible if someone forcibly holds other people tight by their hands,” he said. Calangute police said they have received the complaint, but were yet to register any offence. According to the police, it is a case of drowning. Further investigations are on, they said. The police are yet to recover the missing clothes of the victim who was last seen alive at the Mapusa bus stand the day before her body was found washed up in a semi-nude condition on Calangute beach on August 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/teens-dad-suspects-foul-play-files-murder-plaint/articleshow/85881125.cms||---

The flyover, starting from Kargil Chowk to Patna Science College, is expected to ease vehicular movement on Ashok Rajpath. The road construction department has asked the officials of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL) to start preparations for the foundation-laying ceremony which would take place near Kargil Chowk. BRPNNL chairman Pankaj Kumar Pal said the foundation-laying ceremony would be held on Saturday, though the official confirmation has not come yet. “The four-lane flyover is targeted to be constructed with an expenditure of Rs 422 crore in three years by a Delhi-based firm, Gawar Construction Limited,” he added. “The flyover will ease traffic on Ashok Rajpath and facilitate smooth movement of ambulances and other vehicles. After the completion of this project, vehicles will move at three levels – tier 2, tier 1 and add-grade level (the existing road). The grade level will remain the same. All the four lanes of tier 1 and tier 2 will have three exits for the PMCH via their multi-level parking before terminating near Patna Science College,” Pal said. He added, “The double-decker flyover and the Ganga Expressway, another mega project, will be connected via Krishna Ghat. One ramp will be near Krishna Ghat and another near Patna Science College.” The length of tier 1 (from Patna Science College to Kargil Chowk) will be 1.45km and tier 2 (from Kargil Chowk to Patna Science College) 2.2km. The length of multi-level car parking loop, on the other hand, will be 145m. The width of the proposed flyover will be reduced a little near the Khuda Baksh Oriental Library to save the George Curzon reading hall from demolition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/double-decker-flyover-cm-likely-to-lay-stone-tomorrow/articleshow/85876825.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Allahabad||NCR records 23% growth in freight loading||Prayagraj: As the nation continued its fight against Covid-19, North Central Railways (NCR) has strived hard to keep up the momentum of its business. At the end of August, NCR registered 23.01% growth in its originating freight loading in the period from April to August as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. Monetizing the figures in revenue terms, a growth of 15.7% has been registered in the same period, informed NCR officials. NCR loaded a total of 7.24 million tonnes during the period April to August this year against a loading of 5.88 million tonnes during corresponding period of last year. Revenue earned out of this outward loading during this period comes out to be Rs. 723.74 crore, shared NCR CPRO Shivam Sharma. A particular benchmark has been set by NCR by registering best ever loading for the month of August. In August 2021, 1.45 million tonnes of freight was loaded, which is the best figure for the month of August. Previous best for the month of August was 1.28 million tonnes, which were loaded in August 2018-19. This is especially significant as August month usually shows a dip owing to monsoons. Total revenue earned by NCR in the month of August 2021 itself is around 144.74 crores, the CPRO said During a meeting of senior officers on Wednesday, chaired by NCR General Manager Pramod Kumar, these figures were shared by the Principal Chief Operations Manager (PCOM) Biplav Kumar. Biplav Kumar lauded the efforts of Business Development Units of NCR headquarter and the divisions for their proactive roles in attracting new traffic for NCR. “Among the major commodities which showed an upward trend were cement, foodgrains and petroleum oil lubricants. Container traffic too showed a 26% growth in loading as 1.08 million tonnes of cargo was loaded during April to August this year as compared to 0.86 million tonnes of container traffic last year,” he added. NCR GM Pramod Kumar congratulated the BDUs and all the officers and their team members. GM however expressed his concern over slight dip in loading in August as compared to the loading in last couple of months of current financial year itself and urged that “all necessary steps should be taken to step up the loading further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ncr-records-23-growth-in-freight-loading/articleshow/85875251.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Pratapgarh cops conduct mapping of houses and hideouts of criminals||Prayagraj: In a first of its kind exercise, the Pratapgarh police are conducting mapping of the homes and residences of criminals and law-breakers with the help of drones to find out about their hideouts and to block any chances of escape for the repeat offenders during a police raid. After preparing a fresh dossier of over 1,600 criminals whose names surfaced repeatedly in connection with loot, dacoity, murder, robbery, snatching and other petty offences in the past 10 years, the cops have decided to conduct mapping of their houses \ hideouts with an aim that no escape route gets left if cops conduct raid at their homes or hideouts in connection with a crime. Details of criminals and their close relatives have been compiled and houses of relatives, if living in the same village, are also being mapped with the help of drones. A team of senior police officials on Wednesday launched the mapping exercise of the houses of repeat offenders in the Mandhata circle of the district. Circle Officer (City) Abhai Kumar Pandey told TOI, “Cops have initially launched physical verification of criminals who were recently bailed out.” He added that the Thana cops concerned have been asked to put a check on the activities of criminals (who were bailed out recently), particularly those involved in loot, snatching and dacoity. Pandey, meanwhile, said that the Pratapgarh police have also conducted the mapping of the houses \ hideouts of criminals so that they could not escape from their hideouts if cops again raided their address in connection with a case. “Once we complete the mapping of criminal’s hideouts or homes in all seven circles of the district, cops would be deployed in and around houses of criminals during the raid so that they are not able to dodge police teams,” said Pandey. “We would be storing the mapping with the police station concerned,” he added. Mapping of the residents of criminals has been undertaken after going through reports that criminals have at least two to three temporary and permanent homes or their relatives’ residents which they used for their shelter in villages and blocks. Cops have also been strictly asked to conduct physical verification of criminals who were recently bailed out, at regular intervals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pratapgarh-cops-conduct-mapping-of-houses-and-hideouts-of-criminals/articleshow/85875091.cms||---
---||Allahabad||New bridge over Ganga to cut down distance between Lucknow-Chitrakoot||Prayagraj: Good news awaits commuters travelling between state capital Lucknow and Chitrakoot or towards Madhya Pradesh via Prayagraj. Following a new bridge coming up over river Ganga, joining Kareti ghat of Kunda Pratapgrah and Shahzadpur of Kaushambi district would reduce the travelling distance by around 50 km. After the commissioning of this new bridge, being constructed by UP state bridge corporation and based on the German technology of cable-stay bridge, the commuters would be saving around one hour of their travel time. Presently, those travelling towards Chitrakoot or MP from the state capital or from Raebareli and Pratapgrah have to cross river Ganga either at the old bridge near Kade Dham (which joins the GT road at Saini) or they have to come all the way up to Prayagraj and cross Phaphamau while moving towards MP and Chitrakoot from Naini. However, now after this new bridge, which is around 90% complete, the commuters would be able to save around 50km of distance and thereby reducing the travel time. For accessing the bridge, the commuters would have to follow the road towards Kareti ghat (from the by-pass near Kunda on Prayagraj-Lucknow highway), cross Ganga by the upcoming bridge and the road would bring them straight to Shahzadpur at Kaushambi. From there, the road towards Chitrakoot via Muratganj has to be followed. Traffic is expected to start on the new bridge by the end of December. “The government had approved the construction of this 1272 meters long bridge over river Ganges, between Kareti Ghat to Shahzadpur, in July 2019 and the construction of the bridge was undertaken by us and now the bridge is almost 94% complete,” said the project director, Subhash Pratap Bagri. Around Rs 248 crore was spent on the construction of this bridge. Like the new bridge over river Yamuna at Prayagraj, this bridge is constructed in the form of an Extradosed cable-stay bridge of German technology. The bridge is supported over 13 pillars. Although there was some delay in the construction of the bridge due to the first and second wave of the pandemic and the work had come to a standstill for several days but still, the corporation has made up the lost time and managed to minimise the delay by just a couple of months. The bridge would also come as a boon for denizens of the Sangam city who stay in the city west.

Stern action will be taken if any organisation, association, group or individual is found arranging pandals in violation of instructions, police have said. Vizag city police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said Ganesh idols shall not be put up in public places, nor shall permission be given for erection of Ganesh pandals in public places in violation of Covid-19 guidelines. Police added that idols may be put up in private precincts and the festival should be a private affair. The public may be educated about Covid-19 regulations well in advance and counselled to perform pujas at home, but not in public places as large gatherings raise the chances of spread of virus. Similarly, no permission should be given for procession while immersion or use of loudspeaker and loud music, they added. A senior police officer said around 2,500 Ganesh pandals were erected in Vizag city in 2019 and an exclusive website was launched to provide a single window clearance from various departments. Over 20 Ganesh idols that had a height of between 20 to 35 feet came up in the city in 2019. In Vizianagaram as well, police chief Deepika M Patil said, “We request the devotees to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at homes in strict adherence to Covid-19 norms. The police will not issue permission for putting up pandals, performing pujas at public places for immersions of the idols.” Meanwhile, Vizagites said though Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the biggest festivals in the state, with various organisations, colonies, traders and individuals coming together to celebrate, this year, too, Covid-19 has dampened the festive spirit among idol makers and locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/for-second-year-in-a-row-vizag-to-celebrate-ganesh-chaturthi-indoors/articleshow/85876803.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Business||IIFL Housing Finance looks at co-lending model to grow||Mumbai: IIFL Housing Finance is looking at a co-lending partnership with banks to grow its home loan business. The private lender has partnered with Standard Chartered Bank and Central Bank and is currently in advanced talks with another public sector bank. The housing finance company, which has a loan book that is around 46% of IIFL’s loans, has developed expertise in lending for affordable housing, which now serves as a competitive advantage. Speaking to TOI, Monu Ratra, CEO, IIFLHF said that while for PSU banks home loan continues to be a branch-led portfolio, his company through the use of technology and productive field staff has been able to digitise and make the customer onboarding process efficient. “Once you do a lot of transactions, to keep yourself cost-efficient you need a lot of innovation. We do not use external software. We have a 100-member team in-house to develop our applications, which enables us to customise much faster. A lot of effort has gone into this and over time this investment has created a moat for us,” said Ratra. To digitise the process, IIFLHF has partnered with several fintechs including for support on the KYC process, to read the text in documents using OCR (optical character recognition) and other tasks. This digital infrastructure enables HFCs to deploy agents with electronic tablets to onboard customers. The company can also expand its office network without significantly pushing up its operating expenses. Ratra points out that public sector banks are ideal partners as other than SBI there is no other PSB with a loan portfolio of over Rs 1 lakh crore. At the same time, demand in the affordable segment has increased even as this niche industry has seen some consolidation. “Banks realise that they cannot customise systems for one segment of this market. This is why they would want to partner someone like us to do this business,” said Ratra. The Reserve Bank of India had permitted co-lending three years ago to provide borrowers with the advantage of the low cost of funds of banks and the efficiency of finance companies. Despite its average loan size being only around Rs 18.5 lakh, IIFLHF has managed to contain its customer acquisition cost at 1.5%. Under RBI’s co-lending model, the housing finance company will be the single point interface for the customer, but the loan would be shared between the bank and NBFC. Banks can participate in the loan up to 80% and pay the housing finance company a fee for procuring the loan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/iifl-housing-finance-looks-at-co-lending-model-to-grow/articleshow/85882896.cms||Mayur Shetty

Devi was among the six MPs of the LJP who had revolted against Chirag Paswan and lent their support to Pashupati Kumar Paras, who was recently inducted into the Narendra Modi cabinet and made minister for food processing industries. Paras handed over the appointment letter to Devi in the presence of MPs Chandan Kumar (Nawada) and Prince Raj (Samastipur) besides other senior functionaries of the party on Thursday. Speaking on the occasion, Paras said, “Veena Devi’s nomination as chairperson of the LJP’s parliamentary board will strengthen the party. She will now focus more on strengthening the party’s support base.” Prince Raj, who is also the state president of the LJP’s Paras faction, hailed Devi's nomination. Devi’s elevation is being viewed as a severe blow to Chirag. Devi represents the Rajput-dominated Vaishali Lok Sabha constituency. She is the wife of influential JD(U) MLC Dinesh Singh. Singh was earlier served a show-cause notice by the JD(U) for his role in fielding his daughter Komal Singh as an LJP candidate from Gaighat assembly seat, which was held by Devi before she was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/veena-devi-is-new-chairperson-of-ljps-parliamentary-board/articleshow/85875957.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||PhonePe does a Google, makes data insights public||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Adoption of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in Bharat — or non-metro India — appears to be far faster than the pace set by the metros. India’s financial capital Mumbai does not figure even in the top 10 in terms of the number of UPI transactions. Districts like Rangareddy and Medchal Malkajgiri have reported a higher number of transactions. PhonePe, which registers 40% of all UPI transactions through its app, on Thursday said that it would make available anonymised payments data across states, districts and 19,098 PIN code zones across the country. The data gives granular insights, including the nature of payment (merchant, utility or P2P), the phone model used, and the average transaction size. The data on 2,000 crore transactions are showcased on an interactive map of the country, which can be zoomed in to district-level data. The data shows that recharges, bill payments and P2P categories are higher in tier-2 cities and beyond as, for many, this has been the first digital bill payment option. This is unlike urban areas where customers have been using online payments and other channels for bill payments long before the launch of UPI. Other insights reveal that two-thirds of insurance purchases made using PhonePe are in tier-3 cities and beyond. Announcing the launch of the platform ‘PhonePe’s Pulse’, the company’s co-founder and chief executive Sameer Nigam said that PhonePe would also make its data available through APIs (application programming interface) to academics, government, regulators, policymakers and any entity without any cost. “When we started PhonePe five years back, we struggled to get reliable granular data on digital payments trends across the country. We had promised ourselves that if we are successful and gather enough data on our platform, we would open it for anyone who wants to get deeper insights on the Indian payments industry,” said Nigam. “We built PhonePe Pulse because we can and, crucially, because we should help unlock opportunities for others to build in India,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/phonepe-does-a-google-makes-data-insights-public/articleshow/85880647.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Allahabad||Rape a crime against society, not just an individual: HC||Revised Prayagraj: Denying bail to a ‘baba’ (sage) accused of raping a minor girl, the Allahabad high court recently observed that “a rapist not only violates the victim’s personal integrity, but also leaves indelible mark on her soul. It is a crime against the entire society and not just against an individual.” Rejecting the bail application of one Bhootnath of UP’s Fatehpur district, Justice Sanjay Kumar Singh observed, “In this case, a hapless girl had been ravished by the accused. The act of sexual assault induces trauma and horror for any girl or regardless of her social position in the society. As a matter of fact, the crime is not only against the victim, it is against the whole society as well. It demands just a decision from the court and to such demand, the courts of law are bound to respond within the legal parameters.” The court added that due to such incidents, faith and trust are decreasing. A first information report (FIR) was lodged by one Keshanlal Sonkar under Section 363 (kidnapping) of IPC against an unknown person alleging inter alia that on June 1, 2019, at about 4.00 a.m., her minor daughter had gone out but did not return home. She was recovered one month later from the possession of the applicant, Bhootnath alias Ramdas alias Babaji, from Jamnagar, Gujarat with the help of the local Jamnagar police. The applicant was arrested on July 2, 2019, and after obtaining a transit remand, he was brought and produced on July 5, 2019, before the concerned court of Fatehpur district. In her statement, the victim had stated that she has been forcibly enticed away by the applicant and also made an allegation of committing rape upon her against the applicant. She also stated in her statement that the applicant used to give her some medicines, due to which she used to fall asleep. It is also alleged by the victim that the accused had also beaten her. Thereafter, sections 376 (rape), 323 (hurt) of IPC, and 3/4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) were added by the investigating officer in the criminal case. The prosecution argued that the applicant is well acquainted with the family members of the victim. He is a sage and it was not expected by a sage to commit such a heinous crime with a girl, who had reverence and faith in him. It was submitted by the counsel for the applicant that as per the medical examination report of the victim, she is about 18 years and the victim had developed illicit relations with the applicant and as such, she was a consenting party with the applicant. Rejecting the pleas of the applicant’s counsel, the court noted that as per section 2(1)(d) of the POCSO Act, a ‘child’ means any person below the age of 18 years and that in this case, a heinous crime of kidnapping and rape had been committed with a child/girl by the accused, who is a sage (baba) aged about 50 years and was known to the victim’s father and used to visit her house, therefore, he must suffer for its consequences. In response to the argument that she was a consenting party, the court observed, “A child/girl, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime, but is a victim of another person’s lust and therefore, her statement need not be tested at this stage with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice.” The court passed this order on August 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rape-a-crime-against-society-not-just-an-individual-hc/articleshow/85875192.cms||---

Police said the location of phone number linked to one of the bank accounts in which money was transferred was found in Punjab. The fraudsters had targeted a 14-year-old girl suffering from depression for months. According to SHO Mahanagar Pradeep Kumar Singh, “While surfing the internet, the girl got swayed by a advertisements of solutions to get rid of mental disorders,” said Singh. The website sent some links to the girl and asked her to pay a small amount as registration fee. Thereafter, she was introduced to a godman who assured her of treating all her mental ailments. He interacted with her only on WhatsApp, said Singh. The girl also informed her mother and used her account to make the payment. A few days later, the man called her and told her that she had fallen victim to black magic and if he did not cure it, she would die. “The man also told her that her family might face adversity. All this while, he kept asking for money in various transactions. The girl kept paying from her mother’s account,” said the SHO. The man convinced the girl by saying that he had conducted several rituals to ward off witchery from her for which he had charged a hefty sum of Rs 8 lakh. For each transaction, he gave her a different account number. When the girl’s condition did not improve, the parents decided to lodge an FIR. The charges included dishonesty and criminal breach of trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/godman-who-duped-mahanagar-family-of-rs-8l-traced-in-punjab/articleshow/85883195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Agitated over the delay in announcement of their results, a group of students and their parents protested at the regional office of CBSE here on Thursday. However, the security did not allow the students into the premises. The students wanted to know that despite giving several representations to the district administration and the CBSE officials, their results have not been announced. “When we talk to the school authorities, we are told that they have sent all the marks to CBSE and the delay is being caused by the CBSE as the school has done all that was desired from their end. However, when we approach CBSE, we are told that it is the school which is at fault. In between the two, we are helpless,and our future seems bleak,” said a student protesting at the CBSE office. When TOI tried to contact the principal of the school, he did not pick up the call. However, a teacher of the school LK Tiwari said, “The school has sent all the marks to the CBSE and there has been some ‘communication gap’. Our principal is in touch with higher officials of CBSE in Delhi and the matter would be resolved in a couple of days.” Meanwhile, CBSE officials made it clear that the school has been at default since the past two years and CBSE has extended all support in the larger benefit of the student fraternity. “This school has not even submitted the list of candidates (LOC) despite the fact that the last date for the same was extended till December 2020 owing to corona crisis. In fact, CBSE had sent many reminders to the school authorities to send the LOC but they failed to comply. Not only this, they have not even submitted the marks of the students. Now, after the results are out, they want CBSE to declare the result,” said regional officer (RO), CBSE, Prayagraj, Shweta Arora.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/68-students-await-results-ascbse-school-pass-the-buck/articleshow/85875117.cms||Rajeev Mani

Move to assembly area at Patna Junction||PATNA: Railways has developed “assembly areas” for passengers at the Patna Junction with the sole purpose of evacuating them safely in case of any emergency. The concept of assembly area at the Patna Junction is the first of its kind in the East Central Railway (ECR). ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the assembly areas have been developed at both ends of the junction – Mahavir temple and Karbighaiya. At the Mahavir temple end, the assembly area has been developed near the railway booking office. “The step was necessary as footfall of passengers is increasingly high at the Patna Junction,” he added. “Certain areas have been earmarked as meeting points for passengers at both ends of the Patna Junction. They can be easily evacuated from the crowded platforms to the safe meeting points where sitting arrangements will be made for the stranded passengers,” the CPRO said, adding at least 500 passengers can be evacuated at both ends of the junction in emergency situation. Such emergency shelter or meeting points are functional at New Delhi and Bengaluru airports. “Thanks to the facility, passengers can be safely evacuated in case of earthquake, fire or stampede,” the CPRO added. Meanwhile, the disaster management team of railways has also worked out a contingency plan to check any untoward incident at the railway stations where rush of passengers is high, the CPRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/emergency-move-to-assembly-area-at-patna-junction/articleshow/85876925.cms||Kumod Verma

The collector also gifted a tricycle to Baaji. Yadav directed the Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) officials to ensure payment of pensions to such people without seeking authentication. He asked the GMC commissioner to depute special teams for disbursement of pensions to those with 100% disability. “We should act with humanity while dealing with such people. Take senior officials’ permission to release pensions to differently-abled people with 100% disability and don’t wait for the authentication,” Yadav directed the GMC officials. Yadav also ensured Baaji received his last month’s pension which was withheld by the officials of GMC due to fingerprint authentication problem, a few days ago. Following a directive from the chief minister’s office (CMO), Yadav told GMC officials to immediately disburse the pension to Baaji without waiting for biometric authentication. According to information, the ward secretariat staff in KVP Colony could not disburse the pension amount to Shaik Baaji as they could not tap his fingerprints on the biometric device. The staffers then tried to carry out an iris scan. However, they could not complete the authentication. Speaking to the media, Yadav said the administration has deputed village and ward volunteers to disburse welfare pensions on the first day of the month. He said volunteers should immediately bring any difficulty in disbursement of pension to the notice of senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/guntur-collector-reaches-out-to-disabled-with-pension-tricycle/articleshow/85879508.cms||Samdani MN

Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said rise in prices of edible oil, food items, cooking gas cylinders and fuel has made it difficult for the middle-class people and the poor survive. Tejashwi said if the prices are not controlled, he would hit the streets over the issue. “Prices of cooking gas have been increased twice in two weeks. Cylinders distributed under Ujjwala Yojana are lying unused at the houses of the poor as they can’t afford to refill them. When the LPG cylinder was available at Rs 384 in 2014, those in opposition were raising a hue and cry. It costs Rs 1,000 per cylinder and the same people, who are in power now, are silent,” Tejashwi wrote on his social media accounts. Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Singh tweeted that inflation would persist in the country till the NDA government was in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-centre-over-price-rise/articleshow/85876048.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: ‘Good relation between same sex must for healthy society’||VADODARA: “It is necessary to note that for the healthy society, good and pious relations and friendships between same sex are very much needed … Such instance (honey trap) not only shakes the confidence of the society but also shakes the real purpose behind the concept of gay or same sex dating. Such kinds of offenders are a threat to society as well as social balance.” This is what a sessions court in Vadodara observed while rejecting the bail of a man who was arrested for blackmailing a man along with his two other friends through a gay social networking and dating mobile app. The court of additional sessions judge A J Kanani also noted that offenders like the accused Rakesh Kanojiya ‘have shaken the social structure by trapping innocent people for their monetary gains’. Court also came down heavily on the accused and said that it is not inclined to show any leniency as he deceived the complainant and blackmailed him. Kanojiya and his accomplices Ajay Thakor and Akshay Gohil had planned to extort money from a man, who used the gay dating application. Gohil took the man to a pre-decided place in Waghodiya in June. When Gohil and the man were in compromising position, Kanojiya and Thakor recorded their videos and photos and later ambushed him. They took away Rs 6,000 cash, gold necklace, mobile phones and demanded more cash due to which the man’s wife and sister came to give Rs 12,000. Later, they threatened the man to pay Rs 50,000 or else they would circulate his photos and videos. Tired of the blackmailing, the man had lodged an offence of robbery, extortion, unnatural offences, criminal conspiracy and under Information Technology Act. Following the registration of FIR, the accused were arrested and have been in judicial custody. Kanojiya sought bail again as the investigating officer submitted the chargesheet of the case. Founder trustee of Lakshya Trust that works with the LGBTQ community, Sylvester Merchant said that he was very surprised with the judgement. "Gay men have very few options for dating and these days mobile applications are used widely and virtual spaces are used a lot. It is important that these places stay safe," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/good-relation-between-same-sex-must-for-healthy-society/articleshow/85877271.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Only Thayanur panchayat in Manikandam block is yet to take a stand, officials said.The 24 village panchayats are Malliyampathu, Marunthandakurichi, Kambarasampettai, Mutharasanallur, Mudikandam, Mekkudi, K Kallikudi,Nachikurichi, Somarasampettai, Nagamangalam, Punganur, Panayakurichi, Gundoor, Navalpattu, Solamadevi, Kizhakurichi, Thalakudi, Madakudi, Appadurai, Esanakorai, Pudukudi, Madhavaperumalkoil, Pichandarkoil and Koothur. The 24 panchayats have submitted the resolution copies to block development officers in five blocks as directed at a meeting held recently. Though they have passed resolutions in favour of the merger, some ward members expressed dissent. “Our villagers are afraid of losing MGNREGA and other rural welfare schemes if we merge with Trichy city. But the district collector has assured us to provide the required amenities and facilities in the coming years. We are in a difficult situation” a panchayat president said on condition of anonymity. Though not all panchayats are interested in amalgamating their hamlets with the city, they were unwilling to proceed with legal battle and tedious administrative process in going against the expansion proposal. Some of the panchayats that require basic amenities including drinking water, stormwater drain and UGD network have opted to merge with the city. “About 70% of our people, mostly in the urbanised area, were interested in the merger,” A James, president, Navalpattu panchayat, said. Navalpattu villagers staged a protest condemning the expansion proposal on Thursday, but the panchayat passed the resolution to merge with the city corporation. Most of the panchayat presidents opined that resisting it will not help as the authorities may use their discretionary power to take over the panchayats. Official sources that the resolution copies along with the expansion proposal will be further scrutinized to accept or reject villages based on the extent of agricultural land in the total land of panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/24-of-25-village-panchayats-resolve-to-merge-with-trichy-corporation/articleshow/85881237.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Dampened demand may hit idol sales again||VIJAYAWADA: The Krishna district administration’s decision to prohibit large-scale Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations is making its impact felt on artisans. District collector J Nivas on Thursday announced that no permission will be granted for pandals and Visarjan programmes in view of an imminent third wave. While many festive committees in the city had adopted a wait-and-watch policy before booking an idol, artisans had been hoping that relaxations would bring in some profits this year. The festival, which is widely observed across the state, last saw large-scale celebrations in 2019 when around 8,000 pandals, ranging from the small to the large, came up across Vijayawada. Installing large Ganesh idols is often a matter of prestige for festival organisers. Demand for the larger Ganesh idols with heights between two to 20 feet were high and would come up in workshops on the city’s outskirts, manned by workers from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. The nature of festivities changed with Covid-19. In 2020, the government did not permit public celebrations or pandals as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. About 15,000 idols manufactured in the city last year went unsold, sending artisans into debt. “I had invested Rs 6 lakhs on idols last year. Not even a single idol was sold and I ended up in debt. I became a defaulter and even failed to pay labour charges for the workers,” said M Ghanshyam, an artisan from Rajasthan who arranged a workshop at Prasadampadu in the city. Ghanshyam added that this year he repainted the old idols and readied them for sale, hoping for better fortune. But the administration’s announcement has come as a dampener. “Around 1,200 artists were working round-the-clock in finishing the idols,” said K Ramnath, an idol seller from Kanuru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/dampened-demand-may-hit-idol-sales-again/articleshow/85876846.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Trichy||Trending: Vinayaka idols downsized, low-cost||Trichy: As the state government has restricted placing giant Vinayaka idols in public places and immersions citing the pandemic, idol makers have avoided making giant idols and instead made simple and low-priced idols, claiming that there is a hesitation among buyers to spend big.Kondayampettai and adjoining vicinity in Trichy is home to around 50 idol makers manufacturing at least 5,000 idols with their family members during Vinayaka Chaturthi. As the celebrations last year were low-key due to the pandemic, the idol makers seem to be well-prepared this time by altering their plans. “We are not producing idols above 3 feet in height and the cap on the highest priced idol is Rs 2,000. People think that idol immersion is completely banned but in reality, small idols can be worshipped at houses and immersed in water bodies,” said S Periyasamy, an idol maker at Kondayampettai. This time, the entire idol cluster has focused to produce clay-based idols instead of paper-pulp cum tapioca powder idols. The latter is used for making giant Vinayaka idols. Stating that last year people preferred to buy low-cost idols, the makers have produced 0.5 feet and 1-foot-tall idols in bulk, which will be priced between Rs 50 and Rs 300 per piece. “We did not opt for any new designs or themes, the small idols will be simple,” said G Jaishankar, another idol maker. Sharing concerns over the wet weather, the producers expressed fear over the lack of availability of clay soil in suitable conditions. They also requested the district administration to allow street vendors to establish stalls in markets and residential neighbourhoods to sell the idols during Vinayaka Chaturthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trending-vinayaka-idols-downsized-low-cost/articleshow/85881274.cms||Deepak Karthik

One of the main factors for the certification was the facilitation council under DIC which guides investors apart from resolving grievances between MSMEs and their clients. There are over 15,000 MSMEs in the district including engineering, fabrication and food industries and the district industries centre promotes entrepreneurship and offers financial support to small-scale industries to thrive. The centre recently applied for a certification under International Organization for Standardization (ISO). A team from BIS, Chennai audited the services provided by the department in the office situated on Collector office road here. The team evaluated their system in sanctioning loans and follow-up with the respective banks, single-window clearance and investment guidance for new investors and subsidy sanctioning mechanism. As the workflow was found to be effective, officials said they received the ISO 9001:2015 certification last week. “Every year, we are resolving at least 10 disputes between MSMEs and their clients pertaining to delayed payment for services offered. The micro and small enterprises facilitation council - a quasi-judicial body - will redress the grievances within three months even if the client is based in other districts or states,” said V Raveendran, general manager, DIC, Trichy. The customer satisfaction point of view of the services offered by DIC was also reviewed in the certification process to assess the quality of the management system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-district-industries-centre-bags-iso-certification/articleshow/85881260.cms||Deepak Karthik

Vitamin B intake is associated with good quality blood, skin, nails and hair besides keeping the nerves healthy. The survey, however, indicates that 61% of the people ignored early signs of poor nerve health even when half of them admitted experiencing some of the key symptoms. Conducted by not for profit organization, Heal Health, with the help of Hansa Research and Proctor and Gamble, the multi-centric survey covered 1,800 respondents from across 12 cities. It aimed to gauge the awareness levels and perceptions about nerve health and to understand if people can identify nerve related discomforts. Results revealed limited knowledge amongst the masses about nerve health. Over 73% of respondents said they relied on vegetables while 69% of respondents thought fruits were the best source of Vitamin B12. To note, dairy products and meat are the richest source of the essential nutrient. However, experts recommend use of supplements as over 70% of the Indian population is lactose intolerance while a good majority does not consume non-vegetarian food. Stating that September marks the National Nutrition Month, experts pointed out sub-optimal Vitamin B intake also impacts overall health as the body is not able to perform important functions. “Deficiency is common in people who do not take adequate amounts of dairy products or non-vegetarian food. Adequate amount of Vitamin B12 and its supplements must be taken regularly as part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet,” said Dr Sanjay Kalra, former president, Endocrine Society of India. Medical literature suggests that it is important to nourish one’s nerves to avert medical condition called peripheral neuropathy which adversely affects quality of life. Honorary General Secretary, Association of Physicians of India (API), Dr Mangesh Tiwaskar said that lack of awareness led to diagnosis of complications in later stages. “Several people have to undergo amputation (as in case of diabetic foot) as a price of their ignorance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/69-adults-unaware-about-right-sources-of-vit-b12/articleshow/85883208.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Shahibaug police inspector K D Jadeja said the 45-year-old GCRI employee had separated from his wife about four years ago. His children also lived with his parents, and he was living alone for past few years. Sources said that he was mentally disturbed after separation from his wife and had attempted to end his life a couple of times in the past. Police and two vehicles of the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services were on the spot to save him but Solanki jumped from the fourth floor. Two videos of his suicide went viral on Thursday where AFES officials and another persons are seen trying to change his mind. In one of the videos, officials ask him to eat gutka offered by them but Nilesh is adamant on ending his life. He can be heard saying that he will jump from there even if the officials try to save him by putting net below the building. Solanki then hesitates for a moment and takes a leap. He hits the boundary wall and falls on a tin shade. Police officials said that Solanki was rushed to hospital but died during treatment. Hospital authorities said that the man died due to head and body injuries. “He was roaming around suspiciously on Wednesday and was asked to leave the premises as it was beyond his duty hours. He had not reported on duty since August 28 and had not even put his leave report,” said an official.“He was attempting to jump from a couple of other locations but was spotted and rescued. So, police and fire brigade were present here,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gcri-staffer-jumps-to-death-at-civil/articleshow/85878892.cms||---

The department planned to widen the service road as haphazard parking in the narrow lane was causing frequent bottlenecks during peak hours.The department officials said that two houses and 10 shops occupying around 8-feet-wide land on the service road were asked several times to vacate the property. However, as the encroachers did not vacate voluntarily, the officials on Thursday with the help of police support razed down the properties. “Trichy Corporation will also be reconstructing the drain at the end of the service road. We will widen the existing width of the service road from 35-feet to over 40-feet,” an official with the department said. A tender has been floated to execute the work, the official added. The reconstruction of drains by the civic body is anticipated to prevent waterlogging.Meanwhile, the residents pitched for a similar solution to prevent waterlogging in the subway situated on the other side of the Crawford RoB. “Even after minor drizzle, the subway in Crawford-E Pudur is flooded,” H Ghouse Baig, a resident of Ramachandra Nagar said.

Police said the case is about a group of 16 people trying to obtain vaccination certificates without actually getting vaccinated. As per complaint lodged by a woman medico heading a vaccination centre, the alleged incident took place at the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s vaccination centre being operated from the DKMM College in Pahadsinghpura area of the city. The issue came to light on Saturday after one of the health staffers raised an alert about sudden increase in the number of beneficiaries on Saturday. Soon a team from the civic body rushed to the health centre and screened the list of beneficiaries lined up for inoculation for the day and found that some of them had not even turned up at the centre, but still were listed. In addition to the police complaint, the civic body too initiated an independent probe into the incident of over a dozen people being issued certificates without actually being inoculated. Inspector Prashant Potdar told TOI that statements of all those having access to the login id and password, as well as the people whose names have suspiciously appeared in the CoWIN App are being recorded. “We have managed to unwrap some layers and are confident of cracking the case at the earliest,” said Potdar while saying that the probe may also bust a racket involved in obtaining certificates with inoculation. A health department official said though there has been a demand for vaccination, there are citizens from different walks of life who still are reluctant to get the shots. Indicating that there could be an insider from the health department involved in the alleged act, another official from the health department said, “The CoWIN app is a secured application. It is almost impossible for someone from outside to access and log in.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/certificate-without-jab-cops-in-aurangabad-book-case/articleshow/85873885.cms||---
---||Chennai||Artificial insemination denies cattle mating right, ban it: Madras HC||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered authorities to avoid artificial insemination of animals as it denies them their mating right. Denying and depriving the right to copulate amounts to cruelty to animals under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the court said. “Artificial insemination deprives bulls and cows the pleasure of mating which they are entitled to. Reproduction by natural process is a basic biological need which cannot be interfered with,” a bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice P Velmurugan said. The court also ruled that only native bulls should be permitted to take part in jallikattu and other bull sports in Tamil Nadu, and participation of imported or hybrid bulls should be prohibited. State veterinary department officials should certify the nativity of animals before the jallikattu, the bench said. The court also directed the state government to encourage bull owners and farmers to groom native breeds by providing subsidies. “There is an inbuilt prohibition under the Act to use other breeds, including imported hybrid/cross variety bulls, in jallikattu. In view of the prohibition, no owner or authority can allow other bulls except native bulls to participate in jallikattu,” the court said. The bench was passing the order on a plea moved by 71-year-old E Seshan of Thoraipakkam in Chennai, seeking to ensure that only native breeds of bulls were permitted in jallikattu, manjuvirattu, oormadu, vadamadu or vadamanjivirattu, eruduttu viduthal. Recalling how jallikattu was revived in Tamil Nadu after the sport was banned by the Supreme Court, the bench said, “the very object of the amendments brought in to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act by Tamil Nadu government in 2017 was to preserve the culture, heritage and native breeds of cattle.” “It is only to facilitate to groom the native breeds so as to preserve and make them to participate in jallikattu which is part of Tamil culture and heritage,” the court said. However, Western varieties of cattle (Bos Taurus) and cross breeds of cattle which do not have humps or have tiny hump which is also not aligned to their front legs as in the case of pure native breed bulls are nowadays allowed. It is impossible to play the game of jallikattu with western cattle or cross breeds as there is no or little hump, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/artificial-insemination-denies-cattle-mating-right-ban-it-hc/articleshow/85881368.cms||Suresh Kumar

While all the students could access their score card, Fauzia wasn’t allowed to do so. A student of class 12, Fauzia, 18, lost her father to Covid and her family took a loan of Rs 12,000 to pay her fees for April and May. However, with her school fee pending since June, the school refused to share her marks. “She has been served a notice stating that her access to student-teacher WhatsApp group for online classes 11 will be blocked if the fees is not paid,” said her elder sister. “Our father’s death has left us in deep financial instability. We were hoping that at least the school will consider our plea on mercy ground but in vain. My sister, who wants to be a doctor, is now under depression,” said her elder sister. Nine-year-old Vibha, a student of class 4, had to drop out of her convent school in Rajajipuram after her mother failed to pay the school fee. Vibha’s father succumbed to corona infection during the second wave. Later, thanks to the efforts of her uncle, another convent school in the neighbourhood offered to waive 60% of the school fee. In the case of six-year-old Alia, an eminent school, which has several branches in the city, struck off the kid’s name as her mother failed to pay the fee after her husband’s death due to corona. For students like Fauzia, Vibha and Alia, a ray of hope has come in the form of the Centre government’s submission in the Supreme Court that the state government should shoulder the burden of the fee if the private schools are unwilling to waive off the fee. Speaking to TOI, lawyer Vaibhav Pandey, who practices in Allahabad high court’s Lucknow bench said, “Aishwarya Bhati, the additional solicitor general told the Supreme Court that for children who have lost either parent or both parents after March 2020, the state governments shall ask private schools to waive the fee of the distressed children for the current academic year. In case, the private institutions are unwilling to effectuate such waiver, the state governments shall shoulder the burden of the fee.” “The apex court has sought response from the state governments on the next hearing on September 7,” he added. Manoj Rai, chairperson of Uttar Pradesh Woman and Child Development department, said, “Currently, UP is offering free education as well as financial aid to Covid orphans at government run schools. Over 5,000 kids have been funded by the state government. Further, we have also directed the district magistrates to communicate with private schools in order to waive off fees of such students but only few schools have come up to extend help.” “Private schools claim that they have slashed the fee of such students to half or have waived off the fee but in reality not every school has done that. We have a list of Covid orphans who were forced to leave the school after they failed to pay the fee,” said Sangeeta Sharma, former member of Lucknow child welfare committee.

---||Agra||Upbeat after Allahabad HC remark on cow as national animal, Hindu bodies want Centre to act||AGRA/HARIDWAR: With a bench of the Allahabad high court suggesting that the Centre declare cow as the national animal, Hindu religious and right-wing organisations said the government should “immediately implement” the plan. “This has been a long-pending demand of the society. The Allahabad high court has not only approved the demand but also expects the Centre to take steps to implement it,” VHP joint general secretary Dr Surendra Jain told TOI. “We can’t tolerate Hindu sentiments being hurt. The judiciary also favours this now.” While denying bail to a man accused of cow slaughter, the Allahabad high court had on Wednesday said that the “right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat beef can never be considered a fundamental right” and added, “The government will also have to bring a bill in Parliament and declare cows the national animal.” Organisations of Hindu sadhus said this has been due “since Independence”. President of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, Mahant Narendra Giri, said it would mean people “respecting” cows more. “I urge the government to frame a law. Cow is not an animal, it is our mother.” Nirmohi Akhara spokesperson Sita Ram Das said the government, “voted to power by people for the Ram Temple and cow protection,” owes it to the public to see this through. “We expect the government to do this immediately.” Hindu priest bodies said this would strengthen “heritage”. President of Chatur Sampraday in Mathura, Mahant Phol Dhol Bihari, said, “It would be a matter of pride for Indians if the cow is declared the national animal. The cow is a part of Indian heritage. We don’t just respect it as a god but also derive medicinal benefits.” In Haridwar, Swami Santoshanand from Avadhut Mandal Ashram said, “The government needs to act now.” (With inputs from Sheo S Jaiswal)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/upbeat-after-hc-remark-on-cow-as-natl-animal-hindu-bodies-want-centre-to-act/articleshow/85876242.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

These include helpers, gardeners, maintenance labourers, drivers, gate attendants, watchmen, receptionists and cooks. Now, the labourers, who have rendered continuous service for five years and more, have once again appealed to chief minister Pramod Sawant, who also holds the forest portfolio, to consider their request on humanitarian grounds. Some of these labourers are nearing retirement. Speaking to TOI, the labourers at Cotigao said that despite rendering services for time periods of 8,10, 12 and even 15 years, they are receiving meagre payments, sometimes not even sufficient for them to take care of their families. “Now we are hoping against hope, for some goodies, at least before Ganesh Chaturthi,” a labourer said. While TSL status will result in a hike in payment, it will also ensure that they are eligible for benefits such as dearness allowance and provident fund. “When we work with dedication and zeal, it is the duty of the government to ensure us fair reimbursement,” another labourer said. The labourers said that each year they make a representation to the chief minister and the local MLA, but to no avail. In fact, they most recently submitted yet another letter to the authorities in this regard in August, they said. They said that while several of their representations have reached the chief minister’s office, all they have received are oral assurances. Meanwhile, the range forest officer told TOI that the names of these labourers for TSL status have long been sent for consideration, and that it is left up to the department to do the needful. Interestingly, it is not just these labourers who are facing this issue. Across the state, nearly 400 labourers are awaiting similar TSL status from the authorities concerned. The labourers, who have rendered continuous service for five years and more, have once again appealed to the chief minister, who also holds the forest portfolio, to consider their request on humanitarian grounds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/daily-wagers-at-cotigao-chaudi-still-wait-for-temporary-labourer-status/articleshow/85881711.cms||---

The village heads had allegedly boycotted the family in connection with an issue related to a temple.Revenue officials said the family hailing from Mariyamman temple street in Keezhamoovarkarai village submitted a petition to tahsildar Shanmugam on August 24. According to it, Jayakumar, 50, a fisherman, and his brothers Karnan, Nilavan, Raja, Murali and Madhavan are residing with their families in the village. The six of them had together donated a door guard made of bronze to the temple after engraving their names on the metal three years ago.Though it is not known what transpired between the brothers and the other villagers recently, the village heads suddenly convened a meeting and announced their ostracization. The heads instructed the villagers to boycott the six family members, the petition added. The family sought the intervention of revenue officials in the matter and instruct the village heads to allow them to participate in the ensuing temple festival.At a peace talk convened by Sirkazhi revenue divisional officer G Narayanan on August 31, the village heads were instructed to revoke the ostracization and boycott of the family. DRO told TOI that he warned villagers against indulging in such practices which would attract legal action. The issue was settled amicably after both the parties agreed on a compromise during the peace talks, the official said. However, taking the complaint given by the family members as a ‘suo motu’ case, SHRC sought a report on the issue within six weeks and the matter would be listed for further consideration after that, a notice issued by the assistant registrar of the commission stated on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shrc-seeks-report-on-familys-ostracization/articleshow/85881333.cms||---

Since she is 65 years old and requires someone to take care of her, she submitted a representation to the authorities on June 26, 2021, seeking two months ordinary leave for her son. Since, no action was taken on the representation, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench.The petitioner’s counsel submitted that since the application is pending for a long time, it would be sufficient if the authorities dispose of the same within a time frame fixed by the court.Taking into account the limited prayer and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the petition, a division bench of justices V Bharathidasan and S Ananthi directed the principal secretary of the home department to consider and pass appropriate orders on merits and in accordance with law, within a period of six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rajiv-case-convicts-mom-files-petition-in-hc-for-sons-leave/articleshow/85881399.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to appoint agency to build, run ‘e-challan’ system for Covid offences||MUMBAI: In a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government will soon appoint an agency to design, build, operate and maintain a state-wide fine collection system for Covid-related offences. Relief and rehabilitation principal secretary Aseem Gupta confirmed to TOI his department has invited proposals from individuals as well as agencies to prepare the system for mobilization of fines for Covid-related offences. “We found that we were imposing fines for violation of the Disaster Management Act, but there was a lack of uniformity. Once a new system comes into force, we expect uniformity across the state. In addition, we have proposed that the entire fine amount will be utilized exclusively to set up infrastructure for Covid-related treatment,” Gupta said. Elaborating on the novel concept, Gupta said it is on the lines of e-challan drafted by the traffic branch for collecting fines for traffic-related offences, on the spot. “It is on the same lines, but slightly different. We expect the new agency to build a mobile app. According to provisions of the Disaster Management Act, the collector will be the competent authority to impose the fine,” Gupta said. Alarmed at the sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases across the state last year, provisions of the Epidemic Act, 1897, and Disaster Management Act, 2005, were invoked for the first time to take on violators of orders issued under the two stringent legislations. For individuals, the local administration had imposed a fine of Rs 500 for violation of the DM Act, while for small professionals, it was Rs 10,000, and for major commercial establishments Rs 50,000. “We expect the agency to develop a software for collection of fines from erring persons and establishments. Once developed, we will know how a message is sent on a cellphone and how fine is collected,” an official said. On the mode of payment, the official said it has been made clear in the request for the proposal while the agency will collect the fine, it will be paid a nominal amount as commission. “Whosoever proposes the lowest commission and who has developed the software will be given the contract. We have proposed to grant the agency a commission between Rs 4 and Rs 5 per case,” the official said. The official said since the lockdown, around 90,000 cases were registered in the state for DM Act violation. He said last year, the relief and rehabilitation department utilized Rs 826 crore and this year Rs 1,600 crore will be used to fight Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-appoint-agency-to-build-run-e-challan-system-for-covid-offences/articleshow/85881432.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Under the Smart City Project old pipelines of sewage and water supply are being replaced in the serpentine lanes of old Kashi area. On Wednesday, the minister along with other public representatives reached the narrow lanes of his City South assembly constituency, which houses most part of the ghats along river Ganga, Kashi Vishwanath and other prominent temples apart from major wholesale markets in old city area. During the surprise physical inspection of the work of laying sewage and drinking water pipelines Tiwari took spade and removed newly laid stone plates exposing large scale irregularities. According to Tiwari, after replacing the old pipelines of sewage and water supply with the new ones three layers of plain cement concrete (PCC) has been prescribed in the condition of contract. However, only one layer of PCC was found, the quality of which was also not found satisfactory, he added. Three-day time has been to the contractors and officials concerned for corrective actions in order to avoid punitive action against them, he said. During his visit of over four hours he also detected laxity in water supply and sewage connections at many places. Natives of Kaivalya Gali, Ahilyabai, Maan Mandir, Tripura Bhairavi, Rani Bhawani Gali, Meerghat, Kalika Gali, Vishwanath corridor and adjoining areas also apprised the minister of the ground realities of the work and problems being faced by them due to delay in completion of the work.

The court has fixed September 7 as the next date for recording statements of the accused in this case. Talking to TOI, district government counsel (criminal), Prayagraj, Gulab Chand Agrahari said, “The plea of the jailed MP’s lawyer demanding further investigation in his case was rejected by the MP-MLA court. The defence lawyer had submitted an application under section 173(8) CrPC, demanding further investigation in the rape case. During hearing on this application on August 27, I had strongly opposed it stating that they don’t have any locus standi, as after filing of the chargesheet in any case only police can seek permission for further investigation. Finally, the court rejected the plea.” According to Agrahari, now the next date in this case has been fixed as September 7, when the statement of the accused person in this case would be recorded before the MP-MLA court. “Earlier, the complainant and her companion, who was also the prime witness in the rape case against Rai, had got their statements recorded before the MP-MLA court,” said Agrahari, adding, “Apart from them, statements of other witnesses including former station officer of Varanasi’s Lanka police station Bharat Bhushan Tiwari, investigation officer and sub-inspector RC Pandey, head constable Raghav Rai, Dr Rashmi Gupta, constable Priti Rawat, Amit Srivastava and Shiv Kumar Gaud and the security guard of the apartment where the alleged incident took place had also been recorded before this court.” On May 1, 2019, the Ballia woman complainant and former student leader of a college in Varanasi had lodged a rape case against Rai with Lanka police in Varanasi, alleging that on March 7, 2018, he had raped her after calling her to his apartment. After lodging the case, Rai contested the 2019 parliamentary election as an absconder on a BSP ticket. He had succeeded in winning the Ghosi parliamentary seat. Later, he surrendered before court on June 22, 2019, and has been in jail since then. Police had filed a chargesheet against Rai and hearing in the case was taking place at MP-MLA court at Prayagraj. Several efforts to terrorise the complainant and her family were made allegedly by Rai and his men. Attempts to lodge cases against her were made by Rai’s close aides, alleged the family members of the complainant. On August 16, the complainant and her companion levelled serious allegations against many police officers and others through livestreaming on Facebook before setting themselves on fire. During the course of treatment, her companion died on August 21 while she succumbed to burn injuries at RML hospital in New Delhi on August 24. Self-immolation by the duo led to action against a number of police officials, including DIG Amit Pathak while former IPS Amitabh Thakur was arrested in Lucknow on the charges of abetment of suicide of rape victim and prime witness following submission of report by SIT formed by state government in this connection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/court-rejects-rape-accused-bsp-mps-plea-for-a-further-probe/articleshow/85880267.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

After booking him under sections of the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, the police arrested the resident of Jai Bhavaninagar, on Thursday night. Citing contents of the complaint, Pundaliknagar police station inspector Dilip Gangurde said the accused had befriended the minor — an orphan and stays with her elder sister who is a nurse — by getting a rakhi tied by her. After the recently concluded Raksha Bandhan festival, he started frequently interacting with the girl. He also asked her to start preparing for police recruitment. Police said that a few days ago, the accused told the girl that she was gaining too much weight and it may prove to be a hurdle during the physical fitness test for police recruitment. He then told her to accompany him on a morning walk. The girl complied. After a few minutes, the accused allegedly made a call to his friend and took his car. He told the minor girl to go with him to a flat in the Satara area for weigh-loss exercises. The minor, in her statement to the police, said that when she refused, the accused told her that he was her “rakhi brother” and she had no reason to worry. The minor then went with him to the flat, where he raped her. Later he dropped the girl home and warned her against telling anyone. However, on Thursday morning, the girl told her sister, who took her to the hospital and got her examined. The sister, with the help of activist Sneha Bhosale, took the minor to the police station, where her statement was recorded and a medical test was performed. The offence was then registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-arrest-25-year-old-man-for-raping-minor/articleshow/85876256.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He has taken advice from several doctors but failed to get any relief. He booked an online appointment in the neurology department of King George's Medical University (KGMU) but got a 45-day waiting period for consultation. "My symptoms are getting worse with every passing day. Apart from burning sensation, now I feel excruciating pain and numbness in my little toe. It has almost made me unfit for my job as a security person. I cannot stand for long hours," he told TOI. Like Singh, many patients who need physical examination at the earliest or are forced to wait for a long period for face-to-face consultation with doctors at KGMU’s OPD. These include those suffering from ailments like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, heart diseases, gastro-intestinal disorder and urological issues. The reason for the long waiting list is the limit on the number of patients that can be seen daily at the OPDs by the university to ensure Covid-19 protocol. KGMU’s demand is high because it offers cost effective super speciality treatment in all disciplines. It caters to patients from across the state. Besides, there is a huge backlog because OPDs remained closed during the second Covid-19 wave. Ajay Singh of Madion area had a heart surgery in 2018 at KGMU. Last week, he started feeling uneasy again. He went to a private hospital where tests revealed that there was a clot in the artery. “I want to see the KGMU doctors again, but since my case does not qualify as an emergency, I have been given a long waiting period,” he said. Patients who are under treatment of KGMU doctors are also facing problems for follow-up examination. Gaytri Devi (63) got treatment at ophthalmology OPD on August 13 and was advised to come for follow-up after 15 days. "We tried booking slots, but all are full for a month, "said her son Amar Singh. Similarly, Ram Naresh Rawat, 56, who visited orthopaedic OPD on August 13, was told that his case is of rheumatology. “I went there but was told to come after taking an appointment,” he said. KGMU spokesperson Dr Sudhir Singh said, “We are making every possible arrangement to cater to as many patients as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/botched-slot-bookings-push-kgmu-opd-patients-to-brink/articleshow/85883255.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The accused have been identified as Janabai Jadhav (59) and her daughter Savita Pagare (33). They were produced in the court on Thursday following which, they have been remanded in three-day police custody. When contacted, investigation officer and police sub-inspector Shrikant Bharate said, “The incident came to light after a social worker found that the accused women were brutally assaulting the children — aged two and five years.” A police team rushed to the Ramnagar area and rescued the two children who were handed over to the child welfare committee on Thursday. The authorities said the women are suspected to be a part of a larger racket involved in making money by forcing minors into begging. As per the complaint lodged by Devraj Veer, the social activist, he saw the mother-daughter duo assaulting the children and objected to their action. However, they did not pay any heed to his requests and continued to thrash the children. Police said during the preliminary probe, the accused were asked about their relationship with the minors. The accused claimed that they had adopted th children. Later, the accused also produced two bond papers of Rs 100 each. The bond papers stated that they had purchased the two-year-old for Rs 55,000 and the five-year-old for Rs 1 lakh. A woman official from the child welfare department, citing statements of the rescued minors, said the accused not only assaulted the children, but also deprived them of basic hygiene facilities so that people would sympathise with them and give them alms. As per the findings of the police, by making these children beg on streets and traffic signals, people earn anything between Rs 300 to Rs 700 every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-women-held-for-buying-minors-forcing-them-to-beg/articleshow/85873968.cms||Mohammed Akhef

During the search, the officials found out that they had concealed gold in the form of paste in their rectums.Based on the statement given by the four, the officials arrested three more people - Rizwan Mohamed, Abdulkayuom and Syed Mohammed Buhari who were waiting outside the airport to receive the gold. Subsequently, the involvement of an inspector of customs Dharmendra Singh also came to light. All these eight were arrested and remanded in judicial custody on June 20. Seven of them moved the HC Madurai bench seeking bail.Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the modus operandi of all the petitioners appears to be similar. The four who acted as only carriers for a meagre sum of money were arrested, however, the main accused are yet to be apprehended.The judge observed that the inspector of customs who was on duty had facilitated the gold smuggling. Such an organized crime cannot be done individually and there must be a network behind this offence abroad as well as in India. If there is any network, it should have been unearthed by taking the accused under custody. Though the petitioners were arrested on July 20, no steps were taken to take them under custody to find out the network behind this offence.Taking into account the fact that the petitioners arrested were mere carriers and failure on part of the authorities to take the petitioners under custody for inquiry, the judge granted bail to these seven by imposing certain stringent conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/seven-gold-smugglers-get-bail-told-to-cooperate-with-inquiry/articleshow/85881410.cms||---

Padshala enquired with the bank and found that someone had taken a loan of Rs 8 lakh on July 6, 2004 on his house and as no amount was paid after taking the loan, the total amount and with interest rose to Rs 56.49 lakh. Padshala was asked to approach a debt recovery tribunal where the bank filed a plaint against the person who took the loan on Padshala’s house. On enquiring with the debt recovery tribunal officers, he came to know that the person forged documents of his house and obtained the loan from the private bank.

Meanwhile, the search for the sixth man accused in the case continues. In a joint operation with Tamil Nadu police, Karnataka cops arrested the five individuals from different villages in Tirrupur and Erode, three days after the incident. While four of them were from Tirrupur, one of them was from Erode district. The team that took four of the accused to Tamil Nadu on Wednesday is reportedly continuing the probe in the neighbouring state. A police officer said that, given the amount of evidence they had collected, they may not have to subject the accused to a polygraph test. Meanwhile, a special team is in Tamil Nadu, continuing its hunt for the sixth man accused in the case. A senior police officer expressed confidence of his landing in the net soon.

---||Mysuru||Reporting crime is not a shame. Don’t keep it a secret: Mysuru City top cop||MYSURU: Back to back major crimes had kept the city police, perhaps the Karnataka police on tenterhooks throughout the previous week. A four-man armed gang looted a jewellery shop and shot at a young customer killing him on the spot on August 23. The next day, a MBA student was gang-raped by a group on Lalithadripura Hillock. Both the crimes grabbed national attention. Cops were under enormous pressure following public outcry but they achieved success within four days after the crimes by arresting inter-state miscreants. In an interview with TOI, Mysuru City Police Commissioner Chandragupta, an IPS officer, has expressed how reporting petty crimes makes a world of difference in policing. How challenging were the cases —-jewellery shop heist-murder and the gang rape?When crimes of serious nature occur police obviously face criticism from all quarter. First thing we did was to keep the morale of all police officers high and encourage them to remain focused on the investigation. The best way to respond to criticism is through work. The cases were cracked and the accused arrested immediately. Both the cases were truly challenging. In the rape case, we began the probe with very little information. What is the lesson learnt from the crimes?City police are attempting to revamp the system by taking measures to prevent crimes that are heinous in nature. We’re identifying crime prone areas in all police limits. Secondly we’re stepping up patrolling. Even activities of listed miscreants will be monitored closely and regularly. Can we have a crime-free city?Preventing crime is a multi-pronged approach. People keep coming to a growing city like Mysuru in search of work from different parts of the country.We can’t stop them from coming but we need to surveil suspicious people with regard to their stay and work. There is a need to devise specific plans to monitor the movement of outsiders with the help of the public. We need to work on it. We have learnt a lesson from these two cases wherein the accused were from across the country. How important is public cooperation in policing? Policing is everyone’s job but police are solely responsible if something goes wrong. Most importantly we want the public to report all petty crimes happening to them or in their vicinity. Be it eve teasing, gambling and drinking in public places, kerb crawling and robbery including mobile snatching. People should come forward and report crimes. They shouldn’t keep it secret for whatever reason. Reporting crime is not a shame. It is one’s responsibility. Crime is a crime whether it is a minor or major one. It shouldn’t go unreported. Otherwise it will embolden miscreants to repeat the offence. If we know what has happened, cops will be in a better position to take action. If people have a feeling policemen won’t respond to them at police stations, they can call 112 emergency numbers for help as a list of all complaints are maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/reporting-crime-is-not-a-shame-dont-keep-it-a-secret-top-cop/articleshow/85876298.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Madurai||50 yrs on, traders all set to move out of Pudhu Mandapam||Madurai: The Kunnathur Chathiram in Madurai, which has been renovated at a cost of Rs 7.91 crore under the Smart City programme, is ready to house traders and shopkeepers from the neighbouring Pudhu Mandapam, which in turn is expected to get a much-awaited makeover and become a major tourist attraction.It was in 2010 that shopkeepers who were occupying Pudhu Mandapam were told that they would have to move out as they were defacing the heritage structure constructed by Viswanatha Nayak in 1635 AD. It has beautiful and intricately designed sculptures including those of Nayak kings. It was decided to relocate them to Kunnathur Chathiram, a 17th century choultry constructed by a philanthropist named Chambaiyan from Kunnathur. After demolishing the old structure, the corporation started constructing a three-storey one where 190 shops from Pudhu Mandapam are being relocated. The renovated structure was inaugurated by chief minister M K Stalin on August 30.President of Pudhu Mandapam Viyabarigal Mattrum Thaiyal Tholilalargal Sangam, G Muthupandi, says they had readily agreed to shift eleven years ago and are looking forward to occupying the new location. ``But, tailoring shops have been given space on the third floor of the new structure. We have asked the corporation commissioner to allow them to share space with the other shops on the ground and second floor,’’ he said.Some of the tailoring shops have occupied Pudhu Mandapam for over 50 years. Though the corporation has said that 190 shops would be relocated, these shopkeepers say that 300 of them have been paying rent to Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple administration. The tailors have extraordinary skills, stitching clothes worn by people for disguises during the Chittirai and Avani festivals at the temple. ``They are fit to be showcased as part of Madurai’s rich cultural and traditional heritage. So, shifting them to the nondescript top portion would be a drawback to the concept of Smart City which also aims at showcasing the heritage of the city,’’ said S Saradha, a teacher. Besides the 90-odd tailoring units, some shops sell books and others brass and copper utensils. One other concern the traders have is the lack of ventilation at their new location. ``Pudhu Mandapam is an open structure on all sides with ample air circulation, but Kunnathur Chathiram has only one entrance and exit. The civic body should ensure that the new chathiram is well ventilated especially in the wake of the pandemic,’’ the traders said. They also wanted the corporation to fix rents at nominal rates as most of them have been hit hard by the pandemic.Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said the traders had been given an intimation on shifting. ``We also had a meeting. We will allot the shops following due process based on the beneficiary list given by HR&CE department, after the 21-day notice period,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/50-yrs-on-traders-all-set-to-move-out-of-pudhu-mandapam/articleshow/85881442.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Turned away by SC, Anil Deshmukh moves Bombay HC to quash ED summons||MUMBAI: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh has moved the Bombay high court for quashing of summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). When his petition, filed on Wednesday, came up before Justice Revati Mohite-Dere on Thursday, the judge recused herself. Besides quashing of the summons, Deshmukh’s petition has sought various other reliefs, including permission to submit documents or his statement through the electronic mode, attendance through an “authorised agent” and entrusting the probe to a Special Investigating Team (SIT). The ED has so far issued five summons to Deshmukh in a case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after the CBI registered an FIR against Deshmukh and others in April, invoking the Prevention of Corruption Act. Last month, the Supreme Court refused Deshmukh interin protection from arrest in the ED case. On Thursday, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Shreeram Shirsat appeared before the HC bench for the ED but did not make any submissions as Justice Mohite-Dere said: “Not to be listed before me’’. In his petition, Deshmukh, 71, has sought HC orders to entrust the investigation to an SIT comprising ED officers from outside the Mumbai zonal office, and for the probe to be monitored/supervised. The NCP leader has also urged for orders to the ED to follow the guidelines laid down by the SC in its 2014 landmark judgment in the Arnesh Kumar case on compliance with procedures before any arrest. The ED has said its investigation shows Deshmukh’s educational trust had received over Rs 4 crore of the money allegedly collected by the now dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze from bars and restaurants on his instructions. Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged in a letter that Deshmukh as minister had asked cops to collect Rs 100 crore a month from such establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-turned-away-by-sc-deshmukh-moves-hc-to-quash-ed-summons/articleshow/85883260.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to rework vaccine strategy to double jab sessions to 8,500 a day||PUNE: The Maharashtra government intends to tweak its vaccination plan to multiply the number of beneficiaries it inoculates each day. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary in the public health department, wrote to all districts that Maharashtra aims to increase the number of daily vaccination sessions to nearly 8,500 from an average of 3,000-4,000 at present. Dr Ramaswami N, Maharashtra’s National Health Mission commissioner, on Thursday told TOI the state has targeted an average of 13-15 lakh vaccinations per day to increase coverage. The state has also told municipalities to conduct three vaccination sessions per urban primary health centre (UPHC) a day and five sessions per urban community health centre (UCHC) a day, wherever these facilities are available. Dr Vyas has told district authorities to increase the number of vaccination sessions after the supply of Covid vaccines from the Union government increased this month. Two crore vaccine doses are likely to be made available to the state in September. He has also requested district authorities and municipal corporations to hold meetings with Ganesh mandals, NGOs, National Cadet Corps (NCC) and religious leaders and seek their help in increasing the turnout of vaccine beneficiaries. “A Covid vaccination monitoring committee should be set up for each village to keep a tab on preparation and planning of inoculation sessions,” he said. Dr Ramaswami said, “For the past few days, we are reaching an average of 9.5-10 lakh vaccinations per day in the state. We now want to further increase the daily shots following a boost in the supply of doses from the Union government. The aim is to ensure the daily vaccination numbers remain high for a sustained period and achieve full immunization in the state as soon as possible.” He said the health department was also closely monitoring how many sessions were being planned and conducted each day in the district. Dr Ramaswami said even if the state receives 3 crore doses in September, it would be able to utilise them. “Vaccine supplies in September are expected to be much more than those in the last two months. The current plan is to increase the number of sessions to a minimum 6,000 per day. The plan is to push this further to around 8,500. This will help the state increase the number of doses administered per day by another two to three lakh from the current average,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-to-rework-vaccine-strategy-to-double-jab-sessions-to-8500-a-day/articleshow/85881480.cms||Neha Madaan

A rare disorder called Trichobezoar occurs when a mentally unstable person is involved in obsessive pulling of hair and eating it, which accumulates as a lump in the stomach. The 17-year-old girl from Balrampur district approached the hospital with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues. Preliminary diagnosis through ultrasound and CT scan showed an unidentified lump in stomach. “I performed an endoscopy and detected the ball of hair inside. The patient denied pulling and eating her hair. It is a rare condition found in mentally unstable persons. After a lot of coaxing, she finally agreed that she had been doing it for the last five years,” said head of the team, surgeon Dr SR Samaddar. Weighing 2kg, the lump of hair was 20x15 centimetres in dimension and required one and a half hours of surgery for removal. “The patient needs counselling and we have advised psychiatric help for her. She will also need at least 10 days of healing and five days of hospital observation,” Dr Samaddar said. The team included surgeon Dr SK Saxena, anesthesiologists Dr Noorul and Dr Piyush and staff Urmila and Pratibha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/balrampur-docs-remove-hairball-weighing-2kg-from-girls-stomach/articleshow/85883273.cms||---

The estates, to come up at a cost of Rs 394 crore, will help create 7,000 jobs, minister for rural industries T M Anbarasan told the assembly on Thursday. The clusters will be established at Manaparai in Trichy, Sakkimangalam in Madurai, Kodur in Chengalpet and Kaverirajapuram in Thiruvallur. A private industrial park at Kinathukadavu in Coimbatore district will also be established by Coimbatore Sidco Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association (COSIEMA) with Rs 9.06 crore TN grant.  This estate is expected to create 1,000 jobs, Anbarasan said. Tansidco will also establish a sculptors park in Thirukalukundram taluk in Chengalpet district on 19 acres at a cost of Rs 23 crore to give direct employment to 100 artisans and indirect employment to 1,000 people, he said. The MSME department has increased capital subsidy by 50% to Rs 75 lakh from Rs 50 lakh under the new entrepreneur cum enterprise development scheme (NEEDS), the state’s premier self-employment programme. Educational qualification for assistance under the scheme will be Plus Two. Through TANSEED, the state will provide a grant of Rs 10 lakh each to 50 startups this year. “Earlier, the minimum requirement was graduation or ITI or polytechnic qualification. A large section of unemployed were Plus Two qualified and they were missing out on the scheme. The move will enable more youngsters to become self-employed,” MSME secretary Arun Roy told TOI. In another significant step, the industries and MSME departments have initiated an MoU between TIIC and Taico Bank, an industrial cooperative bank with around Rs 1,200 crore in deposits, to pave way for easy sanction of larger number of loans to MSMEs. The MoU is likely to be signed soon. “Taico Bank is not able to lend to MSMEs because it does not have the project appraisal capacity. At the same time, it has a banking licence and can give working capital loan. TIIC has project appraisal ability, but since it is not a bank it is not allowed to provide working capital,” Roy said. “Once the MoU is signed, for the same client, TIIC can provide the term loan and Taico Bank can provide top-up on term loan and also working capital loan. It will be a win-win situation for everyone,” Roy added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-plans-4-msme-industrial-clusters-to-create-7000-jobs/articleshow/85881511.cms||D Govardan

Metropolitan Magistrate Mansi Malik asked Police to submit its report by November 9.

It further alleged that he was told that the company was actively involved in animation, licensing, technology and beauty products. “Through the news reports, it has come to our knowledge that the company is into defrauding investors, and has never carried out any of the businesses stated but is into the business of producing adult porn movies by developing mobile applications and circulating them through it and to further carry out illegitimate business/activities against the law to defraud unsuspecting investors in the companies in a dishonest and deceitful manner,” it alleged.

He used to take pictures of the content of her handset and her social media activities.” Many such examples of cyber spying came to the fore in a survey conducted by Saurashtra University (SU)’s psychology department on 1,080 women aged between 18-30. The survey revealed that when it comes to cyber spying, young women fear their family members more than any stranger. Majority of the young women, with whom Nimmi Patel — a student of psychology department, interacted expressed apprehension that their family members are keeping watch on their social media activities. Most of the women who participated in the survey are graduate or post graduate students coming from middle class and upper-middle class families. According to the survey, 72% of women feel that family members are trying to hack their social media accounts. While 54% respondents said that family members want to get their social media passwords by hook or crook. Almost 81% women fear that their mobile phones are being checked by their family members when they are asleep. Yogesh Jogsan, the head of SU’s psychology department, said that online stalking or spying creates trust deficit within the family. “This kind of spying creates a trust crisis within the family and leads to negative impact on the young girls. In some cases, such spying leads the girls to take wrong steps,” Jogsan said. As high as 68% of women revealed that they were cyber stalked in the past. The incidents of cyber stalking increased after the women posted their photos on social media. Almost 57% of respondents said that they were approached by stranger men after they had uploaded a photo of their social media accounts. “Different cybercriminals have different intentions. Some do it for fun, while others do it for blackmailing the account holder by threatening to leak personal data. There are some who make money by selling the stolen data to third parties,” Jogsan added. The survey also revealed that young girls are more prone to fall victim to cybercrimes. “Youngsters spend most of their time on social media sites but hardly have any knowledge about cybercrime, it’s repercussions or the laws dealing with it,” Jogsan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/young-women-are-more-at-risk-from-family-members-than-strangers-study/articleshow/85876492.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

While DCDS recorded a three wicket win over Baroda Cricket Association in a match that was reduced to 35-overs-a-side at the GMSS, Sector 26 ground, Ranstar CC pipped Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association by a wicket at the Maharaja Yadavindra Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur. The match between DCDS and Baroda was delayed for a few hours after early morning showers. Sensing help from the damp wicket, DCDS decided to field on winning the toss. Baroda started with utmost caution, and the move paid off as both openers Jyotsnil Singh (64) and Amit Passi (30) came up with a stellar effort to negate any early breakthroughs for the opposition bowlers. Captain Ahmed Noor Pathan also came up with a handy 37 off 44 balls, before Shivalik Sharma’s 55 runs off 33 balls laid the foundation for a challenging 220. For the DCDS side, Shiva Singh and Pretak Mankad picked three wickets each, while Rahul Gehlot pocketed a couple. In response, DCDS rode on a collective batting effort from the likes of Rajesh Sharma (44), Dinesh Mor (49), wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav (40) and Mayank Rawat (47 not out) to overcome a minor collapse and eventually get to the target with more than a couple of overs to spare. In another match played at the newly constructed Mullanpur stadium, MPCA rode on a fine half century from Akshat Raghuwanshi (69) and useful contributions from Prithviraj Tomar (44), Aryan Deshmukh (40) and Yash Dubey (35) to put on 264 for 8 in their 50 overs, after being asked to bat. For the Ranstar boys, Subodh Bhatia and Chetanya Bishnoi shared six wickets between them. In response, the Ranstar CC team was determined to make it two successive wins in a row, despite getting a revised target of 251. Their efforts bore fruit, thanks to half centuries from Pranshu Vijay (86) and Pradeep Malik (52), along with a notable 38 from Sumit Verma. However, in a hurry to get to the total, the side lost nine wickets, before eventually managing to clinch the nail-biter with almost four overs to spare. Aryan Deshmukh and Adheer Pratap picked a couple of wickets each for the MP side.

The charges are imposed on vacant plots for not carrying out construction in stipulated time. An official said people who purchase plots through auction or lottery have to carry out minimum construction in the vacant plot in a stipulated time. “As per the provisions, the allotment of the plot is cancelled if the owner fails to adhere to the norms. Once the allotment is cancelled, the owner has to deposit the resumption charge for the re-allotment of the plot. This charge was earlier 15% of the reserve price of the area.”According to the orders, exemption to carry out construction has been also provided to owners who failed to meet the deadline. The owners will now be able to extend the period of construction till March 31, 2022. Earlier, the period was earlier applicable till December 31.Apart from this, the UDH also increased the powers of empowered committees in local bodies for subdivision and reconstitution of plots. A source said, “The UDH earlier decided to increase the resumption charges, but withdrew it later. The exemption will motivate many either to deposit charges or to carry out construction.”The committee will now be able to dispose of the cases of plot size measuring 3,000 square yards. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/relief-for-residents-who-failed-to-carry-out-construction-on-purchased-plots/articleshow/85881568.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Soon, waste segregation to be must for households||LUCKNOW: With the Cabinet giving nod to the Uttar Pradesh Solid Waste (Management, Operation and Sanitation) Rules on Thursday, it will soon be compulsory for households to segregate waste at source and for urban local bodies to implement door-to-door waste collection. The new rules also set penalty for violating the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules-2016, including littering in public areas, making pets defecate in public places and throwing construction waste on the roadside. All the waste will have to be segregated at source into three categories — biodegradable, non-biodegradable and domestic. It will have to be deposited in different bins as per their category. Waste like sanitary pads and diapers will have to be disposed of as per directions of the specific local body. An official said the state government was forced to declare these rules since it was observed that the local bodies had not declared bye-laws as necessitated under the 2016 rules. “The bye-laws were necessary for implementation of the solid waste management rules, but neither the urban local bodies formulated these bye-laws nor were not implementing them satisfactorily. As a result, the purpose of the SWM Rules was being defeated and no sanitation was being maintained,” the official said. The state produces 14,468 tons of solid waste each day and the responsibility for collecting and managing it vests with urban local bodies. Among the non-biodegradable waste, the local body will have to identify what is recyclable and ensure that it is supplied to authorised recyclers. The biodegradable or wet waste should either be composted or treated through bio-methanation for production of fuel. In areas where waste is different from what is specified for the three domestic categories is produced, like butcheries and meat shops, waste has to be stored in separate closed bins and should not be mixed with other waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soon-waste-segregation-to-be-must-for-households/articleshow/85883331.cms||Neha Lalchandani

In the draft of the Rajasthan Tourism Promotion Scheme circulated for inviting suggestions from various stakeholders, the department has proposed incentives, procedures, and criteria for setting up guest houses, agriculture tourism units, camping sites and caravan parks. On Monday, the senior officials of the department had consultation meetings with the industry to get insights and suggestions to the proposals laid out in the draft. When TOI spoke to Nishant jain, director, department of tourism, he said, “We will send the draft to various relevant departments for their inputs and suggestions. That’s why it will take some time to announce the final policy. But it will be ready very soon.” As per the draft, the department is laying thrust on facilitating investors with time-bound approvals, tax incentives and transparent process. Ranvijay Singh, joint secretary, Hotels and Restaurant Association of Rajasthan,” said, “The policy will play an important role to boost rural art and culture, crafts, while creating economic opportunities for people living in villages.” Singh said that the policy will help youths, who travelling to cities for jobs and livelihood opportunities, find gainful employment in their own areas.

A barrage and a bridge across the tributary of the Vedganga river were also damaged. The dam, built in 2000, had a capacity of 2.79 million cubic feet. It served to irrigate over 350 hectare of farmland. Following the dam burst, crops in 150-200 hectare were estimated to be damaged. Mahesh Surve, superintendent engineer of the Kolhapur irrigation circle, said the dam had developed leakages and a plan with a total outlay of Rs 2.5 crore for repairs had recently been approved. “Over the past few years, leakage points had been observed and some remedial measures were taken. The major repair work, however, was pending. We found that water pressure had caused the dam to burst. By 7 pm, some leakages were observed and we alerted the villagers living in tghe downstream areas. The dam suddenly burst between 10.15pm and 10.30pm.” Surve said most habitations along the tributary are located on elevations and there was no direct threat to the lives of the villagers. However, after the alert was issued, Jijabai Mohite (55) rushed to rescue her cattle from the shed near the river bank and was caught in the flash flood. She was washed away. Though there was only about 10mm rain prior to the incident on Wednesday, the region had received heavy rainfall in July and the dam was 100% full since then. “We have given the task of finding the actual cause and events leading to the burst to the dam safety inspection division of our department. To ensure such incidents do not recur at other reservoirs, I have asked the engineers to get an audit done and initiate measures to overcome the shortcomings,” said Surve. Kolhapur district collector Rahul Rekhawar paid a visit to the dam site and asked revenue authorities to inspect damage to lives and properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/earthen-dam-bursts-in-kolhapur-woman-washed-away/articleshow/85874308.cms||---

The girl, who lived on a footpath until literally yesterday, passed her Class X (SSC) exam by studying under a lamppost near Azad Maidan and then went on to join a top-notch city college, has just realised her dream of having a roof over her head. Asma moved into a 1BHK flat on Thursday and will stay here for at least three years. “My dream is complete,” a smiling Asma trilled as she entered the flat on Mohammed Ali Road. “I am so happy...,” is all she managed to say. The teenager, who lived on the footpath where her father sold lemon juice, stepped into the house with her parents and siblings. Once in, she plonked on a cushioned seat in the furnished home and looked around, taking in her new world. Her brother romped about excitedly and sank onto the mattress on the bed as their mother looked on incredulously. The family will stay here for at least three years, until Asma completes her graduation. Asma shot into limelight after she passed the SSC exam last March. TOI had reported on her plight and how she had braved the odds to clear the school public exam despite the odds. Only recently, TOI had published a photo of the girl studying on the footpath, ducking under a plastic sheet as it rained. A few months ago, a bunch of overseas donors decided to help Asma. Moved by the circumstances of the bright girl, these do-gooders from different countries in the West, including an Indian, collaborated with one another and chipped in Rs 1.2 lakh to help Asma live with basic amenities for at least three years until she completes her graduation and takes up a job. The money will be used to pay the rent, electricity bills and for the family’s basic needs. The girl is currently a student of Class XII (Arts) at K C College, Churchgate. One of the key persons who facilitated Asma’s entry into the new house is a Spaniard, German Fernandez, who came across Asma’s story on social media. “I was touched on reading about this girl,” Fernandez said. “Education can help transform the quality of a person’s life… Also, I’m all for supporting women’s education,” As for Asma, she is keen on pursuing her studies. “I am very, very happy today,” she said in English when TOI visited her home. Evidently, the teenager’s love for studies has helped rewrite her family’s fate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girl-who-studied-for-ssc-exam-on-footpath-moves-into-a-1bhk/articleshow/85881727.cms||SL Shanth Kumar
---||Lucknow||BJP to hold statewide meetings of intellectual classes from Sept 5||Lucknow: In a significant development ahead of the UP elections, BJP is set to organise conventions aimed at reaching out to Brahmins, who constitute 13% of the voting population. The move comes close on the heels of similar conventions organised by the BSP to win over the influential community, in an attempt to recapitulate its social engineering formula that helped it come to power with full majority in 2007. Scheduled to be organised between September 5 and September 20 across all districts, BJP’s convention will be named ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’. Confirming the development, party state general secretary and in charge of the conventions, Subrat Pathak said the sammelan should not be read as the one driven by caste factor only. “It is mainly meant to connect with the intellectual classes who may happen to be from any caste,” he told TOI. BSP conventions, spearheaded by Mayawati’s trusted aide and Rajya Sabha MP, Satish Chandra Mishra, too, have been termed ‘Prabuddh Sammelan’. On July 11, 2013, the Allahabad high court, while hearing the PIL (number 5889) filed by one Motilal Yadav, had banned events by political parties in UP on the basis of caste. Mishra had kicked off BSP conventions on July 23 from Ayodhya by visiting the Ramjanmabhoomi and offering prayers at the makeshift Ram temple. Pathak, who is party MP from Kannauj, however, accused the opposition of keeping caste at the core of their conventions. “That is not the case with BJP. Our aim is to reach out to the intellectual classes and inform them about the ideology and policies of the party,” he said. Experts see BJP’s attempt to counter the opposition which has been seeking to poach the Brahmin vote bank which has been siding with the BJP since the peak of the Ram temple movement in early 1990s. Significantly, the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, too, has been sensing an opportunity to reach out to Brahmins, who are considered important in mobilizing the other castes in favour of a political party. Akhilesh had candidly announced installation of statue of Parshuram in all districts if his party comes to power in UP. BJP, importantly, has been treading cautiously while reaching out to Brahmins, in what is being conceived as a step to ward off a backlash from the backward castes who gained importance post implementation of the Mandal commission recommendation -- envisaging 27% reservation to OBC in 1990. Not surprisingly, BJP has been heightening the fervour around former UP CM Kalyan Singh, a Lodh OBC, who passed away on August 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-hold-statewide-meetings-of-intellectual-classes-from-sept-5/articleshow/85883334.cms||Pankaj Shah

Covid-19 induced slowdown left 60-year-old Gopal Chavda’s retail garment shop business in limbo, which finally ended in both him and his 58-year-old wife, Nirmla hanging themselves at their residence on 12th floor of their residential building. The couple left behind a suicide note, said cops. “Due to Covid-19, the retail business was hit hard and we were suffering a hug financial loss and therefore, we are taking this extreme step,” the note said. “The incident came to light when they did not answer to the phone call made by their daughter who lives in Vadodara. Worried about her parents for not answering her phone calls, she immediately asked her brother, Rahul who stays in Rajkot, to go to their house and find out. Rahul reached the spot only to find their parents hanging from a ceiling fan in the room,” police said. Deceased and his son Rahul owned a readymade garment shop near Balaji hall on 150 feet ring road in the city, cops added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/garment-shop-owner-wife-end-lives-due-to-financial-crunch/articleshow/85876588.cms||---
---||Dehradun||‘Recurring landslides show a pattern that faultline is active in Nainital’||Nainital: Recurring landslides across Nainital point to a pattern that a faultline is active in the lake town and this is a cause of alarm for town residents and officials, says Professor BS Kotlia of Kumaon University, who is part of the three-member team that has been set up by the district administration to study the landslide-hit area at Thandi Sadak and suggest ways to prevent further damage. The two other experts in the team are Professor Charu Pant and Professor AK Sharma. Speaking to TOI, Professor Kotlia said that the landslide at Thandi Sadak should not be seen in isolation and that a faultline runs from the Governor's House in Nainital through the Mall Road. At least four landslides have occurred on this faultline in the last 23 years which suggests that it is active. “The landslide of 1998 damaged the gate of Dev Singh Bisht College campus. In 2011, there was a landslide at the Governor’s House. A few years later, Nainital’s Mall Road collapsed. Besides, a hotel on Mall Road has been subsiding. Just a month ago, a 20-metre-long stretch of the road leading to the Governor's House collapsed and now, the landslide at Thandi Sadak shows a pattern,” he said. He added that just building retention walls on the affected site will not work as the landslides will take the walls with them. “We need solutions like the ones at dam sites otherwise there is no way to prevent a disaster. Sadly, no one is interested in these measures. People want short-term makeshift solutions which would be damaging in the future,” Professor Kotlia lamented. He added that he will make a presentation before the district officials on Monday (September 6) highlighting all these concerns. Professor Charu Pant, however, disagrees with Kotlia. “There are different reasons for each of these landslides and therefore, I will be visiting the area near Thandi Sadak with my team soon. We will prepare a report and present it before the administration soon,” said Pant. When asked whether a detailed study about these recurring landslides and geological sensitivity of the Nainital region will be conducted, district magistrate Dheeraj Garbyal said that the focus of the three experts would be on the Thandi Sadak landslide spot and once that study is completed, the possibility of conducting a detailed study will be looked into. “We also have the development authority doing a similar study. However, Thandi Sadak is our focus right now. Once that study is completed, we will see if a detailed study on the entire town is needed,” Garbyal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/recurring-landslides-show-a-pattern-that-faultline-is-active-in-nainital/articleshow/85876548.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt to ramp up tuberculosis testing to eradicate ailment by 2025||JAIPUR: Aiming to make Rajasthan free from tuberculosis (TB) by 2025 under the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme, the health department will ramp up its TB testing across the state by organising health camps. For the purpose, the health department has sought help from Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to ensure availability of equipment used in identification of TB patients. Currently, 60 CBNAAT and 60 Truenat machines are available in the state for testing TB, whereas the process of outsourcing more than 100 machines has also been started. Health minister Raghu Sharma said since Rajasthan is geographically the largest state in the country, it needed more resources. He requested the Centre to provide three mobile vans and an additional CBNAAT equipped mobile van to the state. He took up the issue with the Centre about the shortage of cartridges used in CBNAAT machines. He said every year 1.50 lakh cartridges are required in the state. In such a situation, the Centre should make available the cartridges in sufficient numbers. Sharma on Thursday virtually attended the launch programme to give pace to active case finding (ACF) campaign of TB and Nikshay Poshan Yojana presided by Union health minister. ACF campaign is going on since 2017 to identify TB patients in the state. As many as 96,823 TB cases in the state were notified on Nikshay portal till now in 2021, whereas 1.37 lakh cases were notified in 2020. This year due to Covid, the identification of TB patients remained affected. Currently, 72,000 TB patients are undergoing treatment in the state. TB patients during treatment are given Rs 500 per month under Nikshay Poshan Yojana. The state government in 2020 paid Rs 25.05 crore to 96,394 TB patients and Rs 8.20 crore to around 48,000 beneficiaries this year so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-to-ramp-up-tb-testing-to-eradicate-ailment-by-2025/articleshow/85881648.cms||---
---||Dehradun||For more armed forces recruits, U’khand wants all secondary schools to offer NCC training||Dehradun: Uttarakhand plans on making it mandatory for all state government-run secondary schools to offer National Cadet Corps (NCC) training to its students to “prepare” more of them to join the armed forces. In a recent meeting, state education minister Arvind Pandey asked department officials to look into ways to prioritise NCC training in secondary schools (classes VI to XII). The department will prepare a proposal and present it to the state directorate of NCC to get their assistance in implementing the program. “We are considering making it mandatory for all government schools to offer the training,” SP Khali, additional director of state secondary education, told TOI. “The move aims to cater to the interests of youths to join the armed forces. Uttarakhand has a high population of defence personnel.” The NCC, set up in 1948 as a youth organisation of India’s armed forces, aims at creating “an environment conducive to motivating young Indians to join the armed forces.” In 2019, Punjab had made NCC training compulsory in schools and colleges close to the international border with Pakistan. Earlier this year, NCC chief Lieutenant General Tarun Kumar Aich had suggested compulsory training in schools and colleges. Uttarakhand’s plan, however, does not mandate the training for students but for schools to offer the option, Khali said. “The plan is in its initial stages. We need to prepare a proposal. Our schools need to meet the criteria the NCC has set before training can take place. Secondary schools in UP, MP and Bihar already have NCC classes,” Khali said. At the meeting, the education minister also said a textbook overhaul for secondary school students is on the cards. The new books will have chapters on Uttarakhand’s freedom fighters, martyred soldiers and “others who sacrificed their lives for the nation."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/for-more-armed-forces-recruits-ukhand-wants-all-secondary-schools-to-offer-ncc-training/articleshow/85876565.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Roads washed away, border villages pay Rs 2,500 for LPG||PITHORAGARH/NAINITAL: Bridges and roads have collapsed, with landslides blocking off parts of hilly Uttarakhand after record heavy rains. This has led to transportation costs spiralling in villages bordering China and Nepal, where locals are paying up to Rs 2,500 for an LPG cylinder. Many are not getting cooking gas even when they are ready to shell out the money. In Pithoragarh, there are about 40 villages in the upper Himalayan valleys of Byas, Chaudas and Darma. Most have been affected. “The closest gas godown is at Dharchula, about 50km from here,” said Anju Ronkali, gram pradhan of Rongkong, a small village with about 120 people. “The Dharchula godown is 120km from our village,” said Dharmendra Kutiyal, gram pradhan of Kuti. “A 14.2-kg cylinder costs Rs 922.50 at Dharchula. Taxis are charging Rs 1,200 to get each. They drop off the cylinders and then we have to pay porters to bring them up to our houses. The total cost comes to about Rs 2,500.” Besides taxis charging more, another reason, locals said, is that bad roads don’t allow an uninterrupted taxi ride. “In some places, porters are getting cylinders for villages. They have to change taxis two or three times. It costs more,” said Jaman Datal, a farmer from Dantu village in Darma Valley. In Chamoli, Niti and Mana have been hit hard by the rains. At Bampa, bordering China, there has been no LPG supply for a month now because the road leading up to it keeps getting blocked by landslides. “About a dozen villages around us are facing this,” said Dhamu Pal, a small business-owner who lives at Bampa. “There are at least 500-600 families in these villages who have been forced to survive without essentials.” Here, too, locals now depend on taxi services to carry cylinders from nearby towns. “It’s not just gas,” said Pal. “Flour, vegetables and other essentials have also seen a price rise. Wheat would cost Rs 1-2 a kg at the ration shop. Because there are no stocks, it costs Rs 15 a kg now. Even for that, we have to travel at least 20km to the village nearby, Mallari."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/roads-washed-away-ukhand-border-villages-pay-rs-2-5k-for-lpg-cylinder/articleshow/85876580.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Computer science student gets Rs 60 lakh package||MUMBAI: Google India picked a computer science (CS) student from the 2022 graduating batch at VJTI for a package of Rs 60.1 lakh on Tuesday. The engineering institute is expecting software biggies like Microsoft and Apple, considered to be the ‘Super Dream’ companies on campus, to visit in the coming months. So far, it has placed close to 30 students with annual packages above Rs 25 lakh. The corresponding numbers last year were in single digit. In the pandemic year, demand for IT and computer science students continues to surge, placement cells said. The CS student was picked for a coding profile, said Nitin Gulhane, dean, training & placement (VJTI). The number of companies offering Rs 25 LPA+ packages and total offers they are making have gone up this year, he said. Morgan Stanley picked four students last year for a package of Rs 25.3 LPA; this year they picked 17. Amazon came with a package of Rs 32 LPA this year and hired two students. A New York finance firm, MSCI, increased its package from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 18 lakh this year, added the professor. Last year, Matunga institute closed its placement season on a good note too, with two students getting packages worth Rs 58 lakh (from Google) and Rs 43 lakh (from Microsoft). Gulhane said the placement scenario is not as good for students from core branches of engineering. Last year, close to 90% students from IT and CS batch were placed, but only 20% from civil engineering and 32% from textile branches were placed at the institute. In a special drive, started in the pandemic year, the institute is reaching out to companies, to hire students with special needs. “While educational institutes have reservations for PwD students, during recruitment, these candidates have to go through the same screening process as students from general category. We have been appealing to these companies to consider them as special cases and 5-10% of them oblige. They gave more time for these students to understand them and their skills better,” said Gulhane. Sayush Kamat, an IT student with dysgraphia, said he did not crack the coding test for some companies, which left him demotivated in the beginning. But, with the institute’s help, he did better and got placed at Telstra telecommunications company with a package of Rs 8.5 LPA. The institute placed 10-15 students with special needs in one year, with one bagging an offer of Rs 14 lakh too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-comp-science-student-gets-rs-60-lakh-package/articleshow/85883371.cms||Yogita Rao

From 53 lakh doses allocated in August, the quota has now been raised to 96 lakh for September. If vaccination continues with the same pace, it would take another 5-6 months to be completed in the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma on Thursday said the state had developed basic infrastructure to administer 15 lakh vaccines per day. He has requested Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to provide vaccines as per the capacity of vaccination developed in the state. The number of doses administered in the state has risen up to 4.57 crore, but it’s still a long way to go to reach the target of 10 crore vaccine doses. Rajasthan is at the fifth place in the country in the list of states with highest number of Covid vaccinations. Uttar Pradesh with 7.56 crore, Maharashtra with 6.07crore, Madhya Pradesh with 4.77crore and Gujarat with 4.77 crore are in the top 4 positions. In Uttar Pradesh, more than 15.27 lakh doses were administered on Thursday, while in Rajasthan, the number of doses administered were just over 2.4 lakh. Since the current pandemic situation in the state is more or less under control, the state is focusing on Covid vaccination. Only eight persons tested positive in the state on Thursday taking the overall tally to 9,54,108. The state’s toll stands at 8,954. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (4), Ajmer (2) and one case each in Jalore and Bikaner. Health minister said that the state was making its preparations anticipating the third. He said the department had arranged oxygen generation plants to concentrators for the availability of 1,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen. He said the number of beds in NICU, PICU, SNCU and ICU was being continuously increased in children’s hospitals. Along with this, the basic infrastructure has also been strengthened in the selected 332 community health centres, so that there was no burden of patients in the district-level medical institutions and the general public could get all medical facilities within their vicinity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-will-get-96-lakh-covid-vax-doses-from-centre-this-month/articleshow/85881694.cms||---

The airline submitted a proposal to Kushinagar airport authorities, which referred it to DGCA for clearance. Deputy general manager, AAI, Kushinagar airport, Sanjay Kumar Narain, confirmed the carrier has submitted a proposal to operate flights to and from Kushinagar. “The authority has asked the company to get DGCA nod. Flight operations are currently suspended till September 30 and the airline will be allowed to operate after due approval,” Narain told TOI. Sources said, the airline also plans to operate a flight between Kushinagar and Bhairahawa in Lumbini province of Nepal. Kushinagar Airport likely to be inaugurated before UP pollsAir connectivity with Nepal is expected to boost the Buddhist circuit, which the UP government seeks to push on the global map. Tourists and pilgrims from Buddhist nations touch down at Kathmandu airport and then come to Kushinagar by road. Now, tourists will be comfortable with a direct flight from Bhairahawa and Kathmandu to Kushinagar. Buddha Airlines had experimented with the idea of operating flights from Kathmandu to Lucknow and Varanasi around 10 years ago. The move, however, fell flat in the wake of less footfall. The airline, eventually, had to suspend its operations to India. The Kushinagar International Airport is likely to be inaugurated months before UP assembly elections. Sources said, AAI has been seeking feedback before making the airport functional. The Kushinagar airport was handed over operations to AAI in October, 2019, and a regional connectivity scheme (RCS) terminal was completed a year later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kushinagar-nepal-flight-to-boost-buddhist-circuit/articleshow/85883343.cms||---

The highway was blocked since August 27 at different places due to landslides triggered by heavy rainfall in Tehri Garhwal district, prompting the district administration to stop the traffic movement between Tapovan and Maletha. According to orders issued by Tehri Garhwal district magistrate (DM), the National Highway (NH) division of the Public Works Department (PWD) has repaired the road and the traffic movement on the highway has been restarted with certain conditions. Firstly, traffic movement between Muni Ki Reti in Rishikesh and Kirtinagar will be allowed between 8am and 5pm only and earthmoving machines have been stationed near danger zones to clear the debris in case the slide gets activated again. Moreover, the personnel of the disaster management department have been deployed at the danger zones on the highway to ensure a safe journey for the passengers, according to the order issued by Iva Ashish Shrivastav, Tehri Garhwal DM. Nearly 70 roads, including a couple of national and state highways, are still blocked in the state, according to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) report.

Expressing happiness over the ‘never before’ kind of enthusiasm among the party cadres, he described it as a ‘huge achievement’ for the party ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. “Aap sab ka bahut bahut swagat …. bahar bhi aur bheetar bhi … jagah nahi hai baithne ki aur khare hone ki … ye bahut hi badi saphalta hai Samajwadi party ki (A warm welcome to all of you … you all have turned up in such large numbers … there is hardly any space inside the auditorium or even outside to accommodate more people … it is a big achievement for the Samajwadi Party),” Mulayam said, starting his address. The party founder went on to applaud the SP leaders and workers for their dedication towards the party. “Itni badi tadaat mein pehli bar itne log hain … hum lagatar aa rahe hain … lekin bheed jahan tak hai …. aaj jitni nahi thi … aap bahar dekhiye jakar kya haal hai …. yehi haal bhitar hai …. Iske liye main apka swagat karta hoon, apko badhai deta hoon (I visit the party office frequently, but this is the first time that I am seeing such huge crowds …. look at the crowd outside … the situation in the auditorium is no different … I congratulate you all for it),” Mulayam said as party workers hailed the veteran politician with ‘Long live Mulayam’ slogans. The veteran politician concluded his address with an appeal that all party workers and leaders should read more and more about the Samajwadi Party’s history and struggles. “There are number of books at Lohia Trust on history of Samajwadi Party and its socialist values. I will make sure that there are enough copies of these books for all who have not read them till now,” Mulayam said.

In the operation conducted on Tuesday (August 31), a team of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) rescued four villagers who got stuck across mountain river near Milam, the last village on the China border. The villagers, out to collect keeda jadi (Himalayan Viagra), were rescued using ropes which the ITBP jawans tied across the river to bring the four villagers, including a woman, to safety. “An ITBP patrolling party spotted the locals crying for help. In absence of a bridge, the villagers were not able to cross the swollen Gori river. Subsequently, the ITBP team conducted a rescue operation to bring the villagers to safety,” said Narendra Kumar, commandant of 14 Battalion of ITBP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/itbp-rescues-four-villagers-who-got-stuck-while-crossing-mountain-river-at-an-altitude-of-around-12000-feet/articleshow/85876649.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Minister A K Saseendran all for physical meetings||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Amid rising Covid cases in the state and when crowding is mandatorily discouraged and legally restricted, some of those who should lead by example seem to be taking such restrictions lightly. Forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran has been holding a string of physical meetings across the state with representatives of farmers’ organizations, people’s representatives and forest department officials. While as many as seven such meetings have been held, the upcoming ones have been scheduled in Kottayam, Idukki and Kollam next week. The meetings were convened to discuss various issues, including human-wildlife conflicts, issues relating to land titles, and matters related to the forest department. The minister defended holding the meetings saying that they were not crowded, and that virtual meetings were not serving their purpose. “The physical meetings are held as the purpose of holding such meetings are not effectively met in virtual meetings, when it comes to the farmers’ representatives wanting to explain their issues. Also, the meetings are bifurcated into three and are separately held so as to avoid crowding. The Covid-19 protocols are being followed properly, and only the minimum permitted number of people as per Covid-19 rules will be allowed in the meetings,” Saseendran said. Interestingly, sources in the revenue department testify that a large number of people have gathered outside the meeting venues, even if the meetings are held following Covid protocols. “Several people gather outside the halls in the collectorates where the meetings are held---the staff of officials, the aides of people’s representatives, local party leaders and the public who come to meet the minister and the officials. Though these crowds are usual under normal circumstances, this can very well be avoided in the present situation,” a revenue department official who attended one such meeting said. While the meetings of the forests and wildlife minister are being physically held, other meetings that demand even more urgency are being held online. In the wake of the alarming Covid surge, a meeting of all the representatives of local bodies and officials have been convened on Friday by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The meeting in which ministers in charge of local self-government, health and revenue will also participate, will be held online. Ever since Covid-19 was reported in the state last year and the state went for a lockdown, government meetings are being conducted on online platforms, with Kerala state IT mission ensuring the online meeting facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/saseendran-all-for-physical-meetings/articleshow/85879326.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Kolkata police gives ‘blind spot’ lesson to city bikers||KOLKATA: City traffic cops, who have been trying to sensitize bikers on road safety, made them aware of the dangers of blind spots by asking them to sit on the driver’s seat in tractor trailers so that they could understand how difficult it was for drivers to spot bikers, despite the presence of rear-view and side-view mirrors. On Thursday, the officers of southwest traffic guard stopped over three dozen errant bikers on the accident prone Port roads like CGR Road, Outram Road and Goragacha and made them sit behind the truck’s wheel to understand the blind spots and make them realise how they should steer clear of big trucks. A biker sits on a driver’s seat to understand blind spotsBlind spots are locations around a moving vehicle, which are outside the driver’s line of sight even through the use of mirrors. All vehicles have blind spots and depending on the kind of a vehicle, the location of a blind spot can vary. Mostly, there is a blind spot over the right or left shoulder of the driver. It is commonly an area that is blocked by a side-mirror, a pillar connecting the side windshield or items in the car. Blind spots may also be caused by the height of the driver, both taller and shorter drivers may have trouble seeing certain areas around the vehicle while at the wheel. “If a driver cannot see a vehicle next to him, he is more likely to crash into the other vehicle when switching lanes. For the drivers of large vehicles like buses and trucks, it is impossible to spot a biker attempting to overtake from either side of the vehicle from close quarters. The same holds true for cyclists and pedestrians attempting to run across the road in front of a bus,” said an officer. “During Covid, the usage of bikes has multiplied at an exponential rate. So, have cyclists. They need to understand how vulnerable they are on the road when it comes to large vehicles owing to the blind spots of drivers,” the officer added. “I never knew the difficulties that drivers of buses or trucks face and I had no idea that the areas over the left and right shoulders go unnoticed. Cops made me sit at the driver’s seat and informed me about the precautions a biker needs to take while overtaking large vehicles,” said Mohammad Ayub, a food delivery boy, who was stopped by the cops on Thursday for the training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-gives-blind-spot-lesson-to-city-bikers/articleshow/85879387.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In May, the Supreme Court had struck down reservations for Marathas in jobs and education in the state on the grounds that quotas cannot breach the 50% ceiling. In August, the Lok Sabha passed a bill allowing states to identify and notify their own lists for OBCs. “We met President Kovind and he gave us a patient hearing. Among other issues, we apprised him of the need to remove the 50% cap on quotas,” said Sambhajiraje, a descendant of the Maratha king Shivaji and an advocate of Maratha quota. He was accompanied by Vandana Chavan (NCP), Vinayak Raut (Shiv Sena), Ranjitsinh Naik Nimbalkar (BJP) and Sangram Thopte (Congress). On Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will hold an all-party meeting to discuss OBC reservations in local bodies. In May, the SC had struck down the 27% reservation for OBCs in local bodies in the state on the grounds that it exceeded the 50% quota cap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sambhajiraje-leads-quota-delegation-to-meet-kovind/articleshow/85881830.cms||---
---||Kochi||Covid-19: Antigen tests over 50% of Kerala’s testing load||KOCHI: Though Kerala now reports almost 70% of the Covid cases in India, its reliance on unreliable though cheaper antigen tests continues. With cases rising post-Onam, the government announced that the state has decided to conduct more RT-PCR tests for detection of the pandemic across the state but more than 50% of the tests conducted even now are antigen tests. On Wednesday, a day after announcing to conduct only RT-PCR tests in six districts where the vaccination is 80% or close to 80% the state conducted 1,74,854 tests out of which 55% or 95,632 were antigen tests. Out of the 1,74,307 tests done on Thursday, 53% were antigen tests (92,784). In fact, 60-65 % of the tests carried out so far in the state were antigen tests. "Our reliance on antigen tests has to go if we want to control Covid spread in the state. Unless we test and detect positive cases and isolate them, we will not be able to bring down the cases in the state. Antigen test results are unreliable, with even symptomatic patients testing negative. Later, in RT-PCR tests, almost 90 % of them turn positive,” IMA Kerala secretary Dr Gopikumar P said. Since government labs don't have enough capacity it is not easy to ramp up RTPCR tests. Already, it conducts 25,000- 30,000 tests daily and conducting more tests would stretch their capacities and the result turnaround time may increase as was seen during the initial phase of Covid. "The problem is that we have not developed our RTPCR testing capacity. So, if we decide to go for RT-PCR tests alone, then it will take more time to get the results and then again the risk of transmission remains high," said Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert who has been analysing the Covid trends in Kerala. At present, RT-PCR results are given within 24 hours and antigen test results within 30 minutes. Sources said certain decisions made by a few district administrations have resulted in reducing testing. For example, Ernakulam collector, after a meeting with stakeholders on Wednesday, said people who come for RT-PCR tests have to furnish their ward and division numbers too along with name, address, contact number and Aadhaar or passport details, so that it is easier to track the patients who test positive. Lab representatives point out that the directive has made testing a tedious task as often people don't know their ward or division numbers. “Not many labs in the state are doing RT-PCR tests as data entry remains a key problem. Now, it is getting more rigid. Moreover, the number of repetitions in the RT-PCR test is now almost 20%. This is time-consuming and an additional burden for us," said Dr Ramesh Kumar, director, Metropolis Healthcare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/antigen-tests-over-50-of-states-testing-load/articleshow/85879385.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Mumbai||Away from tech, Jains head to temples for austere life||MUMBAI: Prateek Shah leaves on a 45-day journey from Friday. Leaving his phone behind, with no visa or bag, he will walk barefoot to the near-by Jain upashrey, the residence of Jain monks, and lead an austere life like them. Shah is among the many this year who will kickstart the pious eight-day festival of Paryushan at a local temple and continue to live with the monks long after the holy week is over. Termed as the Updhan tap, followers will seek repentance through lifestyle and dietary self-abnegation and go by the routine of the temple like praying at scheduled hours, not bathing, not using electricity. With temples still closed, Paryushan will be a lot muted for the second year in a row. “This year, a lot of people who have missed out on religious activities due to the pandemic have decided to put aside their normal business and take a deep dive into spirituality for a longer duration,” said Babulal Jain Ujjwal, a veritable fount of information on Jainism. “In fact, while this trend has caught the fancy of Jains across India, 38 Jain upashreys in the city will open their doors on Friday to followers who want to take up the updhan tap,” said Manish Gala, president of Kutchi Visha Oswal Sangh. “The option to live with the monks is only open to those who have been administered both the doses of the Covid vaccine,” he added. For many others, this year, the Paryushan is merely an extension of life lived in the earlier months. “We have been living in the aashram with our gurudev as everything was closed. With most companies asking employees to work from home, our aashram saw seekers flying in from around the world, who have been able to follow their spiritual journey and work for companies around the globe right from Dharampur,” said Alpa Gandhi, spokesperson for Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, Dharampur. The start of Paryushan is not the same for all Jains in the city, for the Shwetambar sect, the festival begins Saturday. "It’s been a tradition to start Paryushan by going for darshan of the temple without eating or drinking anything. This is the second year when that will not be possible," said Namita Jain, a resident of Lalbaug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-away-from-tech-jains-head-to-temples-for-austere-life/articleshow/85883404.cms||Bhavika Jain

Six more patients have died at a private hospital in the city.However, as per official data, the dengue toll in the Nagpur division comprising six districts remains at nine.In the last nine days, the division has recorded over 500 dengue cases while the total has risen to over 2,200 since January this year. Over 90% cases have been recorded since July. Nagpur district alone has seen over 340 cases in the last one week.S Gajbhiye, father of the Kamptee boy, blamed the Kamptee municipal council for neglecting sanitation and fogging in their area. “My son caught fever on August 23 night. He tested dengue positive two days later. His pulse and BP were low. Doctors here asked to take him to a hospital in Nagpur. He was on ventilator there for two days before passing away,” said Gajbhiye, a resident of Gautam Nagar.He said that the lid of many drainage chambers in the area is missing. “Our repeated requests to the authorities for preventive measures have fallen on deaf ears,” he said.In the Nagpur municipal limits, the vector-borne disease is raging across all the 10 zones. Citizens and activists have been venting their ire demanding preventive measures. While NGO Janhit has been fogging and removing accumulated water at slums in West Nagpur, Youth Congress activist led by Wasim Ahmed held a protest at mayor’s chamber demanding fogging in Central Nagpur.Dr Harshvardhan Bora, internal medicine and critical care expert at Kingsway Hospital, said that a 30-year-old woman from Nagpur and 27-year-old man have died of dengue. “Half of the beds are occupied by dengue patients.

He said currently there was no advantage of widening the road and so JDA should re-consider its plan.He demanded that if the road had to be widened in public interest, then before removing the affected shopkeepers, action should be taken forward by giving proper compensation or by rehabilitating them elsewhere.

An official told TOI that the survey was necessitated since movement of heavy vehicles has increased in Uttarakhand due to crucial under-construction projects like Centre’s all-weather Char Dham road and Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail link. Once the safety survey is over, repair work will be carried out on the bridges if needed, said the official. All of the 664 bridges to be surveyed are classified as ‘Category B’ bridges, meaning movement of vehicles with maximum 16 ton weight is allowed on them. Many of these bridges were built in the 1960s. The Ranipokhari bridge which fell into the monsoon-fed Jakhan river was built in 1964 and classified as a category B bridge. Several vehicles had narrowly averted disaster as pillars of the bridge on August 26 gave way and the structure crashed. The state also has 657 ‘Category A’ bridges that allow for a higher vehicle weight limit of up to 70 ton. In February this year, the state government had temporarily halted movement of vehicles weighing over 16 ton on any of the state’s bridges. Vehicles with higher weight capacity required prior permission from the authorities. While directions to survey the bridges were issued by principal secretary of the public works department (PWD) R K Sudanshu on Wednesday, circle officers have been asked to prepare a detailed report on the condition of these bridges. PWD minister Satpal Maharaj said information on alternate routes would ensure smooth flow of traffic in case of an emergency. “Silt removal near bridges will also be required. Other repair work will be carried out as necessary,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rain-damage-forces-ukhand-to-start-safety-survey-of-664-bridges/articleshow/85876673.cms||Kautilya Singh

Roy along with three other NID students had designed the coin which was launched in June 2019.  Two years later, Roy has moved on to his UI/UX and visual storytelling projects, but the coin has surely remained close to his heart. “Though I was from FD, my mentors motivated me to participate in the project. I chose the motif of wheat stems and number 8 even as the coin was of Rs 10. The reason was the importance of the number in Indian culture – ranging from Ashtalakshmi to Ashtangayoga,” he said. File photo of Roy receiving the prize money from the then NID director Pradyumna Vyas for designing the coinBut primarily he credits the design to the influence of his mother Chayanika who works with children with disabilities. “Compared to earlier coins, it’s more tactile as the engravings are deeper. The project was an ode to the divyang,” said Roy who is graduating this year. The premier design institute is likely to hold its convocation by the end of September. Pravinsinh Solanki, associate senior faculty at NID and mentor to Roy, said that Roy showed a great example of the interdisciplinary nature of design.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/co-designer-of-rs-10-coin-to-graduate-this-year-from-nid/articleshow/85879447.cms||Parth Shastri

The cleric said that Muslims support the court’s suggestion and respect sentiments of Hindu brothers and this would foster unity and peace in the country. “The high court’s suggestion to name the cow India’s national animal is welcome. The court is also correct in observing that even during the Mughal rule there was a ban on cow slaughter,” said Maulana Rasheed. “Mughal emperor Babur had given two pieces of advice to his son Humayun. One was to respect Hindu sentiments and the other was to not allow cow slaughter. This was followed by all Mughal rulers who came after Humayun. The Mughals allowed people of all faiths and religions to have equal rights on their religious rituals and practices which is why there was never a religious fight between people at that time,” the cleric claimed. Recalling the role of Lucknow clerics in dissuading people from cow slaughter, the cleric said that during the freedom struggle, a fatwa had been issued by Maulana Bari banning cow slaughter on Bakrid. “Even now, no cleric advocates cow slaughter in India and people are encouraged to respect religious sentiments,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cleric-backs-high-court-suggestion-to-declare-cow-indias-national-animal/articleshow/85883400.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We have purchased sanitiser machines, cleaned up tanks, purchased new RO water system for cleanliness and have briefed up the sanitation staff. Our priority is to keep a safe environment for students.” Students’ union has praised the varsity officials for reopening the hostels. NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati said students have suffered enough during pandemic and with situation becoming normal, students want to get started with their studies.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s oldest school hostel set to turn into law college||KOLKATA: When the Bastille fell and the sans-culottes took to the streets of France in 1789, in a quiet corner on the Eastern flank of the Hooghly, the British started a school for the community’s children, making it the oldest school that still exists. St Thomas School, Kidderpore on Diamond Harbour Road not only admitted British day scholars but also had hostel facilities for those who came from outside. This 232-year-old hostel will no longer exist in its original avatar and is getting transformed into a law college. The school is run by the Kolkata diocese of the Church of North India (CNI), which has decided to change the utility of the building. The sprawling heritage hostel that had housed generations of students, mostly from the Anglo Indian and underprivileged backgrounds, is shifting the 35-odd boarders to the Oxford Mission hostel (boys) and Elizabeth hostel (girls), both heritage campuses in Behala and both run by the same management. They will, however, continue to remain the students of the school and will be brought to the campus. They will have access to the canteen and other facilities when physical school reopens. Now that they are attending online classes, arrangements have been made for them at the Behala hostels. “Once upon a time, the sprawling hostel used to be teeming with boarders. Times have changed now and we are left with very few children, whom we are supporting. Most of them are from Anglo Indian backgrounds. The building was mostly vacant and there was no point wasting such premium space. So, the Diocese decided to convert it into a law college,” said secretary of the Diocese and principal of the school, (boys and girls), John Ghosh. The law college will be affiliated to the Calcutta University and a no objection certificate is being awaited. The preliminary inspection has already been done. “It’s a heritage building and one of the most cherished institutions under our umbrella because it is perhaps the oldest school hostel building in the country. We are restoring it and putting the hostel rooms to re-use for the law college,” Ghosh added. Old boarders are, however, sad that the hostel, where they had spent some of their best years, will no longer exist. “It was my first home for 14 years from 1980-94. It’s sad to think that the building will no longer remain a hostel,” said Ajit Agarwal, a former student. The Kidderpore campus also has a tech school that is getting shifted to Diocese land on B T Road. This building will be utilised for an all new under graduate general degree college that is coming up. This, too, will be affiliated to CU. Two other Diocese-run degree colleges are coming up on the St James School campus on AJC Bose Road and on St John’s Diocesan Girls HS School campus on Sarat Bose Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citys-oldest-school-hostel-set-to-turn-into-law-college/articleshow/85879441.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Private hospitals are protesting against it and planning to move the court against it. The hospitals are opposing it saying that they are not traders but essential service providers. Medical establishments cannot be kept on par with other trading commercial establishments. Private Hospital and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS) has claimed that they are opposing the proposal floated by the Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater as they termed the proposal not only illegal but also unnecessary. “We are not traders but essential service providers. Why a trade license, when in fact, we are not trading?” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, PHNHS. The PHNHS pointed out that on one hand, the JMC is collecting urban development tax from the hospitals keeping them in institutional category and not collecting UDH tax from hospitals as commercial establishments, but on the other hand, it is proposing to make commercial trade licence mandatory for private hospitals. Dr Kapoor said that the government is encouraging private hospitals for their contribution in fight against Covid but the JMC is going against it and planning to bring new laws for the private hospitals. The PHNHS has threatened the JMC that if it does not take back its decision, the private hospitals will protest and also file a writ petition in the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-hosps-oppose-jmc-move-to-make-trade-licence-must/articleshow/85881824.cms||---

According to police, the deceased, Bapu Kadam, was under the influence of alcohol when a heated argument broke out between him and his mother (Parubai) on Wednesday. He later picked up a sickle and ended up slitting her throat. The entire incident was witnessed by Bapu’s younger brother Ganesh (28) who then started assaulting the former and in a fit of rage strangulated him. After realizing that Bapu had succumbed to the strangulation, Ganesh took the body to a nearby farm and hanged it to a tree to make it look like suicide. Police maintained that Ganesh murdered Bapu when other family members were busy rushing Parubai from one hospital to another, trying to save her life. The woman is currently admitted at Beed civil hospital and her condition continues to be critical. Majalgaon’s assistant police inspector Nilesh Idhate said initially some of the villagers had expressed suspicion on the condition in which Bapu’s body was found hanging. Moreover, the autopsy report revealed that Bapu had died of strangulation. Accordingly, police summoned members of Kadam family to record their statements and found that Ganesh’s version had some discrepancies and contradictions. Ganesh was later detained for questioning during which he confessed to strangulating Bapu as he thought that their mother will not survive. Police maintained that at the time of incident, both the brothers were reportedly under the influence when the incident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-man-kills-brother-for-slitting-moms-throat/articleshow/85876732.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The head injury indicated that it may have died fighting another tiger, according to the veterinary doctor and forest staff involved in its postmortem. “A majority of the sub-adult tigers [below 2.5 years of age] die after being snapped by a large tiger on their head. It leads to either skull bone fracture, which is flat in their case or breaks their neck bone. In this case, too, the skull is gone, indicating the death is related to fighting,” said Dr Dushyant Sharma, senior veterinary officer, forest department. Poaching has been ruled out, though. The tiger's nails were found intact and the hide had also shrunk in its natural form. According to forest department data, the state has lost seven tigers till August 31, this year. These were three males and three female tigers and a highly decomposed carcass whose gender could not be determined. The Kotdwar forest division and Terai West have lost two tigers this year, followed by the death of a big cat each across Ramnagar Terai forest division, Terai Central forest division, Ramangar forest division and Haridwr forest division. Three deaths have been attributed to natural causes, three due to internal fights, one to road accident and the cause of death of one tiger remains unknown, so far. The state had lost six tigers in 2020, 13 tigers in 2019, eight in 2018 and 14 in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sub-adult-tiger-found-dead-in-terai-west-eighth-tiger-death-this-year/articleshow/85876746.cms||Shivani Azad

The construction of reservoirs began in 2012 and ended in 2018. The purpose of these reservoirs was to provide uninterrupted water supply to the households during the breakdown or maintenance works of the pipelines. Department engineers continue to give the same justification since 2019 that the works would be completed soon, and the project would be commissioned. The initial contractor abandoned the works due to non-payment of dues. The present contractor was supposed to complete the works, but unavailability of labourers led to incompletion. The public works department, through JICA funds, built the overhead reservoirs (OHR) in Varca with a holding capacity of 10 cu lts, in Orlim (3.5 cu lts) and in Betalbatim (5 cu lts). Project’s executive engineer Srikant Gaonkar said that while only minor works are pending, they are in the process of hydro-testing the tanks. However, a source informed that the reservoir line has to be connected to the distribution line which entails seeking permission from the south Goa district collector for road cutting at all the sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salcete-water-reservoirs-yet-to-be-commissioned/articleshow/85881931.cms||---

While several schools are still collecting consent from parents, many began classes. In Vadodara, excitement was writ large on the faces of students as they stepped back in their classrooms after a gap of almost 18 months. Schools too ensured that the moment of coming back to school remained a special one. Many schools in Vadodara and Surat welcomed the students with flowers and beats of ‘dhol’. Schools which began the classes strictly adhered to government’s guidelines and managements of a few schools have even formed teams to ensure that social distancing is maintained at all points and students keep their masks on. Sanitizer dispensers were placed every few metres for the students. “Around 40% students were present on the first day and we are following the guidelines issued by the government like maintaining social-distancing in the classrooms and ensuring that students have their masks on all the time except while they are playing,” said Suprabha Menon, principal of Navrachana School, Sama. “We are delighted and anxious at the same time as students will be experiencing the school environment after a lengthy hiatus. We have ensured all our teachers have taken at least the 1st dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and have mentally prepared our staff through mock drills, training sessions and discussions,” said Preeta Pillai, principal of Podar World School, Sherkhi. Several other schools are still in the process of collecting consent letters from parents and are planning to restart offline classes from next week.

The sugar mills realised that they had been duped after the suspects allegedly failed to hand over the receipts and documents related to the exports. They had allegedly sold the sugar in the domestic market. One case of cheating each has been registered in Nanded and Latur districts by the sugar mills. They claimed to have suffered losses to the tune of crores of rupess due to the suspects Nanded police have arrested Abhijit Deshmukh, who is from Ahmednagar district. He was later handed over to the Latur police. After being produced before the Latur court on Thursday, he has been remanded in police custody for five days. Deshmukh along with three others have been named as suspects in the cases. Authorities said that sugar factories get to pay GST at subsidised rates if they export surplus sugar produced in their factories. If they fail to export the sugar, they have to pay the full GST. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI, “As per the government norms, the sugar factory has to pay 0.1% GST if the export targets are met. Failing to export the surplus sugar, the factory has to pay 4.99% GST.” The officer said that suspects contacted a cooperative sugar factory and assured them of selling their export quota sugar in the international market. “An agreement was also signed between the two firms. Accordingly, 5,682 metric tonnes of sugar was handed over to the firm run by the suspects,” said Shewale. Latur superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale said that the suspects also contacted a cooperative sugar firm in June 2020 and purchased 8,364 metric tonnes of export quota sugar on the pretext of selling it in international market. “Prima facie it appears to be an organized racket. They purchased sugar from the export quota and sold it in the domestic market,” said Pingale. The officer said that in both the cases, at the time of purchase, suspects signed an agreement of selling the sugar in international market and submitting the documents to the sugar factory so that it could avail GST subsidy. After the firm failed to submit the documents, the sugar factory from Latur allegedly incurred losses of Rs 8.74 crore as it had to pay the full GST. Similarly, the sugar mill from Nanded had to pay full GST running into several crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/latur-nanded-cops-bust-racket-duping-sugar-mills/articleshow/85876785.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Elevation of 3 women judges to SC in one go unprecedented: Ex-CJI Bobde||Nagpur: Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Bobde has termed the elevation of three women judges to the Supreme Court in one go as ‘unprecedented’.Justices BV Nagarathna, Hima Kohli and Bela Trivedi were among the nine new judges who were administered the oath by CJI NV Ramana on Tuesday. Now, there are now four women judges, including justice Indira Banerjee, at the apex court.In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Bobde said that their names (of women judges) were under consideration during his tenure as CJI as well. “Whatever may have been the collegium’s reason for delaying the selection then, CJI Ramana deserves applause for overcoming roadblocks and appointing nine judges to the SC in one go,” he said.In an interview to TOI on April 23, a day prior to his retirement, Bobde had candidly admitted that there was not much progress during his tenure on having more women judges at the apex court. Underlining the need for a better gender balance, he stopped short of calling for incentives in the appointment process for the same.Justice Bobde recalled that when he was CJI, President of India Ramnath Kovind had once remarked that there was no woman CJI in the 70 years of SC’s history. “All three of them are among the finest judges in the country with vast experience. Their elevation would hopefully inspire more women to join the judiciary and reach the top court,” he said.On providing special incentives to increase the number of women judges, justice Bobde said that those being given to men are sufficient for them as well “as it’s very normal and natural for them to rise to become CJI. “We have had a woman President, Prime Minister and chief ministers. People are used to the idea of women holding the highest position in governance.”Nagarathna might also become the country’s first woman CJI in September 2027. On this, Bobde said that though she would have a short tenure of 36 days, it would be historic. “It is encouraging to see a rise in the number of women in both bar and bench. There are instances of few extremely talented women lawyers who had declined invitations to become a judge. Competent male and female lawyers should be invited to the judge’s job, irrespective of gender.”Dwelling on the need for more women judges, Bobde said, “They can help in providing greater insight on woman-centric issues like triple talaq, Sabrimala temple where women were prohibited, and various matrimonial subjects like dowry, cruelty, Section 498A and domestic violence cases.”During his tenure as CJI, a petition was filed praying for more women judges in the apex court. At that time, Bobde had told TOI that it was high time for increasing their number in the judiciary. He had pointed out that many women judges were considered during the collegium meetings for elevation to the SC but those discussions didn’t result in any appointment. “We failed as a collegium on this aspect. The solution is more appointments at higher posts, including chief justices of state high courts and as CJI,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/elevation-of-3-women-judges-to-sc-in-one-go-unprecedented-ex-cji-bobde/articleshow/85874537.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The new road constructed by National Highway & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) is set to be completed by 2024. The new alignment that will bypass the existing NH-10 and make its way through Jalpaiguri and Kalimpong districts via Oodlabari, Bagrakot, Chunabhati, Chuikhim, Lolegaon, Lava, Algarah, Pedong and Aritar before reaching Nathula via Gangtok will traverse around 150km, around 50km short of NH-10. While the road will be an alternative to the landlocked state that finds supplies disrupted when landslides occur during monsoon, it will also be of strategic importance to the Army to mobilise troops along the border if tension between India and China escalates. Nathula is a pass on the Indo-China border. Eastern Command spokesperson Gp Capt Hooda said: “The development of national infrastructure and lines of communication in Sikkim will facilitate economic development, trade and tourism. The new road will provide faster movement of resources and better connectivity for locals and is in line with the border area infrastructure development undertaken by the armed forces.” Sources said a road already exists along the proposed alignment except for a 3km stretch between Chhagey and Aritar. While a road needs to be laid at this section to plug the gap, the rest of the stretch needs to be widened. The stretch of road from Kolbong-Chhagey to Aritar will pass through Khasmahal area without disturbing any forest areas. The road only needs to be widened. “The new road will also help businesses prosper in the region. Tourism industry will also get a massive boost,” said social activist Sujit Das of Oodlabari Science and Nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-road-to-reduce-travel-time-to-sikkim-by-an-hour/articleshow/85879501.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

The power generated at the Rs 95-lakh plant will be used for street-lighting of the area and lighting a local garden. “The two metric tonnes per day capacity waste-to-energy bio-methanation plant has been installed on an abandoned space behind the municipal chowky and toilet block at Haji Ali. It will generate 300 units of electricity which will be used for streetlights and lighting at Keshavrao Khade Marg garden,” assistant municipal commissioner of D ward Prashant Gaikwad said. TimesViewIt’s a good decision by the BMC to set up waste-to-energy plants at the ward level. If this plant is successful and can generate electricity consistently, the BMC must set up more such units at the ward level. The quantum of waste sent to dumping grounds will reduce and the BMC will also save electricity. Like this plant at Haji Ali, the BMC must rope in more CSR funds for such environment-friendly projects.“D ward generates around 200 metric tonnes of waste everyday. We hope to be able to scientifically convert a large part of this waste at the ward level, in a phased manner, to reduce the load on dumping grounds,” Gaikwad said. “The Haji Ali plant will need around 2,000 litres of water per day to process two metric tonnes of wet waste.” D ward covers areas in Tardeo, Girgaum, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill and Altamont Road. The plant, which was set up entirely through corporate social responsibility funds, will be inaugurated by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday. The bio-methanation plant can treat over 2MT/day of mixed organic wastes and generate electricity from biogas. “Biological methanation is a conversion process to generate methane by means of highly specialized microorganisms (archaea) within a technical system. Wet waste is sent to the mother digester of the plant through a conveyor belt. It will undergo hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis and form methane, one of the light gases. The digester is connected to the balloon room where the gas is stored,” explained an official, requesting anonymity. Mumbai generates 7,000-8,000 metric tonnes of garbage every day. The BMC sends solid waste to dumping grounds in Deonar and Kanjurmarg; it has already begun the process of scientific closure of the Mulund dumping ground. In January, the BMC had called for an expression of interest for a second waste-to-energy plant at the Deonar dumping ground even as work on the first plant, worth Rs 1,100 crore, is yet to take off despite getting the civic standing committee approval in November 2020. This plant will process 600 metric tonnes garbage daily and generate power for sale in the open market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-1st-waste-to-energy-plant-starts-ops-at-haji-ali-today/articleshow/85881850.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Tech talent get 100% raises, retention bonuses||AHMEDABAD: If you think a new job with a 100% salary increase, a joining bonus of about 30% of the annual package, perks, ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) options, a laptop kit, work from home infrastructure with a retention bonus at the end of the year, a 15-day notice period and the option to work remotely is a dream job and not reality, look around. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, while people in most sectors are struggling to keep jobs or get meagre increments, techies joining IT firms in the state are not just demanding but also raking in the moolah, as manpower needs grow across companies. Buoyed by increased digitisation and technology adoption in various sectors, IT companies are flooded with business and are struggling to meet client requirements for lack of manpower. With a growing need for their workforce and while attrition rates are high, IT companies in Gujarat are doling out pay packages and perks that are getting fatter by the day. “We’re getting business but are unable to meet client needs, as we don’t have enough manpower. Finding talent is a challenge amid high churning and we don’t have an alternative but to meet salary expectations of employees. The average packages for people with more than two years of experience have literally doubled from Rs 6-8 lakh per annum to Rs 12-15 lakh per annum,” said Jaimin Shah, managing director, Dev IT Limited. Industry players estimate requirement of at least 10,000 people across IT companies in Gujarat over the next three to six months. Companies said that majority of manpower requirements are for people with two to five years of experience. “Many employees who have been offered jobs with hefty hikes and perks tend to quit in a few months. This impacts project timelines and even deliverables to clients. To address this, we have offered retention bonuses to employees who stick with the company for a year or more,” said Neha Sheth, CEO, Musikaar. Even though salaries and perks being offered are high, not all employees who get such offers join. Tejinder Oberoi, chairman, GESIA IT Association said, “The offer decline ratio has shot-up to 35-40%. We have interviewed candidates who revealed that they are negotiating multiple offers. This situation is bound to prevail with the sudden surge in demand and limited supply.” While companies give out lucrative offers to new employees, they are also compelled to revise the pay of existing workers as a retention measure. “While we’ve offered a flexible leave policy and bi-annual appraisals, we are also compelled to reset the salary structure of the existing workforce so that uniformity is maintained,” said Ravi Pathak, co-founder, Tatvic Analytics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tech-talent-get-100-raises-retention-bonuses/articleshow/85879519.cms||Niyati Parikh

The agents were seen giving slips before voting at polling booths 33, 34, 35 and 36 allegedly to influence the electorate to cast votes for the party. Political parties are not allowed to campaign in any manner near the booth to influence voters. As soon as the Congress candidate learnt about this, she informed senior leaders following which Belagavi rural MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar visited the polling booth and alerted the polling officials present. Laxmi said BJP was shameless to resort to such dirty tactics to win the election. “The BJP is in great fear of losing the election. Hence they are employing these unlawful methods,” she said. Showing the slips to the media, she said, “BJP thinks printing Modi’s picture on the slip will help them fetch votes, but it is otherwise. The increasing prices of fuel and essential commodities has damaged the image of Modi and seeing his photo reminds the people about their pain.” Laxmi said the issue will be brought to the notice of election officials. Congress also alleged that there are discrepancies in the voters list. There is a difference of 80 voters in the list that was with the BJP and the one with election officials, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-gives-voter-slips-bearing-party-symbol-modi-pic/articleshow/85907698.cms||---

Both chief minister, Nitish Kumar, and education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, expressed shock over the “unjustified” act on Thursday. Governor-cum-chancellor, Phagu Chauhan, also took cognizance of the “unhealthy” development and promised to take corrective measures. Choudhary told this newspaper that the additional chief secretary of the education department, Sanjay Kumar, and the director of higher education, Rekha Kumari, had already asked the vice-chancellor and the registrar of JPU to clarify the matter.  “If they fail to submit a satisfactory clarification, they will be called to the department and told to present a detailed background of the incident,” he added. The minister pointed out that the removal of texts related to the thoughts of national leaders was not only improper, but also against the established norms and procedures. He also claimed, “Any new ordinance, statute or syllabus is implemented by a university only after its approval by the Bihar State Higher Education Council and the governor. But this norm has been blatantly violated by JPU and its statutory bodies.” Meanwhile, Choudhary directed the education department to gather all information regarding changes in syllabi of various courses in recent years from all the universities. “If any discrepancy is found, the state government will take immediate action,” he said. A few years ago the syllabi of all PG courses running in different universities were revised in light of the choice based credit system by committees of experts constituted by the governor’s secretariat. The universities were later authorized to make some changes in the uniform syllabi as per local requirements. So far as the present case is concerned, academics pointed out that the university-level syllabus committee acted arbitrarily and removed not only the texts related to JP and Lohia, but also the ideas and thoughts of great freedom fighters and social reformers like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Raja Ram Mohan Roy, and Dayanand Saraswati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-takes-steps-to-correct-jpu-syllabus/articleshow/85877075.cms||B K Mishra

The crime branch chased the accused for over 60 km before catching them. The arrested accused have been identified as Syed Faisal (24) of Rehmaniya and Syed Aref (24) of Roshan Gate. The probe has revealed that the accused, who are employed with a mobile repair shop in the city, decided to steal the car and sell it in Mumbai, to repay the loan of Rs 7,000. Police said on Wednesday afternoon, the accused men reached out to Vaishnavi Motors, a firm dealing in used vehicles, and expressed their desire to purchase a car. After much negotiation, they requested for a trial of the car shortlisted to be purchased. Accordingly, the owner of the firm sent his employee, Rohan Ingle, with the duo for a test drive before the final deal. Police said soon after they left the firm’s premises, the duo changed their shirts. Aref started driving the car in a suspicious manner, while Faisal allegedly held a sharp-edged weapon against Ingle’s neck and asked him to inform his employer to pay them Rs 1.5 lakh to get the car back. Meanwhile, Ingle started receiving calls from his owner, but the accused did not allow him to take the calls. They dropped him ahead of the Baba petrol pump chowk, before speeding away towards the Mumbai highway. Soon after stepping out of the car, Ingle alerted his employer, who informed the police. Jinsi police, along with the crime branch team led by inspector Avinash Aghav, sent out different teams to identify and nab the suspects. One of the teams found that the suspects had left a two-wheeler outside the firm. The police used the vehicle’s registration number to track down their families and reached out to them. Gathering information from the families, including their cell phone numbers, a team led by police sub-inspector Datta Shelke tailed the suspects for over 60 km, before nabbing them on Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-steal-car-during-test-drive-to-pay-off-rs-7000-loan-held/articleshow/85876835.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It has been asked to file its reply within 15 days, explaining why it must not be closed and why the consent to operate (CTO) must not be revoked under Section 33-A of the Water Act of 1974. The pollution control board has detected a hidden underground pipeline used for illegally discharging the waste chemical-laced water into the rivulet, which further polluted the areas falling in its vicinity in Zirakpur and Derabassi before falling into the Ghaggar River.Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said, “We detected the chemical discharge into the rivulet, which turned the water red. The PPCB, in collaboration with the HSPCB, after an inquiry found that a paper mill in the Industrial Area of Panchkula was the culprit. HSPCB has informed us that a show-cause notice for closure has been issued and we have also given directions to the Mohali PPCB to coordinate with its Haryana counterpart to ensure the closure as per the environmental laws.”After the discharge in the rivulet was detected, a team headed by assistant environmental engineer Rantej Sharma of PPCB, under the supervision of executive engineer, environment, Lavneet Dubey, conducted the probe with the HSPCB officials, who collected the samples for analysis.The inquiry found that to hide the illegal discharge, the paper mill had fixed an underground pipeline, which was connected to the stormwater drain directly.The notice said the paper mill was allowed zero liquid discharge, but it was violating the law by discharging untreated effluents by bypassing the system.

Now, online payment facilities are available not only with big shopping malls but also roadside hawkers. Schools are conducting classes online and even nursery kids have got accustomed to it. There is no need to visit government offices and banks for every small work as most of them can be done online with One Time Password (OTP). Sandhya Deotale, a housewife, said that she no longer carries cash to even vegetable markets. “Most vegetable vendors have displayed QR code and I make payments through mobile,” she said. During the early phase of the pandemic, online transactions through mobile phones were encouraged as a means to maintain ‘physical distancing’ and avoid spread of virus through currency notes. Gradually, people realized that virus doesn’t spread through currency notes or newspapers. But online payments have continued. Even after ‘Break the Chain’ orders in Maharashtra, many have continued to rely on online mode of payments. A report by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD) stated that Covid-19 has triggered a turning point in digital life and e-commerce. “In years to come, we will look back at 2020 as the moment that changed everything. Nowhere else has unprecedented and unforeseen growth occurred as in the digital and e-commerce sectors, which have boomed amid the Covid-19 crisis,” reads the introduction of the report. In the last one year, even land deals, property registration and updating Aadhaar have been done online like never before. Retired government servant Dhanraj Raut said as a pensioner, it was a routine for him to visit banks every November to produce the life certificate which is necessary for continuation of pension. “This year, government launched Jeevan Pramaan platform where I got the certificate digitally without visiting the bank,” he said. Online schools and examinations have become part of life for students as well as parents. “Not only studies and exams, but students are participating in extra-curricular activities by recording their videos. We have conducted singing competition and art camps online this year,” said Vijay Katkar, an art teacher. Work from home (WFH) has continued for almost two years. Many companies have also allowed their employees to WFH for a considerably longer period. “WFH has its own benefits both for companies and employees. Many companies have been thinking about hybrid work pattern for years. But the pandemic has given an opportunity to implement it,” said HR professional Shital Dalal. According to her, the new online work pattern will continue as an option. # E-way of life for all- Businesses and consumers increased digital working in the last 2 years - E-commerce allowed even during lockdown in most parts of the state - A UN survey found that 28% of its informants in India now prefer online to physical shopping- Even small businesses and hawkers now accepting digital payments- Government encouraging digital transactions through IMPS, RTGS, mandatory FastTag etc - Schools conducting 2020-21 session completely online - Many companies extend work from home for next two years||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pandemic-boosted-e-transactions-in-a-way-even-demonetization-couldnt/articleshow/85874606.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Have you seen the condition?” asked a bench of Justice S S Shinde and Nijamoodin Jamadar when prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde opposed Nirmala Kumari’s petition saying she is taken for treatment to Tata Memorial Hospital and can move about. The plea by the Gadchiroli bl-ast accused, who is at Byculla prison, says she suffers from multiple skeletal metastases (cancer) and she also has stage 4 breast cancer. “The fact is, she’s dying. She is developing ancillary diseases inside jail...” her advocate Payoshi Roy said.

---||Ahmedabad||IIM-Ahmedabad withdraws prof’s removal order||AHMEDABAD: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on Thursday told the Gujarat high court that it would hold a fresh inquiry and give sufficient opportunity to its former faculty member, Manish Aggarwal, who had put in his papers last year after the institute initiated an inquiry into charges of financial irregularities levied against him. As IIM-A insisted on conducting the inquiry during the period of lockdown, the high court criticised the institute’s hurried approach. The HC questioned the institute on the urgency that drove it to carry out the inquiry during the lockdown. The court was not satisfied with the institute’s reply that it had granted three opportunities to Aggarwal to explain himself through video-conferencing. Following HC questioning, IIM-A submitted in the court that it would conduct a fresh inquiry. It also said that it would withdraw show-cause notices issued to Aggrawal in October 2019 along with the inquiry report and order of removing him from the service. The institute has also withdrawn the order imposing 400% penalty on Aggarwal. Following the statement made by the institute, the high court disposed Aggarwal’s petition by directing the institute to grant sufficient hearing opportunity to him and complete the process within two months. Aggarwal is at present in Rajasthan and his advocate expressed apprehension that IIM-A would not call him in person and might ask him to tender his explanation through online mode only. Aggarwal approached the court last year after the institute passed an order to remove him after holding an inquiry, which he had asserted was not maintainable. He resigned the day after he was asked to appear before the inquiry committee. The committee went ahead with the inquiry and tendered its report on April 29, 2020 and the institute passed the order of his removal on April 30. On June 1, the institute passed the penalty order. Aggarwal was accused of financial irregularities by claiming more amount than the actual expenditure incurred on his tours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iim-a-withdraws-profs-removal-order/articleshow/85879572.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Drainage capacity key to Mumbai’s battle against climate change||MUMBAI: Can large parts of Mumbai be saved from being submerged by 2050? With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on sea level rise ringing alarm bells, experts are asking the BMC to revisit the city’s Development Plan – 2034 to review infrastructure expansion along the coast. Certain parts of the plan are still in the process of being finalised. “If the city is going to go under 3feet of water by 2050, the Development Plan must be reviewed from the point of hydrology and upgradation of the BRIMSTOWAD storm water drain project,” said Pankaj Joshi, architect, and principal director Urban Center Mumbai (Urban Planning and Design think tank). TimesViewMumbai is largely battling a host of climatic factors that are beyond its control. The only option before it is to control the course and pace of development within its limits. The problem with political and bureaucratic decision-making is that it is focused on the near term. Electoral compulsions and lack of accountability prompt administrators and elected representatives to push their immediate agendas at the expense of long-term goals. We have the answers, but do we have the will to save the city for future generations?Joshi said the city is already witnessing extreme rainfall events, and as their frequency increases, it is the lowly roadside gutter and the open spaces that will be crucial in saving Mumbai from going under. BMC will also need to review what may be permitted to be put up in basements where there are not just car parks but diesel gensets, sewage treatment plants, etc, he said. Based on a published study, net sea level rise off Mumbai is expected to be 0.74 mm per year. Post the July 2005 floods, the Chitale committee had hence recommended increasing discharge capacity of gutters from 25mm/hour to 50mm/hour. But this has still not been fully achieved. Not more than 30% of drains have been re-engineered to increase capacity. This backlog must weigh on the minds of administrators, especially after BMC chief Iqbal Chahal’s dire warning at the launch of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan website last week that by 2050, 80% of Nariman Point and Mantralaya and around 70% of the A, B, C, D civic wards will be submerged due to sea level rise. To compound matters, the city has big ticket infrastructure projects underway or proposed along the coast. The most significant are the coastal road, the underground Metro Line 3, the 300-acre central park at Nariman Point, and the revamp and remodelling of the Mumbai Port Trust lands. Professor Kapil Gupta, department of civil engineering, IIT Bombay, who was in the review team for the IPCC chapter on sea level rise, said, “It is important the civic body carry out several modelling studies to understand how much sea level rise will happen every five years and where the submergence will occur, whether the underground metro will flood. It must involve institutes like Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Studies, National Institute of Oceanography that do such studies.” Gupta who was also part of BMC’s flood guidelines committee said the drains must be reviewed for increasing intensities of rainfall in short duration. Regarding the 300-acre central park at Nariman Point, Joshi said ideally reclamation must be avoided and considering that the majority of the population now lives in the far north the BMC must assess if it is required. Environmentalist Debi Goenka said even a simple issue of toilets backing up because of sea level rise would make most buildings along the coast inhabitable. Joshi said New York, London, Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo have already started rejigging infrastructure for rising sea levels. Open spaces are being used as holding ponds and Mumbai, he said, needs to urgently deconcretise. “Buildings will need to be redesigned so that habitable areas move three levels up. In Hong Kong, they are working on interconnecting buildings at level one and two so that if the road is submerged you can still be mobile,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drainage-capacity-key-to-citys-battle-against-climate-change/articleshow/85881962.cms||Clara Lewis

The court has fixed September 7 as the next date for recording of statements of the accused in this case. Talking to TOI, district government counsel (criminal), Prayagraj, Gulab Chand Agrahari said, “The plea of the jailed MP’s lawyer demanding further investigation in his case was rejected by the MP-MLA court. The defence lawyer had submitted an application under section 173(8) CrPC, demanding further investigation in the rape case. During hearing on this application on August 27, I had strongly opposed it stating that they don’t have any locus standi, as after filing of the chargesheet in any case only police can seek permission for further investigation. Finally, the court rejected the plea.” “Earlier, the complainant and her companion, who was also the prime witness in the rape case against Rai, had got their statements recorded before the MP-MLA court,” said Agrahari, adding, “Apart from them, statements of other witnesses including former station officer of Varanasi’s Lanka police station Bharat Bhushan Tiwari, investigation officer and sub-inspector RC Pandey, head constable Raghav Rai, Dr Rashmi Gupta, constable Priti Rawat, Amit Srivastava and Shiv Kumar Gaud and the security guard of the apartment where the alleged incident took place had also been recorded before this court.”  On May 1, 2019, the Ballia woman complainant and former student leader of a college in Varanasi had lodged a rape case against Rai with Lanka police in Varanasi, alleging that on March 7, 2018, he had raped her after calling her to his apartment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/court-rejects-rape-accused-bsp-mps-plea-for-a-further-probe/articleshow/85883426.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Social activists from the Bhrashtachar Virodhi Janshakti party have written to Ravikant Adsul, the deputy commissioner of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, to stop the construction activities immediately. Sushil Bhandigare, a social activist, said, “Several construction activities are taking place over the hill illegally. A notice has been issued to the people who are carrying out the construction activities but still the constructions are ongoing. KMC deputy commissioner has assured us of looking into the matter.” Vijay Chavan, the conservation assistant with the ASI, said, “I had given notice to these people, who have started construction activities at Bramhapuri in April this year after which the work was stopped for two to three months. Now again, they have resumed their construction work. I have given a second notice to them recently and now it's the work of KMC to take action against these site owners, who are carrying out construction work without the permission of the ASI.” Bramhapuri hill has historical significance. Several historical relics and artefacts like Greek god idols, elephant statues, vessels, coins were found in the excavation here in 1945 and 1946, which were dated back to the 2nd century. These are kept at the museum in the Town Hall garden, said Vijay Chavan. Apart from Bramhapuri hill, Panhala, Khidrapur Kopeshwar temple and Pohale caves are also under the ASI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/construction-at-bramhapuri-without-asi-permission/articleshow/85876893.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||How Delhi’s coaching institutes are gearing up to face testing times||NEW DELHI: Manoj Mathur and his daughter were among the few who visited the lanes of Kalu Sarai — a coaching hub in south Delhi — on Thursday. After getting to know that the coaching institutes had been given permission to start physical classes, Mathur wanted his daughter to begin studying for the engineering Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). They discovered that the institute they had selected would reopen in another few weeks. However, many others in the neighbourhood had commenced offline classes with small batches of students. Delhi government had recently allowed coaching institutes to reopen from September 1. Mathur, a resident of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, said, “We have taken a room very close to the coaching institute because my daughter wants to attend classes in person. We will wait till the institute begins operations.” His daughter wanted to take admission in FIITJEE. She has dropped a year so that she can prepare and appear for the JEE, as she is eyeing entry into one of the Indian Institutes of Technology. Narayana, Takshila Institute and a few other coaching centres resumed physical classes from Thursday. At Takshila, four students came for classes. They were mostly students who had dropped a year to prepare for JEE and NEET. The coaching institute has taken extra rooms to ensure that only 15-20 students sit in a class. Batch timings have also been staggered. Shweta Arora, branch head of Takshila, said, “We collect consent forms from parents before allowing students to attend physical classes. As we are part of the government-empanelled scheme, beneficiaries of Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Yojna will also attend physical classes.” At Narayana earlier, a batch used to have 45 students, but for now each batch will accommodate a maximum of 25 to meet social distancing norms. Due to the lockdown, many institutes in the area have permanently pulled down the shutters. Some buildings have also put up ‘To Let’ boards. However, with this gradual opening, bookshop owners and food stall owners are hopeful of business picking up anew. Anuj Kumar Jain, owner of Arihant Book Depot, which has been in business in Kalu Sarai for two decades, said, “It has been a very difficult time for us because we were dependent on the students who come to the coaching centre nearby. Now that the centre has been allowed to reopen, we hope our business too will perk up. But we are also hearing that some coaching institutes are comfortable with online classes because then they save a lot on running costs.” Some bigger coaching institutes, such as Aakash Educational Services, also commenced physical classes on Thursday. The classes were, however, held only to clear students’ doubts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-citys-coaching-institutes-are-gearing-up-to-face-testing-times/articleshow/85879593.cms||Shradha Chettri

He said the BJP government announced a “clearance sale” of the assets as the country was not important to it. Addressing a press conference at the Gujarat Congress state headquarters, Khera said the Centre’s plan to sell or lease out public infrastructure would create a monopoly in key sectors, something the previous Congress-led governments always avoided. “If we do not stop them now, an entire generation will be destroyed. Before coming to power in 2014, the BJP used to ask what the Congress did in the last 70 years. The answer is the list of assets which you are now selling. While we built India in those 70 years, BJP is now busy selling India,” he said. “There is a difference between the previous Congress governments and the BJP dispensation. A sensible government always takes care that strategic sectors do not slip into the hands of a few. No sensible government encourages a monopoly. “For the BJP government, the country is not important. They just think about votes and making BJP the world’s richest party,” he said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had recently unveiled the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), which is to raise Rs 6 lakh crore, and will look to unlock value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors — from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums. As many as 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports, 40 railway stations, 15 railway stadiums and an unknown number of railway colonies have been identified for private investment. “The government has announced a clearance sale of the country’s assets and they are now claiming that they are giving these assets on lease. Those who buy them will get loans from banks. That means our assets will be purchased using our own money and then they will return those assets back after extracting everything,” he added. Without taking names, Khera said the scheme will only fill up the pockets of select industrialists who are an example of BJP’s “crony capitalism” system. “The time has come to seek answers. Assets worth Rs 60 lakh crore are being given to a select few for just Rs 6 lakh crore, which will also given to them by the BJP government,” said Khera. He said that although the Modi government has so far collected Rs 23 lakh crore through high taxes on fuel, the money was not spent on any pro-people work. On the issue of communal polarisation, the senior Congress leader accused the BJP of diverting the attention of people from key issues by raising communal points. He said the BJP was creating “fault lines” between communities to stay in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-selling-what-congress-created-in-70-years-khera/articleshow/85879633.cms||---

This can only be achieved when mobile connectivity and Internet link improve and online infrastructure strengthened. When so much is being talked about digital revolution, Sare village in Badgaon panchayat, 15km from Lake City, has a different story to tell. In absence of a mobile network, villagers have to climb a 900-feet high hill to fetch an OTP (one time password) for securing the monthly ration they are entitled for. According to Bahadur Singh Bhati, a resident of Sare village, the date of ration distribution every month is a concern for people of this village. The beneficiaries have to move from one hill to another to fetch the OTP for the POS machine. The ordeal intensifies when the network fails and another attempt is made by climbing on the neighboring hill. The village is not too far away from the city limits. Villagers have been facing this problem for a long time. Fetching OTP for authentication to get ration is just one of the concerns. This problem is for the students, too. In absence of connectivity, the students are not able to attend online classes. Many children have not gone to school for more than 18 months. Students of other villages are attending classes online, but those from this village are completely deprived of education in absence of connectivity. Pratap Singh Rathore, deputy pradhan of Badgaon panchayat, said issue had been brought to the notice of administration. Ration dealer Kishan Singh Bhati said, “I have to keep a person on the hill for fetching OTP while others help in ration distribution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/villagers-climb-900ft-hill-to-get-ration-otp/articleshow/85882003.cms||---

In the meeting, Tanveer Singh Krishnawat and Laxmansingh Jhala of Nathdwara unit urged the members of the Mahasabha to stand united against Kataria.Krishnawat said in the meeting that because of the pandemic, the agitation against Kataria was kept on hold. During this period, Kataria had lodged several baseless complaints against the Rajput leaders. The committee alleged that Kataria is against the Rajputs. If he is not expelled from the party, BJP will have to face serious consequences. On Kataria’s comment regarding not including Randhir Singh Bhinder in BJP, the leaders of the Mahasabha said that all Rajputs are with Bhinder. The committee alleged that Kataria’s motive is to go against the Rajputs but this time, the Kshatriyas will not remain quiet. We will not forgive Kataria, added Tanveer Singh. The ‘maha akrosh rally’ which was kept on hold due to Covid protocol has once again been ignited and will turn into a ‘Swabhimaan rally.’In the meeting, it was decided that the agitation against Kataria will continue till he is expelled from the party.

On Wednesday, cabinet ministers led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and requested him to clear 12 names to be nominated to legislative council through Governor’s quota. NCP has suggested Shetti’s name on it’s behalf. Pawar himself had recommended Shetti’s nomination instead of any other person from the outfit. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, after meeting Koshyari, said that the Guv has raised objections over the nominations of those who have lost the elections recently. Shetti, two-time MP, had lost 2019 Lok Sabha election. “Before 2019 Lok Sabha polls, we had come to an agreement that Congress will leave one Lok Sabha seat for SSS and NCP will leave an MLC seat. Since June 2019, I have not spoken to anyone about the promise they made. Pawar suggested my name to counter Bharatiya Janata Party.” He added that getting nominated or not “is a non-issue for me. It should be a concern for NCP.” Shetti along with hundreds of flood affected farmers are marching through villages along Panchganga river. His ‘Panchaganga Parikrama’ entered second day. On fifth day Shetti along with farmers are going to take ‘Jal Samadhi’ at Narsinhawadi. Shetti said since the start of the march, no one from government has approached them to stop the march. “We have demanded loan waiver for flood affected farmers. We raised issues ten days ago. However, I have not heard a word from the government so far,” said Shetti. Since the start of the march, Shetti and flood affected farmers covered around 40 km distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/getting-mlc-seat-is-ncps-concern-says-raju-shetti/articleshow/85876948.cms||---

The coast guard has carried out an aerial survey to identify the barge. Drones are also being used to identify the flat-bottomed boat, said Patil. Preliminary probe by police suggest there was no crew onboard and the barge was drifting. What caught the attention of the fishermen is that the barge did not have any identification (an Indian national flag for instance) or markings mandated by the Maharashtra Maritime Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-unidentified-barge-sighted-off-vasai-coast/articleshow/85882014.cms||---

The team has been asked to submit its report within a week. The SIT will be headed by infrastructure and industrial development commissioner Sanjiv Mittal and have as members additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, ADG Meerut Rajiv Sabharwal and chief town country planner Anoop Kumar Srivastava. As per directions of Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath, the SIT has been tasked with fixing the responsibility of the builder and officials of Noida Authority in the matter. “In the matter of Messers Super Tech which was allocated group housing plot no GH-4 in Sector 93A Noida, in which the Supreme Court has observed that there was collusion between the builder and officers of Noida Authority, an SIT is being constituted,” the government order says. In its order dated August 31, 2021, a two-member Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah, while giving their verdict in a special leave petition, said: “The record of this case is replete with instances which highlight the collusion between the officers of Noida with the appellant and its management.” It has directed that both towers are demolished within three months, at the cost of the builder but under the supervision of the Noida Authority. A government official said that on Wednesday, the CM had said that the case dated back to 2004 and the responsibility of all officials in the matter between 2004 and 2017 had to be fixed. “Strict action will follow as soon as the SIT submits its report. Mukesh Goyal, a manager, who was transferred from Noida Authority last month has been suspended already,” the official said. As per the Noida Authority, the towers for which demolition orders have been issued are T-16 and T-17, constructed on a 54,815 sq mt plot. The allotment of the plot and sanctioning of the map was done between 2004 and 2012. The resident welfare association of the society filed a writ petition before the Allahabad high court on December 10, 2012, alleging that the builder had flouted the National Building Code-2005 and NOIDA building rule-2010 by not ensuring the minimum distance between the two towers. On April 11, 2014, the Allahabad High Court ordered demolition of the two towers and action against the builders but an SLP was filed in the Supreme Court which then passed a stay order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/suprtech-row-up-sets-up-4-member-sit-to-probe-noida-officials-builder-collusion/articleshow/85883439.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The accused, Zeel Vaghasiya, a student of Bachelors of Business Administration (BBA), had driven through the apartment campus to avoid road traffic when he knocked down Sanvar Jain who was playing there. It took over 10 days for police to confirm involvement of Vaghasiya since he was denying having knowledge about knocking down any child. Preliminary postmortem of the child’s body revealed that the boy died after his head banged on some solid surface. Vaghasiya, a property broker’s son, was booked for rash driving, negligent act endangering human life, grievous hurt due to negligent act and causing death by negligence. He was released on bail. Vaghasiya was going home on August 19 in his white car. There was a heavy traffic jam on the road around Surya Prakash apartment. “The apartment has two gates, and to cross the traffic jam through an alternate route, Vaghasiya entered from one gate and left from another,” said a police officer. While crossing the campus, his car passed near the club house where children were playing. “While taking a turn, the left side body of the car knocked down the boy and Vaghasiya did not realize the accident. The boy suffered injury as his head smashed on the floor and he started bleeding,” said KI Modi, police inspector, Umra police station. “A resident of the apartment came to the campus after buying cigarettes. He parked his car in the parking lot and was told by residents that a boy had suffered injuries. Within seconds, he again took out his car to take Sanvar to hospital. In these 33 seconds only, Vaghasiya’s car entered the apartment and left,” said police. No other CCTV cameras in the campus except those at the gates were not functional due to renovation work. Police recovered footage of the cameras and examined it in detail to find out the exact movement of vehicles. Alert kids gave first clue Children of Surya Prakash Residency were first to inform cops that Sanvar Jain was knocked by a white car. Sources in police informed that security guards were also not aware of how the accident happened but Sanvar’s friends, who were playing with him, noticed the car leaving. It was a blind case for cops to crack but some alert children’s initial information helped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bba-student-arrested-for-knocking-to-death-three-year-old-boy/articleshow/85876993.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Can Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab overrule ST board?’||MUMBAI: Hearing allegations of tweaking of MSRTC conditions by state transport minister Anil Parab to favour a contractor in an e-ticketing machine tender process, the Lokayukta, Justice V M Kanade, asked the state to explain if a minister had powers to overrule a decision of the MSRTC board, said sources. BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha had alleged that Parab, who is also the chairman of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), had tweaked the tender conditions passed by the MSRTC board. He had alleged that Parab did it to favour a private contractor from Ahmedabad. Parab said the allegations were an attempt to tarnish his image. “The tender was just opened, but contract has not been awarded to anyone so far. Both financial and technical bids have not been opened, and so how can anyone say that I want to favour someone for this contract? It is a false and malicious allegation made with the intention of defaming me,” he said. In May, Kotecha had approached governor B S Koshyari with the complaint. The governor forwarded his complaint letter to the Lokayukta. “On July 24, 2020, the MSRTC board had proposed a new tender for ticketing machines from 2021. The file gathered dust for seven months. Finally in February, when the file went to the minister’s office, the tender conditions were tweaked, which included reducing annual turnover of bidder from Rs 150 crore to Rs 100 crore, reducing minimum past experience of handling 3,850 ticketing machines to 100 machines, removing clause of previous experience of online reservation among other conditions,” Kotecha said. Sources said that on Wednesday additional chief secretary (transport) Ashish Kumar Singh filed a letter before the Lokayukta that financial and technical bids had not been opened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-minister-parab-overrule-st-board/articleshow/85882044.cms||Somit Sen

---||Chandigarh||Online mode drove medical education off track: Study||Chandigarh: Almost half of the medical students, 46.42%, have lost interest in medicine after suspension of physical classes during the Covid lockdown, says a study conducted by a few medical students from Chandigarh and other states.A team of doctors, Dr Arshi Syal, Dr Yajur Arya and Dr Monica Gupta of the department of general medicine, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh conducted a study to ascertain the effect of the pandemic on undergraduate medical education. According to the study, which has been published in Indian Journal of Medical Sciences, almost half (46.42%) of the students reported decreased interest in medicine after suspension of hands-on teaching or practical classes.A total of 136 respondents (69.38%) felt that they became less productive in studies during the pandemic. Approximately 74% respondents felt less motivated to study at home. More than two-thirds of the respondents felt that on graduation, their clinical skills would be inferior to those of students who graduated during the “non-Covid” era. About 84.69% students believed that their examinations should be postponed, hoping to get appropriate clinical experience once the situation normalised.A total of 400 medical students were sent the online questionnaire by email, of whom 196 medical students responded. A total of 84 students were residing in hostels (42.85%) on the college campus, while the rest were day scholars. Only 22.44% (44) of respondents found video lectures to be better than classroom teaching while 98 respondents (50%) felt that they were still acclimatising to the new method of learning through online classes. Almost three quarters of students felt that their motivation to study had decreased as their curriculum shifted from in person to online. The study aimed at highlighting that the Covid pandemic had a dramatic effect on undergraduate medical education all over the world and this effect was most noteworthy on medical students as clinical orientation and hands-on training are crucial for development of basic medical skills. BOX: ConclusionMost of the students felt less motivated and less productive amid the transition. A major area that has been compromised is that of clinical skills training, a crucial adjunct to theoretical teaching in medical schools. Almost all students believe that their clinical skills in the long-term would remain inferior to those who graduated before the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/online-mode-drove-medical-education-off-track-study/articleshow/85879671.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Sambhajiraje, along with MPs of BJP, NCP, Shiv Sena, and a Congress MLA met the President on Thursday at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. Sambhajiraje said the President heard each of the representatives patiently for 20 to 25 minutes and sought time to study the issues raised by the delegation. The primary concern of the delegation was the Maratha reservation, which had earlier been quashed by the Supreme Court. Speaking to media in New Delhi, Sambhajiraje said: “Recently, Parliament passed the law allowing states to grant reservations. But the states cannot exercise the right if the cap on reservation continues to be 50%, as per the SC judgment in the Indira Sawhney case. Also, the judgment says that reservations can be given only to those living in far-flung and remote areas. With such conditions, the states are unable to grant reservations to the ailing communities. We brought these issues to the notice of the President, who said he would study the matter.” In the petition submitted, the delegation requested the President to exercise powers vested upon him under provisions of the Constitution of India to give justice to all the communities demanding reservation. “Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj implemented reservation for the first time in the country, and had given reservation to the Marathas as well. The reservation continued till 1967. Recently, the SC called the Marathas the dominating class. The state can form a fresh commission and fix the social backwardness of the Maratha community,” said Sambhajiraje. Sambhajiraje said many states, such as Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh, have reservations above 50% and on similar lines, the states should be allowed to expand the reservation policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-meets-prez-with-request-to-lift-quota-cap/articleshow/85877024.cms||---

They also burnt the effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A march was taken out from the Youth Congress office to the Collectorate Circle raising slogans against the continuous hike of LPG gas cylinders denting the family budgets. Rajasthan Youth Congress general secretary Dushyant Raj Singh Chundawat, general secretary Ayush Bhardwaj, Rajasthan University Students Union president Pooja Verma, former General Secretary Jagdish Chaudhary and many leaders took part in the protest. Youth Congress General Secretary Dushyant Raj Singh Chundawat and Ayush Bhardwaj have alleged that the price of LPG has been increased by Rs 294 in 13 months. On July 1, 2020, in Jaipur, where LPG cylinder was available for Rs 594.50, its price has increased by Rs 294 in just 13 months, the direct effect of such increase is on the common man. The rate of 14.2 kg domestic gas cylinder has been increased by Rs 25 costing it now Rs 889 while the rate of commercial 19 kg gas cylinder has also been increased by Rs 75 price touching Rs 1715. Apart from this, subsidies have also been removed on domestic gas cylinders. First demonetisation, then GST and now in the time of Corona, this is the attack of the Modi government on the interests of the people who have lost their savings.  The Narendra Modi government at the Centre came to power with the slogan 'Bahut Hui Inflation Ki Maar, Abki Baar Modi Sarkar'. When a gas cylinder price was only Rs 414 during the time of the UPA government. But now the rate of LPG cylinder has increased up by three times of UPA but the BJP government is not bothered. Youth Congress leaders demanded roll back of the increased rate on LPG. They said, economists are of the opinion that even if Re 1 is increased on petrol and diesel, then the burden on the people of Rs 1000 a month increases. Despite this, the tax on petrol was increased by 260 percent and an 850 per cent excise duty hike on diesel alone. Now the rate of LPG cylinders has also been continuously increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/youth-cong-protests-against-hike-in-lpg-cylinder-price/articleshow/85882077.cms||---

Discussions were held about the final-year students whose courses constitute practicals, who could be called from next week, and that the reopening could take place in a graded manner. The meeting was held by the university with the heads of departments and the principals of the colleges. SP Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, said, “A meeting was held but there was no concrete decision taken. With most of the students from outside Delhi, there are a lot of things we have to keep in mind. What if we call the students and there is a third wave, are we going to ask them to go back? The university has asked colleges to plan at each level like opening up labs and libraries, and we have already been doing that.” Another principal added that it will take some time before the university takes a final decision. “There were discussions that third-year students of courses that have practicals and require labs can be called. However, it will be voluntary and entirely up to the students,” said Rajesh Giri. The university asked the colleges to broadly follow the SOP given by DDMA of 50% capacity. “College principals, teachers are all keen to reopen the colleges. The university has left it to the colleges to take a final decision on how we want it to reopen. But it has asked us to check that the students coming to the colleges are vaccinated with at least one dose,” said Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College. However, different student organisations have been protesting for the past few days demanding that the university be reopened now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-still-undecided-on-reopening/articleshow/85879737.cms||---

---||Surat||Mobile phone addiction claims two lives in Gujarat||SURAT: Extreme fallouts of mobile addiction led to murder of a man by his son, while another teenager took her own life in two separate cases reported on Thursday. While the police detained a 17-year-old boy on Thursday for allegedly killing his 40-year-old labourer father in a fit of rage over being scolded for playing too much on the phone in Kawas village of Hazira, a 16-year-old girl in Surat’s Ved Road killed herself after her parents refused to hand over her mobile phone as they thought she wasted time on it ignoring her studies. Shockingly the boy even attempted to cover his sinister act by trying to pass it off as an accident that his father met with by falling on the bathroom floor. However, the postmortem revealed that the man had died from strangulation. The boy revealed to police that his father often reprimanded him for wasting time playing games on mobile phone. On Tuesday, the berating took a turn for the worse when the frustrated boy strangled his father in a fit of rage to death. Family members who found him lying unconscious in the evening took him to a hospital where he was declared dead. Police sent the body for postmortem. “The son told a family member that he found his father in the bathroom. Initially family members believed the man could have died due to injury that he sustained after falling on the floor,” said a police officer at Ichhapore police station. During postmortem, doctors, however, found marks on the neck and established that he died of strangulation. During questioning, the teenager confessed to his crime. “The accused was neglecting his studies and spent most of his time over mobile phone. He confessed that his addiction often led to massive father-son arguments and on Tuesday, it turned ugly and the boy killed his father out of blind rage,” said the police. Khushbu Upadhyay, a student of Class XI, was found hanging in a room at her home on Ved Road on Tuesday. Her family members, who were away at work when she took the extreme step, told the police that the girl was upset since they confiscated her mobile phone as she spent a lot of time on it. Her father, an auto rickshaw driver, said his daughter had heated arguments with her family members over the mobile phone issue before she ended her life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mobile-phone-addiction-claims-two-lives-in-state/articleshow/85877044.cms||---

Also, the average rainfall of the state is still 8.8% less compared to what it was received till September 2, 2020. Jaipur Met office stated that till September 15 south west monsoon will bring widespread rainfall activity. The figures of the monsoon on average rainfall in various parts of the state suggested that 13 districts in the state are still in the category of the deficit rainfall. District collectors in the affected districts have also been told to make a contingency plan for the drought or drought like situation. “The districts including Banswara, Barmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Dungarpur, Sriganganagar, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Jodhpur, Pali, Rajsamand and Udaipur are still in the category of deficit rainfall. As monsoon is in the last spell it is very difficult to expect it is going to cover this deficit in these districts. This year so far only second spell had a plentiful spell and in other spells scattered rainfall was only witnessed,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Also the average rainfall of the state is 8.8% lesser compared to what it was till September 2, 2020. “In the year 2020 the average rainfall till September 2 was 449.50 mm but this year so far it has been 409.83 mm. Sriganganagar district has received a rainfall of 74 mm so far in this season which is very low while Baran received rainfall of 1074.90 mm which is highest in the state. As far as state capital Jaipur is concerned the city so far has received a rainfall of 455.21 mm which is 3.7% higher compared to 439.10 mm it received till September 2, 2020. “Jaipur is in the category of normal rainfall and the ongoing conditions suggest that it is not going to get a deficit rainfall,” said an officer. However, Bisalpur dam is a cause of concern in terms of the drinking water supply. “It has still reached at 358.10 RL/meter against the full capacity of 1095.84 RL/meter and is merely 32 % filled,” an officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/avg-rainfall-9-less-this-yr-as-compared-to-2020/articleshow/85882088.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Mumbai||Civic panel slams BMC over ‘incomplete’ GMLR flyover||MUMBAI: Members of the civ-ic standing committee and corporators across party lines on Thursday slammed the BMC for the death of a pillion rider on the newly inaugurated ‘inc-omplete’ Ghatkopar-Mankhu-rd Link Road flyover (GMLR). If BMC could spend almost Rs 600 crore on the construction of the flyover, it should have also placed CCTV cameras to monitor the speed of vehicles, said corporators. Questions were also raised on why works like placing rumbler strips, speed breakers and CCTV cameras were not taken up prior to the August 1 inauguration. Shiv Sena and Congress demanded that henceforth, CCTV cameras should be placed on all new flyovers and the clause should be included in the tender itself. BJP party leader in the BMC Prabhakar Shinde, who raised the issue in the standing committee meeting, said on the inauguration day itself, the chief minister had pointed out the need to fix the surface of the flyover. “I have written several letters to the BMC, but there was no reply and no action....It has taken BMC a month almost to begin the works.” Nominated corporator Balchandra Shirsat from BJP pointed out: “Since the inauguration, there have been multiple accidents on the flyover as the mastic asphalt laid on the surface makes it slippery for bikers.” Sena party leader in the BMC Vishakha Raut said: “I suggested that CCTV cameras be placed on new flyovers and the footage be shared with traffic police. This could be part of the tender itself.” On Wednesday, civic officials had said that CCTV cameras, speed-breakers, rumbler strips on both sides of GMLR flyover, speed sensors and milling works will be carried out to make the surface rough, but opposition party leader in the BMC Ravi Raja of Congress said there is no point in proposing works now. “A trial run should have been taken up before opening up the flyover for motorists. Now, the works will inconvenience motorists,” he said. Activists said the entire purpose of the GMLR flyover has been defeated as heavy vehicles are not allowed to ply on it for a month and now even two-wheelers have been barred. Activist Anil Galgali said it should have been inaugurated after all works were completed. Satish Thosar, chief engineer of the civic bridges department, said, “We have begun milling works on the north-bound direction and it should be completed shortly after which milling works will be taken up on the south-bound direction of the flyover. We are placing speed breakers at every 500m distance where there are light poles... We plan to complete the works and open up the entire flyover as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-panel-slams-bmc-over-incomplete-gmlr-flyover/articleshow/85882113.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wasteful use may water down 24x7 dream||NEW DELHI: There is an ambitious project to give Delhiites 24x7 supply of tap water. But any progress towards this has to factor in the large gap in the supply of raw water and the demand as well as the injudicious use of water by the citizens. Delhi Jal Board officials are concerned about the very high water consumption patterns in some of the pilot areas where tap water supply has gone 24x7. DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha reviewed the water consumption patterns and supply cycles in the pilot areas last week. He later tweeted that he and DJB officials had met residents of Shanti Niketan, Anand Niketan and Westend to study the water consumption patterns of the residents. These localities currently have always-on water supply. “Very useful insights!” Chadha said in the tweet. A DJB official disclosed that per capita water consumption in some pilot areas like Westend was objectionably high with some households where the per person consumption was as much as 1,100 litres per capita per day (LPCD). “When water is supplied 24x7 and there is no need for overhead storage so minimising leakages in the supply system, the per capita consumption should actually go down,” pointed out the official. “We are targeting an average consumption of 230 LPCD.” Factors like climate, culture, land-use and working conditions determine the people’s requirement of water. The Bureau of Indian Standards report suggests a minimum of 200 LPCD for cities with full toilet-flushing systems. The Union housing and urban affairs ministry suggests 135 LPCD for urban households, while 55 LPCD has been fixed for rural areas under the Jal Jeevan Mission,. The DJB report on the consumption of water in the five pilot colonies in the three localities reveals that people in Westend Colony are using 443 LPCD. Similarly, Geetanjali Enclave has an average consumption of 295 LPCD, while the consumption in Shantiniketan is 277 LPCD and in Anand Niketan, 229 LPCD. “The situation in Navjeevan Vihar is relatively much better with the average consumption at 208 LPCD,” the water utility official noted. The official noted, "People in some households are using potable water for washing cars and gardening and we have registered per capita consumption as high as 900-1,100 LPCD. The people concerned argued that they were willing to pay for the water, but we must realise that water cannot be produced with money. It is a limited resource that must be shared by all.” Currently, the 24x7 water supply pilot projects cover around 12% of the population in the three areas. DJB plans to boost it to 77%. Raw water availability is a key challenge in realising this ambitious project across the city. Besides excess consumption, the pilot projects also underlined the necessity to have leakage proof pipeline network to maintain constant pressure in the system. A DJB official said that appointing some private contractors in each zone to manage the supply network and its maintenance could help attain this goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wasteful-use-may-water-down-24x7-dream/articleshow/85880007.cms||Paras Singh

The forest department has seized the walrus tusk Walrus is a large marine mammal found only in the North Pole region. Priyanka Lagad, the range forest officer of Ratnagiri, said they had received the information about possible illegal trade of marine animals from a source . “We laid a trap with the help of the local police and arrested three people. Two walrus tusks were seized from the suspects. They have been charged under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,” she told TOI.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC relief for ‘depressed’ SVNIT student||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has quashed a decision made by Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat (SVNIT) to expel a student for missing out on semester examinations because he was a victim of depression aggravated by the lockdown last year. The student approached the HC and challenged his termination on the ground that he had been suffering from depression since January 2020 and the illness reached its peak during the lockdown. Therefore, he could not take the exams, which resulted in his expulsion. The problem arose because the student failed to intimate the institute about his illness ahead of the exams. The Academic Review Committee decided in September 2020 to remove the student from the course because he could not earn 25 credits at the end of the second semester. While quashing the student’s termination and directing the institute to take a fresh decision on continuation of his studies, Justice N V Anjaria on Wednesday observed, “The depressive cycle which the petitioner suffered was during the period of Covid pandemic itself. It was a period of wide-spread despondence. It is reasonable to believe that the situation brought about by the pandemic created an adverse effect on the tender mind of the petitioner, who disengaged himself from the studies. The ground advanced by the petitioner could be viewed as genuine as there is nothing to disbelieve the same.” After the student moved the HC through advocate Ronith Joy, the court ordered SVNIT to allow him to appear in supplementary exam in May 2021. He secured the minimum credit marks and became an eligible contender to pursue the studies further. The high court was critical of the institute and said that doubting the student is insensitive even after a psychiatrist issued a medical certificate. The court also took into consideration that the student has cleared the exams and acquired minimum marks and his illness was attributable to the pandemic period. It will “be inequitable, arbitrary and contrary to the tenets of justness, fairness and equality, to disregard the factor” in expelling him from the course, it said. The court asked the institute to take a fresh view on its decision by showing sympathy to the student. It said, “Approach of sympathy is not the rule of law, yet the law has to be benevolent to sub-serve the interests of justice, wherever the facts and circumstances so justify and demand. This is one such case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-relief-for-depressed-svnit-student/articleshow/85879897.cms||---

Rahul Gajbhiye, the CEO of Cantonment Board Deolali (CBD), who took charge recently, had visited the hospital to take stock of the situation. The decision to reconvert the hospital into a non-Covid hospital was taken due to fewer patients taking treatment at the DCHC for more than two months. “The number of Covid patients taking treatment in the DCHC was negligible, while there were complaints from residents that patients suffering from dengue, chikungunya and other ailments had to go out of Deolali Camp for treatment. On this backdrop, the decision of reconverting the hospital was taken,” he said The decision was taken after discussing the issue with the district administration. He said in case Covid patients arrive, they would be referred to the Bytco Hospital. Meanwhile, Covid tests would continue as usual in the future at CBD hospital. After the Covid outbreak, the cantonment hospital was first converted into a DCHC in May 2020. It continued to function as a DCHC until the first week of February this year as Covid cases continued to drop in Deolali Camp area and its surroundings However, it was again converted into a DCHC on March 15 as cases started to increase. Apart from the residents of Deolali Camp, a large number of patients from the surrounding villages come to the hospital for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cantt-hospital-reconverted-into-non-covid-faciltiy/articleshow/85877092.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nagpur||Check whether IMS needs env nod, court tells NHAI||Nagpur: In a setback to National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) constructing the proposed Inter Modal Station (IMS), the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Thursday directed it to check whether the project would require environmental clearance for felling trees.“We may suggest NHAI to revisit its approach and stand that it has taken in present cases. It should explore options under the law and see if any environmental clearance is really required and it should be obtained as expeditiously as possible. If any directives are required to be issued, a prayer in that regard may be placed for its appropriate consideration,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said.While hearing two PILs filed by Ajay Tiwari and Shweta Burbure through counsel M Anil Kumar and Swachha Foundation secretary Sharad Paliwal through lawyer Ritesh Tahaliyani, the bench issued notices to the respondents for final disposal at admission stage.Earlier, Kumar proposed several alternatives to NHAI, which is carrying out developmental work relating to IMS construction, so that a balance could be struck between development and environment.“These suggestions are contained in his amendment application. We would request the authorities, including the special purpose vehicle constituted for the construction, to look into them and consider their implementation if possible within the parameters of law,” the judges said.While adjourning the hearing till October 13, they noted that there are certain permissions and clearances which are required. “Although it is the submission of NHAI counsel Anand Parchure that except for the tree authority’s permission, all the clearances, including environmental, have been obtained by them, there appears to be disagreement between the parties.”Kumar and MPCB counsel Ravi Sanyal then pointed out to the famous case of Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society in Mumbai where it was held that even in case of development proposed on central government, armed forces or any other authority’s land, environmental clearance is required as provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, override all Acts.“In that case, provisions in Section 11 (d) of the Railways Act, 1989, were not under consideration, but it appears that those observations have been made in the context of the Environment (Protection) Act. This issue would be required to be considered by this court after hearing the parties,” the judges said.The petitioners brought to HC’s notice that NHAI’s application to cut some trees is still pending with NMC. “Since the number of trees exceeds 200, such an application would be decided by the state tree authority. The application along with all the objections are being forwarded by NMC to the state government for appropriate consideration and decision,” they said.HC then directed NMC to forward NHAI’s application along with all the objections to the government within a week. “We direct the government to decide the application seeking permission within four weeks,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/check-whether-ims-needs-env-nod-court-tells-nhai/articleshow/85874936.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Over 600 Ganesh idols of two and three feet height have been prepared. Superintendent of the Nashik Road Central Prison Pramod Wagh said that the speciliaty this year is the low prices of the idols made from Shadu clay. For the past few years, the jail inmates have been preparing the idols ahead of the Ganesh festival. They have received overwhelming response from the citizens. There is high demand for idols made from Shadu clay because they are eco-friendly and can be immersed even at home. Jail authorities said that they do no compete with the other stall owners and do not look to make profit. Citizens approach the jail authorities for the idols. In 2017, the inmates had prepared 150 idols for the first time and set up the stall. They were received with enthusiasm. A year later, close to 1,000 idols were prepared. In 2019, the inmates made 800. Last year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on celebrations, the number of idols was scaled down to 550. This year too, only 600 idols have been prepared. Jail authorities said that some inmates, who were skilled in making these idols, were released on parole due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Jail authorities said that the remaining artists have been working since December last year to prepare the idols for this year’s Ganesh festival. Other senior officials of the jail would also be present at the inauguration of the Lord Ganapati stall on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ganesh-idols-made-by-jail-inmates-on-sale-from-today/articleshow/85877098.cms||Santosh Sonawane

For private schools, only 12.26% of the total student strength attended school on the first day, according to data compiled by the state government. Out of 10,86,871 students in private schools, 1,33,302 students of Class 6 to Class 8 attended school on Thursday. In Ahmedabad, 2,361 students of 21,033 or 11.23% attended school. According to the school reopening guidelines only 50% of students are allowed to attend, hence the attendance was about 24% on September 2. Surendranagar saw the highest attendance of 32.24% while Botad saw the lowest at 5.17%. The state government has cited a considerable drop in coronavirus cases in the state to justify their decision to reopen schools in a staggered manner with strict Covid protocols and guidelines. For government schools, of 19,83,652 students about 34% or 6,77,111 students attended school. The attendance was as high as 68% given the 50% student capacity guidelines, the government claimed in its data analysis.

The police said the murder weapons,sickles and the battery operated wood cutting machine were bought from Jummerat Bazar. Mohammed Shafi, Mohammed Pasha, Mohammed Sajid, B Venkanna, R Vijender, Mirza Akbar Baig were arrested, said Warangal commissioner of police Tarun Joshi. Chand Pasha and his younger brother Mohammed Shafi jointly carried out their business. However, four years ago they went separate ways. Shafi ran into losses and approached Chand Pasha, who agreed to make Shafi as his partner. Even though Shafi got a second chance, he didn’t change his attitude. He demanded a share in the business which was rejected by Chand Pasha and his wife claiming all property was earned after they split. For months Shafi bore grudge against Chand Pasha’s family for not sharing the profits and putting the burden of clearing the debts on him. In the past, few meetings were also held between the brothers in the presence of community elders, but Chand Pasha allegedly did not heed to pay the debts. At around 2 am on Wednesday, the accused who were at Shafi’s residence took an autorickshaw to Chand Pasha’s house. One of the accused break the door of the house using the battery operated wood cutter. At this time, all the victims were sleeping inside their house. Anticipating that the inmates might wake up on hearing the wood cutter’s sound, the accused in the auto rickshaw kept the engine on and kept rising the accelerator so that the victims would not hear the sound of the wood cutter. They first killed Pasha, then attacked Sabera and Khaleel with sickles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-people-arrested-in-triple-murder-case/articleshow/85882227.cms||---
---||Agra||Hundreds outside health centres with viral fever, 65 dead in Firozabad so far||Agra/Meerut: Hundreds of people suffering from viral fever flooded community health centres (CHCs) and primary health centres (PHCs) across western UP districts on Thursday even as the worst-hit Firozabad district reported five more child deaths in the last 24 hours. The death toll in Firozabad has now mounted to 65 in the last three weeks, with 50 of the patients being children, according to sources in the health department. Sources also told TOI that at least 5,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals. In Baghpat, the community health centre recorded a rush of 600 patients with high fever on Thursday while facilities in Muzaffarnagar also witnessed scores of patients with viral infection. Dr Dinesh Singh, Baghpat chief medical officer (CMO), said that Baraut CHC, which used to get 40 to 60 patients every day, is now seeing more than 200 patients in out-patient department (OPD) on a regular basis since the last 10 days. CMO of Meerut Dr Akhilesh Mohan also admitted that thousands of patients with fever are flocking to OPDs in various government and private hospitals in the city. While the death toll from viral fever in Mainpuri stands at eight and 13 people have died in Mathura, the worst-hit district is Firozabad. Health centres are scrambling to arrange beds and more than 100 patients in critical condition have been referred to government hospitals in nearby districts. At the Firozabad medical college — the largest health facility in the district — 400 people are undergoing treatment for fever, including 345 children. Samples of 49 patients tested positive for dengue on Thursday. A health department official told TOI that none of the samples tested in the last three weeks were found positive for Covid-19. “Most patients have dengue-like symptoms, such as high temperature, dehydration and sudden drop in platelets,” he said. The facility has a capacity of 100 beds which was increased to 300 last week. Hospital staff said beds were being added by the hour to accommodate more patients. But on Thursday afternoon, people and children were seen lying on benches and floors on the premises of the medical college as it ran out of beds. For many, it brought back memories of the second wave of the pandemic when hospital beds were scarce. Ajay Kumar, a resident of Daman village, lost his four-year-old son to the illness last week. “Precious time was lost as we went from one place to another looking for a bed. Finally, we admitted him to a private hospital but his platelets were too low by then,” he said. Police have been deployed at the medical college and other government health centres to maintain law and order situation. On Thursday, a team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) also arrived in the district on the orders of the health ministry to study the viral fever outbreak. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said all districts have been put on alert. “Firozabad is under 24-hour monitoring. Special teams of health department officials and scientists have been sent to study the nature of vector-borne disease spreading in the district.” Additional director of the health department, A K Singh, added that additional ambulances have been arranged and special cleanliness drives are being conducted in affected areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hundreds-outside-health-centres-with-viral-fever-65-dead-in-firozabad-so-far/articleshow/85877129.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Nashik||Stagnant active case tally is matter of concern: Bhujbal||Nashik: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal expressed concern over the stagnation in the number of active Covid-19 cases in Nashik, including the city. Talking to TOI, Bhujbal said although the Covid situation in Nashik is not as alarming as it was around four months ago, the fact that Covid cases have stopped declining over the last 15 days is a matter of concern. “The total active cases on a daily basis during the last 15 days continue to hover around 1,000-1,100. It is imperative that cases continue to decline in Nashik, which will mean that lesser people are getting infected,” Bhujbal said. However, Bhujbal made it clear that there is no plan to impose fresh curbs. “This issue was not discussed during the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. But I have directed the Nashik authorities to continue to monitor the data on a daily basis. Nashikites should continue to strictly adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated,” he added. According to the data shared by the health department, in the last nine days (barring August 29) the daily new cases exceeded the daily recoveries. And daily cases in rural Nashik were much higher than in Nashik city. As of September 1, Nashik’s total active cases stood at 1,017 — 459 in Nashik city, 496 in rural Nashik, 47 in Malegaon town and remaining 15 from outside the district. Nashik’s weekly positivity rate last week was 2.52% which was better than the state’s figure of 2.58%. District civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said the bulk of the active cases is either asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic who do not require hospitalisation. A total of 54 Covid patients are currently undergoing treatment in ICUs and another 38 outside the ICU with medical oxygen support. “But it is worrisome that active cases in Nashik have stopped falling. The district health department and Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and zilla parishad are continuing to carry out surveillance to test, identify and treat Covid patients,” added Thorat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stagnant-active-case-tally-is-matter-of-concern-bhujbal/articleshow/85877119.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Ahmedabad||2008 serial blasts case: Trial ends, court reserves verdict||AHMEDABAD: Thirteen years after 19 bomb blasts rocked the city and killed 56 persons on July 26, 2008, the special court on Thursday completed the trial against 78 accused persons arrested from various states and reserved its verdict. The trial was conducted after merging 35 different cases registered against the accused persons in Ahmedabad and Surat. There were 20 FIRs lodged in Ahmedabad for the bomb blasts, 15 FIRs were registered in Surat as bombs were recovered from various parts there a couple of days after the terror strike in Ahmedabad. An unknown outfit, Indian Mujahideen, claimed responsibility of the terror strike and termed the act a reprisal for the 2002 riots. Police claimed that IM was formed by some of the earlier member of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). Before special judge A R Patel, the prosecution examined as many as 1,130 witnesses in this case. There were 26 witnesses who were marked as star witnesses and the court as well as the government put in place special provisions for concealment of their identities for their safety. Four of the accused were treated as approvers by admitting their confessions, though they fought a legal battle asserting their retractions at a later stage. One of the accused offered to turn approver and his request was accepted by the court. The trial was delayed in the initial stage with the Supreme Court staying it on the day the trial court framed charges against the accused. The apex court had stayed the proceedings after the accused persons demanded that all the prosecutions in various cities in connection with the terror attacks be merged and they may face only one trial. The SC lifted the stay when it rejected the demand and ordered for expeditious trial. The special court heard the case in the Sabarmati central jail initially days, but most of the prosecution took place through video conferencing only. This was the only case that continued to be tried in a courtroom through the entire pandemic, when all courtrooms across the state were closed. The trial took place amid various controversies and hindrances. One of them was the alleged attempt by some of the accused persons in this case to escape from jail. On February 11, the jail authorities came across a 213-foot long tunnel dug from the Chhota Chakkar area in the jail. Twenty-four persons accused in the 2008 serial blasts case, including the prime accused, Safdar Nagori, were charged for the jailbreak attempt. The trial is pending in this regard. Since the first arrest on August 15, 2008, none of the accused persons has been granted regular bail by the court. The only accused person out on temporary bail is Naved Qadri, who was released after he was diagnosed as having acute schizophrenia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2008-serial-blasts-case-trial-ends-court-reserves-verdict/articleshow/85879924.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Using fake police stickers will lead to arrests, not just fines||Kolkata: Tightening the screw on imposters, cops have started arresting those using fake ‘Police’ stickers on their vehicles so that they can no longer get away by merely paying a fine under the Motor Vehicles Act. Two such accused, one from Garden Reach and the other from Jadavpur, were arrested on Thursday under cheating case. Both the cases were registered suo motu by local cops, following complaints from sergeants. Lalbazar said the 25 traffic guards have reported 16 cases of illegal use of ‘Police’ stickers since August. Lalbazar has ordered prosecutions against vehicles left in no-parking zones and those using fake parking stickers and boards. Also, those using ‘Police’ stickers—even if they were civic volunteers—without authorization should face legal action, police said. The message from the office of DCP-Traffic has asked sergeants to slap cases, irrespective of ‘VIP’ stickers or beacons on vehicles. Sergeant Rizwan Rafique of the Metiabruz traffic guard on Thursday stopped Garden Reach resident Ziaul Haque (27), when he saw a ‘Police’ sticker and a logo on his two-wheeler. Rafique asked Haque for his police ID card. “The accused was not a serving cop. Yet he rode a two-wheeler with a police sticker, cheating people by impersonification with mala fide intentions. We arrested the accused,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai. A couple of days ago, sergeant Partha Sarathi Dutta of Regent Park traffic guard had intercepted Baranagar resident Rajib Chakraborty who was riding his bike with a pillion rider without helmet. “The rider called himself an assistant sub-inspector and showed a fake ID card, issued by a fake IPS officer. He was brought to the Regent Park police station and arrested for cheating,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/using-fake-police-stickers-will-lead-to-arrests-not-just-fines/articleshow/85879938.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope rules out any further curbs ahead of festivities||PUNE: Ruling out any further curbs ahead of festivals, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday directed the local administrations to implement the existing rules properly with strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols. The Maharashtra health minister said all necessary precautions to prevent crowding during the festivals was in place. He said all cautions should be exercised and Covid protocols should be followed during the festive time. “We are aware of how cases have increased after Onam in Kerala. So, we have to ensure that there is no crowding during the upcoming festivities,” he said, almost a week after the Centre advised the state to be cautious ahead of festivities in a letter. The Centre, in the letter, advised the state to consider imposing local restrictions on mass events during the festivals to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Ahead of the festivities, the state task force members are also against taking any chances after the Kerala experience. They claimed that the cases had receded in the state after the second wave and now the focus should be on double-masking and intensified vaccination. Tope said the state had been registering about 4,000-5,000 cases on a daily basis over a month. “We are keeping a close watch on the numbers and if there is any sudden rise in cases, new strategies have to be implemented,” he said. On eight districts registering a higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state average this week, Tope said the local administrations would have to keep a close watch on the situation in these districts. He said the officials would have to ensure that there was no sudden rise in cases in any pockets. “While some of the districts have registered higher positivity rate than the state average, around 17 districts in the state have below 100 active cases. Some districts are registering just two to three cases each day,” he said. The state currently has around 51,078 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-rules-out-any-further-curbs-ahead-of-festivities/articleshow/85880375.cms||Nisha Nambiar

To this Daniel Craig playing the role of the iconic British secret service agency MI6 agent 007 replies, “Aapna badha na rahasyo hoy chhe, pan taaru haji jaanva nathi malyu (We all have our secrets, we just didn’t get to yours yet).” Above are the Gujarati dubbed dialogues from the Gujarati trailer of No Time to Die, the 25th film in the James Bond franchise which will be the first Hollywood film to be released in Gujarati dubbed version. Later in the trailer, 007 introduces himself to a security guard saying, “Naam chhe Bond, James Bond!” Universal Pictures on Wednesday announced that the film will be released in India on September 30. No Time to Die, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, stars Lucifer Safin and Rami Malek as the villains, Lea Seydoux as Bond’s love interest and Lashana Lynch as the new secret agent who will take over the 007 mantle from Craig. Ben Whishaw has been cast as the MI6 quartermaster Q and Ralph Fiennes as MI6 head M. “James Bond speaking Gujarati is definitely a positive thing for Gujarati film industry which is passing through a tough phase due to Covid-induced financial crunch,” says Abhishek Shah, the maker of national award-winning Gujarati film Hellaro. Shah said that it will be very interesting if the characters spoke in Gujarati dialects. “Dubbing is one of the toughest tasks in film making. Use of regional dialects and slang makes it relatable to local audience,” Shah said and added that a major studio like Universal Pictures deciding to dub a big budget film in Gujarati language proves that Gujarat has emerged as major market for entertainment in the country. Another Gujarati filmmaker, Vijaygiri Bava, said that though releasing the film in both Gujarati and Hindi dubbed versions in the state indicates that the big studios are targeting Gujarat’s rural audience. “Urban audience in Gujarat prefers to watch English films in its original language. Some of them prefer Hindi dubbed. So, the idea behind dubbing No Time to Die in Gujarati must be to tap rural audience,” Bava said. Film makers also feel that Hollywood studios releasing Gujarati dubbed films may bring another competition to Gujarati filmmakers who are already trying to survive in the struggle against Hindi film industry and Hindi dubbed regional films from other states such as Tamil, Malayalam, and Telugu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/naam-chhe-bond-james-bond-007-to-speak-gujarati/articleshow/85880569.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

In January last year, the NMC had made use of dust screens mandatory for construction sites in order to curb air pollution in the city. Initially, the dust screens were used by the builders at construction sites, but gradually a section of builders allegedly started violating the rule. A senior town planning official said air pollution is one of the major issues the city is facing. “Construction works across the city are also adding to air pollution. Hence, we have made using the dust screen or green nets mandatory at construction sites as part of our measures to reduce air pollution of the city,” he said. “But we are observing that a section of builders are not following the rule at their construction sites. We have already decided to find such sites where dust screens are not being used. We will serve notices to such construction sites where green norms are being violated,” he added. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist, said water and air pollution are major concerns as they are directly related to human health. Hence, there is are need to take strict measures to reduce pollution. “But only chalking out green norms is not enough, the civic body should strictly ensures that the norms for construction sites are being followed. The civic officials should continuously conduct spot inspections to ensure that builders are using dust screens during the construction activities,” Pandit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/construction-sites-not-using-dust-screens-under-civic-body-scanner/articleshow/85877167.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Raids on ‘mini BPOs’ lead cops to Jamtara gang, 16 held||Kolkata: The city police busted a ‘Jamtara gang’ on Wednesday and arrested 16 cyber frauds from Jharkhand, who had set up their base in Kolkata as recently as during the second wave of the pandemic. The gang, which called up random numbers and tricked the callers into parting with their bank details and passwords, utilized dormant bank accounts to carry out fraudulent transactions and stole money from ATMs, had set up their “mini BPOs” at rented flats in Kestopur, New Town, Kasba and Bansdroni. They were fluent in Bengali and English, police said. During the raid, 188 stolen debit cards, 78 mobiles and six laptops were seized. “Of late, the activities of Jamtara gangs were observed on the outskirts of Kolkata. They used to take online delivery of goods, obtained through fraud, at specific locations in Kestopur and Rajarhat. Raids were conducted and 16 people were arrested on Wednesday night,” said Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. He hinted at more raids soon. The accused, claimed police, were mostly from Jamtara, Giridih and Dhanbad in Jharkhand and rented flats here in small groups and set up mini BPOs. “They moved into the city around March, during the second wave, after being ‘trained’ in Jharkhand. “When people started working from home again, the gang made this city their base, thinking they could operate here silently while the police focus remained on their home districts. They rented the flats for a year,” said an officer from DD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/raids-on-mini-bpos-lead-cops-to-jamtara-gang-16-held/articleshow/85879976.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Meerut||West UP receives heavy rains, but 29 dists still ‘rain deficient’||Meerut: Most western districts of Uttar Pradesh which have been experiencing long spells of humid days have now received heavy rainfall wiping out deficiency to some extent. However, some districts remained "rain deficient". According to meteorological department's data, Delhi NCR districts in UP received several times more rainfall than normal. For instance, Shamli received 8mm fall as against 2.2mm [normal]. Shahjahanpur received 39.9mm as against 7.7mm. Meerut witnessed 18.5mm as against 8.6 while Baghpat got 22mm against 2mm. The rains were widespread, but still could not cover the overall deficiency like in Mathura, Mainpuri, Rampur, Shamli, which continue to be rain deficient in the current monsoon season. While the news was good for farmers at large, it was a nightmare for civic authorities whose lack of preparedness could be seen in the form of widespread waterlogging which even cost human lives. For instance, a man walking through a waterlogged lane touched an electric pole and fainted, and had to be rescued. And in a tragic incident in Ghaziabad, five, including three kids, died when current flowed into a tin shed while it was raining heavily on Wednesday. Dr RS Sengar, agriculture scientist, department of biotechnology, College of Agriculture, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Agriculture University, said, "The rain is a boon for paddy and sugarcane farmers as both crops require considerable amounts of water. Farmers had waited for the downpour for quite some time now. The rainfall will help pulses and vegetable farming, too." Dr N Subash, principal scientist, Indian Agriculture Research Institute, said, "The maximum temperature was 31 degree celsius which is two degree less than normal while minimum temperature was 22. The weather will remain like this for the next two days. There can be moderate rainfall." The Met data revealed statistics for a period from June 1 to September 2 in which it stated 11 districts received excess rainfall, 31 received normal, 29 are still deficient and three hardly got any rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/west-up-receives-heavy-rains-but-29-dists-still-rain-deficient/articleshow/85877220.cms||Sandeep Rai

The civic administration has sent a letter to the state government in this regard, seeking permission for the appointment in view of the third wave of the Covid pandemic. In April this year, the state government had given its approval for creation of a total 635 posts in five departments of the civic body, including 179 posts in the health department. The 179 posts from the medical department include 16 gynaecologists, 16 paediatricians, 4 ENT & ophthalmologists, among others. The new posts approved in other departments include 343 vacancies in fire brigade department, 12 in accounts & audit, 58 in solid waste department and 43 in the engineering department. “We already have many existing vacant posts in the medical department of the civic body and are facing huge shortage of healthcare workers, including medical officers, specialists, pediatricians and other health staff,” an NMC official said. “During the first wave of the pandemic, we even did not receive any response for our drive to recruit health workers on temporary basis. We also faced the scarcity of the health workers during the second wave — particularly between March and May this year,” he said. “Now, there’s a projection for the third wave. We are also planning a medical college and hospital at the new Bytco hospital of the civic body. Hence, we need to fill up the newly approved posts for the medical department of the NMC at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-seeks-states-nod-to-fill-179-posts-in-med-dept/articleshow/85877248.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Wedding jewellery worth Rs 5 lakh stolen, traced on reception night||Kolkata: A day before her wedding, a 42-year-old psychologist found her jewellery, worth more than Rs 5 lakh, stolen from her New Town home, forcing her to take the vows wearing almost no ornament on the morning of August 15. But quick action on the part of the police, got her “the best wedding gift” as the accused was caught when her reception was on that very evening and the jewellery was traced. Around two weeks later, police on Thursday gave her back all her ornaments. The accused turned out to be a domestic help hired from an agency. “The ornaments are family heirlooms, worn by my mother and grandmother on their weddings. I had planned to continue the tradition. But on losing the ornaments, I wore only a necklace for my marriage registry and reception. I had given up hope of ever getting them back, but police traced the jewellery the next day. They gave them back to me in record time,” said Amrita Panda, a rehabilitation psychologist for people with disabilities. The accused, Sunita Mukherjee (52) had reportedly been hired from a south Kolkata centre. She had joined work on August 11, barely two days before the theft. Panda said she didn’t initially suspect Mukherjee, who told them about her tough life of being a single parent raising a son. “I brought the ornaments from my mother’s place on August 10. I questioned all my relatives and friends but never suspected the help. But some of her actions did later raise my doubt and I lodged a complaint,” said Panda. Mukherjee reportedly had hidden the ornaments—three pairs of gold earrings, two gold-and-tiger-stone pendants, a diamond ring, a gold-plated bangle and a gold chain—inside her petticoat. “The woman seems to be professional the way she had hidden the articles. We are happy to have returned the jewellery to the rightful owner,” said a senior Bidhannagar Commissionerate officer. Panda’s husband Somtirtha Majumder, said, “The incident shows hiring agencies do not carry out background checks.” The officer said it took a month to a year to get stolen items back after recovery. But here, the local police station expedited the handover. “The woman appealed in court to return the ornaments. Our officer confirmed the recovered items matched with the descriptions in her complaint. We had no objection to her keeping “jimma” (custody) of the ornaments till the case is resolved. She can wear them during this period but can’t sell them,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wedding-jewellery-worth-rs-5-lakh-stolen-traced-on-reception-night/articleshow/85880016.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Hyderabad||Unvaccinated persons driving up Covid numbers in Telangana||HYDERABAD: While the number of Covid-19 cases in the state has come down substantially over the last one month, most cases which are now being reported are of unvaccinated persons who had not been infected earlier. District officials said that they have been seeing cases in entire families who were uninfected earlier. “Most of the cases we are seeing now are in families. These are small clusters, usually single households,” said a district medical and health officer (DMHO). Currently more cases are being recorded in Karimnagar, Khammam, and Warangal Urban among other districts. “Unlike earlier when outbreaks were seen in entire localities, spreading from one house to others, now we are seeing sporadic clusters. In most cases these are unvaccinated families which are getting infected and even though there are other houses around, it’s not spreading like earlier outbreaks,” informed Telangana director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao. Those who have not contracted the virus earlier and people who are not vaccinated fall in the susceptible category and have to be extra cautious. “Such people should wear masks even inside their house. While vaccination is proven to prevent infection, the spread of the Covid-19 virus and any new strains will be through the unvaccinated population who were previously uninfected,” added Dr Rao. Meanwhile a large chunk of the state’s eligible population is yet to receive their doses — an estimated 1 crore people. So far vaccination coverage has been largely focussed on the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area. While 95 per cent of the eligible population has been vaccinated in the GHMC limits — encompassing Hyderabad, parts of Medchal-Malkajgiri, Sangareddy and Rangareddy districts. However, vaccination in other districts across the state is as low as 20 to 30 per cent, according to officials of the health department. While the health department has charted plans to scale up vaccination in other parts of the state quickly, it would still take over two months to administer first doses to all eligible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unvaccinated-driving-up-covid-numbers-in-t/articleshow/85880811.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Mental strength a major aspect in miracle recoveries, say doctors||HYDERABAD: A 36-year-old IT professional from Hyderabad affected with severe Covid pneumonia recovered after 90 days of hospitalisation of which 41 days were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Her ‘miracle recovery’ stretched over 90 days starting from May to July this year, after she was admitted in a completely unconscious state at the hospital. During the three months, she was on ventilator support, underwent tracheotomy, dialysis, physiotherapy and finally on a 1 litre oxygen support, after being on ECMO during the miraculous recovery. While such instances of recoveries were largely unheard of before the pandemic, these are now becoming more frequent. These ‘miracle recoveries’ from Covid-19 after having a nearly total lung damage (90-100 per cent in most cases), might be a case for study as multiple factors are involved but treating doctors have found a few things to be common among these cases. In another instance, a 25-year-old nurse at a corporate hospital in the city who was trained to tackle Covid-19 cases, was diagnosed with severe Covid and made a remarkable recovery after being on ventilator for nearly two months. She was slowly weaned off the ventilator and put on physiotherapy. The extent of damage to the lungs decides how long a person stays on ventilator or ECMO, how much the disease will progress while age and mental resolve play a big part as well. “We have seen better outcomes in younger people, although there have been miracle recoveries in 76-year-old patients too. In general, since younger people have better muscle strength and better reserves, their organs are able to sustain better and for longer on ventilator or ECMO. Mental strength plays a vital role in recovery, especially when the patients are weaned off the ventilator and have to put in a lot of effort to start breathing on their own, for physiotherapy and other activities,” said Dr Venkat Raman Kola, clinical director, department of critical care, Yashoda Hospitals. In an extensively damaged lung, recovery depends on whether the lung had any pre-existing disease and the individual host response. “We have seen recoveries after extensive lung damage, even in patients who are over 60 years, having co-morbidities as well as in cancer patients. In such cases, the health of the lungs before the infection is what matters,” said Government Chest Hospital superintendent, Dr Mahaboob Khan. Timely treatment also plays a big role in recovery as it stops the progression of the disease. In many cases, lungs which look pretty bad at the time of discharge, recover drastically within weeks say doctors. Patients who tend to panic on reaching an ICU or ventilator, meanwhile, are seen to have a slow recovery. Doctor said this is because panic lowers the overall immunity and allows the disease to progress faster. Insisting on the huge role of patience and persistence by critical care providers, Dr Shweta Ram Chandankhede, consultant critical care specialist, Care Hospitals said, “While mental strength plays a big role, one thing which many patients who were on ICU and ECMO told us after recovery was that assurance that they were recovering went a long way.” Lifestyle before contracting the disease also play a major part apart from the persistent and critical care by healthcare providers. “Patients with healthy diet patterns and exercise regimes have better chances of healing,” said Dr Ghanshyam, head of department of critical care, Medicover Group of Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mental-strength-a-major-aspect-in-miracle-recoveries-say-doctors/articleshow/85881239.cms||Amrita Didyala

The trial, titled ‘A Prospective, Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo controlled, Phase-2/3 Study to Evaluate Safety, Reactogenicity, Tolerability and Immunogenicity of Corbevax Vaccine in Children and Adolescents’, will be conducted across 10 sites, sources said. The subject expert committee (SEC) that advises the drug controller, has asked the company to get the safety data of the first 100 participants in the age group of 12-18 years evaluated by the DSMB (Data & Safety Monitoring Board) and submit the results to CDSCO before proceeding to the Phase III part of the trial, as per the minutes of the SEC meeting. While Zydus Cadila’s needle-free intra-dermal vaccine ZyCov-D is the first vaccine to be approved for kids (12-18 years), the drug regulator has also granted approval to Bharat Biotech to conduct Phase II/III trials on kids in the 2-18 years bracket and to Serum Institute of India for Phase II/III trials of Covovax on children aged 2-17 years with certain conditions. Biological E’s Corbevax is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials on adults and the company is expected to apply for emergency use authorisation (EUA) in a month or so. In June this year, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) booked 30 crore doses of Corbevax for an advance payment of Rs 1,500 crore, which works out to an advance of around Rs 50 per dose. These vaccines were to be delivered in the August-December 2021 period and the company began at-risk manufacturing of the vaccine in May this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bio-e-gets-nod-for-corbevax-trials-on-kids-aged-5-18-years/articleshow/85881058.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

This year’s highest package was bagged by MTech student, Somnath Paul. The average salaries too, data show, dipped to Rs3.5 lakh per year this time, from the usual Rs 5 lakh to Rs 6 lakh. “Companies that offered high packages until last year informed us that they do not have enough budget for this year. We had few companies that offered Rs8 lakh to Rs10 lakh to the students,” said Prerna Akhouri, training and placement officer at UoH. In February 2020, Adobe had hired a MCA from the university for an annual salary of Rs 43 lakh per annum. Earlier in 2019, two students from UoH secured international placements for Rs 45 lakh per annum. On the brighter side though, UoH recorded the highest number of placements this academic season with all its 396 students being absorbed by 213 visiting companies. Among them, 221 had received offers just before the lockdown hit in March. They were recruited by 132 companies that had held campus placements until then. “I have secured a job as a software engineer with a Bengaluru-based firm. It works on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Before pursuing my MTech in computer science from the UoH, I studied master of science from West Bengal,” said Paul. The other companies that signed on UoH students include Pegasystems, Tata Consultancy Services, GE, Dr Reddy’s, ICICI Bank, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Mercedez-Benz etc. “Many companies offered roles in data analytics, business analytics, software development among others. While the placement season was slightly slow this year, we were able to place all the students by August,” said Akhouri. All recruitments since May 2021 have been through video interviews and online assessments as companies were not able to physically visit the university campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-placements-highest-package-drops-to-rs-17-lakh-all-396-placed/articleshow/85881154.cms||---

Referred to as Tamili or Damili, it is a variant of the Brahmi script used for inscriptions in the early form of Old Tamil. The Brahmi writing system is believed to have appeared in south Asia in the third century BC. The earliest, indisputably dated and best-known Brahmi inscriptions are the rock-cut edicts of Indian emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty in north-central India, dating to 250-232 BC.But new findings of Damili inscribed potsherds point to the ancient script originating before the Ashoka era. In Tamil Nadu, nearly 1,571 Damili inscriptions are documented till date from 79 early historic sites, including Keeladi (Sivaganga district), Alagankulam (Ramanathapuram district), Kodumanal (Erode district), Porunthal (Dindigul district), Arikamedu (Puducherry) and other places.. Of these, nearly 1,464 specimens are Tamil-Brahmi inscribed potsherds recovered from 41 archaeological sites.Irrespective of a large number of Damili inscriptions, the earliest date could not be assigned to Damili script due to the non-availability of the scientific dates. The date of Damili script was determined based on stratigraphy, palaeography, orthography, linguistic features, internal historical evidence and other external cultural/trade contacts.The recent archaeological excavations across the state provided 45 radiometric dates. Of the 45 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates, 39 belong to the early historic sites and remaining are from the Iron Age sites. At least 14 dates were assigned to pre-Asokan (before 268 BC), and the earliest date goes back to 6th century BC.The metallographic analysis carried out on the sword collected from an Iron Age grave at Thelunganur revealed that it was made of ultrahigh carbon steel and yielded two updated AMS dates — 1334 BC and 2742 BC. Even if one considers the lowermost date as the possible date of introduction of steel, it could be placed around mid-14th century BC.Recent findings suggest that manufacturing of iron in India around 2nd millennium BC and steel around 13 century BC. Thus, the introduction of iron in south India goes back to early as 2nd millennium BC and the beginning of the early historic period could be safely placed around 6th century BC, as the evidence stands today.In ancient India, the Indus, Graffiti and Brahmi writing systems were prevalent. While the first and second are yet to be deciphered to the satisfaction of all, the Brahmi script has been deciphered with more clarity and accuracy. Unlike other two, the Brahmi script was in usage for about 1,000 years covering a wider geographical area and one could trace the evolution and transformation of the script over the years.Therefore, the Brahmi script is considered the mother of all Indian scripts, as well to the scripts of Sri Lanka and many southeast Asian countries. After the decipherment of Ashokan edicts, this script became popular and on account of this, it came to be known as Ashokan-Brahmi or Mauryan-Brahmi, though the language used in the edicts is Prakrit. Prakrit-Brahmi inscriptions are found in the entire Indian sub-continent and Sri Lanka except in Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu, Tamilised Prakrit inscriptions are found.The discovery of cave inscriptions in Brahmi script in 1882 by Robert Sewell at Mangulam near Melur in Madurai district could not be deciphered for long as scholars felt that it was written in Prakrit language. The successful decipherment of the inscriptions in 1924 by K V Subrahmanya Aiyerprovided a new dimension to the usage of the Brahmi script in Tamil. So as to differentiate from Prakrit-Brahmi, they designated it as Tamil-Brahmi.The close observations of Damili (Tamil-Brahmi) and Sri Lankan Brahmi (Prakrit-Brahmi) scripts suggest they had closer links with each other in terms of palaeography, probably due to the geographical proximity, than the Ashokan Prakrit-Brahmi. Thus, the co-existence of Prakrit-Brahmi and Tamil-Brahmi (Damili) generated debate on the origin and date of the scripts.Fixing the origin and date of Brahmi script eluded the scholars for a long time as they were mostly engraved on non-perishable material such as rock-surface, metal objects and potsherds. However, the excavated sites of Kodumanal, Porunthal, Alagankulam and Keeladi in Tamil Nadu and at Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama in Sri Lanka shed some light on the chronology of the script.Irrespective of some emerging evidence, scholars like Iravatham Mahadevan and Subbarayalu consider the date of Tamil-Brahmi as post-Ashokaṉ, whereas K V Ramesh, Natana Kasinathan, M D Sampath, S Rajavelu and I consider them as pre-Ashokaṉ. There was hardly any convergence of views with the regard to the date of Tamil-Brahmi due to limited/non-availability of scientific dates. Now, the picture has changed due to the arrival of series of AMS dates, particularly from Damili yielding sites such as Kodumanal, Keeladi, Alagankulam and Porunthal. The excavations are in progress at Korkai, Sivakalai, Adichchanallur, Keeladi, Kodumanal, and Mayiladumparai and all the sites yielded Damili inscribed potsherds in previous and present excavations.The availability of extensive brick structures as one observed at Keeladi and Kaveripattinam, evidence of internal, external and maritime trade contacts evidenced from the occurrence of beads of carnelian, agate, lapis lazuli, Sri Lankan cat eye, punch-marked coins, amphorae, Indo-Pacific monochrome glass beads, names of Prakrit origin and many other cultural items demonstrate that south India, particularly Tamil Nadu, entered into the early historic phase in 6th century BC.(The writer is academic and research adviser, Tamil Nadu archaeology department)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/how-keeladi-dig-is-helping-establish-tamil-brahmi-script-as-pre-ashokan/articleshow/85867143.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Old City parents concerned over unsanitary conditions||HYDERABAD: While educational institutions have finally reopened, many parents in Old City are worried about the cleanliness and unsanitary conditions in localities. As a result, despite being told to send their wards to school, many are hesitant. Parents have expressed concerns over a third wave of Covid-19 and other seasonal diseases such as dengue and malaria. The poor sanitation system in Old City localities has been slammed by the residents with many questioning the need to adopt a dustbin-free method. Locals said that due to this system, many are forced to leave their garbage on the roads, many of which are in the vicinity of schools. “At schools such as Mufeed Ul Anam Boys High School at Alijah Kotla, Girls High School at Noor Khan Bazaar, Government School at Komatwadi, unhygienic conditions are commonplace. When we approached authorities about the issue, they said they did not have enough staff to carry out cleaning operations. Only four to five workers of the 12 who are supposed to be on the field are seen,” GHMC TTDP vice-president Mohammed Ahmed told TOI. Parents have also cited the alleged apathy of authorities towards cleanliness in areas which house educational institutions. Wastage and cow dung are common sights for students at Hussaini Alam. Locals said that despite several complaints, nothing has been done to remove the dumpyard from the school’s vicinity. “Government is asking parents to send children to schools but the ground reality is totally different Old City. In case there is a spread or someone catches infection then who will be accountable?’’ Saifuddin Taiyebi from Hussaini Alam told TOI. Despite repeated attempts to reach zonal commissioner Ashok Samrat, the official was unavailable for comments. “We will look into the matter at the earliest,” a junior official said on condition of anonymity. Locals have urged the education minister, GHMC mayor and commissioner to visit Old City and conduct an inspection to know more about the sanitation problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/old-city-parents-concerned-over-unsanitary-conditions/articleshow/85881200.cms||Omar bin Taher

Unlike his other four family members, all of whom have taken both their doses, Eswaraiah was still unvaccinated due to his inability to walk. He is now among those who have received their vaccine dose during the mobile vaccination drive in Secunderabad Cantonment. Similar was the case of 79-year-old Janakamma, a resident of Balamrai, who has paralysis and cannot sit up straight. During a doorto-door vaccination survey, she was noticed by a health worker who then informed the authorities and got Janakamma administered her first dose. “Vaccine doses are being administered to three categories — elderly, bedridden and persons with disabilities — through the mobile vaccination drive in the cantonment. Overall, 15 mobile vaccination centres along with mobile vans have been set up to cover all eight civilian SCB wards-,”said deputy DMHO, Secunderabad Cantonment, Dr H Raj Kumari. The drive has also been effective in administering the vaccine to those who have been hesitant due to concerns over side-effects and other reasons. The DMHO said that health staff are visiting every house to dispel myths over vaccines and bringing people to the mobile vans for their doses. The official said that around 300 to 400 persons are being administered the vaccine daily as a result of door-to-door visits. The cantonment also has two designated vaccination centres apart from the mobile vans. Hyderabad district collector L Sharman has formed special teams in coordination with officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) and other departments to ensure 100 per cent vaccination in the cantonment. Meanwhile, door-to-door vaccination in GHMC’s Secunderabad zone has been covering beneficiaries at a brisk pace with 25 to 30 vans deployed to cover the five circles — Secunderbad, Begumpet, Malkajgiri, Amberpet and Musheerabad. “Even those in slums who had concerns regarding their health (with regards to the vaccine) are now visiting government-designated centres to take their dose,” said GHMC SPHO B Raja Sree. According to a GHMC official, nearly 70 per cent areas in the Secunderabad are covered as part of the mobile vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mobile-vax-drives-helping-many-get-doses-in-secbad/articleshow/85881294.cms||Sunil Mungara

Public amenities like schools, hospitals and divisional offices are also to be developed in the complexes. The general body of the NMC recently gave its approval to the proposal of the civic administration to develop a shopping complex under public-private-partnership (PPP) model. The NMC will not need to spend any money on the projects from its coffers as it will be developed on PPP basis. Around 40% of the constructed areas will be given to the NMC that will either be leased out or used for school, hospitals and other purposes. The developers will use 60% of the constructed areas and will hand it over to the civic body after 30 years. The NMC has its own vacant plots and old properties in the city. “If we develop these properties on our own, it will take more time. But we can develop these properties on a PPP basis in just two years. Moreover, we can get more revenue through leasing the properties and we also get public amenities like schools, hospitals and divisional offices while constructing shopping complexes,” municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said. An NMC official said earlier the civic administration had appointed an agency to prepare a blueprint about the shopping complexes along with public amenities at 10 different locations. “But after protest by a section of corporators, we stayed the work order to the concerned private consultant. Now, we will carry out a bidding process to deploy a consultancy agency for the purpose. The tender is to be floated within a couple of weeks. The consultancy agency concerned will have to prepare a complete blueprint about the project,” he added. The revenue of the civic body through various taxes like property, water and town planning have been badly affected due Covid-19 pandemic. The NMC has estimated a drop of Rs 300 crore in the revenue for the current financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-build-shopping-complexes-with-schools/articleshow/85877281.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||Delhi Northeast riots: High court quashes 4 out of 5 FIRs in same incident||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court quashed four of the five FIRs registered in a case related to arson and looting during the northeast riots, saying it was the same incident and no fresh investigation for the same offence can take place. Five separate FIRs cannot be registered for the very same incident as it is contrary to the laws laid down by the Supreme Court, the high court noted. All the cases were lodged against the same accused in March last year at Jaffrabad Police Station. “It cannot be said that the incidents were separate or the offences are different. As stated earlier, a perusal of the chargesheets filed in the respective FIRs shows that they are more or less identical and the accused are also same. However, if there is any material that has been found against the accused the same can be placed on record in the FIR,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said, allowing four petitions filed by accused Atir. The accused moved court challenging his prosecution in the five FIRs lodged by Delhi Police on complaints by different members of the same family that when they reached their home in Maujpur area on the evening of February 24, they saw their house was set ablaze that caused a loss of articles worth Rs 7-10 lakh. His plea argued that all the FIRs are in respect of the same dwelling unit and have been filed by different family members and even the same fire-brigade truck had come to extinguish the inferno. The police claimed that the properties were distinct and the damages have been suffered individually by the residents and that the subject matter of each of the FIRs is different from others. But the court disagreed, pointing out that all the five FIRs are identical in their content and more or less a facsimile of one another in connection to the same occurrence. It said they all relate to one house where fire was started mischievously and spread to immediate neighbouring premises as well as floors of the same house and noted that one of the complainants had stated that the premises was his ancestral property and had been divided into four portions pursuant to a family arrangement. “The law on the subject has been settled keeping in line with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of India. There can be no second FIR and no fresh investigation in respect of the same cognisable offence or same occurrence giving rise to one or more cognisable offences,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-quashes-4-out-of-5-firs-in-same-incident/articleshow/85880116.cms||---

The two-term MLA and BSP leader has also written a letter to state police chief against the “deliberate attempt to fuel hatred". He is also planning to file a defamation case against the news channel. The channel, meanwhile, removed Qureshi's photo when it uploaded the show on its YouTube channel. “Elections are round the corner in UP. It is not a random allegation against me. It attacks my patriotism. I have written to the DGP Uttar Pradesh also in this regard. My lawyers will file a defamation case of at least Rs 500 crore against this channel,” Qureshi said. Vikrant Tyagi, a social activist and Qureshi’s aide has filed a police complaint against the channel. “Yaqoob Qureshi is not an unknown face. He has been MLA twice besides serving as UP minister. We want strict action against the channel.” Qureshi was in the news in 2006 when he had announced Rs 51 crore on the “head of Danish cartoonist” for making blasphemous cartoons on Islam.

In addition to them, personal name of north India, beads of carnelian and agate of Maharashtra origin, lapis lazuli of Afghanistan origin and black cat eye of Sri Lankan origin and northern black polished ware of Gangetic origin were recovered in association with punch marked coins at Keeladi, Alagankulam and Kodumanal. The evidence strengthened our view that north and south India and Sri Lanka were totally integrated into the trading system and there were well-established trade routes in the region.The occurrence of silver punch-marked coins is considered one of the indicators for the existence of trade between north and south particularly with the Gangetic valley. These coins were in circulation from the time of Mahajanpadas of 6th century BC. The traders from the Gangetic valley brought Buddhism and Jainism into Tamil Nadu.The availability of semi-precious stones, copper objects, northern black polished ware, punch-marked coins and Tamilised-Prakrit words from the Sangam age sites serves as indicators of thriving commercial activity. During the Mauryan empire, it had wide circulation due to the trade and commerce supported by the well-established state. Chronology of these coins vary from region to region and there are regional varieties too. For instance, the punch-marked coin found as a hoard at Bodinayakkananur near Theni had a fish symbol on the reverse suggesting that this might have been issued by the Pandya dynasty.The ccelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) date obtained from the cultural level at the depth of 165cm goes back to 360BC at Keeladi. The coin found in the fourth season of excavation at Keeladi was recovered at the depth of 162cm and the coin under discussion is recovered at the depth of 146cm thereby suggesting that it belongs to the middle of 4th century BC.The occurrence of a large number of semi-precious stone particularly carnelian beads and agate from the Iron age megalithic monuments of Tamil Nadu suggest the trade contacts between the north and south were well established 3,000 years before. Such piece of evidence helps us visualise the net-working system of India.

Jadhav said unless the patient’s house has enough rooms to isolate, the patient will be admitted to a Covid facility. The civic staff would be visiting that patient’s home to examine whether there are enough rooms to be isolated completely. During the first two waves, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has come across several cases of violation of the norms by Covid patients in home isolation. Some patients under home isolation were found moving in public places and they were institutionally quarantined, said NMC officials. “There has been a projection of the third wave in the next two months. Hence, NMC has started taking measures to provide proper infrastructure to treat Covid patients and also make institutional quarantine mandatory for those who don’t have separate rooms for isolation at houses,” said NMC officials. During the first wave last year, the number of active patients had increased to 6,200 in September. Around 80% of the patients were admitted to hospitals, while the remaining 20% were in home isolation. The second wave saw 80% of the patients in home isolation and the remaining 20% patients were admitted to Covid care centres (CCCs), dedicate Covid healthcare centres (DCHCs) and dedicated Covid hospitals. The number of active patients, which was only 500 in February this year, had increased to 28,000 on April 23. But the trend had reversed thereafter. Now, the number of active patients has drastically reduced to around 459 so far. Of them, 407 patients are hospitalised, while the remaining patients are home isolated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stricter-home-isolation-during-3rd-wave-nmc-chief/articleshow/85877349.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Pune||Indian injection for retinal disorders effective & economical: Pune study||Pune: A made-in-India drug found effective in stabilizing vision can cut down the cost of life-long eye treatment significantly, a study by Pune-based eye surgeons published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal has revealed. The anti-VEGF (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) injection is a life-long treatment meant for patients with retinal disorders like diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. Currently, it is the mainstream treatment that offers hope. Patients may lose vision permanently if they do not opt for it or quit midway. However, a sizeable number of patients stops the treatment as the cost of the imported injection is prohibitive. The prevalence studied has estimated that there are close to 1.1 crore patients suffering from various retinal disorders in India that necessitate prolonged treatment with anti-VEGF injections. Experts have also urged the Union government to slash the current taxes on the Indian-made injection and mandate insurance companies to cover the drug expenses to further support the patients and enhance treatment compliance. “The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved the use of the Made-in-India anti-VEGF injection in 2015 after a multi-centric robust trial found it to be effective in arresting the vision loss in patients with retinal disorders including age-related macular degeneration. The Indian drug can cut down the cost of the life-long treatment significantly,” eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO), a dedicated super specialty eye hospital in Pune, said. Kelkar and his team conducted a small study of 20 patients with age-related macular degeneration and found the drug not only very effective but also very economical. The study was published in the prestigious “Indian Journal of Ophthalmology” in June this year. “Compared with the imported jabs, the Indian injection can save approximately Rs 10,000 per vial for patients who may need to take this treatment lifelong,” Kelkar said. In an earlier study, Kelkar had interviewed 648 lost-to-follow-up patients of retinal disorders who were advised anti-IGVF injection and found that non-affordability was one of the factors. The study results represent the first real-world data regarding safety and efficacy of this made-in-India cost-effective anti-VEGF biosimilar drug. “Moreover, it is a singular study that has made assessment of the drug on various morphological features on multimodal imaging, whereby we have recorded promising outcomes. Long-term studies and larger sample size will validate the outcomes conclusively,” Kelkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indian-injection-for-retinal-disorders-effective-economical-pune-study/articleshow/85880129.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The association members said as the second Covid wave has ebbed, the Nashik residents have once again started travelling to various domestic destinations for holidays. According to TAAN, around 1,000 residents of Nashik are leaving daily for holidays and at least 25% of them are heading towards Leh. The other popular destinations include Goa, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Gujarat and northern India. The association members predicted that if there is no third wave, the number would further increase. Datta Bhalerao, a senior member and the former TAAN president, said so far Ladakh is the most preferred destination for the Nashikites. The tourism sector had been affected for the past one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic. But with the Covid scenario improving and the easing of Covid restrictions, the tourism sector is also improving. “Nashik residents have already started going to various destinations with their family and friends. We have improved around 50% of the business so far and booking will increase further considering the festive season and the year-end if there is no third wave,” said Bhalerao. “The travel agents have bookings till January next year. Earlier, Kerala and Rajasthan were the preferred destinations. But the tourism in both states has been affected due to Covid restrictions. Hence, people are mostly preferring Leh,” he said. It costs around Rs 50,000 each for an eight-day tour, he added. Hitesh Bapat, a tourist from Nashik, said, “I was planning to go to Leh for the past two years but could not. All of us were tired due to various Covid restrictions during the last 18 months. But finally, along with five family members, I went on an eight-day tour to Leh a couple of weeks ago. It was a very good experience,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/leh-emerges-as-favourite-holiday-destination-for-residents-of-nashik/articleshow/85877416.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Delhi||Delhi Police to court: Sharjeel Imam challenged sovereignty||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police alleged before a city court on Thursday that JNU student Sharjeel Imam, through his speeches, was trying to imbibe a feeling of hopelessness among a particular community and his alleged call to burn detention camps was not peaceful. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during hearing of his bail pleas in the case in which Imam has been booked for sedition and under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly giving inflammatory speeches at various places across the country. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, claimed that Imam in his speech given at Asansol on January 22, 2020 said that most of the people who were on the roads didn’t know why they were there. “Imam also specified that people are not on roads for CAA or NRC but because of something else. He has made it abundantly clear that CAA or NRC was not the issue. Issues were triple talaq, Kashmir for which the mobilisation was happening. Also in past speeches, he has given a clear indication that everything is over, as Muslims you have no hope,” Prasad alleged. He further read out the transcript of Imam’s speeches filed with the chargesheet and said that the accused allegedly said that the issue of CAA/NRC was an issue of several countries and he would not listen to the Indian government. “Is he not challenging sovereignty? He says the Indian government cannot formulate the law in India. That is what he questions. He is trying to imbibe a sense of hopelessness that they (Muslims) have no hope left… He said detention camps will be set on fire. What more can be said to incite violence?… How can someone say that this is peaceful?” the public prosecutor alleged. While reading out the transcript of Imam’s speech given at Gaya on January 23, Prasad said that Imam’s first step was allegedly to bring the masses together, then give them anger from within and then utilise it. “And we must keep in mind that he is somebody who has done his thesis on riots. He knows what he is saying. He knows riots,” he further alleged. Imam has sought bail in the case, claiming he did not participate or encourage any violence during any protest or demonstration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-to-court-sharjeel-challenged-sovereignty/articleshow/85880173.cms||Usha Das
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: After 35 years, HMDA and DCI still fighting in courts over Rs 1 crore dues||HYDERABAD: Almost 35 years after entering into an agreement to dredge a couple of sites in Hussainsagar, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) and the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) are still battling it out in courts over payment. The case is now in the Telangana high court which took up hearing on Thursday. The dispute is over nearly Rs 1 crore in idling charges which the HMDA (then HUDA) has refused to pay DCI which was contracted in December 1986 to dredge Hussainsagar at Budha Purnima project and Sanjeevaiah Park. The work was to be finished by December 1987, but was eventually completed in 1989. The HMDA had also promised in writing that the contract would be further extended, but it did not. As DCI waited with its dredgers due to the promise of extension, it claimed the idle time for this extended wait period also. HMDA has been refusing to accede to this because the issue of idling was not there in writing in clear terms. The appointment of arbitrator in 1993 by DCI — four years after the contract period ended — was also not permissible under law, claimed HMDA counsel Y Rama Rao. This arbitrator ruled in DCI favour after 10 years in 2003. But with HMDA not budging, the same year DCI dragged it to the civil court which again ruled in its favour after almost 15 years on Nov 22, 2018. This was finally challenged by the HMDA after 371 days in the high court in March 2020. But the case was left hanging again as the pandemic struck. On Thursday, after the case came up for hearing before a bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar, DCI challenged the condoning of delay of 371 days in HMDA appeal and sought time to file its counter. The HC gave it two weeks to file it and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-35-years-hmda-and-dci-still-fighting-in-courts-over-rs-1-crore-dues/articleshow/85882418.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Pune||‘Data entry delay behind higher Covid positivity rate in Pune’||PUNE: Delay in data entry of ‘negative test reports’ on the state portal has resulted in a higher positivity rate for the district in the cabinet note, the Pune district authorities said on Thursday. The state cabinet note presentation by the public health department has shown the weekly positive rate (WPR) of Pune district at 6.15%. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh confirmed that the higher positivity rate for Pune in the cabinet note was due to some delay in data entry of negative Covid reports. “With the cases having gone down in the district, some contractual staffers have been relieved of their duties. This has delayed the data entry. This will be corrected and I have instructed the health officials to do it at the earliest,’’ he told TOI. Many districts have been facing data entry or reconciliation of data issues, he added. Pune collector had on Wednesday said there were nearly 32,000 tests done in one day in the district and the day’s positivity rate was 3.3%. Between August 26 and September 1, Pune’s positivity rate has been 4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/data-entry-delay-behind-higher-vity-rate-in-pune/articleshow/85880195.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||IIT-Indore using AI to develop network to detect fires in Melghat Tiger Reserve||Nagpur: With forest fires a major cause of concern, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Indore is working on a pilot project to develop a wireless sensor network (WSN) with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to detect forest fires in Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Amravati district. AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. A WSN network is a group of specialized sensors with a communications infrastructure for monitoring and recording conditions at diverse locations. The project is the brainchild of Dr Abhishek Srivastava, associate professor with the department of computer science and engineering. He said, “Our team is working on putting together a sophisticated surveillance system harnessing machine learning to more effectively detect forest fires.” “The approach involves deployment of WSN motes (remote devices) laden with sensors to detect fires. Forest fires are a great cause of destruction in the wild, often leading to a loss of flora and fauna, and forcing the displacement of the local population,” said Srivastava. It was during a casual chat with a friend working for conservation in Melghat that the idea evolved and Dr Srivastava came to know how these fires are detected. Maharashtra is vulnerable to forest fires. As reported by TOI on June 18, 2021, of the over 3.86 lakh fire alerts issued nationally by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) based on satellite data, Maharashtra recorded 60,851 alerts, which comes to 16% of the total incidents in the country. As per FSI data, there was a record number of fires between January and May as compared to the last two years. Most of these fires reported in April and May were man-made and ignited for mahua and tendu leaves collection. “The task is fully reliant on a manual effort by forest officials and field staff who go for long walks, and in the absence of any connectivity, run back to inform of a mishap, taking a long time to extinguish fires. Moreover, Melghat’s rugged terrain makes fighting fires a Herculean task,” says Srivastava. “We worked on the WSN technology but the main issue with such WSN deployments is that they are frequently prone to false positives. For example, the heat sensor of a mote may be stimulated by the rays of the sun on a particularly hot summer day, and this may be misconstrued to be a fire,” said Srivastava. “The humidity sensor may falsely assume a fire on a humid day. To overcome such scenarios, the idea is to appropriately train machine learning algorithms to minimize incidents of false positives,” he said. The norm is to deploy such algorithms on the back-end cloud with infinite resources and send back signals from individual sensors for decision-making. Given the energy-starved environment of a dense forest like Melghat, however, doing this is impracticable. The team, therefore, is working on developing extremely ‘lean’ machine learning algorithms that can be deployed on the resource-constrained WSN motes, and are capable of correctly detecting forest fires. Lean algorithms for classification, anomaly detection, and localization have already been developed and deployed on a pilot WSN network within the IIT, Indore, campus. Deployment and testing of these algorithms at the Melghat Tiger Reserve will be conducted once the pandemic restrictions are completely lifted. “We will talk to forest officials before taking up the project,” he said. The project is designed by Dr Srivastava along with his collaborator at the University of Alberta, Dr Osmar Zaiane, and their team of students comprising Arun Kumar, Ankit Jain, Prarthi Jain, Uttkarsh Aggarwal, and Seemandhar Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/iit-indore-using-ai-to-develop-network-to-detect-fires-in-melghat-tiger-reserve/articleshow/85877519.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The death toll in Firozabad has now mounted to 65 in the last three weeks, with 50 of the patients being children, according to sources in the health department. Sources also told TOI that at least 5,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals. In Baghpat, the community health centre recorded a rush of 600 patients with high fever on Thursday while facilities in Muzaffarnagar also witnessed scores of patients with viral infection. Dr Dinesh Singh, Baghpat chief medical officer (CMO), said that Baraut CHC, which used to get 40 to 60 patients every day, is now seeing more than 200 patients in out-patient department (OPD) on a regular basis since the last 10 days. CMO of Meerut Dr Akhilesh Mohan also admitted that thousands of patients with fever are flocking to OPDs in various government and private hospitals in the city. While the death toll from viral fever in Mainpuri stands at eight and 13 people have died in Mathura, the worst-hit district is Firozabad. Health centres are scrambling to arrange beds and more than 100 patients in critical condition have been referred to government hospitals in nearby districts. At the Firozabad medical college — the largest health facility in the district — 400 people are undergoing treatment for fever, including 345 children. Samples of 49 patients tested positive for dengue on Thursday. A health department official told TOI that none of the samples tested in the last three weeks were found positive for Covid-19. “Most patients have dengue-like symptoms, such as high temperature, dehydration and sudden drop in platelets,” he said. The facility has a capacity of 100 beds which was increased to 300 last week. Hospital staff said beds were being added by the hour to accommodate more patients. But on Thursday afternoon, people and children were seen lying on benches and floors on the premises of the medical college as it ran out of beds. For many, it brought back memories of the second wave of the pandemic when hospital beds were scarce. Ajay Kumar, a resident of Daman village, lost his four-year-old son to the illness last week. “Precious time was lost as we went from one place to another looking for a bed. Finally, we admitted him to a private hospital but his platelets were too low by then,” he said. Police have been deployed at the medical college and other government health centres to maintain law and order situation. On Thursday, a team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) also arrived in the district on the orders of the health ministry to study the viral fever outbreak. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said all districts have been put on alert. “Firozabad is under 24-hour monitoring. Special teams of health department officials and scientists have been sent to study the nature of vector-borne disease spreading in the district.” Additional director of the health department, A K Singh, added that additional ambulances have been arranged and special cleanliness drives are being conducted in affected areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hundreds-outside-health-centres-with-viral-fever-65-dead-in-firozabad-so-far/articleshow/85877507.cms||Ishita Mishra

Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav framed charges against Noor Mohammad in the case related to alleged looting and setting on fire a tailoring shop by a riotous mob at Khajuri Khas on February 24, 2020. “I am of the considered opinion that prima facie there is enough material on record to frame charges against the accused under requisite sections,” the judge said in the order. The court noted that though, there was no specific CCTV footage/video clip of the incident available on record, however, at this stage there was ocular evidence in the form of supplementary statement dated April 2, 2020, of complainant Mohd Hanif, whereby he has categorically named/identified the accused to be part/member of the riotous mob at the relevant time. It added that Hanif’s statement finds corroboration from the statement of constable Sangram, who was posted as the beat constable in the area at the time. The accused’s counsel claimed he has been falsely implicated in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rioting-charges-against-man-who-set-shop-on-fire/articleshow/85880229.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||High court poser to CBI on probe into illegal mining case involving Karnataka ex-minister Gali Janardhan Reddy||HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of the high court on Thursday sought to know from the CBI about its investigation in the illegal mining case involving Karnataka former minister Gali Janardhan Reddy, AP IAS officer Y Srilakshmi and others. The judge was hearing a petition filed by Srilakshmi, who wanted deferment of certain key stages of the trial like hearing of discharge petitions and framing charges in the illegal mining case. Her counsel K Raghavacharyulu raised an objection over the CBI court’s action in proceeding to hear the discharge pleas of the accused in the case. He wants that session to be deferred because the investigation is not over yet. According to him, the CBI has to complete its probe in two aspects. While one is related to the inter-state dispute between Bellary Iron Ore Company (BIOP) and Obulapuram Mining Company (OMC) belonging to Janardhan Reddy, the other pertains to the border dispute that arose in respect of the same tussle. The borderline that separates AP and Karnataka should be demarcated clearly to decide whether the alleged illegal mining was done beyond the permitted areas, he said. The CBI could complete only the dispute between BIOP and OMC and the border dispute is still pending, he said. The CBI has filed four chargesheets in the OMC case so far and is likely to file more once it completes the border aspect also. CBI counsel K Surender said their probe was over in respect of the OMC case and have informed it to the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-poser-to-cbi-on-probe-into-illegal-mining-case-involving-ktaka-ex-min/articleshow/85882477.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Parthasarathy was arrested on August 19 on charges of raising bank loans by pledging the shares of KSBL's clients. Police immediately began questioning several associates before the eventual arrests were made on Thursday. Hyderabad joint commissioner of police (detective department) Avinash Mohanty said the CFO diverted the loan amount allegedly into nine other companies. Rajiv, who is in-charge of trading and broking in KSBL, used the money parked in nine different companies for trading. “Krishna Hari diverted funds to nine shell companies as per the oral instructions of Parthasarathy for showing huge turnover and market share of KSBL in stock market. This caused huge loss of Rs 300 crore, which was shown as book debts,” Hyderabad police said in an official release. “Parthasarathy, by suppressing the facts, pledged the securities belonging to KSBL clients without their consent and by misusing power of attorney. The securities were transferred into the demat account of Karvy and pledged before the complainant bank for margin and short-term requirement in the business of KSBL from March 2013,” it said. Officials said from KSBL, the two diverted money into the nine companies, whose trading accounts were again allegedly opened by these companies in the parent company (KSBL). “Since it was KSBL which was in possession of trading accounts of these nine companies as its clients, the accused used to operate it,” the statement added. C Parthasarathy's bail plea rejected:The bail petition moved by KSBL chairman and MD C Parthasarathy on Thursday was rejected by the Nampally criminal court.Immediately after the arrested, he had moved a petition seeking bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karvy-ceo-cfo-arrested-as-bank-fraud-probe-widens/articleshow/85883525.cms||---

About six crore beneficiaries have been administered Covid-19 vaccine doses in Maharashtra so far. Of them, about 1.62 crore residents have received both the doses. Tope said intensifying the vaccination drive was the main strategy in Maharashtra because it was among the states having the highest number of active cases. He stressed on vaccinating as many people as possible before the upcoming festivities. The state cabinet on Wednesday discussed the unique vaccination drive strategy in Pune, where local bodies were tying up with industries to get vaccines under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds.

Nagpur, have written a letter to the chief of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) complaining against Dr Sudhir Gupta, the in-charge dean of the medical college. According to the staffers, Dr Gupta is mentally harassing them. Dr Gupta claimed that some of the staffers are planning conspiracy against him because he has “implemented some much-awaited and long-pending administrative reshuffles”. The seven-point letter signed by 84 employees mainly alleges use of raw language and arrogant behaviour by Dr Gupta. “The dean passes personal comments on employee when someone takes files to him for approval. He makes the clerks wait for hours for one signature,” reads the letter. “The dean also threatens to ruin our service record and calls us thieves, corrupt and incompetent,” the employees have written. Employees have also alleged that Dr Gupta serves show-cause notices for no reason, stops salaries of employees and targets some selected employees personally. The copy of the letter has been sent to medical education minister Amit Deshmukh, guardian Minister Nitin Raut, district collector and president of state Human Rights Commission. When TOI contacted Dr Gupta, he said since taking over as in-charge dean of GMCH, he has introduced some major reshuffles and administrative changes for betterment of the institution. “This has irked some of the staffers,” he said. According to Dr Gupta, administrative reshuffles pending from last 10 years were done under his tenure and “many senior employees had to leave the table they were handling for years together”. “These senior employees have created this controversy and some juniors were threatened to sign the letter,” he said. Dr Gupta said he has called a meeting of administrative officials and employees on Friday at 11 am. “I hope we will sort out the issue soon,” he said. A veteran in the field of gastroenterology, Dr Gupta took over as in-charge dean of GMCH in February this year after Dr Sajal Mitra took voluntary retirement. GMCH has fought the second wave of Covid-19 and a surge in mucormycosis cases during Dr Gupta’s tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dean-insults-us-threatens-to-ruin-service-record-gmch-staffers/articleshow/85877556.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Himabindu (23) was found buried under the sand near a stream where the body of her cousin Sindhuja was found on August 30 evening. Both Himabindu and Sindhuja were washed away on August 30 in swirling waters of Dosalavagu in Rajapeta village. They were pillion riding a bike, which was stuck in Dosalavagu in Kurraram village. Shravan, who was riding the bike, managed to get out. Sindhuja’s (26) body was found on the same evening near Parupalli stream. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and fire services personnel, police and revenue authorities, who were engaged in the search operations for the last four days, detected Himabindu’s body near the stream.

Work at Harris Bridge, where the Metro will cross the Mula river, has been expedited. MahaMetro said that construction of the pillars across the river has been completed and the installation of girders from both ends of the bridge has started in full swing. Officials said the construction of a viaduct after the Dapodi Metro station up to Harris bridge has been completed. MahaMetro is working to construct the viaduct at Harris Bridge at the earliest. Most pillars are ready after Harris bridge, said officials. The Metro viaduct will not disturb the movement of vehicles on the bridge, said MahaMetro officials. This is because the viaduct is not landing on the bridge and is placed way above the carriageway of both wings of the bridge, said officials, adding that they are ensuring traffic disruption is minimum. The Metro viaduct at Harris bridge will connect the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations. The Mula river is a natural boundary between the jurisdictions of the two civic bodies. The Metro work in the Khadki section had been progressing slowly till the last few months due to the non-availability of land and necessary permissions. Work has been expedited and some traffic changes have also been introduced in the area. Officials said focus is on completing construction of the pillars and stations in the Dapodi-Khadki stretch.

In an ongoing case, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) recently took the rare step of ordering the company’s managing director Mohit Arora to remain present in each hearing. The direction came after Arora appeared before the Commission only in response to bailable warrants issued against him in April this year in connection with failure to give possession to joint buyers of a villa in Sector 17A of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area despite a long delay. The compensation for delay was also not paid. Taking a serious view of the company’s failure to abide by earlier commission orders, a bench comprising member C Vishwanath and Justice Ram Surat Ram Maurya directed Arora’s presence at every hearing, with the case next listed on September 20. The MD had appeared before the apex consumer body and gave a commitment that the builder would give possession of the villa within 60 days and “on this assurance”, the commission cancelled the warrant against him. Despite winning compensation for delay at the rate of 9% interest, Greater Noida resident, Kanwal Batra and his daughter have till now failed to either get the money or the property booked in the “Upcountry” project offered by the builder in December 2013 at a cost of approximately Rs 1.03 crore which the builder had promised to deliver in August 2014. It had six months’ grace period in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Appearing for the buyers, advocate Vrinda Kapoor highlighted that the project had no certificates without which possession can’t be handed over. She told the Commission that while the developer keeps offering possession claiming the completion certificate will be issued soon, the customers have been kept waiting and not been compensated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/consumer-panel-orders-supertechs-md-to-be-present-at-each-hearing/articleshow/85880366.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Ahmedabad||AMC gets in motion on single-window TDR clearance for heritage homes||AHMEDABAD: Four years after it was inscribed a world heritage site, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has now launched a ‘single window clearance’ system for heritage conservation and restoration permissions for owners of listed heritage homes and institutions. The standing committee on Thursday approved the policy. The committee was also informed that 13 listed heritage buildings have been demolished while 230 heritage homes are yet to tagged with special heritage plates. According to the new policy, owners of heritage properties in the walled city will not have to apply separately for heritage elements assessment, road line deductions and to the ASI for NOCs to apply for transfer of development rights (TDR) certificates. TDR can be sold to developers so that the funds can be used by heritage home owners for repair and conservation. “Earlier, the applicant had to submit three different affidavits to three different departments for permissions. Now this will not be the case. An applicant who wants to restore his or her property has to apply to the AMC on a Rs 300 stamp paper. The rest will be handled by the AMC,” said a senior AMC official. AMC standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said detailed documentation of timber heritage buildings is being prepared and will be provided to the individual home owners free of cost.  “With this new arrangement, there will be greater co-ordination between the town development officer (TDO) and the heritage department of the AMC while processing files for TDR purposes,” said a senior AMC official. Sources told TOI that the AMC is yet to come out with a conservation plan for the heritage zone. It is reliably learnt that it has also not finished documenting the 1,800 timber havelis — a document that was to be submitted to Unesco by September 2019. The AMC has thrice failed to meet deadlines it had committed to Unesco since October 2017.  Now, anticipating a surprise review visit from the Unesco thinktank International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), the AMC wrote to ASI in Delhi a fortnight ago, to appeal to Unesco for an time extension so it can come out with a conservation plan, citing Covid as the reason for the delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-gets-in-motion-on-single-window-tdr-clearance-for-heritage-homes/articleshow/85880564.cms||---

Releasing a survey ahead of the National Nutrition Month, doctors reminded how a greater focus must be on diet and nutrition, and the role it plays to help improve overall health. About 34% of people here ignored early signs of poor nerve health, which was lower than the country average of 60% respondents ignoring early symptoms, the P&G ‘Nerve Health Survey’ conducted in 12 Indian cities by Heal Health, a worldwide health research body, said. “Majority of people lack proper knowledge about the impact of Vitamin B on health in general and nerve health in particular. However, without B-group vitamins the body lacks energy. Vitamin B12 contributes significantly to ensuring nerve health. Any person who has a poor diet for a few months, may end up with Vitamin B12 deficiency,” said Dr Rakesh Sahay, professor of endocrinology, Department of Endocrinology, Osmania Medical College at a media conference. “For this reason, it’s important that adequate amounts of Vitamin B12 either in food or in supplements must be taken regularly as part of a well-balanced and nutritious diet,” he added. Despite its importance the awareness about its role and the food sources of the vitamin are misunderstood, doctors said. “When we asked about symptoms of poor nerve, only 50% people could relate it with nerve health, even though they were experiencing the symptoms. The most common symptoms of deteriorating nerve health meanwhile include dizziness, muscle weakness, pins and needles sensation in limbs, numbness of limns, lack of coordination and losing balance,” added Dr Mangesh Tiwaskar, general secretary, Association of Physicians of India (API). The nerve damage caused by a lack of Vitamin B12 may become permanently debilitating, doctors added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/deficiency-of-b-vitamins-leading-to-nerve-damage-survey/articleshow/85882568.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Plea to stop divorce filing in foreign court rejected||Mumbai: The Bombay high court rejected a petition by a man to restrain his estranged wife residing in Australia from filing for divorce or any other proceeding in a matrimonial dispute in the foreign court. Married in 2004, the couple almost always were abroad for work in various countries and in Australia since 2015. The husband said he returned to India in 2019 and filed a divorce petition before the family court in Bandra, but the judge there rejected his interim application for an anti-suit injunction, a plea to prevent her initiating any legal suit abroad. “Their stay in Australia cannot be regarded as a short stay for a temporary period, which otherwise could have been regarded as one of the factors for grant of anti-suit injunction,” said Justice M S Karnik, finding no reason to interfere with the order of the Bandra family court. Justice Karnik, however, expressed a “fond hope that the warring couple resolve their disputes amicably and at the earliest keeping in mind that apart from the hardships the parties are facing, it is their minor son who is worst affected by this unfortunate estrangement”. The high court said that the child is “already a subject matter of a parenting agreement”. The high court said that whether it be in the foreign court or the Indian court, the parties must try to resolve the dispute amicably keeping the child’s interest foremost. The agreement between the parties pertaining to child security was reacehd at the Family Relationship Centre in Australia. Both husband and wife are in their forties now. The wife’s counsel, Himanshu Nagarkar and Anagha Nimbkar, said she had filed an application in Australia for division of assets in 2019 before the husband’s divorce petition in the city. Her plea is pending now before the family court there. The husband through his senior counsel Atul Damle with advocate Prasad Gajbhiye had sought the uncommon relief to restrain the wife. The high court noted that the husband had given an undertaking in the asset division case that he will not transfer any properties or assets situated outside Australia to third parties. The high court said the husband has to show how he will suffer grave prejudice unless she is prohibited from petitioning an Australian court and noted that both his petitions in India—before the family court and high court—were filed not by him but via a power of attorney. In 2019 he had said he was out of the country for a few months. The high court also said the husband had expressed his intention in 2015 to an “immigration specialist” to permanently settle in Australia. The high court said “foreign courts cannot be presumed to exercise its jurisdiction wrongly even after one of the party is able to prove that the parties in the case continue to be governed by law governing Hindus in India.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plea-to-stop-divorce-filing-in-foreign-court-rejected/articleshow/85882590.cms||---

The high court also allowed Dammalapati and others to claim compensation from the complainant for intimidation and harassment. Based on a complaint by one K Srinivasa Swamy Reddy, ACB had registered an FIR against Dammalapati, his family members and friends. It alleged that Dammalapati misused his position as additional advocate general by sharing information he was privy to on where the new capital of Andhra Pradesh would come up after bifurcation in 2014, and amassed huge wealth in Amaravati. It was alleged that Dammalapati purchased landed properties through his family members, relatives and friends in and around Amaravati. ACB also alleged that he cheated farmers by purchasing their lands at throwaway prices before the announcement of capital and the value of same lands increased manifold after declaration of location of the capital. Dammalapati had challenged the FIR in the high court. In his 63-page judgment, Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy concluded that the prosecution had failed to make out a case under any of the sections in the FIR. The judge dismissed allegations of insider trading observing that the such sections are applicable only to trading in securities, bonds and other instruments of publicly listed companies. He also noted that the information on location of the capital was in the public domain and Dammalapati, though a public servant, was not part of the decision-making process on the location of the capital. Justice Roy also dismissed charges of cheating by observing that when there was no grievance from the sellers, there was no case to make out from a vague complaint from a complete stranger. The high court had earlier passed an interim order directing the ACB to stop all further proceedings in the case. The state government had challenged the order in the Supreme Court which upheld the interim order. Following the orders of the Supreme Court, the high court heard the arguments on both sides. Senior counsel Siddharth Luthra argued on behalf of Dammalapati stating that the entire case was foisted with political motives and without any basis. He said the case was a perfect example of ‘regime revenge’. Arguing on behalf of ACB and the state government, advocate general S Sriram stated that the ACB did not get a chance to investigate deeper because of the court orders. He pleaded to let the inquiry be done according to law to verify all facts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-hc-quashes-fir-against-ex-ag-in-amaravati-land-scam/articleshow/85883540.cms||Srikanth Aluri

We are now focusing on the completion of the second dose of these beneficiaries via reminders to them.” When asked if 100% vaccination of these categories would be possible, Deshmukh said there was a possibility if the healthcare and frontline workers got vaccinated from the general citizens’ category. Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India of the Indian Medical Association, said, “Initially, there were a lot of issues with the registration process when the vaccination process started on January 16. Many medical experts got vaccinated from the general citizen category.

A proposal to this effect was passed by the board of directors of the transport body on Thursday. Senior PMPML officials said the process of identifying the market demand would start soon. “The idea is to use the PMPML’s land for commercial purposes based on the market demand in that particular area and the business potential,” Chetna Kerure, the joint managing director of the PMPML, told TOI. Shopping complex, mall, office space or a hospital can come up on these plots, another official said. “The plan will be based on the market demand. For instance, if there is a demand for a hospital in a particular area and a party is interested, the PMPML will provide its plot. The revenue-sharing model will be finalized,” the official said. The official said the plan to set up solar panels on different PMPML properties has also been approved. “The panels could be rooftop or elevated and will help in saving energy. PMPML chairman and managing director will decide the properties, which should have these panels,” the official added. In November last year, PMPML announced 30 fuel stations on their plots to increase non-fare revenue and an agreement has been signed with petroleum firms. “If the PMPML has so many land parcels, why are their buses kept in the open near PMC building? There are 30-40 buses parked in the open near the PMC main building,” a daily commuter said. Daily pass cost restructured The rate of bus passes were restructured during the PMPML board of directors’ meeting on Thursday. For travelling in the PMC area, one can buy the daily pass for Rs 40 now. For a pass for the PMC and PCMC areas, the cost is Rs 50. For travelling in the PMC, PCMC and PMRDA areas, the cost of the daily pass is Rs 70.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-board-gives-nod-to-commercialise-land-parcels/articleshow/85880326.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Pune||Ward-level funds used most for cleaning drainage: Report||Pune: Drainage cleaning appears to be the top priority of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) corporators as far as spending of the ward-level funds are concerned. Out of the Rs 90.90 crore funds utilised by the corporators, nearly Rs15.31crore has been spent on drainage cleaning in the last four years. The second most favourite work of the elected members appears to be distribution of cloth and jute bags. The elected members have spent Rs12.57crore on distribution of these bags, reveals a report by Parivartan, a non-governmental organisation. The group has compiled a “report card” of corporators based on various parameters, including attendance in general body meetings and questions raised by elected members. The five heads under which the local level funds have been utilised is listed in the study. The report published by the NGO on Thursday stated that disaster management work has received prominence amid the spread of the virus. Around Rs6.59 crore (nearly 7.3%) has been spent on Covid-related work from ward-level funds. Expenses for cleaning and removal of debris were Rs5.71 crore (6.3%) and for streetlight repairs and electrical maintenance Rs 5.52 crore (6.1%). Each elected member has spent Rs56.11 lakh on an average from ward-level funds since getting elected in 2017. “Ferreting out information from the civic administration was a tough task,” said Indraneel Sadlage, the NGO president. Bhakti Bhave, a member of the survey group, said, “Citizens should see if the money has been utilised for the right purpose,” she said. “Some work like distribution of bags and buckets was carried out for creating awareness. But now this distribution has stopped due to the pandemic,” said Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC. Aba Bagul, the Congress leader in PMC, said, “The general body meeting of the PMC is being conducted online. So many elected members could not express themselves in the meeting,” he said. Prithviraj Sutar, the Shiv Sena leader in PMC, said, “The ruling BJP in PMC has not allowed elected members to ask questions citing prevalence of pandemic. They have used this opportunity to silence the voice of dissent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ward-level-funds-used-most-for-cleaning-drainage-report/articleshow/85880376.cms||---

The cash-strapped NMC does not want additional financial burden to maintain the gardens and submitted a proposal to the general body meeting to be held online on September 8 to discuss the issue. In June 2020, NMC had taken over 44 gardens developed by NIT. The handing over of the parks was done without the knowledge and approval of the NMC general body. On March 18 this year, NMC’s general body had directed the civic administration to return the gardens to NIT. However, on March 23, NIT chairman refused to take back the gardens and cited rules to place the responsibility on NMC to maintain and conserve the gardens. Due to NMC-NIT’s differences, the maintenance of all these 44 gardens has been badly hit. Citizens have started complaining about their poor upkeep, NMC’s garden department proposal stated. It is now up to the general body to take a decision in this regard, a senior official from the department said. Recently, Gadkari had suggested that the civic body should maintain all gardens, while NIT should take care of all the playgrounds. TOI had reported that Gadkari directed NMC to not ask NIT for any funds for operation and maintenance of the city gardens. Meanwhile, with a view to compensate for the non-operation of Aapli Bus during the coronavirus-induced lockdown period, the NMC transport department has decided to extend the contract of three red bus operators by seven months. The department has submitted a proposal to this effect before the general body. As per the agreement, NMC is supposed to give assured payment for 200km per day per bus. However, during the Covid-induced lockdown, NMC had suspended the city bus operations for almost seven months from March 23, 2020. It only operated 60 buses (20 each from red bus operators) for transporting citizens to quarantine centres. The assured payment to all the three bus operators is around Rs14 crore. “Instead of giving the money, we have decided to extend the contract tenure,” a senior official from the transport department said. “If okayed by the general body, the contract period of the operators will be increased by 219 days (about seven months). So they will run the city bus operation for more than 10 years,” the senior official explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-house-to-decide-fate-of-44-nit-gardens/articleshow/85877618.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Traders at wholesale and retail medicine markets said that the sale of medicines witnessed a rise after May. The sale of Covid-19 medicines had fallen by 80 per cent in the city after a decline in new Covid cases and a high recovery rate. However, after a steep rise in the cases of viral fever, traders in wholesale and retail medicine markets noticed an unprecedented rise in the sale of fever medicines like paracetamol and other antibiotics like Azithromycin, Doxycycline and others. Prayag Chemist & Druggist Association (Retail) organising secretary Nikhil Malang told TOI, “The sale of medicines has gone up about 30 per cent in last few days." He added: “Medicine traders in retail business had to place new orders for fever related medicines, anti-allergic and antibiotics when demand for drugs is increasing by every day and more customers lined up to get medicines”. Malang, however, said that there was adequate stock of medicines required for fever in the drug markets. Earlier, the sale of medicines grew exponentially between April 3 and April 26 when Covid cases were rising and hit a peak during the second wave but the demand started to decline gradually after April 28 as the spread of infection was controlled and the sale of Covid related medicines declined up to 70 per cent. Doctors at government hospitals and private nursing homes, meanwhile, asserted that such fever cases have increased during the monsoon. They claimed, “These are not Covid-19 cases, but the usual respiratory ailments that affect people during the monsoon season and cause high fever, cold and cough." Given the increasing viral fever cases in the districts across the state, the state health authorities have also come with a surveillance and awareness program in the majority of the districts of UP from September 7 to 16, in which health workers will go door-to-door and identify those with fever and Covid-19 symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/demand-for-fever-medicines-up-by-30-after-rise-in-viral-infection-cases/articleshow/85909153.cms||---

The flyover caters to more than 1 lakh commuters daily. Delhi Traffic Police tweeted that repair work of the expansion joints on one carriageway of Rajnagar flyover on Ring Road had been completed. Subsequently, the carriageway from Dhaula Kuan to Safdarjung Hospital was opened. “The work will continue for the next 20 days. As a result, traffic will ply on only one carriageway of the flyover. The AIIMS to Dhaula Kuan side will be closed. Heavy vehicles and buses will be diverted on the at-grade road along the flyover,” said a traffic official. A senior PWD official said that repair work was being carried out in phases to minimise the inconvenience to commuters. The expansion joints had not been repaired for over five years and maintenance was required urgently. Expansion joints allow continuous flow of traffic on flyovers, while accommodating movement, shrinkage and temperature variations on concrete and steel structures. The overall repair plan was submitted by PWD to Delhi Traffic Police in the beginning of August and it was approved mid-month. PWD also plans to carry out repairs on the Africa Avenue flyover in the third phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/repairs-start-on-second-side-of-rajnagar-flyover/articleshow/85880408.cms||---

Raje Mudhoji Bhosale, who too was present with Dhote at the press conference, extended his support to the sex workers of Ganga Jamuna. Dhote also pointed fingers at BJP for “fuelling” a civil war between Ganga Jamuna residents and local population. Dhote, flanked by Bhosale, author activist Aruna Sabane, Sunil Chokhare and others, said that police would be responsible for any law and order situation at Ganga Jamuna where the residents and sex workers are staging protests for a fortnight now. “We had approached the guardian minister (Nitin Raut) but he remained non-responsive. Now, should we go to his doorstep to seek intervention and justice?” she said. Dhote criticized CP for his “high-handedness”. Bhosale, who termed the sex workers of Ganga Jamuna as ‘Devdasis’, recalled his ancestor Raje Khandoji Bhosale had helped them to bring the deity of Lord Jagannath to city from Puri between 1770-1775. “We are not able to understand why the sudden drive to close down this historic place? People who take charge of Nagpur in any official capacity must know the history and facts of this place before taking any such drastic steps,” he said. He said closing down the locality and its activities without sparing any thought for livelihood of residents is inhumane. Sex workers present at the press conference demanded the barricades put up in their locality be removed. “Some of the local residents who used to visit the brothels are our opponents today,” said a sex worker. Another sex worker said that the CP must contemplate marrying them off to government servants to rehabilitate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-to-turn-ganga-jamuna-into-jallianwala-bagh-dhote/articleshow/85877732.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Maharashtra govt plans tweak in vaccination strategy, jab sessions to double||PUNE: The Maharashtra government is considering a tweak in its vaccination plan to vastly increase the number of beneficiaries it inoculates each day. A letter sent to all districts by Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary in the public health department, states that Maharashtra aims to increase the number of daily vaccination sessions to nearly 8,500 from the average of more than 3,000-4,000 it currently conducts every day. Dr Ramaswami N, National Health Mission commissioner, Maharashtra, told TOI on Thursday that the state is aiming for an average 13-15 lakh vaccinations per day to increase coverage. The state has also told municipalities to conduct three vaccination sessions per Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) a day and five sessions per Urban Community Health Centre (UCHC) a day, wherever these facilities are available. Vyas has told the district authorities to increase the number of vaccination sessions after the supply of Covid vaccines from the Union government increased this month. Two crore vaccine doses are likely to be made available to the state in September. Plans to rope in NCC, Ganesh mandals to step up vax speedVyas has also urged the district authorities and municipal corporations to hold meetings with Ganesh mandals, NGOs, National Cadet Corps (NCC) and religious leaders and seek their help in pushing up the turnout of vaccine beneficiaries. “A Covid vaccination monitoring committee should be set up for each village to keep a tab on preparation and planning of the inoculation sessions,” he said. Ramaswami said, “For the past few days, we are reaching an average of 9.5-10 lakh vaccinations per day in the state. We now want to further increase the daily shots following a boost in supply of doses from the Union government. The aim is to ensure that the daily vaccination numbers remain high for a sustained period and achieve full immunization in the state as soon as possible.” He said the health department was also closely monitoring how many sessions were being planned and conducted each day in the district. Ramaswami said even if the state got 3 crore doses in September, it would be able to utilise them. “Vaccine supplies in September are expected to be much more than what it was in the last two months. The current plan is to increase the number of sessions to a minimum 6,000 per day. The plan is to further push this to around 8,500 sessions. This will help the state increase the number of doses administered per day by another two to three lakh from the current average,” he said. “We are trying various methods, including participation of the public and elected representatives, to increase the number of beneficiaries,” Dr Ramaswami said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-plans-tweak-in-vaccination-strategy-jab-sessions-to-double/articleshow/85880488.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Nagpur||Ytl doctor patents way to write pronunciation of ‘L’ in Indian languages||Nagpur: Listeners can very easily notice the difference in pronunciation of the letter ‘L’ in Bengaluru when a typical Kannadiga speaks it, and when a person from the Hindi heartland pronounces it. Similarly, a native Tamilian will pronounce the letter L in word ‘Tamil’ by touching his tongue to the roof of his mouth, while others will pronounce ‘L’ by touching the tongue to the back of the teeth. But how do you write the unique pronunciation of ‘L’ in Tamil? This confusion in pronunciation is all set to end with a proper way of writing the ‘L’ invented by a radiologist from Yavatmal. ळ in Marathi, ళ in Telugu, ಳ in Kannada or ழ in Tamil are the consonant used quite popularly in these languages as well as many other Indian languages. But only the one letter L is used to represent these consonants while writing in English. Due to this, the proper Indic pronunciation of this letter remains unidentified while reading. Dr Raju Ramekar, a radiologist from Yavatmal, a city with the same L consonant in its name, shifted to Telangana for practice and realized people hardly ever pronounce the name of his home town properly. Dr Ramekar then designed a way to write the letter ‘L’ in the proper way to ensure correct pronunciation of the name of a person, place or object even while reading the consonant in English language. He suggested a simple change in writing ‘L’ to deal with this confusion. The letter will be underlined in such a way that readers should understand the difference. Yavatmal will thus be spelled Yavatmal and the underlined L sound will be pronounced properly. “The government of India has already used uppercase ā while writing ‘Bhārat’ to ensure the proper pronunciation of sound ‘aa’. The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) has many such modifications to preserve phonetic values of words. ‘L’ also deserves this,” Dr Ramekar said. He has recently got the copyright for the introduction of the phonetic alphabet as per guidelines of the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST). “If IAST and the government of India accept my copyrighted suggestion, the sound ‘L’ will be pronounced correctly all over the world. Even English speaking world will understand the difference,” he said. Currently, there is no uniformity in writing this sound in English. ळ is the 33rd consonant in Marathi and presently transliterated using simple L in English. ழ is 18th consonant in Tamil, and transliterated using ‘zh’. Hence, the correct spelling is Tamizh and many people still use it. The sound is also used in Telugu, Malyalam, Kannada, Konkani, Marwadi, Mewati etc languages, and Dr Ramekar’s design is all set to bring a big change in the way we write the names of cities like Lonavla, Khadala, Dhule, Bhusawal, Bengaluru etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ytl-doctor-patents-way-to-write-pronunciation-of-l-in-indian-languages/articleshow/85877860.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

This technology was developed to counter air pollution caused by stubble burning. The bio-brick was developed as an alternative and sustainable building material that replaces stubble burning. When used in roofing and wall panelling, the bio-bricks could effectively reduce heat gain by five to six degrees. Compared to burnt clay bricks, bio-bricks would cost about ₹2-₹3 when mass-produced. A prototype of a guard cabin was designed and executed in the space allocated by IIT-H. The sample building is made up of bio-brick material with support from metal framework. “It is a perfect illustration of wealth from waste and we will be submitting a proposal for promoting its wider adoption by the rural community to the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare,” IIT-H director Prof BS Murty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-hs-bio-bricks-may-end-stubble-burning/articleshow/85880579.cms||---

Rain is expected to continue this week, with IMD forecasting light rain on Friday. The last time Delhi received more rain in September was in 2010 — 332.9mm, but through the month. IMD has placed Delhi’s overall rainfall this monsoon in the “excess” category at +29%. However, the distribution has been quite uneven, with North and Central districts having touched the “large excess” category at 112% and 75%, respectively, while neighbouring North East being the only district with a 37% deficit. New Delhi district is also in the “large excess” range. North East district has so far received 368.8mm rainfall as opposed to the normal 582.3mm.

The Gulf workers, who held a meeting in the constituency, also met the Jammikunta tahsildar and handed over petitions urging that ‘Gulf Bandhu’ financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh be implemented in Huzurabad as a pilot project. “There are 15 lakh Telangana workers toiling in Gulf countries and sending foreign exchange. If the armed forces are there on the borders to protect the country, Gulf workers render similar service. The foreign exchange they bring in is used to meet the country’s needs,” social worker and Gulf welfare activist Bheem Reddy Mandha said at a meeting of Gulf workers at Reddypalli village in Veenavanka village in Huzurabad. At another meeting held at Kamalapur, the Gulf workers urged both the Centre and state government to establish a system to take care of their needs. Activists demanded that a Gulf Board be formed to look at all the aspects of employment, including training and orientation before departure, dealing with fake job agents and rehabilitation and resettlement when they return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-demand-for-gulf-bandhu/articleshow/85880623.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Telangana to EC: Hold Huzurabad bypoll by September-end, Covid under control||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government informed the Election Commission of India (ECI) that it was ready for Huzurabad by-election if the commission decided to conduct it. Allaying fears over Covid-19 cases, the government said though positive cases are on the rise in a few districts, the situation was not alarming. The government is believed to have expressed its readiness for the elections during a video-conference held by the ECI on Wednesday. ECI deputy election commissioner Umesh Sinha interacted with state officials on the feasibility of holding the elections. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP M Mahender Reddy, home secretary Ravi Gupta, health secretary SAM Rizvi and senior officials were present at the meeting. “The ECI said it would take a decision soon. We said the coming festival season should be kept in view while deciding the election dates. Ganesh festival is on September 10 and Bathukamma festival and Dasara follow suit in the first and second week of October. Also, heavy police bandobust will be required during the polls,” a senior official, who participated in the meeting, told TOI. Officials said if the ECI wants to go ahead with the elections, the schedule should be announced in a week and polling held either by the end of September or first week of October. “The other option is that the notification can be issued after September 20 (after Ganesh immersion) and elections can be held after Dasara (October 15). However, the ECI did not say anything on the dates as it has to take other states into consideration,” another official said. All the major parties — TRS, BJP and Congress — have been conducting a high-voltage campaign in Huzurabad for the past two months by taking up padayatras, party meetings with workers and elected representatives, public meetings, castes and organisation meetings. The ECI had asked all the presidents and general secretaries of recognised national and state political parties to give their views on holding by-elections and general elections to the assemblies of five states and campaigning in view of the pandemic by August 30. The TRS left the issue to the ECI on conducting by-election. After seeking opinions from parties, the ECI had interacted with the state governments on the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-ec-hold-huzurabad-bypoll-by-sept-end-covid-under-control/articleshow/85880606.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Delhi||Why Delhi’s VIP areas get waterlogged||NEW DELHI: Wednesday’s rain resulted in major waterlogging in the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri, Golf Links, Connaught Place and other prominent roads under the New Delhi Municipal Council. While the civic body claimed that the intensity of downpour was the heaviest in the last 20 years with all major drains overflowing resulting in the flooding of capital’s VIP roads, residents claimed that the same thing happens every year. “Despite being a VIP area, the civic agency has not made arrangements to avoid waterlogging during heavy downpour. Every time, we face a similar situation. On Wednesday, water entered shops in Khan Market and the as nearby residential Lodhi Estate,” said Sanjiv Mehra of Khan Market Traders Association. NDMC official stated that the drains in their area discharge into the neighbouring corporation nallah and depending on the water level on these nallah, such situations occur occasionally. “Our drains merge into the corporation nallah, which goes into the Yamuna. With the high intensity of rain, waterlogging occurred in the area because the nallahs were already overflowing and were unable to handle the water discharged from our drains,” said a NDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhis-vip-areas-get-waterlogged/articleshow/85877902.cms||---

A team of forest personnel formed to crack the case were patrolling the locality around 3pm when they found the tusk. It is 1.5m long and weighs 15kg.Principal chief conservator of forests Shekar Kumar Niraj refused to divulge the name of the village. “It will hinder the ongoing investigation,” he told TOI. “It is the first time in Tamil Nadu that a poaching case has been cracked within four days of occurrence.”The 35-year-old animal was found dead near Kattipatti tribal hamlet by a patrolling team on August 29. While the elephant had lost one of its tusks long back in a suspected fight with another elephant, the other tusk was missing from the carcass, raising suspicion that it could be a case of poaching. Postmortem revealed that there were no external injuries. The cause of death could not be ascertained. Forest veterinarian A Sukumar said that an axe was used to remove the tusk. Forest officials are yet to identify the culprits. “The team has intensified efforts to trace the culprits,” Ganesan said. “Investigation is being conducted scientifically. We are using DNA profiling and analysing cellphone calls made around the time in the area,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/poached-elephant-tusk-recovered/articleshow/85880639.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrashekar Rao lays foundation for TRS office in Delhi, KT Rama Rao terms it historical||HYDERABAD: Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), which completed two decades in politics in April this year, has termed laying foundation of party office in the national capital as a symbol of Telangana’s ‘self-respect’, ‘pride’ and ‘self-existence’. In the presence of scores of TRS leaders, including ministers, MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other leaders, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao laid foundation for the party’s office in about 1200 square metres at Vasant Vihar in Delhi on Thursday afternoon. Amid chanting of mantras, the TRS president dug up a small portion of the earth and placed a brick as a symbol of initiating the work for the office. The proposed buildings with ground and three floors is expected to be completed in a year. TRS working president KT Rama Rao soon after the event described it as ‘historical’ as the party took birth at Jala Drushyam in Hyderabad by Telangana separate state movement leader K Chandrasekhar Rao and is now owning a building in the national capital. KTR recalled in the 14 years of the Telangana movement, the pink party had faced many hurdles, insults, problems and oppression when the word Telangana was unofficially banned by the earlier governments. “While continuing the agitation in the state (galli level), KCR lobbied for Telangana statehood in Delhi,” KTR said. He said KCR had accomplished two historical needs, “achieving Telangana and reconstruction of Telangana” successfully. “Now, TRS is going to have its own party office in Delhi. The party is the first regional party from south India to have party office in the national capital,” the TRS working president said. This gives immense pleasure not only to every party worker and leaders who have been sailing with the party from the movement days, but also every Telangana bidda to have party office in Delhi, he said. In the past seven years, Telangana has reached several milestones and has now become a symbol of self-pride of Telangana, KT Rama Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-lays-foundation-for-trs-office-in-delhi-ktr-terms-it-historical/articleshow/85880640.cms||Koride Mahesh

Pinto was India’s goalkeeper in the 1948 Olympics where he was part of the team that won the Gold medal for the country, and was known as one of the few goalkeepers to score a goal. “Goa has a rich sporting heritage, and is even today considered a powerhouse of sports in the country. It is important that our legends are not forgotten and are immortalised so that they can inspire future generations of Goenkars,” said AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre. Speaking further, Mhambre said that Pinto was rated among the best goalkeepers in the world. Pinto was immortalised in Indian hearts when he scored the final goal against Great Britain in the London Olympic finals, helping the team secure a Gold for India, he said. After retirement, Pinto took up coaching and was a member of the national selection committee of the Indian team that won the bronze medal at the 1972 Olympics in Munich. “It’s important that we remember our legends in Goa, our sons of the soil like Leo Pinto who was also from Mapusa where the Peddem stadium is located. It’s time the chief minister gives due recognition to our Goan sporting icons. They are the icons for our next generation,” said Mhambre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rename-peddem-hockey-stadium-after-leo-pinto-aap/articleshow/85880709.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Noida||Road blocked to protest waterlogging||Ghaziabad: Traffic came to a standstill on the busy Meerut Road near New Bus Adda Metro Station for nearly one-and-a-half hours on Thursday morning after hundreds of Patel Nagar residents staged a protest against the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) over waterlogging issues in their area.The residents complained that water regularly flows into their homes during heavy rains. They claimed a pillar has been constructed for the Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor over a drain in the area, following the GMC’s nod, due to which it’s blocked. Their complaints have only fallen on deaf ears, the protesters alleged. “The blocked drain is the reason behind waterlogging in the area. Every time it rains heavily, water enters our homes. The situation has become pathetic after Wednesday’s downpour. We have asked the GMC officials to make another way so that water could pass easily. But nothing has been done yet. Hence, we are protesting,” said Varun Kumar, a resident.According to the residents, nearly 90% of the houses here are affected. “Rain water entered my house last night. We had to shift our valuables to the first floor but there were many heavy items that could not be moved,” said Mukesh Singh, another resident. Police said the protesters had to be removed forcefully. “We told them to raise their complaints with the authorities concerned and not to make life difficult for commuters,” said Mithilesh Shukla, SHO, Sihani Gate .Ghaziabad municipal commissioner Mahendra Singh admitted that “the residents have a genuine grievance”. “We are in touch with the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NRCTC). Although the agency has laid a pipe there, its discharge capacity is low. The NRCTC has assured us that they will rectify the problem and restore the drainage system in a phased manner. For now, we have installed a pump to drain out the accumulated water from the area,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/road-blocked-to-protest-waterlogging/articleshow/85882830.cms||---

It had recently come to light that the city bus operator had sent 17 buses for the event at Kevadiya Colony. Also, Mayor Keyur Rokadiya had used the car to travel to the meeting. Some other party members had also travelled with him. Leader of Congress party in VMC, Ami Ravat, raised the issue in a letter to Rokadiya. She said that the bus operator had said openly in a statement that he was not going to charge for the buses he had provided for the BJP programme. She said that taking such favours from a contractor amounted to corruption. Ravat also alleged that there were a series of irregularities in the city bus operations too. Ravat was earlier denied the post of the opposition leader in the VMC on grounds that the Congress did not have sufficient numbers. She was also denied use of the car that was earlier earmarked for the leader of opposition. Ravat said that the cars given to the deputy mayor, standing committee chairman, leader of the ruling party and chief whip of the BJP in VMC were also in violation of the rules and should be withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mayors-car-for-bjpmeet-cong-cries-foul/articleshow/85877484.cms||---

The construction cost is expected to shoot up from around Rs 150 crore to over Rs 650 crore. In 2018, the civic body had proposed the flyover in Kora Kendra area of Borivali from Link Road to SV road area measuring around 930 metres at a cost of Rs 150 crore.

Civic officials said even though it’s an extension of the same project, it will be an entire new phase of work that will be carried out in Borivali east.

---||Nagpur||‘MVA responsible for slow pace of development in Nagpur’||NAGPUR: Two days after Congress city president and MLA Vikas Thakre specifically targeted the BJP leaders including Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and former CM Devendra Fadnavis for “failure of various projects”, “slow pace of work” and “massive corruption”, ruling party leader in the NMC and senior BJP corporator Avinash Thakre blamed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (of which Congress is a constituent) for stalling the development works in Nagpur. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Thakre claimed that in 2014 the pace of city’s development had picked up significantly when the Fadnavis government came to power in Maharashtra. However, with the change of guard in Maharashtra in 2019, the MVA government started playing dirty politics, he alleged. “The state government has started misusing administration by deputing a municipal commissioner who had put a halt to development works in the city,” he said “Though the civic chief was then transferred, the new commissioner slashed funds for the city’s development and provided only Rs55 crore for improvement of civic infrastructure in the city,” he claimed. The dirty politics of Congress did not stop here and the MVA government had stopped the special grant of Rs25 crore for state’s second capital started by the previous government, Thakre pointed out. It went further by withholding the works from the funds sanctioned by Fadnavis, said Thakre putting Nagpurians at inconvenience due to the stalled projects. “On one hand the city Congress leaders are pressuring the administration to stall the development works in Nagpur and on the other, they are making false allegations regarding NMC’s failure,” he accused. Even during the Covid crisis, the NMC did not receive any financial help from the state government, he claimed. As the NMC polls are nearing, the Congress is trying to lure citizens by issuing misleading statements, he pointed out. “The Congress will once again face defeat in the NMC polls and BJP will storm to power for a fourth consecutive term,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mva-responsible-for-slow-pace-of-development-in-city/articleshow/85877923.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Noida||Man who killed wife, kids harassed her family with false murder case||Noida: In the three years after Rakesh allegedly killed his wife and two kids as well as a friend to fake his own death, the family of his spouse Ratnesh had a harrowing time.While the family was running pillar to post to search for their missing daughter and grandchildren and had to approach a local court to get an FIR registered against Rakesh at the Bisrakh police station some eight months later, Rakesh’s brother Rajiv got a false murder case lodged against his father-in-law and two brothers-in-law at the same police station.Ratnesh’s father Motilal and her two brothers, Jitendra and Ravi, were booked by Kasganj police under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (disappearance of evidence).Kasganj police said that after killing Ratnesh (then 27) and children Avni (3) and Arpit (1) and burying their bodies in the basement of their house in the Chipyana area of Bisrakh on Valentine’s Day of 2018, Rakesh, his girlfriend Ruby — a UP Police constable posted in Agra — and his family members planned how to avert any suspicion.“In order to fake his own death, Rakesh, who at the time worked at a laboratory in Greater Noida (west), trapped his friend Rajendra alias Kalua, who resided in his native village in Aligarh as he was of the same build,” a police officer told TOI. “Rakesh asked Kalua to accompany him to a relative’s house and got him drunk on the way. However, after they reached the Dholna area of Kasganj, Rakesh took him to the jungle area of Marupur where he had hidden a chopper near the railway line. He used the chopper to kill him and, to hide his identity, severed his head and hands,” he said. Kasganj SP Rohan Pramod said that Rakesh had put an LIC slip in Kalua’s pocket so that the body would be recognised as his own. “Rakesh’s family members played a crucial role in ensuring his crime didn't come to light and his brother Rajiv told the Kasganj police that the body belonged to Rakesh. Both families continued to claim that the body belonged to their member,” he said. However, since the LIC slip belonging to Rakesh was recovered from the body, it was handed over to Rakesh’s family and duly cremated.On the other hand, Rakesh got a nose surgery done to change his appearance. He subsequently started using a fake name and frequently changed places till he settled as a labourer in Haryana’s Panipat. “He had also got a fake Aadhaar card made in the name of Dileep Sharma, a resident of Kushinagar,” Pramod said. While the murder mystery remained unsolved for more than three years, the DNA report of the disputed body threw light on the unsolved case. “Upon receiving the DNA report, the Kasganj police again started focusing on the case. The report had found that the body did not belong to Rakesh. Cops then started tracking the activities of Rakesh’s family and using surveillance and manual inputs, tracked him down,” a police officer said.Rakesh was arrested by Kasganj police on Wednesday when he was on his way to meet Ruby. Five more people have been arrested by the Kasganj police in connection with the four murders. They include Ruby, Rakesh’s father Banwarilal, his mother Indravati and his two brothers, Rajiv and Pravesh. Bisrakh police said they will start the legal process to get the accused on remand. “We will do the needful to get their custody,” ACP-2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-who-killed-wife-kids-harassed-her-family-with-false-murder-case/articleshow/85882807.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Lucknow||BJP begins mapping of Uttar Pradesh natives in Maharashtra for 2022 polls||LUCKNOW: Taking a cue from 2014 Lok Sabha election when Gujaratis from all over the world had come to Varanasi to successfully campaign for the then Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party is planning to rope in UP residents residing in Maharashtra to help it win UP assembly elections in 2022. For the records, around 10% (1.45 crore) of Maharashtra’s population is from North India. They are either from Bihar or from Uttar Pradesh. Already, Uttar Bharatiya Morcha, a wing of Maharashtra BJP, has begun mapping these UPites in Maharashtra. Mostly from an influential class in Maharashtra, the morcha has decided to map these UPites and bring those willing to come to UP during assembly elections 2022. Since these UPites residing in Maharashtra still have their roots in the native districts of Uttar Pradesh, they can be of great help to the BJP in UP during assembly elections, said Shweta Shalini, in charge of the morcha and spokesperson of Maharashtra BJP. Shweta, who was born in Bihar, now claims herself to be Ayodhya’s daughter-in-law as she has married Ankush, an IT entrepreneur from Ayodhya. The work has already begun, morcha president Sanjay Pandey told TOI and added that the morcha has taken up an assignment to prepare a database of the north Indians residing in Maharashtra. The database is being prepared by filling google forms. The north Indians residing in Maharashtra are being requested to fill up their details, including the native district along with the phone numbers, said Pandey, who is a native of Pratapgarh. Once this process is complete, the morcha would prepare a database, Shweta said. “From the database, another set of data of those willing to actively participate in the UP assembly elections would be prepared,” she added. The UPites interested would be sent to their native districts during elections, Pandey confirmed. He said the bigger plan is to build a bridge between party workers, North Indians in Maharashtra and the UP government. “For this, we had a meeting with UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Thursday. He has assured to appoint a key person from the party to look into the problems at the native districts of the UPites residing in Maharashtra,” Pandey said. This would not only help the party in UP during elections but would also encourage UPites residing in Maharashtra to provide all sorts of support to BJP during UP assembly elections, another member of the delegation said. Initial response suggests UPites in Maharashtra are ready to help the BJP in UP assembly elections wholeheartedly, claimed Pandey. Earlier, the delegation also met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and requested him to get additional 25 rooms constructed at UP Bhawan in Mumbai that can be used by the attendants of patients who come to visit Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital. Pandey said the UP CM promised to construct a lodge for attendants from UP if the UP government gets a piece of land for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-begins-mapping-of-up-natives-in-maha-for-2022-polls/articleshow/85882879.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

An FIR was also lodged recently by the hospital against unidentified persons. Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent, said, “Assistant nursing superintendent Kusum Chopra used to manage the stock book. After the matter came to light, a panel was formed.” The panel said Chopra had entered the details of the receipt of the oxygen cylinders in the stock book but hadn’t taken any receipt after giving them to Covid wards.

---||Kolkata||Inadequate passenger load, pay cuts shrink bus services to bare minimum||Kolkata: Not getting enough passengers, unavailability of workers amidst pay cuts and mounting losses due to rising fuel costs have led to several city routes either reducing services to the bare minimum or stopping them altogether. This is especially true for routes that cover longer distances — linking North and South 24 Parganas with Kolkata. The situation is equally bad for buses originating in Howrah and connecting Kolkata to the district. Out of the 7,000-odd buses in Kolkata, around 2,500 are operational, claimed the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. Bus owners claimed the operational cost per kilometre stands at Rs 39. “Several routes from the South 24 Parganas are running one or two services per day. While one of the oldest routes connecting Esplanade to Falta has stopped services, another popular route is operating with a dozen buses instead of the 40 in its command. In the north, bus services from Berachapa, Basirhat and Malancha have been hit, except DN 16/1. At least 10-12 buses on routes like DN-17 and 217A are not plying,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. Similarly, 30A, which operated with 17 buses, is now plying five to seven buses daily. “The Dunlop-BBD Bag route had 20 buses, but currently only two are running. The Behala Chowrasta-BBD Bag route had 20 buses, of which none is running now. We have not even been able to get the fitness certificates ready to make the buses road-worthy,” said Pradip Ghosh of the West Bengal Bus And Minibus Owners’ Association. Bus unions are now seeking a white paper from the government explaining why fares will not be revised. “A few routes are charging extra, leading to deterioration of bus worker-passenger relationship. We do not know why the committee on fares is not making a public statement,” said Banerjee. The pay cuts, too, are hurting the private bus sector. According to several drivers and conductors that TOI spoke to, they have been asked to take a commission cut ranging from 2%-3%. “When buses had two doors, 24% commission was reserved by drivers and conductors. When it was reduced to one door, the driver’s commission was fixed at 15% and the conductor was paid 9% of the sales. But since Monday, owners are insisting that drivers settle between 10%-12% of commission and conductors another 6%-8%. This would mean earning no more than Rs 300-Rs 450 a day. We have to look at other alternatives,” said Naru Singha, a driver on route 237. Titu Saha, general secretary of City Suburban Bus Service, stated that the 12%-6% commission model was here to stay and some routes had already implemented it. Arguing that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has announced a financial package for each worker involved in the transport sector, Banerjee has sought a Rs 2 lakh loan to bus owners through cooperative banks. Bus owners also want a waiver of all fines, taxes, EMIs and insurance payouts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/inadequate-passenger-load-pay-cuts-shrink-bus-services-to-bare-minimum/articleshow/85877972.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This comes a day after 33 people, including Bhartiya Kisan Parishad (BKP) leader Sukhbir Khalifa, were held during a similar agitation.Protesters have accused the police of using excessive force to restrain agitating farmers on Thursday. Mahesh Singh, an agitator who was present at the site, said farmers were thrashed and shoved into buses by the police.According to police, after the farmers’ march towards the Noida authority office was stopped at the Sandeep Paper Mills intersection, they began agitating at the spot. Agitators, police said, declined to talk to officials following which some of them were detained and put in buses to be sent to police lines.FIRs under sections 147, 332, 341, 188 and 279 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Epidemic Disease Act have been filed against the agitators, police said.“On Wednesday, around 300 protesters were detained from the protest site by the Noida police after they were stopped at different intersections on their way to the Noida authority office,” Satveer Kumar, a protester said. Farmers also claimed that several others were picked up from their homes ahead of the protest. They have now threatened to march towards the authority’s office again on Friday.Police, however, said farmers will not be allowed to reach the site. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said, “Thirty-three farmers were arrested on Wednesday and 25 others on Thursday. They have been booked under different sections. If they attempt to use their guerrilla tactics again, action would be taken against them again.”Several points on the way to the Noida authority’s office have been closed, police said. The road from sector 15 roundabout to Jhundpura has also been barricaded while traffic movement at Sandeep Paper Mills, Harola, and sectors 6, 7 and 8 has been barred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/protest-over-abadi-land-58-farmers-held-over-2-days/articleshow/85882854.cms||---

Bidhuri blamed Delhi government for the waterlogging and said that thousands of people who take this road for travel to Badarpur and to Gurgaon remain in trouble.The LoP also released a video on social media of him riding a boat near the flooded underpass. Terming the situation scary and unfortunate, Bidhuri said after Wednesday’s rainfall, most of the capital’s road network remained waterlogged. “PWD failed to clean the big and small drains before the onset of the monsoon, which has led to such a situation,” Bidhuri said.

---||Delhi||With Delhi's Sadar Bazar still flooded, traders threaten to shut shops over ‘inaction’||NEW DELHI: With the rainwater level still not receding at Sadar Bazar on Thursday, traders have warned the authorities that they will shut down the market to protest against their inaction. Some lanes were still waterlogged despite PWD and DJB installing super suction machines and cleaning choked drains and sewers till late at night. Rakesh Yadav, president of Federation of Sadar Bazar Associations, said, “When the situation didn’t improve on Thursday, we wrote to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and pursued the deputy commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and senior officials of DJB and PWD. Such a situation has never occurred. It also took a long time for the authorities to act. We have warned the officials that we will shut down the market and hand over the keys to them.” A PWD official said there was no drain and sewer barrel section near Akhada and Pul Mithai Chowk was choked due to accumulation of garbage. “After DJB cleaned it, we cleared the connecting lines. Things have normalised to a major extent and no waterlogging is expected to occur again,” added the official. DJB used three multipurpose sewer cleaning machines, one desilting and one recycler machine from Azad Market Chowk to Pili Kothi to clear the area. Residents and shopkeepers said due to power cuts lasting 24-36 hours, they were unable to flush out the rainwater inside their shops and houses. Rajendra Sharma, general secretary of the federation and a trader in Teliwara, said, “Fear has gripped traders as they have incurred huge losses due to stock getting damaged. The weather department has forecast rain in the coming days too.” People also blamed lack of cooperation between the area councillor and MLA for the mess. However, MLA Somdutt Sharma said the problem occurred due to missing stormwater drains in the area. “Either there are no drains or they are not connected to sewer lines, which is why low-lying areas around Mahavir Chowk get submerged every year. The sewer lines don’t have the capacity to take pressure when flooding occurs during rain. Garbage also chokes the drains. We expect the situation to normalise by Friday morning,” added Sharma. Area councillor and former mayor Jai Prakash, who sat on a dharna against Delhi government, said, “If the MLA was aware about the problems, then why didn’t he act on time or at least interact with residents. The priority should be to resolve the issue rather than play blame-game.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-sadar-bazar-still-flooded-traders-threaten-to-shut-shops-over-inaction/articleshow/85877963.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Kolkata||Parking full, malls in Kolkata carve out more space for cars||KOLKATA: Some of the popular malls in Kolkata are struggling to accommodate customers’ cars in parking lots during weekends. Though footfall is still 40%-50% that of August 2019, the vehicle count is up 20% in the same period following a sharp rise in use of personal vehicles in the wake of the pandemic. While one mall is augmenting its parking facility, another is evaluating the cost of creating a vertical parking lot to tackle the situation. In at least three malls, parking lots have been chock-a-block by 4pm during the past four-five weekends. That was a rare phenomenon in July-August in the pre-pandemic times when parking demand usually shot up closer to Durga Puja and Diwali. “The parking space crunch does happen before and during festivals. But given that it has happened this early, it is a cause for concern. We don’t want any shopper to turn away because of a problem with parking. Hence, we have already added 54 slots at the South City International School just behind the mall. In addition, we have made provision to park 200-odd cars in the driveway around the mall. Thus, we can now park around 1,450 cars at any given point of time. But even that is proving inadequate. Thus, we are making a provision to park an additional 250 cars at the school,” said South City Mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. On the other hand, City Centre I in Salt Lake had never made much provision for car parks like Forum (an annexe building was set up subsequently to accommodate more cars), the city’s first mall. It had leased out a little used slip from the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation to park 350 cars at a time. The absence of further parking space is hurting now. Though a section of customers park their cars in blocks around the mall and then walk over, many are also giving it the skip. While some of them may be returning on a weekday to do the shopping, it is losing other customers. Around 60% of sales are generated between 4pm and 9pm at malls. “Use of personal vehicles has increased both on account of safety and convenience. While many don’t perceive public transport safe in the current scenario, getting public transport has also become difficult. Moreover, most app cabs now refuse to operate ACs. Thus, we have 15%-20% more shoppers who are arriving in cars. It is forcing us to evaluate vertical parking options,” said Ambuja Neotia Realty whole-time director Ramesh Pandey. At Mani Square, the car queue on the service road stretches beyond Apollo Hospital on weekend evenings. One of the first malls to set up a separate building for multi-level parking that can accommodate 800 cars, it is proving inadequate at weekends. “We have a substantial car park but it isn’t enough. We have rarely faced such a situation in the past and never this early,” said Mani Group director Sudarshana Gangulee. At Acropolis and Quest, the situation is slightly better because there are still many people from the neighbourhood who walk in. “There has been an uptick in footfall and corresponding sales. We have been witnessing a spurt in the number of customers coming in their own cars and bikes. The five-level underground parking facility has proved sufficient till now,” said Acropolis mall general manager K Vijayan. “The average parking time for vehicles at a mall is around two hours. So, vehicles are driving in and out. There are times when the parking gets full. But since many customers at Quest are chauffeur-driven, they alight while the car does the rounds or parks elsewhere,” said Quest vice-president Sanjeev Mehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/parking-full-malls-carve-out-more-space-for-cars/articleshow/85877954.cms||Subhro Niyogi

CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan said the state government banned processions and celebrations due to the pandemic. “However, there is no restriction to celebrate indoors and dissolve Vinayaka Idols in public places.

We mostly get school and college students in the morning hours,” said a barber on the Huzur Road here. “I expect more customers during the weekend as the uncertainty period has ended. Teachers expect students to have a clean, neat appearance.”But there is only a marginal increase in the footfall, said S Saravanakumar, secretary of the Coimbatore North District Barbers Association. “Barbers struggled for months due to the strict Covid-19 regulations. Many could not pay rent for shops and many struggled to even feed their families. We expected more patronage when reopening of schools and colleges was announced.

Industry representatives said supply chain issues and the fear of new restrictions were impeding better recovery. Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture’s (MCCIA) data showed that August was a month of marked improvement over the past few months, since the onset of the second Covid wave. Observers said the eased restrictions, especially in services such as malls, restaurants and tourism, brought more people back to work and had a positive effect on economy. Levels of production and employment improved, as did optimism about returning to pre-Covid levels of employment and production. Of the approximately 150 entities surveyed, 37% of them said they have returned to the pre-pandemic levels of production, an improvement over 30% in July. The micro and medium-scale industries improved by 5% and 7%, respectively, while large industries and services improved by around 6%. “Manufacturers are still facing challenges of high raw material prices and the rise in freight charges. Services are slowly picking up. The only concern is the fear of further restrictions,” MCCIA director-general Prashant Girbane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/industry-recovery-strong-in-august-with-ease-in-curbs/articleshow/85880761.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Officials have been told to locate about 1,000 feasible plots ranging from 120 to 300 sqm in these two sectors. GNIDA is also preparing to launch a built-up residential housing scheme in sectors Xu 1, 2 and 3 by the middle of this month. “Work is underway to locate plots for the residential plot scheme in sectors 17 and 22D of the Yamuna Expressway area. Instructions have been given by the CEO to draw up the scheme for launch latest by early next month,” said an official from YEIDA. GNIDA officials, meanwhile, said that their property department has made all preparations, including the brochure, for the residential housing scheme that is expected to be launched by mid-September. For this, about 113 built-up buildings as well as plots, which had been left out of allotment earlier, have been identified by the Authority in sectors Xu 1, 2 and 3. “Some 12 buildings of 200 sqm in Sector Xu 1, 16 buildings of 120 sqm in Sector Xu 2, and 85 plots of 120 sqm in Sector Xu 3 have been identified. The cost of a 120 sqm building will be around Rs 58 lakh while that of a 200 sqm building will be around Rs 82 lakh,” an official said. “Allotment will be done on a first come first serve basis. Preference will be given to allottees opting to make a lump sum payment. There will also be an option to pay in instalments. The applicant will have to apply by paying 10% of the total cost and only through the online application process,” he added. While the link to apply for the scheme will be available on the GNIDA website, the successful applicants will have to deposit 20% of the total amount within 60 days from the date of allotment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/housing-plot-scheme-near-airport-site-soon/articleshow/85882888.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Nature observatory, medicinal garden on cards for Lake||KOLKATA: Spread over 192 acres, including a 73-acre water body, Rabindra Sarobar is set to get new green zones, like a medicinal garden, nature observatory zone and fungus garden. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, will soon sign a memorandum of understanding with the state horticulture department for better management, supervision and nurturing of the new green zones that will have different species of trees. A committee with horticulture and forest department experts has been appointed by KMDA to conduct surveys to come up with recommendations as to how green zones with specific species of trees could be developed to make Rabindra Sarobar more attractive to students and nature lovers. The idea is to make it an eco-tourism destination on the lines of Eco Park or Botanical Garden, keeping intact its natural ecosystem, officials said. “The plan is to divide the premises into different green zones. For example, there can be a ‘Triphala’ zone where amlaki, haritaki and boira saplings will be planted; there can be ‘Pancha Pallab’ and ‘Pancha Bati’ zones that will have trees falling in those categories. The scientific names of the trees will also be put up. There will also be a garden with trees that have medicinal benefits,” said a KMDA official. There is also a plan to have a nature observatory zone with different animal species and a butterfly garden. The expert committee is coming up with their recommendations, the official said. “The MoU with the horticulture department will be signed for better supervision of the different green zones as KMDA is basically an engineering wing. Horticulture experts will be able to properly supervise and nurture the trees of different species. Soil testing will be done to further check what kind of saplings can be planted in certain areas,” an official said. At present, there are around 7,000 trees belonging to 70-75 different species in Rabindra Sarobar. Several trees were uprooted during Amphan last year, but many of them were replanted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nature-observatory-med-garden-on-cards-for-lake/articleshow/85878020.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Delhi||Delhi govt to garner Rs 3k cr from 12 retail liquor licences||NEW DELHI: The excise department of Delhi government expects to collect Rs 3,000 crore by awarding 12 zonal retail liquor licences to private players for which e-tenders have already been floated. An evaluation committee has also been set up to review the bids. Under the new excise policy, which aims to transform the liquor trade in the capital and elevate consumers’ experience, Delhi has been divided into 32 retail zones, out of which 20 have already been auctioned, for the supply of foreign and Indian liquor, except country liquor, in the capital during 2021-22. The bids for the rest will open on Thursday. The committee will evaluate pre-qualification, technical and financial aspects of all bids received through the 12 e-tenders. “The committee, which has excise officials, including the deputy controller of accounts, as its members, will scrutinise the documents and submit its recommendations,” an official said. Earlier last month, the government collected Rs 5,300 crore by allocating 20 zones. While tenders were floated for all 32 retail zones in June this year, these 12 zones could not be auctioned due to technical reasons such as some bidders applying for all zones and many qualifying for more than two zones. To prevent monopolisation, the new policy stipulates that a company can get licence for maximum two zones. Fresh tenders were issued on August 12 for the rest. Each of the 32 zones has been divided into nine to 10 wards. Each zone will have a maximum of 27 liquor outlets, with every ward getting three outlets on average. In March, Delhi government brought in the new policy to reform the liquor trade and itself exit the retail business. The policy suggests equitable distribution of liquor trade. Currently, some areas in the city have a higher concentration of shops than others, which leaves space for the liquor mafia. Out of Delhi’s 272 wards, 79 have no liquor shop and around 45 just one shop each. It is also pointed out that 50% of the liquor shops in Delhi are currently in just 45 wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-to-garner-rs-3k-cr-from-12-retail-liquor-licences/articleshow/85878103.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Delhi||21-year-old civil defence volunteer found dead in Surajkund forest: Report says no rape||NEW DELHI: A 21-year-old civil defence volunteer whose body was discovered in the jungles at Surajkund on August 27 was not sexually assaulted, says the autopsy report. While her death has been attributed to injuries caused by a sharp weapon, the victim’s family insists she was sexually violated before being murdered. The self-proclaimed murderer had disposed of the body and surrendered at the Kalindi Kunj police station. Nizamuddin claimed he had married his fellow civil defence volunteer without their families’ consent, but killed the girl because she maintained illicit relations with other men. On August 27, he took her on his bike and slashed her neck, chest and head at a spot near Palli Road near Surajkund before dragging her body into the underbrush. With the autopsy report, a copy of which is with TOI, stating the cause of the death as shock and haemorrhage due to the stab injuries that are antemortem in nature, Faridabad police have applied for a production warrant to question Nizamuddin further. The woman’s family has demanded a CBI probe into the killing. Her cousin alleged to TOI that police did not investigate the case properly. “She had multiple stab wounds on different parts, even in the genital area. The brutality of the attack suggests she was assaulted before being murdered,” the cousin said. “It doesn’t seem like a single person did it, but could be a full conspiracy.” The family wasn’t aware if the woman was really married to Nizamuddin, with the cousin saying, “We haven’t seen any proof of this. The only time we met Nizamuddin was when she filled the application form for the civil defence job.” RP Meena, DCP (Southeast), said, “According to the accused, the two married at a Saket court on June 11. When he learnt that he had relations with other men, he first tried to get her to mend her ways. On the fateful day, Nizamuddin said they met at Lajpat Nagar and rode his bike towards Surajkund. On Palli Road, he stopped and talked to her about her behaviour. An argument ensued and in a fit of rage, he slashed at her with a knife.” Faridabad police received a call from Delhi Police officials about a man claiming he had killed his wife and disposed of her body in Surajkund. “After searching for 3-4 hours, we recovered the body. It had wounds, but there were no mutilations,” said Dr Anshu Singla, DCP (Headquarters and NIT), Faridabad police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-found-dead-in-surajkund-forest-report-says-no-rape/articleshow/85878041.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Lucknow||Lucknow record: 8 lakh vaccine doses given in 1 month||LUCKNOW: With 43,132 more people taking the jab on Thursday, the number of inoculations against Covid-19 crossed 8-lakh mark in past one month. In fact, the rate of vaccination now is four times higher than the one witnessed in the first few months of the mass immunisation campaign rolled out in January this year. The first 8 lakh doses were administered in about 125 days from the start of the drive on January 16, while the last 8 lakh have come in 30 days from August 3. TimesViewWith the health department deciding to increase the number of special camps and organise a mega drive to inoculate over a lakh people in a single day, taking the jab will be easier and more accessible. While people should shed hesitancy and take full advantage of the facility, health officers should ensure basic amenities at centres for the convenience of beneficiaries. They should also ensure that Covid-19 protocol is not ignored as was done during the previous two drives.“The daily vaccination rate is as high in September as it was in August because of the special camps that are being held in schools, offices and places of worship,” said health officials. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said, “Another mega vaccination drive has been planned on September 6 and the target is to administer one lakh doses in a single day.” Meanwhile, Thursday’s vaccinations were the fourth highest single day inoculations so far after 93,436 recorded on August 27, about 80,412 on August 3 and 51,326 on August 16. These vaccinations also took the number of people who have taken at least a shot in Lucknow to over 20 lakh – about 55% of the district's 36 lakh adult population eligible for the vaccine. Of those jabbed on Thursday, 66% (28,546) beneficiaries took the first dose and 34%(14,586) completed their two-dose vaccine course by taking the second shot. Meanwhile, seven people tested Covid-19 positive in the city in the past 24 hours. As there were no recoveries, the number of active cases increased to 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-record-8l-vaccine-doses-given-in-1-mnth/articleshow/85882936.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The businessman had submitted a complaint application to the cyber police station. After verifying the details of the application, the police registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act against the fraudsters. The complainant runs a garment shop on Kumthekar Road. Inspector Meenal Patil of the cyber police station told TOI, “The victim’s cousin stays in New Jersey, USA, and they are in touch with each other. The fraudsters had called up the victim on his WhatsApp number on July 12. One of the callers had used the photograph of the businessman’s cousin as his identification picture. He claimed that there were disturbances in the phone network and sent the trader text messages.” Patil said, “The suspect told him to transfer Rs4 lakh to two bank accounts claiming that one of his friends in India was ill and needed financial aid. The suspects provided him with details of the two bank account details. The businessman transferred the money to the account.” After transferring the money, the victim called up his cousin. “The businessman’s cousin told him that he had not neither called him nor sent him any text message,” Patil said. Preliminary probe revealed that the fraudsters had studied the victim’s social networking profile and used the photograph of his cousin brother to make the call to the victim. “We have sought details of the bank accounts from the two private banks. We have written to the banks to freeze the two accounts. Further investigations are on,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garments-trader-falls-prey-to-crooks-trick-loses-rs-4l/articleshow/85880803.cms||---

The brave heart, Awaiz Salim Ansari (23), suffered injuries on his hands after the burglar, Vithal Waman Bhole (47), bite him. When he screamed for help, residents of the area came running to his help, overpowered the burglar and called police. Bhole, having his roots in Jalgaon, was currently staying at a rented accommodation at Hingnemala in Hadapsar. Senior inspector Shrihari Patil of the Khadak police said, “Bhole was convicted in a murder case registered at Bhusawal and was serving life term in the Nasik prison. He was released on Covid parole on July 8, after which he came to Pune.” Patil said, “A few days ago, Bhole stole a motorcycle from the vegetable market in Hadapsar and used it commit the crime. We have seized the motorcycle after arresting him.” Assistant commissioner of police Satish Govekar said, “We have taken down the statement of Ansari and registering a case of attempt to murder against Bhole. We are also checking his criminal background. We shall also check if he was involved in any crimes after shifting to Pune”. Ansari, the daredevil youth, runs snack centres in Kondhwa and Balajinagar. He said, “We have two flats in the Heena Tower building. One is on the first floor and the other on the second floor. The first-floor flat was locked. My mother and other family members had gone to Mumbai for shopping and they returned around noon. I took some snacks from my Balajinagar outlet for my family members and reached home at around 1pm.” Ansari said, “Around 1.15 pm, I heard some noises from the first-floor flat. I went downstairs and found the flat’s door open. After I entered the flat, I saw a man pulling out things from the cupboard. A bag was lying near his feet. Wielding a knife, he warned me as soon as he saw me. When he walked a few steps towards me, I told him not to harm me and take whatever he wants. As soon as he bent, I pounced on him.” He said, “After I grabbed him between my hands and hips, he took out a pistol from his bag. Still, I dragged him outside the flat and then to the staircase. At this point, he bit on my hand several times. But I knew, he would fire at me if I lost the grip. So, I kept dragging him. After reaching downstairs, he fired a bullet. It hit the wall. Then he fired again. The second bullet hit the iron door of the society.” Ansari said he was yelling for help while dragging the burglar. “People came running and intercepted him,” he said. Hrishikesh Balgude, a resident of the area, said, “I had heard two loud noises like that of bursting firecrackers. I also heard Ansari calling for help. I rushed to the spot with others and we all intercepted the thief. We also found the pistol on the floor. There was an empty cartridge. I called up the police and we handed over the burglar to them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-foils-burglary-bid-of-murder-convict-on-parole/articleshow/85880844.cms||---

---||Pune||Restaurateurs in Pune seek deadline extension until 1am||PUNE: The increase in the number of patrons waiting for a table between 8pm and 10pm is getting difficult to manage and becoming a worry for restaurateurs. The Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) has now demanded an extension in the operational deadline from 10pm to 11.30pm. Industry sources said that business has picked up for most eateries after the deadline for dine-in was extended till 10pm at 50% seating capacity. However, the rush has increased even on weekdays now, sources added. Praful Chandawarkar, director of Malaka Spice, said, “The government should extend restaurant operation timings till at least 11.30 pm because it is difficult to handle the crowd that gathers due to restricted deadlines. The number of patrons increases between 8-10 pm on all days. An extension would help spread the crowd over a longer period and reduce risk as well” Epidemiologists had also given suggestions on similar lines to the state governments in the past, as deadline extension for establishments is the best way to preclude crowding in spaces prone to high footfall. Ganesh Shetty, president of PRAHA, said that the association had recently approached the government regarding the extension. “However, we were told that such a request will not be taken up till at least Ganesh Chaturthi this year, as there are also a host of restrictions on Ganesh mandals. The authorities have asked us to wait until after the festival, when they may take a decision if the number of Covid cases remains low,” said Shetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/restaurateurs-seek-deadline-extension-until-1am/articleshow/85880879.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||‘Two-dose Covishield prevents serious illness’: Lucknow Medical College study||LUCKNOW: The two-dose Covishield vaccination course develops enough antibodies against Covid-19 in a month. In a few cases, post vaccination response can be delayed, but required antibody numbers gradually generate in two-four months and are effective in preventing serious illness in case of infection. This was revealed in a study done by the Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH) on 246 hospital employees, including 96 women, who were fully vaccinated in January-February and were exposed to high risk during the second wave in April-May when the hospital was converted into a Covid facility for serious Covid-19 patients. “We checked the antibody levels of these people twice – after a month of vaccination and then in the fourth month. About 93% (229) of the employees developed full antibodies after a month and the number remained intact even after four months,” said MM Faridi, principal, ELMCH and head of the study panel. “Vaccination did not trigger the immune response in 17 people after a month post-vaccination, but tests four months later found that 14 of them developed required antibodies. Hence, overall, nearly 99% developed the required defence mechanism, which showed that antibodies continue to develop with time and last for a long period,” he added. Of these 246 employees, 18 got infected during the second wave, but none of them developed serious symptoms. We found that antibodies in these 18 employees were less than half in comparison to the average level in others, indicating that high levels provide good protection, said additional medical superintendent Dr Siddharth Chandel. Another finding was that average antibody levels in women were slightly less than men.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-dose-covishield-prevents-serious-illness/articleshow/85883015.cms||---

Three such spots have been identified and the authorities plan to rehabilitate the existing hawkers doing business at the spots to the ground floor of the multi storeyed car parking complex. The three spots where the cycle stands are coming up in Sector V are in front of Webel Bhavan, near Godrej waterside and opposite Wipro gate. “We plan to hold an inspection to see the work progress of setting up the cycle stands next Tuesday after which one or two of them would be opened. There will be a small shed for people to keep and lock their cycles for free. But there will be no docking system,” said a NDITA official. Officials said the exisiting hawkers will be invited to move to the ground floor of the multi-storeyed car parking complex in Sector V. “They can move in to the car parking complex in the ground floor for a reasonable rent if they want,” said an official. Officials said that setting up a few cycle stands in Sector V had stemmed up after noticing that a considerable number of people come for work in the IT hub using cycles from the neighbouring areas but often they don’t find a suitable place to keep their cycles for a few hours. Earlier, NDITA issued a notification in which all large office complexes as well as parking lots in Sector V were asked to reserve some space to park bicycles. The authorities were also thinking mulling of using one flank of the Technopolis bound one-way road from SDF Building for cycles and pedestrians and the other flank for vehicles.

---||Delhi||Delhi's ITO to Mathura Road: Glide down under||NEW DELHI: The Pragati Maidan tunnel along with three underpasses near Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, Kaka Nagar and Bhairon Marg are likely to be opened for traffic by November. Trials are expected to be held in October, a PWD official has revealed. The completion of the Pragati Maidan corridor improvement project will allow signal-free movement on the 3.5-km stretch between ITO and DPS, Mathura Road. The PWD official said that both the underpasses being constructed near DPS and Kaka Nagar will be opened to traffic soon along with the 1.2-km tunnel going below Pragati Maidan from Mathura Road to Ring Road. Work on the tunnel portion below the railway line is pending but will be completed soon, the official confided. The corridor improvement plan, work on which began in 2017, comprises the tunnel and six underpasses. It seeks to decongest Mathura Road, Bhairon Road and Mahatma Gandhi Marg. PWD plans to operationalise four of these six tunnels by October. “The civil work is on the verge of completion, particularly on the underpasses near Matka Peer and Supreme Court. As soon as we get some respite from the rains, we will begin the final push,” the official said. PWD will also construct a service lane along Mathura Road before the trial run. With the Ashram underpass also nearing completion, the stretch between Ashram and ITO is likely to be decongested by the year-end. “The trials for two underpasses, the main tunnel and the Bhairon Marg tunnel will run till October-end. Atter Delhi traffic police gives its approval, the road safety audit will be carried out and the entire process is likely to be completed by November,” the PWD official said. The centrepiece of the corridor improvement is the six-lane tunnel running below Pragati Maidan and connecting Mathura Road with Ring Road. It is expected to take the pressure off the intersections at ITO (used by up to 62,000 passenger car units daily) and Bhairon Marg (57,000 cars daily). A chunk of the east-bound traffic will use this tunnel for a quicker getaway. With Mathura Road also becoming signal-free, peak hours will no longer look so daunting. The main beneficiaries will be commuters going to east Delhi from south and Lutyens’ Delhi via India Gate and ITO. Vehicles going to south Delhi from ITO will also have access to the tunnel from Mathura Road, a much-needed alternative to Bhairon Marg, especially during peak hours. As a consequence, this will greatly reduce traffic at the ITO crossing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ito-to-mathura-rd-glide-down-under/articleshow/85878435.cms||Paras Singh

---||Amritsar||Farmers stick to confrontation line, won’t let any party campaign in Punjab||BATHINDA/JALANDHAR: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s line of opposition to various political parties out electioneering in Punjab has not been followed strictly by the village cadre of farm unions, who won’t allow any campaigning till their protest against the three agri-marketing laws is on at the Delhi borders. Despite the SKM asking its members to oppose only the BJP and ‘just question’ visitors from the other parties, scores of farm union members have been confronting all politicians and not letting them enter their villages. The Kirti Kisan Union, a constituent of the kisan morcha, has taken a line that as long as the Delhi agitation is on, there can be no other political activity in Punjab and no talk of elections. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) factions of Ekta-Dakaunda, Kadian, and Ekta-Sidhupur, besides the Punjab Kisan Union and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee also have come out in the open to oppose any politician caught campaigning or even getting into the election mode. Akali Dal (Badal) president Sukhbir Singh Badal has tasted their anger first-hand. On August 31, he had appreciated the SKM’s call for sabotaging only the BJP events and spare politicians of “farmer-friendly” parties. “But protests continue against us,” said SAD spokesperson Harcharan Singh Bains. The BKU statement assumes significance for the SAD since it is the only party engaged in a mass contact programme in the state right now. Even Navjot Singh Sidhu as the new Punjab Congress president had to face the farmers’ ire. Apart from direct protests, village after village is putting up the ‘politicians keep out’ sign and fining any resident who invites any politician for any kind of interaction. Successive appeals by senior SKM members Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, and Joginder Singh Ugrahan to spare the non-BJP parties have had little impact in the villages of Punjab. Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala told TOI: “We feel that electioneering is harming the farmers’ struggle. Until the Delhi morcha is alive, there should be no campaigning. Like-minded outfits are with us but, at some point of time, the SKM will also have to take this line. We opposed Navjot Singh Sidhu at Khatkar Kalan and Moga, and we even confronted the SAD at Longowal when Sukhbir didn’t come forward to take our questions.” BKU (Ekta-Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said: “The farmers’ anger against politicians is showing because the parties guard only their interests and worry only about their rallies.” BKU (Ekta-Sidhupur) president Jagjit Singh Dallewal said: “We want the farmers to follow the SKM directive but, sometimes, the local units or individuals can also take an initiative.” Darshan Pal of the SKM agreed that the union workers were confused about the protests. He said: “Morcha’s 32 farmers’ unions from Punjab will debate it on Friday (September 3) and try to frame a standard questionnaire for the parties campaigning in Punjab. The workers will be asked to stick to those questions and not take any other action.” In Jalandhar, Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala was clear about his group’s stance. “Elections, while the Delhi border protest is on, will divert people’s attention and harm the morcha.” When the KKU had posted the same stance on Facebook on August 22, a few netizens had argued that their position could be counter-productive like the boycott of the 1992 assembly elections by all the Akali groups, which had allowed the Congress to come to power “despite its unpopularity”. Asked if the SKM will go after only the BJP, Deep Singh Wala said: “SKM also said the other parties should suspend their rallies, yet they continue with those events while our people are holding protests. The polls are six months away, and without focus, we could be gone in six months.” Asked if he’d be fine with President’s Rule if the assembly elections were not held on time, the farm union leader avoided any direct reply but claimed that the current situation wasn’t much different from the President’s Rule. “If people lose their land, how does it matter if it is the President’s Rule or an elected government,” he said, adding: “Let the elections be declared, and then we’ll see.” About Sukhbir, he said: “He (Sukhbir) wants to talk to us only indoors, without the presence of the media. He is on a 100-day yatra for his political ends and not the farmers’ cause. He must clarify his position. If he can’t answer farmers’ questions, why should we let him do his political tamasha? He is a proxy of the Punjab BJP.” In Mansa, 28 villages have barred entry of all politicians and KKU doesn’t even have any presence there, claimed Deep Singh Wala. Asked why the SKM had missions in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh to support any party that could oust the BJP, and a different position in Punjab, Deep Singh Wala said: “All states have different situations. Punjab is at the centre of our agitation. If movement weakens here, it will have a countrywide impact.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farmers-stick-to-confrontation-line-so-wont-let-any-party-campaign-in-punjab/articleshow/85881029.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In a first, NMC bans idol immersion in Nagpur lakes||NAGPUR: For the first time, immersion of all idols has been banned in water bodies across the city. “All idols including those of sarvajanik mandals will have to be immersed in artificial tanks,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. “Those found violating the rule will be penalized under the Water Pollution (prevention and control) Act, 1974,” he said. Radhakrishnan said the decision was aimed at conserving the city’s water bodies. The civic body is spending crores on rejuvenation of water bodies and allowing immersion of idols there will amount to efforts going waste, he said. Citing notifications issued by the Maharashtra government and NMC, the municipal commissioner told TOI that the height of idols at sarvajanik Ganesh mandals has been restricted to 4ft and 2ft for individual households. NMC has banned sale and purchase of PoP idols in the city. “If the height restrictions are followed, idols from sarvajanik Ganesh mandals can also be immersed in artificial tanks easily,” he said. Radhakrishnan said the state government had issued a notification to this effect in June and the civic body followed the same. “Both the notifications were issued well in advance to rule out doubts about its strict implementation by the civic body,” he said. To prevent immersion of idols, besides barricading the lakes, NMC will deploy civic cops and take the help of police. Deputy municipal commissioner Rajesh Bhagat too will issue a notification in this regard in a day or two. Assistant municipal commissioners of 10 zones have been informed to start preparations for creating artificial tanks, said a senior official from the solid waste management department. The AMCs have been told to ensure that artificial tanks are in place from the second day of the 10-day festival commencing from September 10. NMC will fill non-potable water in artificial tanks, which will be drawn from public and private wells. It will also deploy two mobile artificial tanks in every zone to allow devotees to immerse idols. Two private firms engaged in door-to-door garbage collection have been instructed to collect nirmalya and other pooja material from sarvajanik mandals and individuals on alternate-day basis. “Nirmalya will be dumped in nearby gardens where it will be used for preparing compost. Idols will also be disposed of in such a manner that it will not harm the sentiments of any devotees,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-nmc-bans-idol-immersion-in-city-lakes/articleshow/85878546.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The rural development department headed the home survey for bringing poor children back to mainstream society. The survey was conducted under the guidance of the RDPR department. Members of School Development and Monitoring Committees, anganwadis and women self-help groups visited each house to get details on children who have discontinued formal education.The rural development department has prepared a mobile app where district-, taluk-, and cluster-level data is uploaded. According to a ZP source, the survey was carried out in 144 GPs with help from 1,606 enumerators from the first week of January till the last week of August. After surveying 1,44,695 children aged 18 and below, the department found that 223 of them have dropped out due to various reasons. Most of them had dropped out to work as daily-wage workers (as the behest of their parents) while some lost access to education due to poverty.Mohan Hanchate, deputy director of public instruction, said they have completed the survey of drop-outs in rural areas of Dharwad district in collaboration with RDPR department. “Workers from anganwadis and GPs were part of the survey team. We have identified 223 students who have discontinued their education during the pandemic. We have now started the process to admit them to government schools. Most of them are in lower primary school and a few are in high school,” he said, adding 70% of the survey of school drop-outs has been completed in urban areas.Akkamma, an anganwadi teacher from Devarahubli village, said they conducted the survey using a mobile app. “We visited each and every house in the village for the survey. Those who had discontinued their education are now going back to schools. We are making arrangements for their admission to nearby schools,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/survey-done-to-assess-dropouts-in-rural-areas-of-dharwad-dist/articleshow/85876036.cms||---

---||Nagpur||MAT slams forester being relieved of charge despite stay on transfer||NAGPUR: The Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT), Nagpur Bench, on Wednesday rapped range forest officer (RFO), Khapa, for issuing orders to take one-sided charge from a forester, despite a stay by the tribunal on his transfer. On August 8 (Sunday), Nagpur deputy conservator (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada had issued orders to transfer 38 foresters. These orders were received online on August 10. However, a couple of foresters challenged their transfer in MAT and obtained a stay on August 11. One of them was PR Madke, who is currently posted at Khubala in Khapa range. Madke (49) was transferred to Narhar in the West Pench range of Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR). Despite a stay on his posting, RFO SG Athawale directed new incumbent BV Lonare to take charge one-sided. As Madke’s transfer was stayed, he continued to work in Khubala, and on August 21, also registered a case against illicit felling. Yet, RFO Athavale sought guidance from DyCF in the matter. Based on his advice, RFO allowed Lonare to take one-sided charge of Khubala round on August 24. Aggrieved Madke moved a contempt application in MAT seeking relief. Hearing the application on Wednesday, MAT vice-chairman Shree Bhagwan expressed disappointment and set aside the order issued by the RFO. The RFO’s order itself is dubious. It states that Madke has been relieved of charge on August 10, but the fact is that orders were received online the same day. Secondly, the RFO knew that Madke’s orders has been stayed, so why guidance was sought from the DyCF? As per guidelines, the staff should be posted on rotation in three wings of the department – territorial, wildlife, and social forestry — but it has been found that eight foresters were posted again in the same wing. Madke has earlier worked at Narhar between 1997-2001. He was again posted there. In his 24 years of service, for 12 years he has worked in wildlife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mat-slams-forester-being-relieved-of-charge-despite-stay-on-transfer/articleshow/85878562.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu announces plan to provide a unique health ID to everyone||CHENNAI: Everyone in Tamil Nadu will soon get a unique health ID (UHID) that will help them access medicare and provide the government with a database to better prioritise and provide health care. Announcing this in the assembly on Thursday, health minister Ma Subramanian said, “Digitalisation will help us see what is required. It will help us create adequate physical infrastructure according to demand.” “While the digital record will help patients seek treatment at any hospital, the state will have a denominator for all diseases. This data will be the driving force for all policy decisions,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The unique ID will also be the backbone for schemes such as makkalai thedi maruthum, a scheme to provide comprehensive and holistic healthcare for non-communicable diseases at people’s doorsteps. Every listed beneficiary under the scheme is brought under the Population Health Registry (PHR). The registry will have the name, age, gender, mobile number, smart (ration) card number, health ID, street details, health sub-center of the beneficiaries. The state has piloted UHID projects in two blocks of Krishnagiri district. “We now have names, addresses and contact details. With medical details about each of these people getting digitalised, nurses need not carry huge registers to keep a check on vaccinations, tests or delivery of drugs,” a senior official said. For instance, reminders can be sent for tests or screening and results can be delivered on the phone. This policy will ensure “right to health and health care as the foundation of the state’s health system,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-announces-plan-to-provide-a-unique-health-id-to-everyone/articleshow/85881046.cms||Pushpa Narayan
---||Chandigarh||Haryana govt trying to save officer: SKM||Bathinda: Alleging the action taken by the Haryana government to transfer Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, along with several other officers, was “only a protection and promotion”, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha threatened that unless the SDM was sacked and a murder case registered against him by Monday, they would further intensify their protest. The group of farm bodies said the action by the government was “completely insufficient and deceitful towards the farmers”. SKM condemned the lathicharge on KKU workers at Moga in Punjab and demanded immediate action against the officials there too. The farmers were lathicharged when they were “peacefully going to talk” to Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal, it said. The farmers’ anger is rising against the new rules proposed by the Union government for the purchase of paddy. In the new standards being set, the purchase of broken grains has been reduced from 25% to 20%, moisture content is being reduced from 15% to 14%, the percentage of purchase of damaged paddy to be reduced from 3% to 2%, and red grains which had a limit of 3% till now, will no longer be purchased. It is clear from the norms being set by the government, that it wanted to buy minimal paddy from the farmers at the support price. Farm unions of Punjab have refused to accept the new norms, while condemning and opposing them. SKM stated that as per decision taken at its national convention on August 26-27 at Singhu border, meetings have begun in various states for the formation of coordination committees. Meetings have already been held in Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh. Meetings are lined up in Madhya Pradesh on September 3, at Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh on September 9 and in Bihar on September 11. SKM want to set up coordination committees in all the states before September 25 to organise ‘Bharat Bandh’ more effectively than before by ensuring the participation of more organisations. SKM also said that preparations for the Muzaffarnagar kisan mahapanchayat on September 5 were going in full swing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-govt-trying-to-save-officer-skm/articleshow/85881059.cms||---

In this regard, Mangaluru city police have already launched a month-long workshop for aspirants wanting to join the police force as sub-inspectors or constables. Almost on similar lines, Vidyamaatha Academy in Puttur is also conducting a month-long workshop for PSI aspirants from rural areas, and for those who have passed the physical test, coaching is free. Bellare police station police sub-inspector G V Anjaneya Reddy has been motivating youth to join the police force when they visit police stations, or during beat meetings. He sends them alerts, whenever the government calls for appointments. “While in other districts, 90% of the staff are locals and 10% are outsiders, in Dakshina Kannada the trend is vice-versa. Having local officers helps in better intelligence gathering and dealing with law-and-order situations. Under the guidance of our senior officers, we have been motivating youth to join the force,” he told TOI. Anjaneya Reddy has come forward to sponsor cash prizes for those who top the mock test organised by the academy on September 15. Cash prizes of Rs 3,000 and 2,000 for those who top paper 1, and Rs 5,000, Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000 for those who top paper 2, have been announced by the PSI. Only those who have cleared the physical test can take the written test. Bhagyesh Rai, MD, Vidyamaatha Academy said, “We have completed two batches of PSI coaching and the third one is on. The month-long coaching is free for those who have cleared the physical tests. IPS officer Prakash Gowda has been an inspiration behind launching this course, and Puttur Rural police station SI Udaya Ravi, probationary SI Shreekanth Rathod and Anjaneya Reddy have also taken a few classes voluntarily,” he said. The academy, a wing of Vidyamaatha Foundation, launched last year. “After conducting job melas, we realised there are no takers for government jobs as there is a misconception that you must pay to get a job. We first introduced coaching for Staff Selection Commission exams last year, and later coaching for PSI and constable aspirants,” said Bhagyesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/psi-motivates-youth-to-join-police-force/articleshow/85876057.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Though rainy season is not over, the officials claimed they will get it done with the help of readymade patch work system, as it was not viable to start hot mix plant due to rains. Sabharwal earlier had visited a stretch near Jalandhar bypass where recently two parks are being renovated by the civic body. The commissioner pulled up the horticulture branch officials for the wild growth and also directed officials to do patch work of road from Sherpur Chowk to Dholewal chowk. Along with this, rehabilitation of green belt children friendly park near Dr Ambedkar Chowk will be completed by September 9 and rehabilitation of green belt children friendly park in Salem Tabri will be completed by September 30. Earlier, the commissioner reviewed the schemes like PM Awas Yojna, National Urban Livelihood Mission and PM SVANidhi. Under PMAY scheme, a total of 2,402 applications were received out of which 998 were rejected. Now MC will do physical verification of these rejected applications because their addresses were not found correct . Under PM SVANidhi the MC has received 20,364 applications are already uploaded against a target of 27,105. It was found out that loan applications are pending in some of the banks so additional commissioner is told to get these loan applications approved. Commissioner Sabharwal said, “I reviewed many schemes under central government and in some schemes the progress was satisfactory while in some I have asked officials to speed up the work. For improving the condition of roads, I have instructed for patch work so that commuters do not suffer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/under-fire-for-poor-condition-of-roads-mc-chief-asks-for-patch-work/articleshow/85881128.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||NGT panel suggests closer monitoring of illegal units||New Delhi: Following a factory fire that broke out in west Delhi’s Udyog Nagar, which claimed the lives of six people, a National Green Tribunal (NGT) committee, appointed to identify the cause of the incident and remedial measures, has suggested forming state-level committees under each district magistrate, which will meet every four months to review enforcement activities taking place in each district. The committee, while finding negligence from the north corporation for failing to enforce building bylaws effectively, said each sub-committee can carry out enforcement drives from time to time to identify more such industries that were operating illegally and without requisite norms and permissions. The NGT committee, which has submitted its findings to the tribunal, comprises of officials from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), DCP (outer Delhi), director of industrial safety and health, and was constituted on July 29, 2021, under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate (West). Since then, the committee has held four meetings — on July 30, August 4, August 10 and August 16 — meeting officers from CPCB, DPCC, Delhi Fire Service (DFS), Delhi Police, labour department, north and south corporation, DSIIDC, BSES and the forensic sciences laboratory, among others agencies. The committee said not only was poor enforcement in place from the north corporation, but multiplicity of licences being issued by different departments was causing ambiguity during enforcement. “The role of the north corporation has been found lackadaisical as it has completely failed to enforce building bylaws, due to which norms have been openly flouted, thereby taking away precious lives,” the report says, stating that there are 33 approved planned industrial areas in Delhi as well as 25 unplanned industrial clusters notified for redevelopment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngt-panel-suggests-closer-monitoring-of-illegal-units/articleshow/85878648.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Syringe shortage leads to vaccine wastage worry||KOLKATA: Vaccinators in Bengal who managed to squeeze out an additional dose or two from Covid vaccine vials are now finding it difficult to do so due to a syringe issue. The expertise of Bengal’s vaccinators not to waste a single dose but extract more from the vials had led to an additional 16 lakh people being vaccinated in the last three-and-a-half months. In August alone, 7 lakh people could be additionally vaccinated due to negative wastage in Bengal. The state has been topping the country, along with Kerala, in negative wastage of vaccines. But vaccinators are unable to do so any longer due to poor quality of auto-disable syringe available in market. Syringe shortage, partly driven by the state requiring more syringes to deliver the additional vaccine doses being extracted from the vials, had led to the government procuring syringes from the open market. The Centre provides syringes proportionate to the vaccines. “Earlier, our vaccinators were able to squeeze out 11 doses easily from most vials and even 12 doses. But now, for past few weeks, vaccinators have not been able to draw more than 10 doses from each vial, at times 11 doses,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, vaccination coordinator at ID Hospital Beliaghata. “Yes, we are seeing this trend,” said state director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. The top state health official, however, said it was too early to immediately comment on the reasons. “It might be that the manufacturers are taking care to reduce wastage (by not giving the extra doses). But this is just a hypothetical statement,” he said. Senior health officials seconded the DHS and said they were also getting such reports from various vaccination sites. But they too said they are not sure about the reason. Kolkata Municipal Corporation admitted they were unable to take out more from the vaccine ampules due to syringe issue. According to a medical officer at a KMC-run clinic in Tollygunge, a vaccinator now can at best extract 10 doses from a single vial. While government vaccine centres are encountering the problem, private ones are yet to face it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/syringe-shortage-leads-to-vax-wastage-worry/articleshow/85878653.cms||Saikat Ray

Decision has been taken to exempt fines and interest imposed on regularisation charges on owners who do not have lease deeds (patta) of their plots/houses. These relaxations will be provided during the Prashasan Shehron Ke Sang Abhiyan 2021 (urban area services), organised by the government, in colonies developed before June 17, 1999. The exemption order was issued by the urban development and housing (UDH) department on Thursday and the benefit will be available till March 2022. According to a Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) official, such camps have been organised in the past to approve land holdings in colonies developed before June 17, 1999. However, many owners did not come forward to claim lease deeds due to various reasons, including financial ones. "The decision will reduce the financial burden. As per the rule, an interest of up to 15% can be charged on regularisation fees," he said. As per estimates, there are over 41,600 land owners without lease deeds in JDA areas alone. But, the government has not given any exemption to land owners living in regularised colonies developed after June 17, 1999.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/financial-relief-for-owners-without-lease-deeds-in-city/articleshow/85881176.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||UT asked to discontinue work on bird aviary for now||Chandigarh: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has directed the UT administration to discontinue the process of setting up of the walk-through aviary at the city forest (Nagar Van) adjoining Sukhna Lake. In a recent communication to the UT Administration, the ministry stopped the exercise till grant of approvals by the competent authority. In its reply to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), UT forest and wildlife department justified and defended the upcoming walk-through aviary at the city forest (Nagar Van) adjoining Sukhna Lake. “None of the rules, guidelines or laws have been violated in the process,” UT’s reply read. UT chief conservator of forests (CCF), Debendra Dalai, in the reply to AWBI said, “The department of forest and wildlife, Chandigarh administration has developed two walk through aviaries at Nagar Van within the city limits to house exotic birds which are commonly bred in India.” The reply further reads, “The procurement of exotic birds was done only from the registered reputed and authentic sellers/breeders/suppliers and not from any grey market. These suppliers are registered with the Animal Welfare Board of Tamil Nadu (AWBT) and also registered on ‘Parivesh’ portal of ministry. Before selecting the sellers, a committee consisting of officers from different departments such as animal husbandry and fisheries, finance department and the forest department cross-verified all the details and sources of birds were also traced physically visiting the facilities on site. These exotic birds are housed for nature education and for all non-commercial usage or public displays”. Sources said that after the recent communication, a team of Central Zoo Authority (CZA) visited Chandigarh and they are expected to give their final order in a day or two. City-based activist R K Garg had written to secretary, Animal Welfare Board of India, in which he submitted that these birds would be kept in enclosures made of very thin layer form of net. As such birds will not be able fly freely and will be confined to a specified area, which is against the rules framed for bird sanctuaries, he had submitted. Earlier, AWBI had written to the UT forest and wildlife department stating that procurement of birds should only be made from authorised sellers, while exhibition of animals in zoological garden for education or scientific purpose is exempted under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The AWBI had also mentioned that many aerial birds in India are covered under the various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and necessary permission needs to be obtained from the Wildlife Department for their procurement. Spread over 100 hectares in and around the Sukhna Lake reserve forest area, Nagar Van has facilities such as walkways, jogging and nature trails, shallow water bodies, visitors’ shed among others. It was opened for the visitors in 2018. The committee constituted for the project had conducted a study about the habitat of the area, flora, and water quality. The ‘Bird Park’, proposed to be developed on the lines of Jurong Bird Park in Singapore, envisages creating a new tourist spot in Chandigarh and a place for bird lovers and aspiring ornithologists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-asked-to-discontinue-work-on-bird-aviary-for-now/articleshow/85878761.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Vidhan Sabha sources said the BJP, which is also the principal opposition party in the 81-member strong assembly, abstained from the meeting to stage a protest against the delay in appointment of Dhanwar MLA Babulal Marandi as the leader of opposition.  Earlier, the saffron brigade had disrupted the House proceedings in the Budget session and last year’s monsoon session demanding Marandi’s appointment. Mahto chaired the meeting in the presence of chief minister Hemant Soren, Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam, Ajsu Party chief Sudesh Mahto, Jamshedpur (East) MLA Saryu Roy, RJD MLA and minister Satyanand Bhokta and CPI-ML(L)’s Bagodar lawmaker Vinod Kumar Singh. “I am not aware why the BJP legislative party representative did not attend today’s meeting. However, I am certain that the House will function in an orderly fashion and dispense its duties without any disruption,” Mahto told journalists after the meeting at his office in Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha. Soren said it was imperative that the House functioned without a hitch this time. Without referring to the adverse effects the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic had over Jharkhand, Soren said: “Given the critical times we are in, it is necessary that the House functions without obstacles. The government is open to suggestions from the opposition.” Sudesh said he has suggested the Speaker consider holding a debate on the inclusion of caste-based census in this year’s national census. “The Speaker assured that it will be brought to the assembly working committee in its meeting on Monday (September 6),” Sudesh said. Alam, who is also the minister for parliamentary affairs, did not divulge the bills which are likely to be tabled in the House. However, sources said the government is likely to bring in the Medical Protection Bill for its passage along with the bill to defer the panchayat elections in Jharkhand till later this year. On the eve of the monsoon session’s commencement, Congress legislative party huddled into a meeting at a city hotel. The meeting was chaired by AICC’s Jharkhand in-charge RPN Singh, AICC in-charge Ajoy Kumar and newly appointed state president Rajesh Thakur. The BJP legislative party also huddled into a meeting at its party office later in the evening to chalk out its strategy. However, decisions taken at the meeting were not known till the time of filing the report as the meetings were underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-stays-away-from-speakers-meet-ahead-of-monsoon-session/articleshow/85877683.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Last year, NMC did not allow the aforementioned medical colleges to enrol students owing to the lack of faculty members, among others. Talking to TOI over phone, Das said, “The ground reality of these three new medical colleges continues to be dismal and there is a growing apprehension that NMC may not allow the institutes to enrol new students. We know that many teachers of these colleges have been transferred but no replacement has been sent there. Four teachers alone have been transferred from Palamu and their substitutes are not posted there. In such a situation, where faculties in these colleges are absent, NMC may not allow admissions to take place for the 2021- 22 session.” He added that NMC will be inspecting these colleges either before the NEET examination or before the NEET result is announced. The NEET exam is scheduled to take place on September 12. Das said people of the state, especially the students, must ask the government to explain its apathy towards the proper management of the medical colleges. “There is still some time left for the government to save the new medical colleges from further mismanagement,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/das-takes-a-dig-at-govt-over-poor-condition-in-3-new-med-colleges/articleshow/85878263.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Thursday, deputy commissioner Aditya Ranjan said the exercise is part of their campaign titled “Mera Vidyalaya Meri Zimmedaari”. He said during his stint in Chaibasa (West Singhbhum) as the deputy development commissioner, he had implemented a similar scheme and reaped satisfactory results. Ranjan said, “Providing quality education to the children is the ultimate dream of every parent. Hence, the district administration has decided to help in making those dreams come true.” On the processes of the scheme, the DC said in the first phase, all selected schools will be provided with modern facilities like libraries, ICT labs, playgrounds, good drinking water and proper hygiene on the campus among others to provide a congenial environment for students to pursue their studies and passion. He further said, “Bi-lingual (English & Hindi) mode of teaching will be introduced in these schools to attract students as well parents. Apart from classroom computer training, 45 days of training will be given to each student in rotation at the district e-governance society (DEGS). Of the 45 days, 15 will be on career counselling.” The administration has set up a seven-member district programme management unit under an SDO-rank official for overall supervision of the scheme. “To uplift the morale of the students, senior officers of the administration will also take classes from time to time. Each school will be divided into four houses in the name of the local rivers and the waterfalls to make the students aware of the local heritage. There will be a display of career counselling charts in each school. The schools will be rated on marking systems based on certain parameters like mode of teaching, cleanliness and reorganization. The marks will be filled up by the visiting officers,” he said, adding “We are also working towards improving the student-teacher ratio.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/19-model-schools-to-come-up-in-koderma-district/articleshow/85878324.cms||---

He added, “We will also intensify the frequency of our patrolling on tracks.” He further said, “With coach trains running at 130 km/hr, the tracks on Howrah-Mumbai line are now high-speed ones and therefore the risk involved in trespassing is more than ever.” When asked, Pathak said that as such there are no particular sites on the 1346.24 km-long-track under Chakradharpur division which can be identified as danger zones. “Other than the dedicated sites such as authorised rail crossings, foot over-bridge and subways, there’s always risk involved whenever one crosses the railway tracks at unauthorised sites,” he added. Meanwhile, an RPF official of the division said that Wednesday’s accident took place at an unauthorised site. “The deceased were not crossing the tracks, rather they walked onto the bridge which is very dangerous,” the RPF official requesting anonymity said. The deceased, who were the residents of Barabambo in Seraikela, were going to their relative’s house in Lodia in Chakradharpur after visiting a bank in the Chakradharpur town when they were mowed by the train, Chakradharpur police station in-charge Praveen Kumar said. Sources at Chakradharpur division said that there’s no provision for monetary compensation to the next of the kin in such accidents as per the Railways Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/chakradharpur-rly-div-starts-poster-campaign-intensifies-patrolling-on-tracks-to-avert-mishaps/articleshow/85877330.cms||B Sridhar

Moreover, there are no positive cases inside the jails. “I was told a few days back that the vaccination figure is 90%. By now, the figure must be 100%,” Kumar said. There are around 21,500 prisoners across 30 jails, including five central prisons, in the state, though the figure keeps changing as new convicts and undertrials arrive daily. “The new arrivals are being kept under quarantine for at least 14 days,” Kumar said, adding that at present, there are no Covid cases in the jails. At Birsa Munda Central jail in Ranchi, the authorities said all of the nearly 3,700 inmates, which includes convicts, elderly undertrials, and jail staff have received both doses. However, several new under-trials have come and they are being kept under quarantine before sending them to the wards. The administration would be holding special camps at least once a month to vaccinate the newcomers. The authorities also said the Birsa jail has not recorded a single Covid case in the past three months. During the first wave of Covid-19 last year, there were 270 Covid cases and around 40 during the second wave earlier this year, they said. The problem of overcrowding, however, still persists in the jails, which are filled beyond their capacity. In Chatra, Gumla, Latehar, Garwah and Rajmahal, the prisons are filled at more than 200% capacity. The jail administration said it is planning to shift prisoners from the overcrowded jails to the new prisons at Barhi and Nagar Utari. Some have already been shifted to Barhi.  The administration is also giving parole to some prisoners to reduce the number of inmates. It has also prepared a list of 185 prisoners whose cases would be reviewed in a meeting headed by chief minister Hemant Soren for their release soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/over-90-prisoners-in-state-vaccinated/articleshow/85877719.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: 3 policemen suspended, 2 moved to police lines for assaulting jawan||CHATRA: Chatra SP Rakesh Ranjan has suspended three policemen and attached two others to police lines for beating up an Army jawan in Mayurhund block during a mask-checking drive on Wednesday. Ranjan swung into action after videos of the assault went viral. The incident occurred in the Karma Bazar area, where Pawan Kumar Yadav, a general duty soldier at the Army camp in Jodhpur in Rajasthan, was beaten up for not wearing a mask. The suspension order came late on Wednesday night. Ranjan said, “Based on a report from the DSP (headquarters), three policemen (one head constable and two constables) have been suspended as disciplinary action. Two sahayak constables have also been pulled up.” The victim, Pawan, is a resident of Arabhusai village under Katkamsandi block of Hazaribag district. Pawan said when he reached Karma Bazar on his bike, a police jawan, Sanjay Bahadur Ram, stopped him and took away the keys of his vehicle. “They asked me why I was not wearing a mask. When I showed them my helmet with the visor face shield, they started misbehaving with me and attacked me with lathis,” he said. Notably, Mayurhund block development officer Saket Sinha, who was present at the spot during the mask-checking drive, was not held responsible for the incident. But locals said they want action against him, too, for being a mute spectator even though as an administrative officer, he had the power to prevent it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-cops-suspended-2-moved-to-police-lines-for-assaulting-jawan/articleshow/85877391.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Rafale jets have landed but Rahul Gandhi yet to take off: Rajnath Singh||KEVADIA: Defence minister Rajnath Singh took potshots at the Congress and Rahul Gandhi on Thursday for creating an unnecessary issue over Rafale fighter jets . “They made an issue out of it but what happened? Rafale jets were manufactured in France and they have already landed in India. But Rahul is yet to take off,” Singh said at Kevadia in Narmada district. Singh was in Kevadia, Statue of Unity, for BJP’s three-day executive meeting. He also slammed the Congress, saying that the party wasn’t sensitive towards the Indian soldiers as it kept the issue of One Rank One Pension (OROP) unresolved for 40 years. “If the previous Congress governments were sensitive towards army jawans, the issue of OROP, which the jawans had been demanding for 40 years, would have been resolved. But the Congress did not accept the demand,” he added. “But, Modi implemented it immediately. This shows the difference between a Congress government and a BJP government,” he said. He further emphasized that not a single major terror attack has taken place in the country since Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014. “Forget about Jammu and Kashmir, no major terrorist attack has taken place in any part of the country after the arrival of PM Modi. This is our major achievement,” said Singh. “Terrorists now realise that they are not secure even in their safe havens. What we did (surgical strike in PoK) after the Uri attack gave a clear message to the world that we can kill terrorists on this side as well as by crossing the border if need arises,” Singh added. Referring to the Ram temple at Ayodhya, he said that such issues are not mere slogans, but BJP’s commitment. “We always fulfil what we promise. These are not mere election slogans. It’s our cultural commitment. Now, no force can stop the construction of a grand Ram temple. We had sacrificed three of our state governments after the structure (mosque) was razed ...,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rafale-jets-have-landed-but-rahul-yet-to-take-off-rajnath/articleshow/85877527.cms||---

The protesters who gathered before the assistant engineer (AE) of the water department, Nilesh Vaingankar, said that they are being supplied water at odd hours, especially during the night. They said that they have stay up late and go to work in the morning. Citizens also brought to the notice of the officer that the water pressure was so low that supply did not reach even the the first floor of buildings. The group was accompanied by ex-councillor Krishna alias Daji Salkar, councillor Gourish Borkar and others. People from Newvaddem, Mangor Hill, Vasco city and other places took part in the morcha. “We have been informed that a file was moved seven years ago to change the water pipelines of the Vasco city as they have becomes very old and have ruptured at many places. It is the responsibility of the local MLA to ensure normal water supply and get approval for such projects, which he has failed to do,” Salkar said. He said that he is still looking for the BJP ticket to contest the upcoming assembly elections and that people are fed up of the many projects that have failed to take shape in Vasco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fed-up-with-irregular-timings-for-water-supply-vasco-locals-lead-protest-march-to-pwd-office/articleshow/85881302.cms||---
---||Goa||NCP gives Cong September 15 deadline to decide on alliance||Panaji: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) urged Congress to “take everybody along” and form an anti-BJP coalition for the 2022 state assembly elections.  Speaking in Goa on Thursday, NCP national general secretary Praful Patel said that if Congress does not decide on an alliance by September 15, NCP will work on Plan B with other like minded parties. Patel, who arrived on an official visit to Goa to review the poll preparations said that NCP’s stand has already been conveyed to the Congress leadership, including those at the helm in Delhi. “There have been some informal talks with Congress and they have told us that they are open to considering an alliance with us. We have indicated to them that they must come forward and in the month of September itself, in the next 10-15 days, they must have a discussion with NCP and if they have other like minded parties in mind, they must complete the discussions so that every party has a few months to prepare in those assembly segments so that there is a better chance of success,” said Patel. Patel said that the NCP has been a consistent Congress ally even though the experience in 2017 was bitter. He also said that NCP has already initiated discussions with Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and other regional politicians regarding a poll strategy. Asked about speculation about NCP inducting some of the Congress turned BJP MLAs, Patel said it was premature to discuss the issue. “We have not been talking to anybody who is a so-called defector but if Congress does not decide on an alliance, then the political landscape will be different and then we are free to take our own decision. When we are together, then I will respect their sentiments,” said Patel. He also said that NCP has already begun formulating a Plan B in the eventuality that Congress fails to decide about an alliance within a reasonable time frame.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ncp-gives-cong-september-15-deadline-to-decide-on-alliance/articleshow/85881451.cms||---

This is a cruel joke played by BJP government on the common man,” Chodankar said while addressing reporters at the party’s South Goa district office, Margao. “I am deeply saddened by the cruel act of BJP government to increase LPG gas cylinder prices by Rs 25 at a time when most Goans are preparing for Ganesh Chaturthi. This act of BJP will never be pardoned,” Chodankar said. Chodankar also announced the schedule of party observer P Chidambaram’s three-day visit to the state beginning Friday. Chidambaram is scheduled to have a meeting with the Saligao block of the party at 6pm on Friday, while on Saturday he will interact with the chairpersons and convenors of election committees followed by an interaction with the newly appointed block presidents at Congress house in Panaji. A meeting with the Margao block of the party is also scheduled at 6pm on Saturday.

---||Noida||Supertech twin tower case: SIT to identify colluding Noida officials||LUCKNOW/NOIDA: The UP government on Thursday set up a four-member special investigation team (SIT) to fix responsibility of officials for the construction of Supertech’s twin towers, which the Supreme Court earlier this week ordered demolished within three months. The SIT was formed following the court’s scathing observations of collusion between Noida Authority and Supertech that led to the towers, Apex and Ceyane, coming up at Emerald Court in Noida Sector 93A in violation of law. The SIT, which has also been directed to probe the role of Supertech officials, will submit its report within a week. The Noida Authority, meanwhile, completed its internal investigation and named five retired officials among seven in its report on staffers complicit in facilitating the towers’ construction. TOI had reported on September 2 that seven officials were under scrutiny. The seven named in the report include Mukesh Goyal, a former manager in the planning department who was shunted out to Gorakhpur last month and suspended this week. The report has been sent to the state government with a recommendation to constitute a high-level committee to look into the roles of other senior officials posted in Noida Authority during the period when most rules were bent. Specifically, the report has sought an inquiry into the roles of two additional CEOs posted in 2006-07 and 2011-12 The SIT, which will now carry out the primary investigation, is headed by infrastructure and industrial development commissioner Sanjiv Mittal. Its three other members are additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh, additional director general of police (Meerut zone) Rajiv Sabharwal and chief town & country planner Anoop Kumar Srivastava. Why Supertech’s Noida twin towers are going to be India’s tallest demolition challenge"In the matter of Messrs Supertech, which was allocated group housing plot no. GH-4 in Sector 93A Noida, in which the Supreme Court has observed that there was collusion between the builder and officers of Noida Authority, an SIT is being constituted," the government order says. In its order dated August 31, the two-member bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said: "The record of this case is replete with instances which highlight the collusion between the officers of Noida with the appellant and its management." The Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad high court order of 2014 ordering the demolition of the towers. The CM, according to a government official, has said that the case dated back to 2004 — the year land for Emerald Court was allotted — and responsibility of all officials between 2004 and 2017 needed to be fixed. The current government took office in 2017. "Strict action will follow as soon as the SIT submits its report. Mukesh Goyal has been suspended already," the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/supertech-twin-tower-case-sit-to-identify-colluding-noida-officials/articleshow/85885236.cms||Neha Lalchandani

President of the committee Roshan Desai said that LPG prices have steadily increased since the BJP government came to power. “Rising LPG prices have broken the backbone of the common man who are struggling to survive in such times,” she said, adding, “This has made the situation very difficult for middle-class families. The BJP-led government which promised achche din is now rubbing salt on the wounds of the common people”. She said that the Narendra Modi government has completely forgotten the problems of the common man. “Our demand is that the government should consider the common man’s problems and rollback the hike in LPG cylinder prices,” Desai said. The protesters expressed their anger by making tea on a kerosene stove.

Furtado said that he is unperturbed by the entry of former mayor and his current CCP colleague Uday Madkaikar into the Congress fold. Furtado said that the success of the Ami Ponjekar panel in the CCP council elections proved that BJP Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate is not invincible. Asked if he would stand as an independent if Congress chose another candidate, the seven-term councillor said he would remain with the party. “The party has to give me the ticket as I have proved my mettle and loyalty through Ami Ponjekar. What else do they want me to prove?” said Furtado. Without directly referring to anyone, Furtado said that all politicians who are returning to Congress should work to strengthen the party for the next five years before aspiring for a ticket.  “I am sure Uday Madkaikar will support me this time and after five years maybe I will support him,” said Furtado. He also said that several former CCP councillors and sitting councillors are likely to join Congress in the coming days. “I am in touch with most of the disgruntled BJP karyakartas,” said Furtado, adding that voters are waiting to elect a good candidate. “They are fed up of Babush’s tricks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-for-5-yrs-before-seeking-cong-ticket-says-furtado/articleshow/85881732.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||Andhra Pradesh high court orders jail for 3 IAS officials for contempt||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh HC on Thursday found five IAS officers guilty of contempt of court and sentenced three of them to jail terms ranging from two weeks to a month. The court, after hearing a contempt petition moved by one Tallapaka Savitramma of Kanupur village, Nellore district, found the officials guilty of wilful disobedience of the court’s orders. However, Justice Battu Devanand suspended the operation of the sentence by four weeks on the request of the officials. While senior IAS officer Manmohan Singh, the then principal secretary for revenue, was sentenced to four weeks in jail and a fine of Rs 1,000, principal secretary for finance SS Rawat was sentenced to one month in jail and fined Rs 2,000. Failing to pay the fine would increase the jail term by another week, the court said. Nellore district collector Revu Mutyala Raju has been sentenced to two weeks in jail and fined Rs 1,000, while KNV Chakradhar and MV Seshagiri Babu, who previously worked as Nellore district collectors, were fined Rs 2,000 fine each. Savitramma had moved a petition in 2017 after her assigned land was taken away by the state government for the setting up of the National Institute for Mentally Handicapped. Considering her plea, the court had directed the government to compensate her along with the others within three months. As no damages was paid, she moved a contempt petition in 2018. The court issued notices to the respondents and, after perusal of counter-affidavits filed by them, impleaded officials who had been Nellore district collectors during the period of litigation as well as principal secretaries of finance. After impleading the officials, the compensation amount was finally paid on March 30, 2021, a delay of about three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/andhra-pradesh-high-court-orders-jail-for-3-ias-officials-for-contempt/articleshow/85885255.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Delhi||Tihar Jail inmate Ankit Gujjar’s death a case of custodial violence, says Delhi high court||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday observed that the nature of injuries sustained by Ankit Gujjar, who died in Tihar Jail, clearly shows that it was a case of custodial violence. Justice Mukta Gupta, while reserving order on a plea by Gujjar’s kin seeking transfer of probe into his death to the CBI, added that the incident involved a larger issue of extortion by jail officials. “The issue is the moment a phone is recovered (from the deceased), your (jail) officer is asking for money. It is a case that for every implication, money is extorted from the family. It is far more serious. What has happened to the deceased must have happened to others also. It is writ large that it is a case of custodial violence and who has done it is also very clear,” Justice Gupta said. Gujjar, 29, was found dead in his cell in Tihar on August 4. His family alleged that Gujjar was being harassed by jail officials as he was "unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money" and was murdered "as part of a pre-planned conspiracy". On August 18, the court had sought status reports from Delhi Police and jail authorities on the plea. Counsel for the family, advocate Mehmood Pracha, said that "police is not conducting investigation in proper format" as the DVR of the CCTV installed in the jail was yet to be recovered and the aspect of extortion by jail officials through online transactions was not being looked into. "The status report filed before the magistrate and status report filed here say that the injury is minor. The post-mortem shows 12 grievous injuries," he said. The prosecution maintained that it was a fair probe and said Gujjar, who was found to be in possession of a mobile phone, amongst other things, had attacked the deputy superintendent earlier in the day and, as of now, action had been initiated against certain officials. "He (Gujjar) may have committed an offence, (but) this man (jail official) not only beats him up but gets CCTV closed… A life has been lost. Twelve injuries show it is a case of custodial torture," the court remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-jail-inmate-ankit-gujjars-death-a-case-of-custodial-violence-says-delhi-high-court/articleshow/85885256.cms||---
---||Goa||After Cong snub, GFP looks to strengthen its presence||Panaji: With Congress steadfastly dodging the alliance question, Goa Forward Party (GFP) has also decided to strengthen its organisational presence in every constituency in the state, said GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat on Thursday. GFP’s stand appears to be similar to the voices emanating out of Congress camp. GFP has ramped up its election campaign over the last three months, with party president Vijai Sardesai touring Mandrem, Santa Cruz, Mayem and Aldona. Party functionaries will also tour Mormugao in the coming days. “The party president has given us a mandate to strengthen the organisational base at the grassroots in all constituencies. If we are a political party, then we need to have a presence in every constituency,” said Kamat at the party headquarters. Kamat’s words mimic the statements of AICC senior election observer P Chidambaram who said that that the “mandate” for the Congress is to increase membership in all the 40 constituencies. “Right now, our focus is to go to maximum constituencies and increase our members. Fielding a candidate in every constituency is a different matter. We want to have a presence in every constituency,” said Kamat. In Shiroda, GFP appointed Panchawadi pancha Vishant Gaonkar as block president. Gaonkar had joined GFP in 2017. “We will soon come up with our block committee for Shiroda and will continue our work here. We are trying our best to help people of Shioda try to resolve issues,” Gaonkar said. Kamat said discussions about alliance with Congress and other like-minded parties are going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-cong-snub-gfp-looks-to-strengthen-its-presence/articleshow/85881817.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Addressing reporters at the party’s South Goa district office after a function held to induct a few personalities from Fatorda, party spokesperson Aashish Kamat said that he hoped that any decision with regards to an alliance will be taken by the party leadership based on the feedback received from grassroots party workers. “Going by party observer P Chidambaram’s statement that the party will contest all 40 seats, we have started working in that direction in Fatorda. We will strengthen the party and field our candidate in Fatorda. Chidambaram was very clear that the party workers’ feedback will be taken at constituency level with regards to the alliance. I don’t think that the party will be inclined to forge an alliance,” Kamat said. Stating that it was imperative that all Opposition forces stay united, Kamat said that if Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai wanted to join hands with Congress, he was welcome to join. “Anybody is welcome to join the party. Congress is the only party that will always be against BJP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-fatorda-block-vows-to-wrest-control-of-seat/articleshow/85881879.cms||---

This was announced by chief minister Vijay Rupani in Kevadia on Thursday after the Gujarat government signed an MoU to this effect with ministry of defence in presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh. Rupani said that the 4-day expo will be held between March 10 and 13 in Gandhinagar next year. While the seminars will be held at Mahatma Mandir, the helipad exhibition centre will serve as the exhibition site for the expo. “We have good infrastructure for defence equipment production in the state. The Dholera SIR may become a hub for defence equipment production units. Apart from having a big runway and airport, it also has enough land for weapon trial and testing range,” Rupani said. Singh said that plans are afoot to host even the defence ministers’ conclave in the state. Singh and Rupani were in Kevadia to attend a meeting of Gujarat BJP’s state executive that was presided over by state unit chief C R Paatil. Along with the key leaders all the party MLAs, MPs, members of executive committee, party’s state office-bearers and presidents of district and city units attended the meet.

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case probe waste of time & money, says court||NEW DELHI: While discharging three people accused in a northeast Delhi riots case, a city court on Thursday said police’s failure to conduct a proper investigation was a “colossal” and “criminal” waste of taxpayers’ time and money. It added that when history would look back at Delhi’s worst communal riots since partition, the failure of police to conduct a proper, scientific investigation would “surely torment the sentinels of democracy”. The court said it couldn’t permit such cases to meander mindlessly, taking precious judicial time when it was an “open-and-shut” matter. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said the sort of probe conducted and the lack of supervision by superior officers clearly showed that the investigating agency had merely tried to pull wool over the court’s eyes and nothing else. He said he was pained to note that no real/effective investigation had been carried out and merely by recording the statement of constable Gyan Singh, that too at a belated stage, especially when the accused were already under arrest in another case, police had just tried to show the case as “solved”. “The evidence brought on record miserably falls short for framing charges against the accused,” it was observed. After a long investigation, police had shown only five witnesses, one being the victim, the other the constable, one duty officer, a formal witness and the investigating officer. The court discharged Shah Alam, Rashid Saifi and Shadab of all charges related to alleged vandalism, looting and setting on fire the shop of one Harpreet Singh by a mob. It noted that there were a large number of accused who had been languishing in jail for the last 18 months or so merely because the trial in their cases had not been initiated and police just seemed busy filing supplementary chargesheets. “The precious judicial time of this court is being wasted in giving dates in those cases. A lot of time is being consumed by cases like the present one, where there is hardly any investigation carried out by police,” the court observed. The judge said the case appeared to have been solved merely by filing the chargesheet without any real effort being made to trace eyewitnesses, the real accused and technical evidence. “This does not appeal to the senses that nobody watched such a large crowd of rioters when they were on a spree of vandalism, looting and arson,” he added. “The complaint was required to be investigated with a fair amount of sensitivity and skill, but it was missing and recording of the statement of constable Singh on March 3, 2020 was the ‘be all and end all’ of the entire investigation,” said the court. Coming down heavily on police, the court said, “The casualty in the matter is the pain and agony suffered by the omplainant/victim, whose case has virtually remained unsolved, callous and indolent investigation, lack of supervision by superior officers and criminal waste of the time and money of the taxpayer.” The court noted that even after receiving two written complaints, police didn’t start investigations till March 2, 2020, for reasons best known to them. All of a sudden, on March 3, 2020, the constable “emerged in the picture and the IO leapfrogged that opportunity” to record his statement and consequently arrested the accused persons from Mandoli jail. It added that the silence and delay was not only fatal to the case, but also gave an impression that the constable had been “planted/introduced” to “solve” the case. The other observations were that the accused had not been specifically named in the FIR, no specific role had been assigned to them, no recovery of any sort was made, no eyewitness account was available on record and no CCTV footage or video clip confirmed their presence at the scene of the crime. There was no material to even remotely show that they had participated in the criminal conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/northeast-delhi-riots-case-probe-waste-of-time-money-says-court/articleshow/85885282.cms||Usha Das

---||Bengaluru||Vokkaliga-Lingayat forum set up against Karnataka govt caste census report||BENGALURU: The politics over caste-based reservation has taken a fresh turn with two dominant communities — Vokkaligas and Veerashaiva-Lingayats — coming together under the aegis of a new forum to oppose the state caste census report. The Vokkaliga Veerashaiva-Lingayat Sourdha Vedike is organising an event on Saturday, where seers and leaders will urge the government to reject the Kantharaj commission’s caste census report. Siddaramaiah had commissioned the report in 2014-15 when he was chief minister but his government said the report was not ready before its term ended in 2018. “At the outset, the report is flawed as it distorts the facts about the population of communities. While the population of certain communities is inflated, the population of others, like Vokkaligas and Lingayats, has been undermined. The two communities have joined hands to fight it out,” said VS Nataraj, convenor of the Vedike. Backward classes panel studying reportThe development is being seen as politically significant as the Vokkaligas and Lingayats are considered to be strong votebanks in southern and northern Karnataka respectively and political leaders of the two communities are often seen as rivals, especially when it comes to occupying the chief minister’s position. “It is not the time to discuss the political differences between the two communities. The common cause at present is to oppose the caste census,” said Krishne Gowda, coordinator of the Vokkaliga Veerashaiva-Lingayat Sourdha Vedike. The synergy also comes days after the Centre brought in a constitutional amendment restoring powers of states to identify backward classes and draw up their own OBC lists. “It is quite interesting to note that the two politically heavyweight communities are coming together, given the situation in Karnataka, ahead of the 2023 assembly polls. While the ongoing debate over caste-based reservation seems to be setting the tone for the upcoming elections, the newfound camaraderie between a section of Vokkaligas and Lingayats appears to be for political convenience,” said BS Shivanna, chairman of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Thinkers Forum. Earlier this week, Siddaramaiah demanded that the state government accept the Rs 140 crore Kantharaj commission report and reclassify the OBC categories based on the population of communities. “Now, the report is ready and the Centre has empowered the state government to identify communities and give OBC tag to them. So this is the right time for the government to accept the Kantharaj commission report and act on it,” said Siddaramaiah. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has put the ball in the court of the Karnataka State Commission For Backward Classes as it is the panel’s prerogative to submit the report to the government. “We are studying the report and legal aspects about its submission. We need some more time to decide on it,” said Jayaprakash Hegde, chairman of the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vokkaliga-lingayat-forum-set-up-against-caste-census-report/articleshow/85883387.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The CBI’s FIR accuses Tiwari of entering into a criminal conspiracy with Daga and some unknown persons to subvert the agency's probe into extortion allegations against Deshmukh by disclosing case-sensitive and confidential documents. The cop, attached to the CBI, accepted bribes to leak the information, the FIR states. The CBI had asked for Tiwari and Daga to be remanded in its custody for a week. Special CBI Judge Vimal Kumar Yadav granted the agency their custody for two days after hearing both sides. Advocate Tanvir Ahmad Mir, appearing for Daga, told the court that the CBI lodged the FIR on Aug 31, but didn't supply a copy for over 24 hours. On August 29, a report that was purportedly part of a preliminary inquiry conducted by the CBI into the case against Deshmukh was leaked. The report allegedly mentions that the agency had concluded that "no cognisable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anil-deshmukhs-lawyer-arrested-cop-sent-to-cbi-remand-in-docu-leak-case/articleshow/85885294.cms||Usha Das

Darjeeling tea is India’s first geographical indication (GI)-tagged product, which ensures that none other than those authorised are allowed to use and sell it. Since the last decade, the Hills tea garden owners have been urging the Centre to ban sale and distribution of Nepal tea in bulk and enforce publication of a label of origin, FSSAI compliance and customs checks on it. In a letter to the CM on September 1, DTA chairman B K Saria wrote: “Production of Darjeeling tea after the prolonged crisis of 2017 has come down from 9.5 mkg to around 6 million kg (mkg) in 2020, while salaries/wages of garden employees have gone up by around 50%. Coupled with this, the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic has affected both the domestic and exports market. The crisis has been further compounded by the sale of deceptive Nepal tea being sold in the Indian market as ‘Darjeeling Tea’.” According to an estimate by DTA, in 2020, around 9 mkg of tea was imported from Nepal and sold to "naive" customers as Darjeeling tea. As per the Board, 69.4 mkg of Nepal tea has been imported to India in the last four years, of which only around 26.6 mkg has been re-exported, underlining the fact that the rest 42.8 mkg of imported leaves were sold in India. In August 2020, the Centre had cleared a long-pending revision of the Indo-Nepal trade treaty, which would now ensure checking of mandatory sanitary and phytosanitary certificate for importing tea from the Himalayan nation. However, the DTA, in the letter, complained that tea leaves imported legally from Nepal are not subjected to any check by the Indian food quality watchdog, FSSAI. “Also, Nepal tea is sold at a much cheaper rate than the Darjeeling cuppa as its cost of production is very low owing to rampant use of child labour and gross violation of labour laws,” it adds. Explaining the gravity of the situation, Sandeep Mukherjee, principal advisor to DTA, said: “Darjeeling tea industry is not getting the required attention that it deserves. Unless import of Nepal tea into India is banned, the livelihood of those dependent on it would be at risk and may reach a point of no return, where more tea gardens in the Hill would shut down.” According to DTA, there are around 67,000 people involved with the Hills tea sector directly and four lakh indirectly. The Board in September last year had officially made DTA (“an equal partner in the protection of Darjeeling GI”), a joint authority to monitor, enforce and report on the producers, who mix and sell illegally imported Nepal tea under the ‘Darjeeling’ brand name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/darjeeling-planters-at-bengal-cm-door-for-blanket-ban-on-nepal-tea/articleshow/85880084.cms||Sovon Manna

Bihar, where two assembly seats are vacant, and Assam having three MLA vacancies apprised EC — represented by secretary general Umesh Sinha and deputy election commissioners of the states concerned — about their respective flood situation. Sources said EC will take a call soon on the bypoll schedule, keeping in mind factors like Covid-19 cases, floods and upcoming festivals like Durga Puja, Dussehra and Diwali. While three Lok Sabha seats are currently vacant — Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh and Mandi in Himachal Pradesh — 35 assembly seats across 16 states are due for bypolls. The 35 seats include seven seats in West Bengal; four in UP; and three each in Himachal, MP and Assam. EC sources said the commission will soon decide on whether to go ahead with all bypolls or hold them separately, depending on the evolving Covid and floods situation. A call on whether or not bypolls should be held in UP, where assembly polls are due in first half of 2022, will also be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bypolls-due-in-17-states/uts-covid-floods-pose-a-worry/articleshow/85885341.cms||Bharti Jain

The convict did not want to marry her because he suspected that she was having an affair with another man. The court also fined Himanshu Chauhan Rs 1 lakh, 90% of which will be awarded as compensation to the mother of the late cop Hema Rathod. She was posted as Lok Rakshak constable at Savli police station. As per the case details, 25-year-old Rathod’s burnt body was found from a farm at Moti Bhadol village in Savli taluka on February 16 in 2018. Police arrested Chauhan as he was seen with Rathod in the footage of CCTV cameras installed at two different locations. During the interrogation Chauhan admitted that he had killed Rathod as he suspected that she was having an affair with some other man and was avoiding him. He had also told cops that he wanted to call off the engagement but did not want to tell his family members because they all liked Rathod. So, to avoid the wedding, he planned to kill her. A day before the body was found, Chauhan took her to the farm where he confronted her about the suspected affair which led to a heated argument. In aggression, Chauhan tried strangling her and then kicked her down. As Rathod fell down, Chauhan strangulated her by placing his knee on her neck. Later, to conceal the identity of the body, he poured petrol on it and set it on fire. During the trial, the additional public prosecutor C G Patel submitted several documentary and forensic evidence against Chauhan which were upheld by the court. The court also took into account the depositions of the prosecution’s witnesses in convicting Chauhan. The court also directed the district legal services authority to decide on compensation to be awarded over and above the 90% of fine to be paid by Chauhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fiance-gets-life-term-for-killing-constable/articleshow/85877619.cms||---

To be manufactured in Bengaluru, the drones will have a range of about 100km, reports Chethan Kumar. The requirement for what the Army calls “loitering munition” will be fulfilled by ‘SkyStriker’ drones to be made and supplied by Bengaluru-headquartered firm Alpha Design in a joint venture with Israeli firm Elbit Security Systems. The contract signed on Wednesday is worth around Rs 100 crore. According to Elbit systems’ website, SkyStriker is a cost-effective loitering munition capable of long-range precise tactical strikes. Co bags 2 orders for radars, identification systemsThe drone improves performance, situational awareness and survivability by providing direct-fire aerial-precision capabilities to manoeuverable troops and special forces. The ‘suicide drone’ as some describe it — as it crashes into the target with the explosives — is an autonomous system that can locate, acquire and strike operatordesignated targets with a 5kg warhead installed inside the fuselage. Its electric propulsion offers a minimal acoustic signature, allowing covert operations at low altitude, making it a silent, invisible and surprise attacker. Col (retd) HS Shankar, CMD of Alpha Design, told TOI: “Location details (GPS) will be loaded onto the drone before launch. Upon launching, it will hover around the area, pick up the target, relay the information back to ground control equipment and strike only after getting clearance. Ground control can change targets after the launch, and even call it back in case a mission has to be aborted.” The Alpha-Elbit JV has already exported about 100 such drones — manufactured based on Elbit’s technology — and has orders for another 100 exports. Alpha owns 51% in the JV. 2 more defence contractsAside from the Army contract for its JV, Alpha Design has independently bagged two more defence contracts from the Indian Air Force in the past week. The first is for six Very High Frequency radars. the IAF already has long-distance surveillance radars — P18 radars — that can capture targets beyond 200km procured in 1980 and 1990s. Given their age, the IAF was looking at whether it should upgrade P18s or procure new ones at the same cost and decided to buy instead. Under the emergency procurement powers, the IAF issued EOIs and RFPs which got responses from four companies: defence PSU BEL and three private firms — Alpha Design, Astra Microwave and Data Patterns. While all four companies met the technical requirements, Alpha emerged as the lowest bidder and bagged the Rs 200 crore contract signed last week. The second, also an IAF contract, is for around 60 Identification of Friend-or-Foe (IFF) systems that will be integrated with ground radars. This technology was developed by the Centre for Airborne Systems (CABS) under DRDO and transferred to three firms: Alpha, BEL and Data Patterns. All of them had built prototypes that were approved by the authorities concerned but Alpha emerged as the lowest bidder to bag the Rs 80+ crore contract, signed on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/army-to-buy-100-armed-drones-from-bluru-firm-jv/articleshow/85883391.cms||Chethan Kumar

However, Congress MP from Bhuvanagiri Komatireddy Venkat Reddy was conspicuous by his presence at the meeting despite TPCC’s clear instructions to party leaders not to attend it. Though Vijayamma claimed that Thursday’s meeting was organised in memory of her husband, political observers said it was ostensibly held to enlist support for YS Sharmila’s new party in Telangana. Even as the meeting organisers said that there was no political motive, Vijayamma asked Telangana people to bless her daughter Sharmila, who is trying to chart her own course in state politics by organising deekshas and going on tours in support of unemployed youth and farmers. While YSRTP chief Sharmila promised to usher in ‘Rajanna rajyam’ in Telangana, Vijayamma said: “YSR was a prominent figure in Telugu politics that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former PM Manmohan Singh have both lauded him several times.” Prominent among those who attended the meeting were former APCC president N Raghuveera Reddy, former Congress MP Undavalli Arun Kumar, YSR’s close aide KVP Ramachandra Rao and former Rajya Sabha MP Gireesh Kumar Sanghi. Invitations had been sent out to 80 politicians from Telangana and 40 leaders from Andhra Pradesh. Top business magnates and key people from the film industry were also invited. Founder of Shantha Biotechnics K Varaprasad Reddy and Dr Guruva Reddy of Sunshine Hospital not only attended the sammelanam, but also shared their association with YSR. Veteran actors Krishna and Mohan Babu sent video messages. Banda Karthika Reddy, who served as a mayor of Greater Hyderabad during YSR’s period as CM, and former MLA Kuna Srisailam Goud were present. Both leaders recently switched loyalties from Congress and jointed the BJP. Former TRS MP and BJP leader AP Jithender Reddy and BC leader R Krishnaiah attended the meeting. Interestingly, none of the TRS leaders attended the meeting despite invites being extended to leaders like D Srinivas and others. Sharmila, who described her father as an extraordinary person, vowed to serve the people of Telangana. “My father had never discriminated between regions. He always loved them. When people of one region are suffering, I felt compelled to return and re-establish Rajanna rajyam (golden rule),” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ys-vijayamama-bats-for-ys-sharmilas-telangana-party/articleshow/85885394.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Following stone pelting by both sides, police resorted to lathicharge and used water cannons to disperse the protesters. Irked, farmers allegedly damaged over a dozen vehicles parked near the grain market, the venue of the rally. Some policemen and protesters sustained injuries in the stone pelting and cane charge. The rally was arranged under the SAD campaign, ‘Gall Punjab Di: 100 days, 100 constituencies’. Before this, the state had only witnessed some isolated incidents of farmers stepping up the heat on politicians, mostly BJP leaders. Earlier, the SUV of BJP state chief Ashwani Sharma was damaged while Abohar BJP MLA Arun Narang was roughed up. Farmers’ protest was by and large peaceful till now as police had not stopped them from holding sit-ins. Farmers who clashed today were mainly from Kirti Kisan Union and said they wanted to reach the stage to pose questions to Badal. Farm organisations BKU Ekta Ugraham, BKU Ekta Dakaunda and other outfits condemned the lathicharge on protesting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-clash-with-punjab-cops-near-sads-rally-venue/articleshow/85885398.cms||Neel Kamal

The court, after hearing a contempt petition moved by one Tallapaka Savitramma from Kanupur village of Venkatachalam mandal in Nellore district, found the officials guilty of wilful disobedience of the court’s orders. While senior IAS officer Manmohan Singh, the then principal secretary for revenue, was sentenced to four weeks in jail and a fine of 1,000, principal secretary for finance SS Rawat was sentenced to one month in jail and 2,000 fine. Failing to pay the fine will increase the jail term by another week, the court said. District collector of Nellore Revu Mutyala Raju has been sentenced to two weeks in jail along with a fine of 1,000, while KNV Chakradhar and MV Seshagiri Babu, who previously worked as Nellore district collectors, were fined 2,000 fine each, with a clause to spend a week in jail if they fail to pay the fine. Savitramma had moved a petition in 2017 after her assigned land was taken away by the state government for the setting up of National Institute for Mentally Handicapped. Considering her petition, the court had directed the government to pay compensation along with others as per the issued GO within three months. As no compensation was paid, she moved a contempt petition in 2018. The court issued notices to the respondents and after perusal of the counter affidavits filed by them, impleaded the officials who worked as Nellore district collectors during the period of litigation and also the principal secretaries of finance. After impleading the officials, the compensation amount was finally paid on March 30, 2021 — a delay of about three years. After perusal of the affidavits filed by the officers, the court found Manmohan Singh (then principal secretary for revenue), SS Rawat (principal secretary for finance), Mutylaraju, Chakradhar and Seshagiri Babu, who worked as Nellore district collectors, responsible for delay in payment of compensation to the 62-year-old widow. Justice Battu Devanand observed that because of the negligence and disobedience of the officials, the old woman suffered a lot. Noting that it was a fit case for contempt of court, he rejected the unconditional apology tendered by the officers. The court also directed the state government to pay `1 lakh to the petitioner towards costs. However, Justice Devanand suspended the operation of the sentence by four weeks after request by the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-high-court-sentences-5-ias-officers-to-jail-for-contempt/articleshow/85885450.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Late on Wednesday, the CBI had arrested Tiwari, who allegedly supplied sensitive and confidential documents to Daga for subverting the agency’s corruption case against Deshmukh. The CBI produced the two before a special CBI court in Delhi on Thursday and sought seven days’ custody for interrogation. The court gave two days’ CBI custody. Last week, a purported CBI report giving Deshmukh, 71, a clean chit during the initial stages of the preliminary enquiry (PE) against the former minister for alleged corruption was circulated in the media.

Tigress T32 — a photographer’s delight and such a familiar sight that locals gave it a nickname — was already decomposing when its carcass was found, weighed down by two big stones. The magnificent stripes that made it popular stood out even in death and decay. “There were deep wounds on its face. The exact cause of death has not been ascertained, but we will get those involved,” Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) field director Vincent Rahim told TOI. The facial wounds seem to have been inflicted by an axe, said officials; perhaps a failed attempt at extracting the fangs. All body organs are intact. “It is possible that the tigress fell victim to electric wire traps laid by poachers for game meat. There is another wound on its face which seems to be made by a spear,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bandhavgarhs-most-stunning-tigress-found-dumped-in-well/articleshow/85885459.cms||P Naveen

Once they speak out about their individual struggle for justice we will get a bigger picture and find that the same treatment is being meted out to almost every complainant and is not the issue of one woman alone,” Sabina Martins of Bailancho Saad said. The organisations and individuals who met recently in Panaji took note of the multiple brazen acts of violence against women in public places and criticised “inadequate response at police stations. The organisations comprising Arz, Bailancho Saad, Goa domestic workers’ forum, Human rights law network, Presentation society, Saad Aangan, The Muslim women’s association condemned the “mental violence inflicted on complainants and their families by patriarchal attitudes, victim-blaming, admonishing and even vulgar behaviour amounting to sexual harassment”. A common refrain at the meeting that government bodies have been inept and not forthcoming to address challenges women face to get justice. “The government has not provided adequate infrastructure, personnel and budget to strengthen the redressal mechanisms. Protection officers with independent charge under Domestic Violence Act, a full-fledged forensic laboratory has been a demand for several years which have not been fulfilled. Mandatory functions under various acts are just not taking place,” Martins said. Absence of quick action has resulted in erosion of trust and fear of the law which has encouraged crimes and as a result women’s right to work, pursue education, creative pursuits have been affected. Restrictions are being put on the women instead of the perpetrators who roam freely, Martins says. The organisations also decided to meet various authorities to flag off issues that need redressal like the forensic lab, regular meetings with the police and dedicated protection officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inadequate-support-to-deal-with-crimes-against-women/articleshow/85880678.cms||---

The incident took place at a school in the taluk’s Duggaladka village when the centre was chock-a-block with vaccine-seekers due to a mega drive conducted by the government on Wednesday. Sullia taluk health officer Dr B Nandakumar told TOI that KB Arun, from Kootelu village in Sullia, will still have to take another dose after a stipulated gap of 84 days. The officer said the faux pas occurred when the man didn’t leave the room after taking the first dose, and the nurse on the job didn’t realise she was administering a second dose to the same person. “Soon after realising the mistake, he was made to remain under observation at the premises for 2-3 hours before he was sent home,” he said. A team of health officers has been checking his vital parameters at his house since Wednesday evening. Dr Nandakumar said the man was under the impression that two doses of vaccine were necessary to travel. He seemed to have believed rumours that he would be denied rations from the public distribution system if he weren’t fully jabbed. “Hence, he did not leave the room after the first round. The nurse, too, could not recognise him due to the facemask and the confusion caused by the milling crowd,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-gets-2-doses-of-covishield-in-mins/articleshow/85878369.cms||Vinobha K T

Stating that approvals and clearances for the hill-cutting were issued fraudulently by the authorities, they have demanded that action be taken against all officials found guilty of indulging in ‘fraudulent practices’. One local, Dr Jorson Fernandes, alleged that the development activities on the land have been carried out on the basis of a sale deed containing several ‘glaring discrepancies’. “Also, about 150m away is a tributary of the Sal and low lying agricultural land. The whole area is home to different wild animals, birds, insects and other species and microorganisms. Hence, the whole ecological balance of the area is in jeopardy,” Fernandes said. Stating that hill-cutting would lead to alterations of sub-surface flows and damages to the ground water table, Fernandes said that the wildlife of the area has been displaced “as foxes and peacocks are seen on roads.” Pointing out to the ecologically sensitive nature of the land, Tarun Rebello, a lawyer, said, “Such ecologically fragile zones need to be protected as they balance our ecology and biodiversity and therefore such land is not appropriate for development.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cuncolim-locals-oppose-hill-cutting-cite-eco-imbalance/articleshow/85880916.cms||---

Police said the complainant, a caretaker of a holiday home at Gauravaddo, said he received a complaint from a building resident that the lift was non-functional. He went to check on the lift and when he reached the fourth floor, the top-most floor of the building, he saw the lift door open and heard people talking on the terrace. The caretaker said he saw two strangers and when he questioned what they were doing there, they both pointed pistols at him. He said they hit him on the head with the butt of one pistol, causing him injuries, and attempted to flee the spot. The caretaker immediately raised an alarm following which one assailant, identified as Sushil Bhagwan from Haryana, was caught by locals and taxi drivers.

---||India||Man charged for online barbs against judges||NEW DELHI: The CBI has filed the first chargesheet in connection with a case involving posting of derogatory messages on social media about judges and judiciary. The agency has named one Lingareddy Rajasekhar Reddy as an accused in the chargesheet. Reddy was the first suspect to be arrested in the case on July 9 when he landed in the country from abroad. He is presently in judicial custody. The CBI has also had many of the objectionable posts removed from the social media platforms and public domain. It has identified at least two more entities abroad and efforts are on to arrest them. “Investigation is continuing including through the channels of MLAT, Interpol to collect evidence from abroad,” said the spokesperson for the agency. The agency had arrested five suspects in July and August last in the case and also examined Lok Sabha MP Nandigam Suresh and former MLA Amanchi Krishnamohan, both belonging to YSR Congress, in the case. While three of the suspects were arrested in July, two men were held on August 7, just a day after Chief Justice of India N V Ramana rued that judges were not on priority for investigating agencies and that their complaints of being harassed or intimidated were not heeded despite specialised bodies like CBI being roped in. CBI had registered the case on November 11 last year against 16 people and taken over investigation of 12 FIRs from CID, Andhra Pradesh, in pursuance of the orders of the High Court.

---||Goa||After month of House nod, Goa Mining Corp Bill sent to governor||PANAJI: While the state government has ambitious plans to restart mining activities before the 2022 assembly elections, it has taken over a month to send the Goa Mining Corporation Bill 2021 for governor’s assent after it was passed in the state legislative assembly. On July 30, the state government passed the bill, but it was sent for governor’s assent on September 1. A senior government officer said that the reason behind the delay is that the law department was thoroughly checking the bill. Once a bill gets the governor’s assent, no changes can be made in the bill, the senior officer said and added, “If there is something wrong in the bill, then we cannot make a correction after the governor assent.” The senior officer said that once the bill gets the governor’s assent, it will be notified. Mining came to a halt in Goa in March 2018 after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The mining concessions in the state were granted under the decree of 1906. On December 19, 1961, Goa, Daman and Diu were liberated from Portuguese rule and Goa became a part of India. However, the concessions were deemed to have expired on December 12, 1961, which was the appointed date as per the Abolition Act, 1987, from which date the concessions were treated as deemed leases under MMDR Act. “The MMDR Act was amended in 2015 and provision for auction of the leases was inserted in the amended act, after the expiry of the mining leases. A need is therefore felt for proper implementation of the statutory provisions and to carry out scientific and sustainable mining in order to generate revenue for the state government.” The state government had renewed 88 leases for second renewal. However, the renewal of those 88 leases was quashed by the Supreme Court. The state government had filed a review petition, but it was dismissed. The state government has signed an MoU with Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd in July for carrying out mapping of mineral resources in the state and to identify potential mining sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-month-of-house-nod-mining-corp-bill-sent-to-guv/articleshow/85881075.cms||---
---||Goa||Sattari locals divided over bhumi bill||Valpoi: There is confusion in Sattari over the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill. While one group of social activists supports the bill, another group has been aggressively protesting it, holding public awareness meetings in different villages. Interestingly, in the past, both groups used to protests unitedly demanding land rights for the people of Sattari. The bill witnessed early opposition in Sattari taluka. However, after studying it, some stakeholders concluded that the bill would benefit Sattari taluka. It gathered tremendous support at a public awareness meeting held recently at Kanekar hall in Valpoi. Speaking at the meeting, social activist Ganpat Gaonkar said that most of houses in the panchayat and municipal areas are considered illegal as they have been built either on government or Alvara land. “Though authorities are regularising the houses, owners must sign an affidavit stating that they will demolish the house if any illegalities are found. Except for a few, most of our dwellings are illegal and can be demolished if any complaint arises,” Gaonkar said . Goankar said the bill provides a mechanism to give ownership right to self-occupied dwellers of small units, thus enabling them to live with dignity. “This bill is perfect for Sattari and we will support the decision of the government. There may be some amendment needed. Those opposing the bill should give suggestions instead of merely opposing it,” Gaonkar said. Another local, Ranjit Rane, said that a few people with vested political interest have been opposing the bill without a valid reason. “We are thankful to chief minister Pramod Sawant for bringing the bill, which will be a remarkable beginning for obtaining our land ownership rights,” Rane said. Meanwhile, Vishwesh Prabhu, who is against the bill, said that experts as well as the state’s renowned lawyers had strongly opposed the bill and pointed out to its illegality. “This bill is an injustice to the poor villagers of Sattari taluka as well as the state. People need to know that in the bill, ownership is restricted to houses and hence, people’s land, if in question, will be taken away by the government,” Prabhu said. “We are conducting meetings in every villages of Sattari to convey the disadvantages of the bill,” he said and demanded that the government give land ownership rights to bhumiputras. Stating that people are being misguided about the bill, one local, Dasharat Mandrekar, said that this bill is not for the betterment of the villagers. He said that officials need to clarify how this bill is good for people of Sattari and the state. Vishant Kasar, who demanded that the bill be scrapped, called for people to unitedly it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sattari-locals-divided-over-bhumi-bill/articleshow/85881063.cms||---
---||Kochi||Multiple dying declarations can prove guilt if consistent, says Kerala high court||KOCHI: If there are multiple dying declarations in a case, they can be used to establish the guilt of the accused if the declarations provide credence to each other and are reliable, the high court has held. The judgment was given by a division bench of Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice Ziyad Rahman after considering an appeal by Thankappan Achary of Thalayal near Neyyattinkara in Thiruvananthapuram. He had challenged a sessions court’s judgment of May 2017 convicting him for the murder of Thilaka, wife of his younger brother Subrahmonian, by pouring kerosene over her and setting her on fire around 9.45am on July 16, 2014. Both the brothers were residing in the same house and the deceased and the appellant had fought over steep increase in electricity bill on July 15. The victim, with 60% burns, was taken to Neyyattinkara general hospital first, where she told a doctor at 10am that she was set on fire by the appellant. She was taken to Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where she told her son, at 11.30am, that she was set on fire by the appellant. At 1.08pm, Thiruvananthapuram judicial first-class magistrate recorded her dying declaration, in the presence of a doctor, and she deposed that the appellant set her on fire. The victim’s daughter reached the hospital at 3.30pm and she was also told that it was the appellant who set her ablaze. She succumbed to injuries at 5.45am on July 17. Considering the admissibility of the four dying declarations, the court applied the tests stipulated by the Supreme Court in a 2020 judgment (Purshottam Chopra and Another Vs. Govt of Delhi). The court noted that the first declaration was within just 15 minutes, thus ruling out chances of afterthought, manipulation, tutoring, etc. As the same version was maintained in all three subsequent declarations, there is no ground to disbelieve, the court held while confirming the life sentence awarded to the appellant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/multiple-dying-declarations-can-prove-guilt-if-consistent-says-kerala-high-court/articleshow/85885525.cms||---
