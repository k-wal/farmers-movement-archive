Shankar’s wife, three children and grandchild were found dead on Friday evening. He submitted a nearly eight page report on the incident, blaming his wife Bharati Shankar for pushing others to take the step. Decomposed bodies of Bharati, her children — Sinchana, Sindhurani, Madhu Sagar — and grandson (Sindhurani’s son) were recovered from the house. Madhu Sagar, an engineering graduate, worked with a private firm, while the couple’s daughters were married. The incident came to light when Shankar, who reportedly left home following a fight with Bharati and the others last week and remained incommunicado, returned home at 5.45pm. “My wife would get upset over trivial issues and fight with me. My daughters too cultivated the same habit of quarrelling with their husbands and returning to our home. Bharati never advised them. Instead, she opposed me when I requested them to return to their husbands’ homes. Last week, my younger daughter came home after fighting with her in-laws over a trivial issue. We don’t face any financial problems,” Shankar told police. Police said they haven’t searched the house yet. “Saturday went in autopsy and inquest. We took a detailed statement from Shankar. By Sunday or Monday, we will search the entire house for a possible death note. Prima facie, it was a suicide pact. We have to wait for baby’s autopsy report,” a senior officer said, adding: “Most importantly, we will take statements from Shankar’s two sons-in-law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/suicide-pact-man-blames-wife-says-shed-fight-over-trivial-issues/articleshow/86328643.cms||---

This was revealed in a survey conducted by the marine science department of Berhampur University (BU) after undertaking a cleanliness drive to mark the International Coastal Cleanup Day on Saturday. “The study showed that 4.82 gram of solid waste material was found per square metre of the beach this year, which was much higher than the previous years’ findings. In 2018, we had found 1.6 gram solid waste per sq metre, while it was 3.6 gram in 2019,” Pratap Kumar Mohanty, professor of the marine science department, said. He added that they could not conduct the beach clean-up exercise on this day last year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. On Saturday, the marine sciences department of BU in collaboration with the National Center for Coastal Research, Chennai, the ministry of earth sciences and the Academy of Technocraft here collected heaps of garbage and debris from the Gopalpur beach. Several other organisations like the Zoological Survey of India, the Gopalpur Port Limited, the Gopalpur notified area council, the Light House officials and the locas took part in the exercise, which was inaugurated by Berhampur MLA Bikram Panda and sub-collector Keerthi Vssan V. Mohanty said, “During the three-and-half hour drive, we collected 67.10 kg solid waste of eight types from 13,934.8 sq km area of the beach. These included non-biodegradable plastic, foam plastic, rubbers, glasses, papers and different metals.” This apart, the students and volunteers also created awareness about keeping the coast clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/gopalpur-beach-becoming-more-polluted-each-yr-study/articleshow/86328725.cms||---

The former IB officer and Nagaland governor succeeded Banwarilal Purohit who was appointed as the governor of Punjab and the administrator of the Union territory of Chandigarh. “This place has a popular government mandated by the people. Governance is the responsibility of the government. Governor is to function within the parameters of the Constitution. I will try my best to keep that in mind,” he said, replying to a query from reporters as to whether he too would break away from convention like his predecessor and tour the state to hold review meetings with the district administrators. On the performance of the DMK government, the governor said it was too premature to say anything. “I believe it should be doing well. The way it has handled Covid… It (case) has come down.” He said a pandemic such as Covid was above party, politics, above differences, if at all, between a state and the Union. Reminded of the opposition from certain political parties to his appointment given his IB background, Ravi said, “The slate of our relationship is absolutely new and clean. My effort will be to make it as beautiful as possible in the days to come.” The swearing-in event that lasted 10 minutes saw chief secretary V Irai Anbu reading out ‘Warrant of Appointment’ signed by President Ram Nath Kovind on September 9. Chief justice of the Madras HC Sanjib Banerjee administered the oath of office to Ravi on the lawns of Raj Bhavan. “I, Ravindra Narayana Ravi, do swear in the name of God…,” Ravi said, evoking loud claps from the gathering. CM M K Stalin, Union minister L Murugan, ministers, judges, MPs, MLAs, bureaucrats and others were present. Former governors M M Rajendran (Odisha) E S L Narasimhan (Telangana), P Sathasivam (Kerala), M K Narayanan (West Bengal) and RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy were among the special invitees. PMK president G K Mani was present. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam was not present. The party was represented by Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, former Speaker P Dhanapal, party deputy coordinators K P Munusamy, R Vaithilingam, party whip S P Velumani and former minister P Thangamani. In a letter to Ravi, Panneerselvam expressed his greetings. He apologized for not being able to attend the swearing in ceremony, since he was in his native Theni, following the demise of his wife, P Vijayalakshmi. “I will be arriving at Chennai in a few days and I would be too glad to greet you in person at your convenience,” OPS said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/will-stick-to-guvs-constitutional-limits/articleshow/86329283.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||Most DMK allies skip swearing-in ceremony||CHENNAI: Allies of the DMK — Congress, VCK, CPI, CPM and TVK — on Saturday chose to stay away from the swearing-in ceremony of R N Ravi as governor of Tamil Nadu. The leaders used the civic polls to nine districts as an excuse or were out of Chennai to attend party meetings and programmes scheduled earlier. MDMK leader Vaiko and KNMK leader E R Eswaran were present at the event. TNCC chief K S Alagiri said there was no intention to boycott but he was preoccupied with election work. “The governor is part of the system and we don’t have any personal differences with Ravi. Tamil Nadu is a cradle of democracy. We wish the BJP had appointed an educationist or scientist, not a former IB officer. Such people should have been appointed in terrorism-hit states,” the Congress leader told TOI. Alagiri last week threatened to organise protests if the Centre attempted to use Ravi “to murder democracy in Tamil Nadu”. VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan, who urged the Centre to withdraw Ravi’s appointment, chose to skip the event. CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan said the party did not attend swearing-in ceremonies of governors. “Only the legislature, composed of elected representatives, is superior. There is no need for a governor to exercise powers over the state legislature,” Balakrishnan said. CPI state secretary R Mutharasan said he was attending a four-day party meeting in Hosur, while MMK leader M H Jawahirullah said he was busy with constituency programmes. KNMK leader E R Eswaran chose to remain seated in his chair at the ceremony rather than greet the governor on the dais.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/most-dmk-allies-skip-swearing-in-ceremony/articleshow/86329284.cms||Julie Mariappan

Nodal officers have been appointed in all departments and PSUs to conduct special drives to clear the backlog in vacancies. The campaign would ensure that people with disabilities are given 4% reservation as per section 34 (1) the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. So far, the social welfare department has identified as many as 1,095 vacancies, including 380 in the education department and 214 in the health department, in the government sector. The process of collecting details from PSUs is still on. “The vacancies will be filled up in the next six months by conducting special drives by the respective departments,” said an official in the social welfare department. “The nodal officers would be responsible for the entire process of the special recruitment drive, starting from identifying vacancies till the recruitment is completed,” added the official. The state government had announced the constitution of a panel to monitor the implementation of social justice in education, employment, postings and promotions. The panel would play a crucial role in ensuring that the long-pending vacancies meant for people with disabilities are filled up. “We want the state government to approach the issue in a futuristic way. The panel cannot limit its authority on pending vacancies alone. Finding jobs should be an exercise that is professional, scientific, robust and participatory to ensure social justice. To achieve that, the government should appoint representatives of the community to reflect the views and thoughts of the differently abled,” said Prof Deepak Nathan, a disability rights activist and founder of December 3 Movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/tn-to-fill-vacancies-for-people-with-disabilities-in-next-six-months/articleshow/86335061.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

With the popular Fair being called off in the second consecutive year, the otherwise teeming suburb, the church and the fair precincts wore a rather quiet look in the last two weeks of the celebrations. The regular stalls in front of the basilica stayed open for the few stray visitors in the last couple of weeks. Attended by lakhs of people from all walks of life and different faiths, the fair used to be known for the numerous stalls, games, shooting gallery, gas balloon kiosks, food stalls with wafting aromas and a fortnight of entertainment. Even though the fair stayed cancelled, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, Bandra, took the digital route just like last year. Masses during the Novena and Octave Feast were streamed live on their YouTube channel, TV, cable, mobile on Tata Sky Darshan, from Sept 3-19, enabling the worshipper to pray from the safety of their homes. Masses were conducted in English followed by local languages, including Konkani, Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam, and Gujarati. I MISS THE JOY OF THE BANDRA FAIRArlene, a Bandra resident, has some of the fondest memories of the fair and really misses it much. She tells us, “What I miss about the Bandra Fair and the Feast is the nine days of novena to Our Lady. Going up for the mass every day for nine days and the joy of completing the novena, and then on the feast day going with family and friends. Nothing beats the joy of just walking down the Bandra Fair. Nothing khaas there, but just the fun of going with friends, starting at the Mount and then walking up and down the stairs and having all those delicacies from the stalls, having a good laugh with friends and jostling in the impossible crowd and then coming back home feeling really happy. I miss all that.” Terrance DCunah adds, “I miss taking the children to the fair to buy all those cheap toys available there.” IT’S BEEN MORE PEACEFUL HERENot everyone who stays in Bandra feels like that though. Gretable Fernandes who has been a Bandra resident for decades is actually happy that the fair has been cancelled. She feels that the suburb has been rather quiet this year, thanks to the suspension of the fair. “It is a lot peaceful here this year. Our Hill Road used to be ‘hell road’ during the time the Bandra Fair was held. So I am quite sure, people who use public transportation from Bandra to commute to work find it a big relief this year.” Marie Dsouza, a senior citizen, agrees with Gretable wholeheartedly, and says that the municipality is surely losing a lot of money now that the fair has been cancelled. She says, “I don’t miss the fair at all. It was very dirty, very noisy and unpleasant. The building residents, and people who lived around there have been trying to stop the fair for a long time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bandra-residents-happy-that-fair-was-cancelled-for-the-second-consecutive-year/articleshow/86329214.cms||Debarati S Sen

This development has left the Indian intelligence agencies alarmed as an operation had indeed taken place around 2016 in which an Afghan suicide bomber, who was posing as a student, was tracked down to a college on the Delhi-Haryana border. The suspect, who was assembling IEDs for carrying out what could have been the first suicide bombing by IS in the country, was flown back to Afghanistan after being captured in a covert operation. The coalition forces had then undertaken an operation against IS, based on information they got from his interrogation. Read AlsoKabul airport attack kills 60 Afghans, 13 US troopsKABUL: Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul's airport Thursday, transforming a scene of desperation into one of horror in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover. At least 60 Afghans and 13 US troops were killed, Afghan and theA subsequent offensive had resulted in a massive blow to ISKP with over 500 terrorists being taken out in the bombings that followed. The suspect, codenamed Ham, was later locked up in an Afghan prison. Initial information with an agency suggests that he may have been freed during a jailbreak orchestrated by IS early August and then used to carry out the airport bombing during the exit of the US forces from the country. After the airport bombing, the fidayeen was identified by the IS mouthpiece, Amaq, as Abdul Rehman Al Logari. The Indian agencies are particularly worried over the claim by the IS magazine that the other prisoners who escaped along with Logari are “waiting for an opportunity”. In the article, the magazine’s editor says about Logari: “The brother was arrested five years ago in India, when he had travelled to Delhi to carry out an istishhadi (martyr) operation… the brother was deported to Afghanistan, but he didn’t go home and carried out his operation.” The article also criticises the Taliban, referring to them as murtad (disloyal to their religion), and calls Pakistan’s ISI Taliban’s masters. “On August 15, the coalition led by America left Kabul as the murtad Taliban took over. The days that followed and preceded this tactical withdrawal saw the murtad Taliban stoop to new lows by their own standards. From participating in the shameless gatherings of the Rafidah to patronising the crusaders, the murtadeen became more and more brazen,” the piece reads. “Kabul airport saw thousands of Afghan bureaucrats trying to leave with their families, along with traitors and killers of Muslimeen. By the grace of Allah, a soldier of the Khilafah, Abdur Rahman Al Logari, carried out an istishhadi operation which resulted in the death of 250 people, including 13 crusading American Marines and over a dozen murtad Taliban fighters,” says the article. “The brother was arrested five years ago in India, when he had travelled to Delhi to carry out an istishhadi operation on the cow-worshipping Hindus, in revenge for Kashmir. But Allah had decreed otherwise and the brother was tested with imprisonment and deported to Afghanistan. Staying true to his promise to Allah, the brother did not go home, rather he carried out his operation, his heart filled with tranquillity and pleasure (sic),” said the magazine. The 2016 operation, intelligence sources said, was highly appreciated by the security establishment and details were shared with other security agencies. Interestingly, the suspect was tracked down through human intelligence after an Indian agency was alerted about the possibility of a fidayeen attack in Delhi following analysis of certain communications and transactions abroad which had raised red flags. The sleuths had carried out covert surveillance in Lajpat Nagar and at least four educational institutions in Delhi and Haryana for close to a year before the “extremely motivated” suspect was identified.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: In 2020, 332 engineering colleges bag better pass percentage||CHENNAI: As many as 332 engineering colleges affiliated to Anna University got a pass percentage above 84% in the November/December 2020 exams. This is in contrast to the November/December 2019 exam when PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research in Coimbatore secured a pass of 83.8%, the highest that year. While a mere 57 colleges got above 50% pass in 2019, 400 of 411 colleges got above 50% pass in 2020, according to the academic performance released by Anna University on Saturday. Experts say the results are not a true reflection of the quality of students and colleges and that they were boosted due to the unsupervised online exams conducted in July. After Anna University conducted a proctored online test in February, the higher education department ordered it to conduct a re-exam following complaints from students. The results of the exam in the April/May 2020 semester were even higher as the government declared students of the first three years all-pass in view of Covid-19. As many as 30 colleges got 100% results and 412 of 441 got above 90% pass and only two colleges registered less than 70%. Principals said the high pass percentage in 2020 will make more students eligible for campus placements in 2021-22. “Usually, we will have 60%-70% of final year students with all pass and be eligible for the screening process for campus placements. This year, we have around 90% of final year students eligible for campus placements due to inflated results,” a principal from a city college said. R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College, said the absence of an exam-like environment and unsupervised tests resulted in the surge in pass percentage, but added that that it will not impact campus recruitment. “Recruiters have their own screening process and will not consider semester exam marks while selecting candidates. They have their own recruitment tests,” he said. Former vice-chancellor of Anna University E Balagurusamy said the results are not a true reflection of the performance of students and colleges. “Anna University should have avoided publishing these results on the website as it will mislead the engineering aspirants and public. The exams were not conducted in a proper form and it was mass copying. The 100% results shows the process of examination and evaluation is wrong. They should return to normal physical mode exams for next semester and if it is unavoidable, they should go for proctored online tests,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/332-engg-colleges-bag-84-pass-in-20/articleshow/86328746.cms||A Ragu Raman

While our health workers will be able to do periodic tests to see if they are keeping their sugars and blood pressure under control, we will also prevent out of pocket expenditure such as travel and wage loss to these people," said J Radhakrishnan. In addition to drugs, health workers offered palliative care services to more than 17000 people with terminal illness and physiotherapy to more 18,000 people including those with disabilities.

When officials attempted to open the locked files, the unique ID popped up demanding payment of a certain amount for each file. Till late in the evening on Saturday, teams of officials from state-owned Elcot and those drawn from entitles such as Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC) and the Thiruvananthapuram unit of forensic lab — Computer Emergency Response Team — were analysing the extent of damage and means to unlock the files. They could neither unlock the files nor retrieve the data stored in them. “No security data has been compromised,” an officer told TOI, adding that files containing protocol arrangements such as function arrangements, expenses, bill settlement, Independence Day speeches and invitation cards have been encrypted and locked. But, since most of these details had already been copied in pen drives to be taken to higher ups for clearances, all of them have back up data. Most of the public department desktops are outdated models unsupported by updates, another officer said, adding that even the purchased common place anti-virus softwares had not been paid for and duly updated. Since secretary-level officials’ establishments have not been targeted nor sensitive departments compromised, the first ever ransomware attack on a Tamil Nadu government department is being viewed as an alert, and advisories are being prepared to ensure that departments stayed vigilant against such breaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ransomware-attack-encrypts-protocol-files-of-state-govt/articleshow/86328788.cms||A Selvaraj

The PM said if they harness these, there would be hardly any requirement for engaging consultants, sources said. Sources said the PM also said he was perplexed to see why execution of works is slow even when officers and departments have enough domain knowledge and skills. In his first physical interaction with secretaries since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, the PM also asked them to reach out to all officials in their departments and use their expertise for better results. “The PM said being the head of the department, we should interact with staff across all levels... This would give a lot of confidence to the staff across all levels. There is a need to use the available government data intelligently for best results. He said we have to constantly work on improving things,” said an official. The PM’s call to secretaries comes at a time when the government has put a lot of focus on expeditious implementation of projects and schemes. This is also being seen as a departure from the earlier government when political bosses blamed the bureaucracy. The PM’s comment also gains importance considering that the government has announced big bang reforms and a massive target for monetisation of assets, which would require decisive leadership in bureaucracy. Officials said secretaries from different departments also spoke during the interaction, most of them mentioning the steps taken by their respective departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-asks-secretaries-to-use-domain-knowledge-of-officials-data/articleshow/86330232.cms||Dipak K Dash

In ECMO therapy, a machine does the job of lungs while the lungs take rest allowing the patient to recover. The AIIMS launched the facility around two months ago on July 15. Dr Krishna Mohan Gulla, an associate professor of paediatrics who was among the key doctors involved in treating the baby at AIIMS, said she had a rare condition called Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis in which proteins get accumulated in lungs. She developed the problem in July, a month after she recovered from Covid-19 in June. It was detected after she went another hospital for her fever and breathing difficulties before being referred to AIIMS. The only option was to wash both lungs with saline, which is technically challenging in such a sick child. An expert team of doctors was formed and the group decided to do the lung washing (whole lung lavage) by putting the child on ECMO support (artificial lungs). “To clean the unwanted deposits in her lungs, she was put on ECMO support for 24 hours on August 30 and on ventilator support for three days after that. She improved, the lungs were washed for a second time on September 13 without ECMO support. She responded well and was discharged on Saturday,” Gulla said. The girl would still be on one litre oxygen support for a few days at her home. She would require further follow up to ensure there is no further protein accumulation, the doctor said. Gulla said AIIMS New Delhi has treated a three and half years old baby using ECMO earlier. All available literature shows this Odisha girl would be the youngest to have been successfully put in ECMO support. ECMO is a costly treatment, for which many patients had to be airlifted from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata, Chennai and Hyderabad during peak of second wave in April to June. In government sector, AIIMS Bhubaneswar and SCB Medical College and Hospital Cuttack have launched ECMO in recent months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/dhenkanal-girl-countrys-youngest-to-get-ecmo-therapy-for-post-covid-problems/articleshow/86329503.cms||Ashok Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Cell phone number theft racket busted in Odisha, 2 held||BHUBANESWAR: How about the mobile number that you are using all of a sudden goes defunct, gets used by another person within the next few hours while the SIM card is with you? Police here unearthed such a mobile number theft racket and arrested two former employees of a telecom company here on Saturday. Deputy Commissioner of Police Umashankar Dash said a gang involving these two and their associates stole at least 36 vanity mobile numbers and digitally transferred the numbers to others without the knowledge of the original customers who had paid a premium to buy these. The police are also investigating if the stolen numbers were used to make bank fraud of the original users. Dash said it’s a unique type of fraud with its origin in Bhubaneswar. The two arrested accused, Keshab Chandra Dhir (27) a matriculate, and Sanjat Kumar Panda (27) a graduate, both natives of Bhubaneswar, worked as team leaders in the telecom company. They were issued a Local Area Payment Unit (LAPU) number, which is used to recharge, activate SIM and digitally swap SIMs. They lost their job in the company around one and half years back, but did not return the LAPU, which they were supposed to. Using the LAPU number, they digitally swapped different vanity SIMs without the knowledge of the customers and sold it to people using internet. The buyers transferred money to the account of the fraudsters. People buy vanity numbers paying thousands of rupees. To not get caught, the moment they were swapping the SIM they port out the number immediately to other networks. This helped them retain the SIM as the victim would complain to a mobile service provider who no longer served them because the number is already ported out to another service provider. Dash said the crime came to notice after the telecom service provider lodged a complaint that many of its customers were alleging that their SIMs were not working while their numbers were being used by unknown persons. They were using the 15-digit International Mobile Subscriber Identity number of the SIMs to get new SIMs from their associates sitting in different locations of India. They were activating them by uploading fake documents such as AADHAR, PAN and driving licence through the LAPU numbers. Dash said the fraudsters used simple tools available on line to prepare different fake identity proofs. A case has been registered at Infocity police station in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cell-phone-no-theft-racket-busted-2-held/articleshow/86329500.cms||Ashok Pradhan

Asked if he would accept whoever Congress chose as the new CM, Amarinder said, “I will not do it (make a commitment) right now. I will now consult my associates and supporters and then make a decision. I have been in politics for 52 years and remained CM for 9.5 years… They have stood by me.

---||World||Imran bats for 'inclusive' govt in talks with Taliban||ISLAMABAD: Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for installing an inclusive government in Afghanistan that provides representation to all ethnic groups of the war-torn country. "After meetings in Dushanbe with leaders of Afghanistan’s neighbours, and especially a lengthy discussion with Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon, I have initiated a dialogue with the Taliban for an inclusive Afghan government to include Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks," Imran tweeted on Saturday. "After 40 years of conflict, this inclusivity will ensure peace and a stable Afghanistan, which is in the interest not only of Afghanistan but the region as well." Almost similar views were expressed by leaders of other countries at the recent 20th Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Council of Heads of State (SCO-CHS) Summit, with economic cooperation among the member states and Afghanistan’s situation being the pivotal topics. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had spoken via a video link, noted that the new provisional government could not be called representative or inclusive, "as we do not see representatives of other ethnic groups there but believe we need to work with it". Putin also criticised the withdrawal of the United States-led forces from Afghanistan and urged the SCO member states to talk about dealing with the volatile situation there. Chinese President Xi Jinping said it was necessary to "encourage Afghanistan to put in place a broad-based and inclusive political framework" and "resolutely fight all forms of terrorism" so that it can live in peace with its neighbours. He was of the opinion that Afghanistan should be guided to be more open and inclusive, and pursue moderate domestic and foreign policies. Earlier this month, the Afghan Taliban had announced a 33-member caretaker government without any non-Talib or woman. The interim set-up is dominated mainly by Pashtuns who constitute less than half of Afghanistan’s population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/imran-bats-for-inclusive-govt-in-talks-with-taliban/articleshow/86331723.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Need to Indianise judiciary to make it litigant-friendly: CJI Ramana||NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: After 70 years, the Indian judiciary is readying itself to break from the colonial and foreign procedural and jurisprudential influence as CJI N V Ramana on Saturday laid emphasis on effecting radical changes to enable courts and its stakeholders create a friendly atmosphere and use a language familiar to litigants from rural areas. Speaking at a memorial for SC Judge M M Shantanagoudar in Bengaluru, the CJI said, "Very often our justice delivery poses multiple barriers for the common people. The working and the style of courts do not sit well with the complexities of India. Our system, practices, rules being colonial in origin may not be best suited to the needs of the Indian population." Does this mean the intellectual weight of constitutional court judgments would no longer be measured by incorporating the logic in decisions by the UK and US Supreme Courts, which has been common in important judgments of the Indian Supreme Court and the high courts? The CJI did not elaborate on this aspect. However, he said, "When I say Indianisation, I mean the need to adapt to the practical realities of our society and localise our justice delivery systems. For example, parties from a rural place fighting a family dispute are usually made to feel out of place in the court. They don't understand the arguments or pleadings which are mostly in English, a language alien to them. These days judgments have become lengthy, which further complicates the position of litigants. For the parties to understand the implications of a judgment, they are forced to spend more money." Stressing the need for increased use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to cut down costs of litigation and delays in justice dispensation, CJI Ramana quoted former US Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, who had said, "The notion that ordinary people want black-robed judges, well-dressed lawyers in fine courtrooms as settings to resolve their disputes is incorrect. People with problems want relief as quickly and inexpensively as possible." Reminding judges and lawyers to make litigants feel comfortable in courts and their processes, the CJI said, "Courts need to be litigant-centric, as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern. It is crucial to make justice delivery more transparent, accessible and effective."

Lee Zeldin revealed Saturday that he was diagnosed last November with early stage chronic myeloid leukemia but said he responded well to treatments and is now in remission.  Zeldin, a Long Island Republican who's running for New York governor, said the diagnosis had no impact on his work or Army Reserve duties. The Iraq War veteran said he suffered no side effects from treatment and that his health is now "phenomenal".  "Over the last nine months, I have achieved complete remission, am expected to live a normal life, and my doctor says I currently have no evidence of this disease in my system," Zeldin said in a statement released through his Congressional office.  Zeldin, 41, is in his fourth term representing the eastern half of Long Island, which includes sprawling suburbs, rural farms and the Hamptons. Zeldin is a supporter of former President Donald Trump and in January, objected to Congress certifying election results showing that Joe Biden had defeated him.  In April, amid sexual harassment allegations that led to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's resignation, Zeldin announced he would run for the office in next year's election.  Zeldin's hematologist, Dr Jeffrey Vacirca, said the congressman "responded extraordinarily well" to targeted therapy and "has achieved complete remission".  "Successfully treated early chronic myeloid leukemia is now a chronic disease, which carries a normal life expectancy," Vacirca said in a statement released through Zeldin's office. "Congressman Zeldin is incredibly healthy, is expected to enjoy a normal life and has no evidence of the disease."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rep-zeldin-whos-running-for-new-york-governor-treated-for-leukemia-now-in-remission/articleshow/86331964.cms||---
---||India||How Sikh factor worked for, against Amarinder||JALANDHAR: It was due to his resignation from Lok Sabha against Operation Blue Star that Captain Amarinder Singh retained his appeal among Sikhs not just in Punjab but in other parts of the country as well as in diaspora even as he joined Congress 14 years later in 1998. It was Bargari sacrilege and subsequent police firing cases which pulled down Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP and worked favourably for Amarinder to become chief minister for second time in 2017. Ironically, it was the same case which precipitated the crisis for him. It was Amarinder's acceptance among Sikhs that helped Congress revive itself in Punjab in 1999. For three consecutive elections, the 1996 and 1998 parliamentary polls and the 1997 assembly election, the party had received a drubbing as it had almost become untouchable for Sikhs. Similarly, the sacrilege and police firing cases became biggest issues before the 2017 polls, along with drugs and illegal mining, and led to the Akali Dal losing considerable support among its core panthic vote base. SAD got relegated to third position in Punjab in the last assembly elections. Analysis showed that 40 of the 77 assembly constituencies Congress won were rural and had a predominantly Sikh population. In fact, after the government formation, these cases never left the limelight. Amarinder set up Justice Ranjit Singh Commission to probe the cases and the latter gave a thorough report. It was discussed in a special session of the Punjab assembly. This again worked for Congress and added to the negative perception of SAD. While close to a year was lost as CBI refused to hand over the Bargari sacrilege probe back to Punjab, even as the state assembly passed a resolution in August 2018 and later issued a notification, there was progress in Behbal Kalan police firing and a little progress in other sacrilege cases. The CM also faced criticism from the community for some of his adverse remarks about Kartarpur corridor, which incidentally pushed Sihdu up in their perception. Finally, it was the Punjab and Haryana HC's order in April 2021 to quash investigation in Koptkapura firing case which precipitated the crisis for him. Not only Sidhu, a few ministers and MLAs also questioned the CM on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-sikh-factor-worked-for-against-captain/articleshow/86332015.cms||IP Singh
---||World||Sparse attendance at rally in support of US Capitol rioters||WASHINGTON: A few hundred protesters turned up Saturday in Washington to rally in support of the pro-Trump rioters who ransacked the US Capitol on January 6, but they were outnumbered by a robust security presence and journalists. Police who were caught on the back foot by the deadly riot on Capitol Hill took no chances this time: they used a security fence around the Capitol complex, police in riot gear and rows of armored trucks to keep the peace. Organisers of the "Justice for J6" rally -- who said they wanted to draw attention to those held over the riot who did not commit violent offenses -- had received a permit for 700 people to gather near the Capitol's reflecting pool, but far fewer showed up. Chants of "Let them go" rose from the demonstrators as speakers took to the podium to decry what they called President Joe Biden administration's detention of "political prisoners". "Their rights are being violated," David Thacker, a 63-year-old attendee from Virginia, told AFP. "Their crimes do not justify the way they are being treated." Members of Congress were not in the building on Saturday as the rally unfolded under the watchful eye of police in riot gear with shields, with many lawmakers still on summer recess and not back in town until next week. Look Ahead America, which organised the event and is planning similar rallies across the country in the coming weeks, had appealed for attendees to show respect to law enforcement officers and refrain from bringing Donald Trump banners. But some carried signs that read "Free Biden's political prisoners" or "Justice for Ashli Babbitt", a woman who was shot dead by police on January 6 as she tried to breach the House of Representatives. Capitol Police said 400 to 450 people were inside the protest area, excluding law enforcement -- but that would include the numerous journalists on site. Daniel, a 35-year-old who only gave his first name, said he had a few friends who were being detained pending trial. "I think they should release them," he said. Pointing at the Capitol, he added: "That's our Capitol, for taxpayers, so we're allowed to go in there when we want." Thousands of Trump's supporters, some associated with ultra-nationalist and white supremacist groups, stormed the US legislature eight months ago in an effort to overturn President Biden's election victory. Around 600 have been charged, including at least 185 accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or employees and more than 70 indicted for destruction or theft of government property. Officials say the mob assaulted 140 officers, with damage to the Capitol complex estimated at $1.5 million. Four people were arrested Saturday near the Capitol, including two on weapons charges. Capitol Police also said they separated groups of protesters and counter-protesters without incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sparse-attendance-at-rally-in-support-of-us-capitol-rioters/articleshow/86332024.cms||---

The reference is believed to be to the I-T searches conducted on premises of Sonu Sood and his associates last week. Apart from accusing the actor of violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act while raising donations from abroad, the I-T department also accused him of collecting Rs 19 crore through his charity foundation but spending only Rs 2 crore out of the fund. The searches were conducted across Mumbai, Kanpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Gurugram and Jaipur and documents seized revealed that the actor had invested in real estate ventures along with an infrastructure company in Lucknow. Searches were also conducted on the infrastructure company where tax evasion of Rs 65 crore has been unearthed, the department claimed. It also claimed that the actor's charity foundation received Rs 2.1 crore from overseas donors on a crowdfunding platform in violation of FCRA regulations. The actor has also been found involved with a Lucknow-based infrastructure firm which has indulged in large scale money laundering where "dubious circular transactions" of Rs 175 crore has been unearthed, it claimed. "The main modus operandi followed by the actor had been to route his unaccounted income in the form of bogus unsecured loans from bogus entities. Probes have revealed use of 20 such entries, the providers of which, on examination, have accepted on oath to have given bogus accommodation entries. They've accepted to have issued cheques in lieu of cash," I-T authorities said. The actor camouflaged his professional receipts as loans and evaded tax, the department said. Bogus loans were then used to acquire properties. The total tax evasion has been estimated to be Rs 20 crore, it said. Cash worth Rs 1.8 crore has been seized and 11 lockers have been placed under prohibitory order. The search operation is still continuing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prominent-actor-evaded-20cr-tax-violated-fcra-i-t/articleshow/86332112.cms||---
---||World||Four SpaceX space tourists set to return to Earth tonight||WASHINGTON: The four private space tourists aboard a SpaceX capsule are due to return to Earth on Saturday night, touching down off the coast of Florida after three days of orbiting the planet. The splash-down is scheduled for 7:06 pm local time (2306 GMT) in the Atlantic Ocean not too far from Cape Canaveral, from where the four Americans blasted off into space on Wednesday. The event will be broadcast live by SpaceX, starting about an hour before the scheduled landing time. The Dragon's heat shield will allow the capsule to withstand the descent, which will be slowed by four huge parachutes once the vessel is low enough in Earth's atmosphere. After that, a SpaceX boat will come to retrieve it, and the passengers will disembark. The Dragon capsule travelled farther than the International Space Station (ISS) at an orbit of about 575 km (357 miles) high. Its altitude was reduced to 365 km Friday evening. This will be the third time that Elon Musk's company has taken humans to space and back, after the return of two NASA missions, one in August 2020 and another in May this year. Both were bringing astronauts back from a stay at the ISS. Unlike NASA astronauts, the members of the Inspiration4 mission did not go to the ISS but remained in orbit around the Earth. Billionaire Jared Isaacman financed the trip, paying SpaceX tens of millions of dollars. Isaacman, who led the mission, offered the other three seats to strangers: Hayley Arceneaux, a 29-year-old nurse; Sian Proctor, a 51-year-old professor; and Chris Sembroski, a 42-year-old US Air Force veteran. During the flight, the crew members' vital signs were monitored to study the effects of the environment of space on complete novices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/four-spacex-space-tourists-set-to-return-to-earth-tonight/articleshow/86332110.cms||---
---||World||Woman missing from Wyoming: Agents searches for boyfriend in Florida||ORLANDO: A joint team of police, FBI agents and other law enforcement agencies searched a vast Florida wildlife reserve on Saturday for 23-year-old Brian Laundrie, a person of interest in the disappearance of his girlfriend, Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito (22), while across the country the investigation agency hunted for clues about the missing woman in a mountainous national park in Wyoming.  More than 50 North Port police officers, FBI agents and members of other law enforcement agencies searched the 24,000-acre (9,712-hectare) Carlton Reserve in the Sarasota, Florida area of the Gulf Coast.  Authorities used drones, scent-sniffing dogs and all-terrain vehicles in the reserve, which has more than 100 miles (160 km) of trails, as well as campgrounds. Investigators took some of his clothing from his parents' home Friday night to provide a scent for the search dogs.  "His family says they believe he entered the area earlier this week," North Port Police tweeted Saturday.  Meanwhile, the FBI in Denver said Saturday that agents were conducting ground surveys at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, with help from the National Park Service and local law enforcement agencies, seeking clues to Petito's disappearance. Her last known contact with family members was from the national park known for its mountainous terrain.  Laundrie and Petito left in July on a cross-country trek in a converted van to visit national parks in the US West. Police said Laundrie was alone when he drove the van back to his parents' home in North Port, Florida, on September 1. Petito's family filed a missing persons report Sept. 11 with police in Suffolk County, New York.  Investigators in Florida were hopeful Laundrie was somewhere in the wildlife reserve near Sarasota. Depending on his skills, he could survive out in the reserve for some time, said police spokesperson Josh Taylor at a news conference.  "Certainly, we prepare for all different possibilities, but you know, our goal is to locate him and bring him back to North Port," Taylor said.  Laundrie's family earlier told officers that they haven't seen him since Tuesday. Police said the conversation Friday evening was the first time they'd spoken with the Laundries in detail about the case, and that the meeting came at the family's request. An attorney for the family called the FBI investigators and said they wanted to talk about Laundrie's disappearance, police said.  Investigators were trying to verify the story told by Laundrie's family members that they believe the reserve is where he went with only a backpack, Taylor said. One mystery is how Laundrie got to the reserve. Family members told investigators he took his car, but the vehicle was found back at his family's home, not at the reserve.  Earlier, the North Port police said in a statement that they understood the community's frustration over the lack of progress in finding the missing woman.  "We are frustrated too," the statement said. "For six days, the North Port Police Department and the FBI have been pleading with the family to contact the investigators regarding Brian's fiance, Gabby Petito. Friday is the first time they have spoken to the investigators in detail."  Laundrie has been identified as a person of interest in the case.  "It is important to note that while Brian is a person of interest in Gabby's disappearance, he is not wanted for a crime," North Port police said in Friday's statement. It added that the investigation is now a "multiple missing person" case.  An attorney for Laundrie, Steven Bertolino, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Friday night.  Attorneys for the Petito family released a statement saying Laundrie was not "missing".  "All of Gabby's family want the world to know that Brian is not missing, he is hiding. Gabby is missing," the statement from the law office of Richard B Stafford said.  Earlier in the week, Petito's family pleaded for the Laundrie family to tell them where their son last saw her. Petito and Laundrie were childhood sweethearts who met while growing up on Long Island, New York. His parents later moved to North Port, about 35 miles (55 km) south of Sarasota.  The couple's trek in the Fort Transit van began in July from Long Island. They intended to reach Oregon by the end of October, according to their social media accounts, but Petito vanished after her last known contact with family in late August from Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, authorities said.  Police video released by the Moab Police Department in Utah showed that an officer pulled the van over on August 12 after it was seen speeding and hitting a curb near the entrance to Arches National Park. The body cam video showed an emotional Petito who sat inside a police cruiser while officers also questioned Laundrie.  Ultimately Moab police decided not file any charges and instead separated the couple for the night, with Laundrie checking into a motel and Petito remaining with the converted sleeper van.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/woman-missing-from-wyoming-police-searches-for-boyfriend-in-florida/articleshow/86332177.cms||---

Khadse was revenue minister in 2016, when he helped his wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhari purchase a government plot after manipulating the record. In the chargesheet, the ED also made sub-registrar Ravindra Mule one of the accused. He had helped Khadse's kin reduce the market value of the land in government record from Rs 23 crore to Rs 3.7 crore. The ED also accused Khadse of "layering Rs 50 lakh, received from various sources, including Rs 15 lakh cash, from his bank account to that of his wife, claiming as untainted and finally utilised Rs 38 lakh to purchase the MIDC land." Khadse's kin spent a total Rs 5.53 crore for the land transaction. Of the total expenses, Mandakini raised Rs 2.38 crore (Rs 2 crore she got from a shell company, Benchmark Buildcon Pvt Ltd, as an unsecured loan and Rs 38 lakh of Rs 50 lakh that she received from Khadse).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-maharashtra-ex-minister-khadse-generated-rs-50-lakh-tainted-cash/articleshow/86332196.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt says cheers to Rs 9,000 crore from liquor bids||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has mopped up some substantial revenue by auctioning liquor retail licences at its newly demarcated 32 excise zones with the top few zones raking in around 50% and more in licence fees compared with the reserve fee. Overall, the Delhi government earned Rs 8,911 crore as licence fees, 27% higher than the Rs 7,039 crore reserve fees. While it earned more on average with some zones doing exceptionally well, some zones didn’t elicit a similar response. Zone 32 (Airport zone)did stupendously well, getting bids of Rs 236 crore for 10 liquor vends, against the annual reserve fee of Rs 105 crore. Liquor zone 17 earned least in bids  According to sources in the Delhi government, a Puducherry-based firm has received the licence for the most sought-after Airport zone. At the other end of the spectrum is Zone 17, which has a total of 27 liquor vends spread across nine municipal zones. For a reserve fee of Rs 226 crore, the zone witnessed bids of only up to around Rs 227 crore. The lowest earning zone comprises areas such as Kishanganj, parts of Rohini, Adarsh Nagar, Ghuman Hera, Bijwasan, Kondli etc. Second on the list of toppers is Zone 28 comprising 27 liquor vends in nine municipal wards, including Dwarka-A, Gautam Puri, Pratap Nagar, Vijay Vihar, Bhajan Pura, Deoli etc. The reserve license fee for this zone was Rs 223 crore and the money it raked in is Rs 357 crore, the highest in absolute terms. Third on the list is Zone 11, which too has 27 liquor vends in nine municipal wards, including Punjabi Bagh, Sainik Enclave, Paharganj, Najafgarh, Bapraula, Ghonda etc. The reserve fee for this zone was Rs 222 crore but it raked in close to Rs 351 crore. Zone 31, which includes areas falling under the jurisdiction of New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment, has 29 liquor vends with a reserve licence fee of Rs 217 crore and the highest bid received for this zone was Rs 315 crore. Among the zones that didn’t perform as well as others are Zone 13 and Zone 27, which earned a premium of Rs 4 crore above a reserve fee of Rs 226 crore and Rs 12 crore above a reserve fee of Rs 223 crore, respectively. The first zone has areas like Naraina, Yamuna Vihar, Malviya Nagar, Sangam Vihar etc. and Zone 27 comprises areas like Karawal Nagar, Sadatpur, Nangloi, Tilak Nagar, Karampura etc. As part of the Delhi government’s new excise policy, liquor retails licences in 32 excise zones were auctioned from August 5 onwards and initial bidding of 20 zones brought in Rs 5,300 crore in revenue. The remaining 12 of the 32 zones were auctioned later and the total licence fee generated was Rs 8,911 crore. The revenue generated includes a one-time payment by the winning bidder as well as an annual licence fee. From next year, the city government hopes to rake in around Rs 3,500 crore from annual licence fees. Apart from the licence fee, the government will also earn from excise duty on liquor sales, import fees and other levies, which come to around Rs 650 crore. Besides, the government expects to earn around Rs 1,000 crore from other sources such as licensing of new brands etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-govt-says-cheers-to-9k-cr-from-liquor-bids/articleshow/86332251.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bhopal||MP: Daily wager turned sons into pilots, now they plan to give wings to Atmanirbhar Bharat||BHOPAL: This family knows how to fly – with its feet on the ground. Daily wager Amritlal, 54, who worked his heart out to put all three of his sons through flight school, is gearing up to take his Class 12 exams while one of his pilot sons perfects a home-built flight simulator. Today, the family is under a heavy debt of education loans and money they borrowed for studies. A small piece of land they owned is mortgaged with a moneylender. But Amritlal is at peace as his sons have taken over the responsibility of repaying the dues. All three are commercial pilots. For decades, Amritlal, of Morena district in Madhya Pradesh, moved around looking for odd jobs, sharing his sons’ dreams of being high-flyers. He recently shifted to a rented house in Bhopal along with his eldest son, captain Ajay Singh, 28, who has been working on a DIY simulator for five years. Unable to fly aeroplanes during the lockdown, Ajay devoted his energy to the simulator cockpit to feed his passion for flying. Flying clubs in the country import such simulators for over Rs 1 crore per unit, but he has built one at a third of the cost, he says. This is his contribution towards the dream of an Atmanirbhar Bharat, says Ajay. “This project was not easy. There was a lot of data to study in order to simulate the exact flight characteristics of an aircraft into the simulator, using the hardware I made. The next challenge was to arrange money to buy raw materials, tools and equipment. I am grateful to my parents and brothers, who supported me financially and mentally as well while I worked 16 hours a day,” Ajay said. He is giving the final touches to his single engine aircraft simulator, which can be “easily converted to simulate a conventional cockpit as well as multi engine airplane cockpit”, he says. Every part of the simulated cockpit -- knobs, instruments like primary flight display, multi-function display, altimeter, airspeed and attitude indicator, switches and control column – have been made by Ajay and his young brothers, captain Vijay Singh, 26, and flight cadet Deepak Kumar, 22. Being a Boeing 737-rated pilot, he plans to manufacture a simulator for this plane, followed by an A320 flight simulator. He hopes to take it to another level and begin manufacturing made-in-India flight simulators and drones to reduce dependence on other countries. “I am happy today that India is on the path of development in drones. Under the leadership of aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, it will reach new heights. I am hopeful that he will support our project intended at the country's security enhancement,” says Ajay, who aims to build military-grade drones. In 2016, Ajay did a few projects related to surveillance UAVs with the Indian Air Force, and is a DGCA-approved drone instructor. He is still looking for government help for approvals and funds for his flight simulator and the drones which he manufactured in his startup. His next DIY project: India’s first drone simulator. The proud father, meanwhile, is preparing to take his own little flight – through higher secondary education. “I passed class 8th in 1983 and 10th in 1996. Now my children want me to clear the 12th exam. They say there is no age for studies. I believe so,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/daily-wager-turned-sons-into-pilots-now-they-plan-to-give-wings-to-atmanirbhar-bharat/articleshow/86332595.cms||P Naveen

The report was submitted to the chief secretaries of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, the secretary of Union water resources ministry and the director of Polavaram Project Authority (PPA) on September 13, 2021. In its observations, the constitutional body observed that the new habitations lacked basic amenities such as drainage systems, roads, drinking water, sanitation, burial ground and electricity. NCST stated that villages such as Yerravaram, Pedabhimunipalli–2 & 3 and P Narayanapuram had no proper roads and electricity. Upon receiving complaints from residents on the “poor construction” of houses, the commission verified leakages from the ceiling and cracked walls. “It is also found that the kitchen rooms lack proper window for ventilation. Some of the houses are found without doors in Moolpeta village. The commission has come to know that all the project displaced families (PDFs) have got 379.25 square feet of land for housing,” the report submitted by NCST member Ananta Nayak reads. The report also points out that the land-to-land issue remains a major cause for concern raised by PDFs. “Those who have received the land have complained that it is far away from their habitations and some others have pointed out that the land provided is revenue land which is not fit for cultivation,” the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ncst-team-highlights-official-inaction-at-rr-colonies/articleshow/86327624.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The girl’s decomposed body was recovered from a water-filled ditch near Karnauti village under the Mahnar police station area on September 16, a day after she had gone missing while going to her coaching institute at Shahpur Patori. The postmortem report, however, didn’t confirm rape, as apprehended by the girl’s family.

The docu, which had its European premiere at Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, narrates the story of a boy who is a metaphor for all those living in no-man’s land. The lives of char-dwellers of Bengal find resonances with that of the protagonist. It was “destiny” that had got director Sourav Sarangi to start filming a young boy – Rubel. He wanted to attend school while his financial circumstances forced him to become a smuggler. Every day, he had to cross a river that forms the border between India and Bangladesh. “I shot in a ‘char’ facing Jalangi in Murshidabad. I started shooting in 2002 and it took me almost 10 years to complete this docu. Getting the confidence of the people living in the char was the most difficult part, let alone the adverse weather and the permission from the Border police,” the director said. Director Haranath Chakraborty was in the CBFC advisory board when this film ran into censorship issues. “I had really liked the documentary. When there was confusion regarding its certification, I had told everyone that we should try and see that this film doesn’t face unnecessary hurdles. Censorship is not about creating problems so that good content doesn’t reach people,” he recalled. A still from 'Char - No Man's Island'A still from 'Char - No Man's Island'In a strange twist of fate, Chakraborty remembered ‘Char’ and spoke about it when he was invited to attend a programme on documentaries at Nazrul Tirtha last week. “I was pleasantly surprised that he remembered the documentary so vividly,” the director said. On knowing that the documentary had never got a theatrical release in Kolkata, Chakraborty suggested that the director to get in touch with Nandan CEO Mitro Chatterjee. “I am glad this docu has released at Nandan 2. In 2014-2015, we had tried to release documentaries at Nandan 2. Unfortunately, the audience turnout was poor. With popularity of interesting work on OTT, we now have a mature audience keen on watching docus in theatres. I had a word with Debasish Sen and he is also thinking of starting documentary releases at Nazrul Tirtha,” Chakraborty added.  At the time when there is so much of talk regarding displacement, this National Award-winning documentary has become even more relevant. “I see so many reports regarding forced migration and how people are losing their personal and professional identity. Rubel’s story is a metaphor for all those who live in the floating borders,” the director added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docu-on-char-dwellers-releases-after-9-yr-wait/articleshow/86328550.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

According to police, the cyclist named Maharshi Suthar, studying in class VI, was knocked down by a truck from behind while he and his friends were passing by Ektanagar pump house around 7.15 am. After the boy fell, the truck driver, who is still on the run, did not stop the vehicle immediately and ran over him. He later abandoned the truck and fled from the spot. Suthar’s friends Mitanshu and Shabd informed his family members about the accident. However, by the time Suthar’s mother Deepti and uncle Sunil reached the accident spot, Suthar had already succumbed to the injuries. Police said that the truck’s wheels had run over the boy’s chest and right leg due to which he died on the spot. Locals told police that apart from rash driving, the narrowed road was also responsible for the accident. Locals blamed the civic body for digging up the road and carrying out further repairs. One lane of the road was dug up last month and as the civic body didn’t repair garbage was being dumped on the stretch. Due to the recent spell of rain the stretch is no longer motorable. “It is possible that the truck was being driven at high speed and the driver didn’t notice the boy. We will know the exact details once we have him in our custody,” said a police official. He added that the truck is registered in Uttar Pradesh and was carrying building materials. A case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence was registered against the unidentified truck driver at Bapod police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/11-year-old-knocked-dead-by-truck/articleshow/86327633.cms||---
---||Goa||Odisha have put systems in place to ensure last season’s shortcomings are not repeated: Abhik Chatterjee||Panaji: Odisha FC are making news for all the right reasons. After finishing at the bottom of the Indian Super League (ISL) ladder last season with just two wins from 20 matches, Odisha have now adopted a different route to success. They got Spain’s World Cup winner David Villa on board to head the global football operations, stitched a tie-up with Premier League side Watford FC, signed some impressive foreign players and convinced high-profile Brazilian striker Jonathas de Jesus to give their team a try. “Last season was really difficult,” said Abhik Chatterjee, head of football operations at the club. “There was a change in coach, change in philosophy, young players and a short time to prepare. For the young players, it was a lesson. Every youngster goes through a season like that in his career. You have to learn.” Not just the youngsters, the club has learnt its lessons too. With Raj Athwal joining the club as president, there were new ideas, not surprising from a man who has more than 20 years’ experience working across four divisions in England. “With Raj joining, we sat down and decided that we wanted a paradigm shift in the way the club is perceived. Apart from the football, a club must also be a brand in itself. If you want brands investing in the club, if you want people to be associated with you, there has to be restructuring, so that there is an attractiveness that exists,” said Chatterjee. The new approach has meant Odisha were the first team to arrive in Goa for pre-season. Most of their players are already here, and there is little or no complaint about either the training ground or hotel, a refreshing start to life inside a bio-secure bubble. “This year things are vastly different. We started planning much ahead and did a recce in Goa to confirm the training ground and hotel, so crucial when you are in a bubble for five or six months. “Everyone’s happy so far. We have tried to put systems in place to make sure the shortcomings are not repeated. In football, you can never predict. You can only plan for it and correct things that are in your hand,” said Chatterjee. Even beyond the field, Odisha are taking ambitious steps. Backed by the state government of Odisha, the club is expected to get their academies kickstarted from next month in Bhubaneswar. “We have already done one leg of scouting,” said Chatterjee. “Our grassroots team is going into the districts and trying to look at a lot of talent that exists deep within the state, within the tribal belts.” Unlike other ISL clubs, Odisha can count heavily on support from the government. The state already has a network of sports hostels providing coaching to hundreds of students, while a High Performance Centre at Kalinga Stadium has been the cynosure of all eyes. All this is now available to Odisha. “We have seen how the government of Odisha have done wonders for the men’s and women’s hockey teams by giving them all support and infrastructure. They are helping us to do something similar with our youth academies,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/odisha-have-put-systems-in-place-to-ensure-last-seasons-shortcomings-are-not-repeated-abhik-chatterjee/articleshow/86353619.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: New testing water labs to curb disease spread||AMARAVATI: The state government is setting up four water analysis labs of international standards in East and West Godavari districts. The decision was taken following the spread of the mystery disease in Eluru last year. An US-based renowned firm in water analysis—Perkin Elmer—has been roped in to set up the labs. Initially, one lab each will be upgraded in Eluru, Narsarpuram (West Godavari), Rajahmundry and Kakinada (East Godavari). The government will spend Rs 7 crore on each lab where the water quality will be tested to identify the presence of about 70 metals and 24 chemical pesticide residues. The state government is contemplating to expand the project across the state after studying the efficacy of the pilot project in the two Godavari districts. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the rural water supply and municipal administration departments to closely monitor the quality of the drinking water being supplied. He said there should not be any compromise in quality of water supplied to the public through protected drinking water schemes. Though there are 112 labs in the state, they can analyse the presence of just 14 metals. Besides, these labs are not equipped to ascertain the presence of pesticide residues or other dangerous metals. Scientists had found several varieties of harmful metals in the drinking water supplied by the civic body in Eluru. These particles are reported to have escaped the screening at local laboratories due to the non-availability of advanced testing kits. The government suspects the high number of aqua farms in West Godavari as a possible reason for drinking water contamination, as these farms release chemical effluents directly into drinking water canals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/new-testing-water-labs-to-curb-disease-spread/articleshow/86327505.cms||Samdani MN

Ramesh Yadav (30) and his kin Janardan Yadav (55) were shot at by unidentified miscreants and rushed to Ara Sadar hospital where Dr S K Prasad declared them brought dead. The 20-year-old Rahul Kumar, who also received gunshot injury, was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the town. Sadar SDPO Himanshu said prima facie some dispute between the two sides seems to be the reason behind the murders. Rambabu Yadav, father of Ramesh, told reporters that the miscreants, who also belong to the same locality, were demanding extortion money and shot his son for refusing to pay them. “Janardan tried to intervene and was also shot by the criminals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-shot-dead-one-hurt-in-ara/articleshow/86326894.cms||---

This will go along with the proposed pedestrian zone which Hidco is planning on the stretch under the flyover connecting Axis Mall to Central Mall. Officials said this will help in proper utilization of space and prevent encroachment. “The plan is to create a community space below the flyover. The objective is not only to utilize the space and prevent encroachment, but also help in employment generation, especially for food delivery personnel, and enhance the scope for revenue earning for the authorities,” said a Hidco official. Hidco has started inviting applications from agencies and plans to hold e- auctions early next month to rent out the space on a monthly licence fee basis. Officials said the plan is to develop the road into a picturesque pedestrian zone, which will have a street food plaza, recreation zones, seating arrangements, public art, tree plantation and other decorative structures that will bring a fresh, clean and green look to it. A similar pedestrian plaza with a new look and redeveloped road has been planned for a stretch in Sector V. Hidco has been exploring options for proper utilization of space in pockets, like under the flyover and inside the subways. Some kiosks have already been set up inside the pedestrian subways in New Town that can be used for stalls selling fruits, vegetables, bakery items, newspapers, magazines or small gifts. The Rabindra Tirtha subway, which was recently inaugurated, has a small book-and-magazine corner, a few tea and snacks stalls and a zero-waste shop inside the corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hidco-to-rent-out-space-for-food-kiosks-under-flyover/articleshow/86328497.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The students and their parents were in for a surprise to see the whopping amount when they went to check the bank balance at the CSP of the private bank at Azamnagar. However, the dashboard of the students’ accounts attached to Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank showed petty balances of Rs 128 and Rs 100, respectively. A probe has already been started into the matter. M K Madhukar, lead bank manager, Katihar, said, “We are in the process of sending a letter to the senior officials of the private bank, asking them why the CBS software was showing such a large amount of money in the students’ accounts. The figure reflected in the CBS software didn’t match with our banking software,” he said. A former financial literacy and credit councillor of a leading PSU bank said on the condition of anonymity that the dashboard of the CSP was showing more than Rs 905 crore in the bank account of Gurucharan Biswas and over Rs 62 crore in Ashit Kumar’s account. Both are students of Class VI. But the same was not reflecting in their Aadhaar numbers when their original accounts with the Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank were checked." He added, “A large sum of several hundred crores parked in the bank accounts of the two students, though for a brief period, cannot be denied. The possibility of some foul play cannot be ruled out and the matter needs a thorough investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-967cr-windfall-pvt-bank-under-lens-for-software-error/articleshow/86327016.cms||---

As per government data, 6,800 children visited different government health facilities in the state with complaints of fever and other flu-related symptoms in first 14 days of this month and 15 of them have died. Many children have also been infected with dengue. Health experts have suggested that all precautions for Covid-19 should be taken amid the surge in viral fever and dengue cases. Dr Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, dean of school of health and medicine at Aryabhatta Knowledge University, said, “Viruses can be avoided through practice of basic measures like proper handwash, social distancing and early treatment of sneeze, cough and fever. Everyone needs to add one lemon in their diet plan for vitamin C and sit in the sunlight for vitamin D.” “People should continue wearing mask as it can protect them from the flu. Those facing symptoms of flu should be isolated. To prevent dengue, people should wear full-sleeve clothes and use mosquito repellents,” city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said. AIIMS-Patna Covid Incharge Dr Sanjeev Kumar said viral fever cases among children were on the rise in the state. “If the fever crosses more than three days, people should go for Covid test without taking any risk because the symptoms of viral fever and Covid are same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-respite-from-viral-fever-cases-among-kids/articleshow/86327111.cms||---

With only 43 MLAs in its kitty, the JD(U) has been reduced as number-3 party in Bihar. RJD has 75 and the BJP 74 MLAs. The JD(U) is now struggling hard to regain its status of 2010 when it had won 115 assembly seats and got the status of the number-1 political party in the state. Addressing the opening day session of the two-day division-wise review meeting of the JD(U), Lalan said the party’s office-bearers and workers should maintain mutual compatibility with each other and work in the interest of the organization. He said the district heads of different cells would work under the leadership of the respective JD(U) district president to strengthen the organisation. Party’s MLAs and defeated candidates from 17 districts participated on the first day of the meeting. “JD(U)’s candidates from different assembly constituencies falling under Tirhut, Darbhanga, Saran and Patna divisions expressed their views at the review meeting which was presided over by the party’s state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha. Our national president Lalan Singh attended the meeting as chief guest,” JD(U)’s state vice-president Navin Kumar Arya told TOI over the phone on Saturday. Kushwaha told the party leaders not to be complacent thinking that since the JD(U) has formed the government in Bihar, their work is over. He asked the party leaders and workers to begin preparations for the 2024 general elections and 2025 Bihar polls. JD(U)’s state general secretary Vijendra Kumar Singh Yadav who contested the 2020 assembly polls on the party’s symbol from Sandesh assembly seat, complained that leaders from a particular caste have been nominated on many key posts of the party in Bhojpur district. He urged the party leadership to nominate the members from Mahadalit, Dalit and extremely backward caste communities on some of the key posts of the organisation. Yadav later told TOI that appointments in Bhojpur district were made under pressure from a particular state-level leader. JD(U)’s state general secretary Mrityunjay Kumar Singh and state secretaries Manish Kumar and Basudeo Kushwaha also attended the review meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-jdu-bihars-no-1-party-lalan/articleshow/86327369.cms||Madan Kumar

Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary told this newspaper that on getting information about the officer’s audio went viral on social media, the department got the entire matter examined by the district education officer (DEO), who testified the reported misconduct of Yadav. In the audio clip, which TOI does not authenticate, Yadav is allegedly heard asking an aspirant over the phone to pay Rs8 lakh for recruitment as a schoolteacher as he has to manage things at various levels. The minister said taking serious note of this matter, the department initiated disciplinary action against him and ordered a thorough probe in the matter. Choudhary has appealed to the people to bring any matter of irregularities in teachers’ appointment to the department’s notice immediately so that necessary action may be initiated against the guilty. Meanwhile, the education department has also decided to take stern action against the candidates who are allegedly being recruited as primary teachers on production of forged documents. Recently, FIRs had been lodged against more than 600 recently recruited teachers whose certificates uploaded to the department’s portal were found to be fake. FIRs would also be lodged against the recruiting units concerned if they were found guilty, the minister said. The process of recruitment of 94,000 primary teachers by different units in all the 38 districts of the state is on and the certificates of nearly 50,000 selected teachers have been uploaded to the department’s portal. All the documents and certificates of matriculation, Intermediate, teachers’ training, teachers’ eligibility test and experience uploaded to the portal are being verified from the authorities concerned. More than 60% of the uploaded certificates have already been verified and the remaining ones are in the process of verification, said officials. The minister said that the process of verification of certificates submitted by candidates is going simultaneously with the recruitment of teachers. He asserted that stern legal action would be taken against the candidates or recruiting units whoever is found guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/murliganj-beo-suspended-for-demanding-rs-8-lakh-bribe/articleshow/86326863.cms||B K Mishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A kitchen that ensures no Bohra goes to bed hungry||It is around nine in the morning. Sixty-year-old Yunus H Kapadia drives his wife Munira in his autorickshaw to Faiz al-Mawaid al-Burhaniyah (FMB), community kitchen of the Dawoodi Bohras, at the massive Bohra Jamatkhana in Kandivali West. Dressed in what is called libas al-anwar, Yunus in white overcoat with kurta-pajama under it and skull cap and Munira in a colourful rida, the couple loads two bags containing tiffin boxes and leaves. They spend the next few hours, dropping off hot, hygienically prepared meals to the doorsteps of dozens of Bohra families in high rises and small houses both in Kandivali West and East. “We feel blessed that we began delivering food from the day the service started. I will continue doing it till my last breath,” resolves Yunus, his mask quivering over his white bearded face. A brainchild of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the 52nd spiritual head of the over one million-strong Dawoodi Bohras globally, FMB completed 10 years this August. Syedna Burhanuddin’s son and successor Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin has been instrumental in implementing his father’s vision to ensure that “no Bohra goes to bed hungry.” “Syedna Burhanuddin wanted every Bohra household to get at least one nutritious meal a day. We feel privileged and blessed that we have been able to achieve it,” says Mustafa Yusuf Ali, secretary of the Kandivali Bohra Jamat. So, today FMB programme provides meals to over 100,000 Bohra houses in 900 villages, towns and cities in 40 countries spread over five continents. One of the reasons Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin initiated the FMB, says Kandivali kitchen’s secretary Huzaifa Javadwala, was that he wanted the community’s women to get free from cooking chores and utilize the time to pursue careers, bring up children or help husbands in their business. Fatema Ebrahim Lilamwala says she could not have begun her online trade in utility items had she not received the nutritious meal six days a week (no food service on Sunday). “If I’m able to do business besides managing two kids and old in-laws, it’s because I’m free from worries of cooking,” says Lilamwala. Guided by a team of experts stationed at the community’s headquarters, Badri Mahal in Fort, the programme is executed by community members volunteering at different kitchens. From preparing a monthly menu under a trained dietician’s guidance to peeling beans, cutting capsicums, rolling chapatis and preparing curries, the teams work with a sense of bonding. After all the tiffin boxes for 490 Bohra families registered with the Kandivali Jamat have been filled and sent, members of the Dana (grain) Committee scrub cooking pots and pick up every fallen piece of food. “Whatever food we are left with, goes to the poor, the cats on the campus and the birds in the trees,” says Adnan Dhahodwala, an IT engineer who volunteers with the Dana Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/a-kitchen-that-ensures-no-bohra-goes-to-bed-hungry/articleshow/86330495.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

Curiously, Manjhi has tagged the two tweets with the name of Vaibhav Mishra, who is the petitioner in the Delhi high court demanding a fresh CBI probe and the court on August 21 asked the probe agency to decide in six weeks if the murder of Mishra needs a second investigation by it. The CBI has to take the call on it by or before October 5. Vaibhav had moved the petition on November 5 last year. According to Vaibhav, the CBI, in its first investigation, had treated the incident as a simple case of “murder,” whereas he was murdered under a “political conspiracy”. Two inquiry commissions – one headed by Supreme Court judge K K Mathew and another by Justice V M Tarkunde (constituted in 1977) – have probed the matter. Based on their inquiries, the CBI investigated the case and zeroed in on four accused — Ranjan Dwivedi, Santoshanand Avdhoot, Sudeshnand Avdhoot and Goapl ji, who were connected with Anand Marg. In 2013, they were sentenced to life imprisonment. Vaibhav has taken cue from Justice Tarkunde’s report, which called the incident a result of political conspiracy. Manjhi’s connection with former CM late Jagannath Mishra is well-known in political circles. Incidentally, in recent decades, the big political family of L N Mishra and Jagannath Mishra, who were in the Congress, has seen mutations. Late Jagannath’s son Nitish Mishra, who was earlier a JD(U) minister, is a BJP MLA. Rishi Mishra, the son of Vijay Kumar Mishra and grandson of L N Mishra, was elected to the state assembly on the JD(U) ticket as part of the grand alliance in 2015, but when CM Nitish Kumar, in 2017, joined hands with the BJP again, Rishi joined the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-seeks-fresh-cbi-probe-into-l-n-mishra-murder-case/articleshow/86327411.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Patna||Experts discuss issues blocking agri growth||PATNA: Agriculture has been facing unbridled market forces, Professor Praveen Kumar Jha of JNU said while delivering the A N Sinha memorial lecture on ‘India’s Farmers against Neo-liberalism: Issues that Matter’ here on Saturday. Jha examined the three recent agricultural bills and outlined the dynamics of farmers’ movement across the states. Tracing the transition from a dirigiste to a neo-liberal macroeconomic policy regime, which almost came with a bang in July 1991, Jha pointed out that some elements of such a shift were already evident during the late 1980s. Further, with the country formally joining the WTO and becoming a signatory to the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) in the mid-1990s, the agriculture sector came under the sway of neo-liberalism. On the whole, the balance sheet for this sector has been utterly disastrous during the last three decades, he said. He further observed that factors like substantial compression of rural development expenditures, increasing input prices, vulnerability to world market price fluctuations due to greater openness, inadequate crop insurance and substantial weakening of the provisioning for credit, along with the governments’ apathy to the demand for remunerative prices for farm produce are among the obvious causal correlates of the contemporary agrarian crisis in the country. Bihar’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan observed that some loopholes in the inherent structure have been preventing desired agricultural growth in the country. He said the system can be improved with the cooperation of all concerned. Education department’s additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar pleaded for collective efforts by all the parliamentarians and legislators for giving a facelift to the agriculture sector and ensuring state’s all-round progress. The A large number of academics, social scientists, researchers and bureaucrats attended the lecture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-discuss-issues-blocking-agri-growth/articleshow/86327445.cms||B K Mishra
---||Ahmedabad||1/3rd of eligible population fully jabbed in Gujarat, highest in India||AHMEDABAD: On Friday, Gujarat witnessed vaccination of a record 23.6 lakh persons – 9 lakh got the first dose while 14.6 lakh took the second shot of Covid-19 vaccine. With this, Gujarat now has 33% or one-third of its eligible population (above 18 years) fully vaccinated. As of Saturday morning, 1.64 crore out of 4.93 crore eligible population is fully vaccinated. Moreover, 3.96 crore have taken at least one shot, covering 80.5% of the state’s eligible population. Analysis of the total population coverage reveals that Gujarat tops in both first and second dose coverage in India. While 27% of the state’s total population is fully vaccinated, 59% is covered with at least one dose. Among the major states in terms of total vaccination, Karnataka comes second with 56% and 21% coverage for first and second doses, Madhya Pradesh third with 55% and 15% coverage, respectively. Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, said that the state’s one-third population is fully vaccinated, which would be a major factor to thwart the third wave of the pandemic. “We are happy with the response on September 17 as about 68% of the vaccination took place in rural areas. Cities like Surat also recorded high vaccination,” he said. While some of the districts were behind the state average, as of Saturday morning, the majority had 70% or above coverage for the first dose. Among cities, Jamnagar has 81% of its eligible population getting both the shots, followed by Gandhinagar (75%). Ahmedabad and Surat recorded coverage of 41% of the eligible population for full vaccination. Experts stressed the need for vaccination as the state for the past three days had recorded a rise in daily Covid cases. On Friday itself, the state had 25 new cases, the highest in 33 days. Ahmedabad had doubled the cases at 11 – the highest in two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1/3rd-of-eligible-population-fully-jabbed-in-guj-highest-in-india/articleshow/86330059.cms||Parth Shastri

The dog park will come up in an area of 1.1 acre in the 95th ward of the city. The civic body has approached a Chennai-based landscape architect for designing the theme parks, which include a rainbow park, butterfly park, and meditation park. The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) council, which met on Saturday, approved all the agenda items, including the theme park proposals. As the ruling YSRC enjoys a clear majority in the council, the proposals were passed despite strong objection from the opposition parties. In the morning, the CPM’s Vizag unit staged a novel protest with dogs in front of the GVMC office against the proposed theme parks. CPM corporator Ganga Rao alleged that the corporation has ignored all public issues. “All the roads in the city are in a bad shape and public are complaining on a variety of civic issues. At this juncture, how can the GVMC allocate Rs 12.7 crore for the development of these theme parks? No development works have been taken up in any ward in the last four months. Unfortunately, the GVMC is being operated as per the whims and fancies of some top leaders of the ruling party,” he alleged. The city’s roads are dotted with potholes and motorists are struggling to balance their vehicles during rains, but the GVMC has utterly failed to allocate funds to repair the damaged roads, Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/dog-friendly-theme-park-planned-in-vizag/articleshow/86327540.cms||---

He, however, showed exemplary courage and drove his two-wheeler for about 2.5km to reach PMCH where he was operated upon. The assailants pumped five bullets into his body, causing grievous injuries. Vikram’s family resides at Goraiya Sthan in Lohanipur locality. He is a native of Banka district. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Vikram named a noted physiotherapist, Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh, and his wife Khushboo Singh, who have been detained for interrogation. Dr Rajiv runs his private clinic at Rai Ji Ki Gali near Boring Road crossing. Preliminary investigation suggested that Vikram and Khushboo used to talk even at odd hours, an investigation officer said. The call details record (CRD) revealed that Vikram and Khushboo had made over 1100 calls on each other’s mobile phones since January this year. Some calls lasted for over 30-40 minutes. “In April this year, Rajiv talked to Vikram over his phone for the fist time,” the officer said. Vikram told the police that Dr Rajiv had earlier threatened him with dire consequences. “He was not happy with me for having good relations with his wife,” the officer quoted Vikram as saying. The police didn’t rule out the involvement of ‘supari’ (contract) killers in the incident. The CCTV footage obtained from the spot revealed that the assailants escaped on foot after committing the crime. “It seems the assailants were five in number and had parked their vehicles at a distance from the crime scene,” a police officer said. The police recorded the statement of a woman eyewitness. She told the police that the criminals fired at the victim from both sides when he reached the spot. Meanwhile, Dr Rajiv has been removed from the post of JD(U)’s medical cell state vice-president soon after his name cropped up in the murderous attack on the gym trainer, JD(U) medical cell state chief Dr Sunil Kumar Singh, in a statement, said. Vikram is fond of cine stars and cricketers. He has shared his pictures with Jackie Shroff and Aditya Pancholi on his social media pages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gym-trainer-shot-at-physio-detained/articleshow/86327486.cms||Ramashankar

The move is significant as the election symbol allotted to his party candidates will decide his status in the LJP, whose five other MPs elected his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras as the party national president. Paras has also been made a minister in the PM Narendra Modi’s Cabinet by virtue of that. Chirag has moved the Election Commission of India, which is yet to decide the LJP issue. Chirag claims himself to be the LJP chief. The two seats fell vacant following the death of Mewalal Choudhary (Tarapur) and Shashibhushan Hazari (Kusheshwar Sthan), who had been elected last year on the JD(U) ticket. The Election Commission is yet to officially announce the bypolls schedule. Chirag said the process of candidate selection has already started. He reiterated that the LJP faction led by him would continue to raise the issues plaguing the people in the state. The development comes barely a week after the first ‘barsi’ (death anniversary according to the Hindu calendar) of his father and former union minister Ram Vilas Paswan on September 12. “The decision of Chirag to field his party candidates will make the fight tough for the JD(U), which could have won only 43 seats because LJP had damaged the CM Nitish Kumar’s party in many constituencies,” a political observer said. He said the voters of the Paswan community are in sizeable numbers in both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Sthan constituencies. “If they favour Chirag’s candidates, the fight for JD(U) may turn tougher compared to the previous election,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-to-field-candidates-in-bypolls-for-2-assembly-seats/articleshow/86327056.cms||Ramashankar

We did some business in domestic travel between October and January and are hoping for the same this year. But the RT-PCR requirement for children is a big concern as many parents are not comfortable subjecting them to it. We are requesting the government to waive the test requirement for children below 12 who do not have any Covid symptom,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. His counterpart in Travel Agents Association of India, Manav Soni, is also concerned about the impact of the mandatory RT-PCR requirement on children in the holiday season. “Like in other spheres of life where we have learnt to balance life with livelihood, the government should review the air travel policy,” he said. At present, flyers coming to airports in Bengal from anywhere in India are required to either produce proof of full vaccination or a negative RT-PCR report done within 72 hours. But passengers travelling from Pune, Mumbai and Chennai are required to undergo RT-PCR test even if fully vaccinated. Since no children are vaccinated in India yet, all travellers over 2 are required to undergo RT-PCR test to fly to Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/travel-sector-seeks-kids-cov-test-waiver/articleshow/86328531.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A temporary camp office of the SIT has been set up at a circuit house. Team members of the SIT, including IG (Kanpur) Mohit Agarwal, SP (Mainpuri) AK Rai, ASP (STF) Agra unit Rajesh Yadav and CO (Kanpur Dehat) Tanu Upadhyaya, visited the crime scene where the girl was found hanging two years ago on September 16, 2019. The first SIT was formed by the state government on December 1, 2019. It had recorded statements of at least 300 people and took blood samples of over 100 along with polygraph tests of 12 suspects. However, it failed to achieve a breakthrough, particularly on the circumstances which led to the crime.

Under the new amendment, the offence has been made cognizable and non-bailable and will invite a sentence ranging from three years to life term along with a penalty of Rs 50,000. Sections 272 to 276 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with offences relating to adulteration of food, drink, drug or medical preparations. The offences are punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to Rs 1000, or with both. The offences are non-cognizable and except offences related to adulterating any drug or medical preparation under Section 274, the offences under sections 272, 273, 275 and 276 are bailable. UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal said the bill had been brought in as the punishment for adulteration of food and medicine under IPC is outdated. He said the Supreme court had also suggested to get the punishment for the offence at par with the central Food Safety Act and Central Drugs and Cosmetic Act. He said Rajasthan is the fourth state to make the amendment.

This was announced by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while unveiling the first prototype Metro train for Kanpur and Agra virtually from Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur on Saturday. The development comes after the successful run of Metro in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in the state. Yogi said that the detailed project reports (DPRs) for five other major cities — Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Merrut and Jhansi – are in their last leg. “Metro is the need of the hour and it will prove to be a milestone in the development of Agra and Kanpur. It is a matter of time when five more cities will also have this safe, convenient and affordable mode of public transportation,” he said while congratulating the officials of the UP Metro Corporation and M/s Alstom Transport India Limited. He said that with the help of Metro rail service, the PM’s vision of a self-reliant India was also being realized. Meanwhile, the first set of Kanpur Metro train departed from Savli manufacturing factory in Gujarat on Saturday. It will reach UP in 10 days via road. The departure was also flagged off virtually by CM Yogi Adityanath via video conferencing. Total eight trains each with three coaches will be provided for the 9-km long priority corridor of Kanpur Metro between IIT and Motijheel with nine stations. The trial run on the priority corridor is expected to start from mid-October. “I congratulate the manufacturing team that despite Covid pandemic, which posed challenges in getting the material from different parts of the country and across the globe, trains are being delivered within a given timeframe,” the CM said. According to UP Metro Rail Corporation, the two Metro trains will have the feature of ‘regenerative braking’, with the help of which up to 45% of the energy through the brakes applied in the trains will be regenerated and used again in the system. These trains will also have a state-of-the-art propulsion system to reduce air pollution. These trains will have a carbon-di-oxide sensor-based air conditioning system, which will run according to the number of passengers present in the train and will save energy. “We are proud to deliver the first metro trains, for Kanpur Metro in record time. After successfully delivering Rolling Stock andSignalling solution for the state’s capital Lucknow, we are happy to strengthen this partnership with UPMRC and redefine the mobility needs of Kanpur and Agra,” said Alain Spohr, managing director, Alstom India. Total 39 trains for Kanpur and 28 for Agra, each consisting of three coaches are being manufactured by M/s Alstom in India in view of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ missions, projected by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Besides a floor volunteer to check on residents for any symptoms or help, the society had a register of blood plasma donors and pharmacies for the benefit of the residents and the staffers, alike,” society’s secretary Vijay Maru said. The society chairman, Sujata Nalli, ensured that the society premises were sanitized regularly. “We had vendors setting up stalls for groceries, vegetables and clothes. We even had publishers setting up bookstalls on the premises for the convenience of the residents. The society had also put up an automatic vending machine for snacks and beverages, for which a cellphone application was used to keep the entire transaction touch-free,” Maru said. The residents of Mont Vert Pristine on Aundh RoadHe said the prices of vegetables were kept such that they could be provided free of cost to staff members. “During the pandemic, the residents also kept all celebrations muted and donated grocery kits to housekeeping and security staffers,” Maru said. When things turned too difficult, society’s estate manager Narendra Mulay would wear the PPE kit and reach out to the residents to listen to their problems. A security guard at Yash Sankul in Pimple Saudagar scans temperature of people seeking entry into the societyNot too far away, the residents of Kalpataru Estate Phase 1 in Pimple Gurav were engaged in similar initiatives. “We didn’t inconvenience the residents by imposing more rules. We just sought everybody’s cooperation when it came to masking and social distancing. We maintained a register for people going out or coming in so that contact tracing was possible in case anyone tested positive. We had formed a task force to look into the needs of the residents, especially the senior citizens living alone,” said Krishna Chandra, a resident. Manoj Gurav, the society chairman, said they also helped out a family of three when each family member was admitted in different hospitals. “We helped out with the medical bills and also coordinated among the three members of the family. The cost of the medical check-ups of the domestic workers was borne by the residents when they started coming to work,” Gurav said. In contrast, Yash Sankul in Pimple Saudagar imposed lockdown rules strictly during the first wave. The society chairman, Nitin Dongre, said, “We had kept the interaction with outsiders to the minimum. We have huge terrace area in each building. We had given slots to residents on each floor during the day to use the terrace for fresh air and exercise. We had imposed fines on people not following social distancing or mask rules. We had kept a compulsory 15-day quarantine for people coming from abroad and ensured that such families got essentials at the doorstep.” The society too had vendors setting up stalls for various necessities. Jagdish Gujar, a resident and member of the committee, said high-speed broadband vendors were called in considering most members would work from home. “People were discouraged from using cash and online payment was encouraged. Some people were also involved in distributing prepared meals in the nearby slum pockets,” Gujar said, adding that the society saw only 8-9 cases of Covid-19, with most catching the virus while travelling abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-keep-the-community-spirit-alive-beat-covid-with-right-balance-of-empathy-objectivity/articleshow/86330514.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||1.85 lakh given shots in Mumbai and 13.38 lakh in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The city witnessed one of its highest turnouts for Covid-19 vaccination on Saturday, with 1.85 lakh taking the jab. Across the state, 13.38 lakh took the shot on Saturday; the highest turnout (15.17 lakh) in the state was registered on September 8. In Mumbai, public centres offering free shots saw 1.23 lakh people while the private centres vaccinated 54,977 people. “On Friday, the drive was only open for women. This perhaps resulted in a higher turnout on Saturday when all were allowed,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. In Mumbai, 18.77 lakh have been vaccinated in September so far. While no public vaccination will be available on Sunday, officials said that the city’s September tally should overtake the August tally of 21.34 lakh within a few days. The city has 93.5 lakh population that is eligible for Covid vaccination. So far, 77.32 lakh (82.7%) people have taken the first vaccine shot, while 34.39 lakh (36.78%) are fully vaccinated with two shots. Officials said that the heavy turnout days showcase the capability of the public health system in Mumbai and Maharashtra. “The state can vaccinate over 10 to 15 lakh every day if we get adequate vaccine doses,” said a senior health official. The official added that adequate stocks of the vaccine are available right now to continue aggressive vaccination drives. A senior civic doctor said that the BMC strategy of letting people walk in for vaccines instead of mandatory registration had helped boost the turnout. “We have a few centres where registration is mandatory, but in the majority of them people just need to walk in to get vaccinated,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-85l-given-shots-in-city-and-13-38l-in-state/articleshow/86330539.cms||---
---||Pune||48 of 78 adverse events following immunization studied linked to vaccination, mostly anxiety: Report||PUNE: The Union health ministry’s latest analysis of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) for Covid-19 showed that 48 out of 78 cases had a “consistent causal association to vaccination”. Of these 48, as many as 20 reactions were due to anxiety during vaccination. The national-level causality assessment report stated that as many as 22 cases, including seven deaths, were coincidental. It meant they were not linked to vaccination. Seven adverse events, including two deaths, were in the indeterminate category and one event was in the unclassifiable category. The causality assessment for the 78 cases — six related to Covaxin administration and the rest Covishield — was completed on August 3 after thorough review, deliberation and approval by the national AEFI committee. The latest report stated that of the 48 cases of “consistent causal association to vaccination”, a total of 28 were vaccine product-related reactions such as anaphylaxis, allergic reactions and dizziness. The rest 20 were of immunization anxiety-related reactions. The “consistent causal association” to vaccination is a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccine and the adverse event that follows. Vaccine product-related reaction refers to an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) caused by a vaccine because of one or more of the inherent properties of its product, such as the adjuvant, preservative or stabilizer. Immunization anxiety-related reaction refers to an AEFI arising from anxiety about the immunization. Dr Narendra Arora, advisor, National AEFI Committee, said a chunk of reactions were driven by only panic or fear of vaccination, such as nausea, increase in heart rate and increased sweating, among others. “There has been a higher incidence of anxiety among women than men, after which they had to be admitted to healthcare facilities to alleviate their condition,” he said. Dr Arora said coincidental events were the AEFIs caused by something other than the vaccine product, immunization error or vaccination anxiety. “So far, among all the AEFIs assessed after the vaccination drive against Covid began, all the deaths except one were coincidental. Only one death was due to anaphylaxis,” he said. Among the seven deaths not linked to vaccination, one was a sudden cardiac death, one was related to atypical pneumonia with pulmonary embolism and another was due to chronic diarrhoea and severe malnutrition. According to the report, seven AEFI cases, including two sudden cardiac deaths, were in the indeterminate category. “Indeterminate category includes reactions which have occurred soon after vaccination but there is no definitive evidence in current literature or clinical trial data that these events could have been caused due to the vaccine. Such cases are later re-assessed after all the post-death documentation is available,” Dr Arora said. The report stated that there was another sudden unexplained death of a 70-year-old man under the unclassifiable category. Unclassifiable events are those which were investigated but there was not enough evidence for assigning a diagnosis due to missing crucial information, according to an official of the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The official said in unclassifiable cases, there might be unavailability of complete documents. “The incidence of AEFI events is very small in comparison to the total doses administered in India so far. Up till recently, only 0.02% AEFIs have been reported among the total vaccinations. This is even less than adverse reactions reported in clinical trials. Covishield is a vaccine widely being used across the world and is considered safe,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/48-of-78-aefis-studied-linked-to-vax-mostly-anxiety-report/articleshow/86330553.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Chandigarh||UT asks Bengaluru institute to revise draft policy on village devp, lal dora||Rajinder.Nagarkoti1@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: The UT administration has asked the Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS), Bengaluru, to submit a revised draft policy on village development, regularisation of illegal structures and extension of lal dora. The decision was taken after a recent meeting with a representative of the Bengaluru-based consultant, which was chaired by UT adviser Dharam Pal. The institute, which was appointed to study and offer solutions to the problem, made a presentation and submitted a draft policy. UT adviser Dharam Pal said they had suggested some changes and accordingly, the institute was asked to submit a revised draft policy. Besides, village-wise plan prepared by departments would be merged with the overall development plan of the city. As it was the first draft, views and suggestions of different department heads were taken in the meeting. Provisions of RERA and other relevant acts would also be part of the revised draft policy, he added. The step was initiated after former UT administrator V P Singh Badnore directed senior officials to work on regularisation of such construction in January. The lal dora (red line) separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land. After Badnore’s instructions, some villagers had even started carrying out fresh constructions outside lal dora, hoping it would be regularised. However, teams of UT estate office and land acquisition department had demolished fresh constructions. Political parties and village residents have been consistently asking for the extension of lal dora and regularisation of constructions outside it. Meanwhile, architects and city’s heritage conservationists are demanding removal of illegal constructions to protect the city’s character. In the past, UT estate office had even issued notices for carrying out constructions outside lal dora in villages. UT administration had issued a notification and even clarified that the area outside the aabadi area of recently merged 13 villages, would continue to be controlled by the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952, as applicable to union territory of Chandigarh. The Chandigarh draft master plan, 2031 pointed out that unauthorised constructions had come up on over 250 acres outside the lal dora in UT villages. Villagers maintained that a number of families had lived outside the lal dora for years and had all facilities, such as water connection, power connection, ration cards and voter cards. The merger started in 2013 for uniform development and governance of villages. The administration considered 600 objections and suggestions on the draft notification before a high-powered committee led by UT home secretary recommended the merger on November 30, 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-asks-bengaluru-institute-to-revise-draft-policy-on-village-devp-lal-dora/articleshow/86328683.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This is the third seizure at the city airport in 10 days. “Customs officers intercepted a passenger who arrived from Dubai by an Air India morning flight and seized 463gm of gold valued at Rs 22,07,212”, an official said. The gold was concealed in two solid cylindrical shaped rollers to be used for connecting with the wheels of skating shoes and two solid rods of socket tool kit. The exterior wall of the roller was made of grey-coloured metal and exterior wall of the toolkit was made of solid steel. The gold was so neatly concealed that there was no such joint visible, officials said. Earlier this week, the authorities seized around 142 grams of gold from a passenger who landed on Wednesday from Muscat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gold-worth-rs-22l-seized-at-airport/articleshow/86331892.cms||---

The BMC said that in areas where it finds a large number of people have travelled and returned, it will either hold testing camps or connect such persons to the nearest civic testing centre. The BMC will also activate all its 266 civic testing centres. Officials said that amid concerns of the third wave and the recent festive mood in the city, when people were seen stepping outside and visiting others, they wanted to take all precautions. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said: “We want to trace the infected patients as early as possible so that they do not move out and infect others. Therefore, we plan to test anyone who may be symptomatic and also conduct testing camps where need be.” He said staff on the ground, like community health workers and ward level staff, had already been asked to identify such localities and act accordingly. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said that while they plan to increase testing, especially in containment zones, by undertaking tests on first and fifth day, the aim is to finally keep the positivity rate below 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-says-test-more-in-areas-where-people-have-travelled/articleshow/86330567.cms||Richa Pinto

Moreover, all the members involved in the immersion will have to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. DCP (Zone 2) Vijay Kharat said that processions are not allowed this time due to Covid restrictions, the city police will be keeping a close watch over the public movement and ensure that all orders are adhered by everyone. The 10-day Ganesh festival will come to an end on Sunday. The festival was low key after the police encouraged Ganesh mandals to keep the celebrations muted. The police have invoked section 144 of the Indian Penal Code that prohibits gathering of more than four people at one spot. To ensure that the all orders issued by the police are followed, over 2,000 policemen, including platoons of the State Reserve Police Force would be on the streets. Among the 2,000 policemen would be 27 PIs, six ACPs, three DCPs, 93 APIs and PSIs and another 450 home guards. Police said that the anti-social elements at times try to create mischief during festive periods. On this backdrop, a route march of the police personnel would be conducted in the jurisdiction of various police stations to send across a message. A company of the State Reserve Police Force of 25 personnel has also arrived in the city. While one platoon of the company has been deployed at Nashik Road, one platoon has been deployed in the Bhadrakali area and one platoon has been kept in reserve at the police head-quarters. DCP Kharat added that people should ensure that they do not go in groups to the river banks for immersion. He said that people should immerse the idols in the artificial immersion ponds made available by the NMC. Strict action would be taken if five or more people are seen travelling in groups for the immersion process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/only-4-mandal-members-can-accompany-idols-cops/articleshow/86326744.cms||Santosh Sonawane

They will not deduct challans of people who do not follow Covid rules under the Disaster Management Act either. The decision was taken after teachers working in government schools of the city staged a sit-in at the office of SDM South, Rupesh Agrawal and DC Office in Sector 17. Around 150 teachers and clerical staff performing BLO duties participated in the protest at the SDM South Office in Sector 42. When the SDM refused to accept demands of teachers, they reached the DC office, Sector-17, where the ADC met K P S Mahi. After talking to the teachers, the ADC assured that the issue would be resolved. Pacified by the assurance, teachers announced that they would go to school and do teaching work only. Teachers in the city have been engaged in a variety of works, such as making votes, census and conducting surveys. About 300 teaching and non-teaching staff members of schools have been assigned the task of making votes at this time. Teachers will have to do this work from 7am to 9am and from 5pm to 7pm. This is apart from the school work from 9am to 3pm. Teachers say they are being made to work 12 hours, which is too much. They said that the biggest problem is to prepare students for the National Achievement Survey along with online-offline studies. Besides, teachers have to give extra time to students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/only-teaching-no-extra-work-for-teachers/articleshow/86328728.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Three Park Street restos, part of Kolkata’s gastronomic experience, get heritage tag||KOLKATA: Three iconic restaurants on Park Street — Mocambo, Trincas and Kwality — will on Sunday receive a heritage tag, a plaque that will adorn their entrances, signifying they have existed for more than at least six decades and represent the culture and spirit of Kolkata. While 15 restaurants had been shortlisted for the honour by the Indian Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (Intach) last December, the formal handing over of the plaques was deferred due to the pandemic. The three, the first ones to receive the heritage tags, said they were delighted and would continue to stick to the tradition and recipes that kept Kolkatans hooked to them for more than 60 years. “I look at it as a great honour and a recognition for the hard work that we have put in over the past six decades. Restaurants come and go but few survive such a long time.  It’s a combination of the food, ambience and the quality of our service that have been consistent over so many years that set us apart. It’s not important whether the tag will help us in terms of revenue or not. But it definitely symbolizes our heritage and the fact that we represent the city,” said Mocambo owner Nitin Kothari. Trincas has been an intrinsic part of urban culture in Kolkata — as a tea room, as a meeting point, as a dining destination and as an entertainment venue — for over eight decades. It continues to draw on its culinary and musical heritage: classic Kolkata cuisine, along with live performances every day. Swiss Cinzio Trinca opened Trincas as a tearoom and bakery at its current location on Park Street in 1939. In 1959, Omi and Swaran Puri and their partner, Joshua, bought the going concern and added a full menu and live performances to the offerings at Trincas. Among those who have performed there are pop diva Usha Uthup and British-Indian singer-musician Biddu Appaiah. In 1983, Trincas started a quiet food revolution by serving the first Sichuan inspired-dishes, when Ming Room opened on its premises. Prior to that, Chinese food meant either Cantonese or Haka. “It is a great honour to be awarded heritage status by Intach. The award recognizes the efforts, risks, perseverance and sacrifices of all those involved in the Trincas story. This icon of Kolkata continues to be a living legend that is spreading joy and keeping up with the times,” said Trincas partner Anand Puri. Kwality next door also started as a tea room in 1952, serving beverages, snacks and ice-cream. A few months into the business, it introduced north Indian food. “Though it is a multi-cuisine restaurant now, pindi chana remains its most popular dish,” said Kwality restaurant partner Rajiv Ghai. The restaurant at Ballygunge Phari, which serves Chinese and continental dishes, was set up four years later in 1956. Kothari added that restaurants, like Mocambo, did not need to change due to the tag. “We have altered very little in terms of the menu or the décor. We have the same kind of furniture and even the tapestry remains unchanged. The only major addition have been an extra space to add 70 seats,” said Kothari. Mocambo started in 1956 as a nightclub with music and a dance floor. In the early seventies, the music was stopped and the dance floor converted into seating space after the state government imposed a steep tax on nightclubs. “The whole idea behind the heritage eatery blue plaque is to make people aware and conscious about heritage. Since Kolkata is a foodies’ paradise, we decided to honour the city’s culinary heritage,” said Intach said Kolkata convenor G M Kapur. The other restaurants that will receive the tag soon include Shiraz, Dilkhusha, Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandy, Allen Kitchen, Nabin Chandra Das, Bhim Nag, Paramount, Sabir’s Hotel, Niranjan Agar, Eau Chew Restaurant, KC Das and Indian Coffee House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-park-st-restos-part-of-kols-gastronomic-experience-get-heritage-tag/articleshow/86328818.cms||Subhro Niyogi

In Bengaluru Urban, 82% got the first dose and around 40% got both jabs. Vaccination data till 5pm Saturday shows that the percentage of eligible population covered with both doses is lower than the state average in 18 districts, with Haveri (16.7%) reporting the lowest, followed by Kalaburagi (17.3%), Raichur (18.7%), Vijayapura (19.6%) and Belagavi (20.7%). In first dose coverage, 16 districts are below the state average. Overall, the state has administered 5.2 crore doses covering over 3.7 crore people with at least one dose, while more than 1.4 crore of these are fully inoculated. Also, 13 districts other than Bengaluru Urban, led by Kodagu (38.4%), Udupi (38%) and Ramanagara (37%), have seen full coverage that’s better than the state average. Nationally, around 63% have received the first dose and 21% the second dose.

Therefore, the provision relating to removal of a vice chancellor has been incorporated”. He said, “If in the opinion of the chancellor, the vice chancellor wilfully omits or refuses to carry out the provisions of this Act or abuses the powers vested in him, or if otherwise appears to the chancellor that the continuance of the vice chancellor in office is detrimental to the interest of the university, the chancellor may, in consultation with the state government, after an inquiry as he deems proper, by order remove the vice chancellor.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bill-specifies-basic-qualifications-to-hire-vcs-of-agri-universities/articleshow/86331920.cms||---

The opposition alleged that the bill has been brought in prior to the ‘Prashasan Gaon ke Sangh’ and expressed apprehension on such regularisation on political grounds. The government said with passage of time and increase of population in villages and towns, it is found that land granted for the purpose of common facilities were being used for residential purposes and permanent structures/residential houses had come up on such land. The dispossession of the people staying on such land would create hardship for such people. Keeping in view the above problem, “It has been decided that in case the land has been rendered of no use except for residential purpose, it would be allotted to the person to whom it has been granted, upon payment of premium therefore at the rate fixed under section 96 and on payment of penalty as may be prescribed.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/land-revenue-bill-passed-provides-for-regularisation-of-common-facility-land/articleshow/86331916.cms||---

All these will be limited to 50% of their capacity. The state, however, has decided not to allow electronic dance music (EDM) festivals and nightclubs. CM Pramod Sawant told TOI that the state-level curfew would be extended, with these relaxations. Tourism-related activities have been shut in Goa since the state was hit by a brutal second wave of Covid-19. Sawant chaired a meeting of the Covid task force and discussed the recommendations of the expert committee, which suggested the opening of tourism-related and economic activities. “The state government will allow economic and tourism-related activities including the reopening of casinos, spas, massage parlours and river cruises at 50% capacity from Monday, with strict standard operating procedures (SOPs),” the chief minister said. Sawant said that those entering casinos should be fully-vaccinated or possess an RT-PCR negative certificate. TOI reported on Saturday that the government has written to the Union ministries of home affairs and external affairs to give special permission to allow charter flights into the tourist state. “Goa is ready to start tourism and is open to welcome tourists. I think ours is the first state to welcome tourists during the pandemic,” Sawant had said. With regards to the opening of schools, the chief minister said that the task force has asked the expert committee to take a decision and send it to the task force. Sawant said that at the meeting, the positivity rate over the past three to four weeks was compared, and it remains below 2%. Task force committee member Dr Shekhar Salkar said that a decision would be taken on October 15 whether or not to allowed EDM festivals in the state. Salkar said that the expert committee would hold a meeting on September 24 or 25 to decide on schools opening. “Most likely, schools may reopen on October 4 with regards to Classes IX, X, XI and XII,” Salkar said. Salkar said that the expert committee has recommended to the state government to vaccinate all school staff. Around 98% of school staff are already vaccinated. Salkar also said that the expert committee will review the situation from time to time and give suggestions to the government. Salkar said that “scientifically, the third wave will come, but the virus will have to search for Goans to infect as 98% are vaccinated”. “Vaccinated persons get Covid, but chances of their death are extremely low,” Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/casinos-spas-river-cruises-set-to-restart-from-tomorrow-in-state/articleshow/86330644.cms||Murari Shetye

So far, 4.15 lakh people have been fully vaccinated,” additional district health officer Dr Ravindra Chaudhary said. The vaccination drive has picked up pace in the rural areas. “Earlier, there were issues in the rural parts – especially the tribal areas of the district. Special campaigns were organised by the local health officials to spread awareness among the people. The picture has changed quite a bit now,” said Dr Chaudhary. Niphad taluka is leading the vaccination chart by administering 2.36 lakh doses to the beneficiaries. It is followed by the Nashik taluka, where 1.74 lakh doses have been administered to beneficiaries. The rural data excludes the vaccination both in Nashik and Malegaon municipal corporations. All 10 talukas have already administered one lakh doses. The other talukas are those with lesser population – mostly the tribal and remote areas. It may be noted that Niphad and adjoining Sinnar taluka are the hotspots of covid cases in the district. At the same time the health authorities in Niphad taluka have carried out the vaccination programme aggressively. According to Dr Nawalsing Chavan, who was the taluka health officer of Niphad, said rising awareness about the vaccination, need for travel and other factors helped in demand for vaccination from the very first day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/niphad-taluka-leads-in-vaccination-in-rural-areas/articleshow/86326804.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The cybercrime team coordinated with the banks and froze the transactions of the accused to get the money back. It was a huge relief for Prateek Saxena, one of the victims, who lost over a lakh. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said, “Cybercrime complaints should be lodged immediately to ensure the transaction is traced.” According to data from the latest NCRB report, UP has replaced Karnataka as the state with the highest incidents of cybercrime, with over 11,000 cases reported in 2020. The money was lost to cybercriminals who had hacked the customers’ account through phishing. The complainants who were able to contact the police and were guided to the cyber cell within the ‘golden hours’ after the fraud were able to get their money back. Divulging details, Vijay Dhull told TOI, “We take such complaints on priority and deploy cyber experts to trace the money trail. We ensure that the concerned banks are contacted within the prescribed time frame which is called the ‘golden period’. The complainants are also advised to call 155260 and register a complaint by opening a complaint ticket immediately after the fraud. This ticket number can be taken to the bank for registering a complaint with their bank. Alternatively, they can carry their bank statement while lodging a complaint with the police and mention about the bank account or the application to which their money was transferred so that the police can take action before the money is withdrawn or transferred further.” The SSP added, “We are also offering training programmes related to cybercrime to four sub-inspectors and a woman constable at each police station to handle complaints related to cyber fraud. We request everyone to not share the OTP with anyone over the phone and not click links offering loans and gifts, received through messages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-swift-action-up-police-manages-to-trace-rs-4-2l-lost-in-online-fraud/articleshow/86326777.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse ‘layered’ Rs 50 lakh & routed it to wife’s account: Enforcement Directorate||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate in its chargesheet against Eknath Khadse accused the former BJP leader, who is now with the NCP, of “layering Rs 50 lakh, received from various sources including Rs 15 lakh cash, from his bank account to bank account of his wife, claiming as untainted and finally utilized Rs 38 lakh to purchase the MIDC land.” Khadse’s kin spent a total Rs 5.53 crore for the land transaction (Rs 3.75 crore paid to the seller and Rs 1.78 crore as stamp duty). Of the total expenses, Khadse’s wife Mandakini raised Rs 2.38 crore (Rs 2 crore she got from a shell company, Benchmark Buildcon Pvt Ltd, as an unsecured loan and Rs 38 lakh of Rs 50 lakh that she received from Khadse). On the other hand, Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari raised Rs 3.15 crore, of which Rs 2 crore was an unsecured loan from Benchmark Buildcon. The ED stated that Khadse’s kin paid Rs 4 crore tainted cash to Benchmark Buildcon, who layered the money and transferred it to Mandamini and Chaudhari as unsecured loans. The chargesheet said Chaudhari prepared forged backdated loan documents to show Rs 4 crore as loan from Benchmark. In his statement to the ED, Khadse said that he was not aware of his wife and son-in-law purchasing the MIDC land. He also told them that the transfer of Rs 50 lakh from his account to Mandakini was a normal financial transaction between husband and wife. The ED chargesheet stated that “Eknath Khadse was the mastermind of the conspiracy conducted to (sic) the illicit purchase of MIDC land in the name of Mandakini and Chaudhari at far below price i.e. Rs 3.75 crores from the true value i.e. Rs 22.83 crores to achieve his ulterior motive of getting the compensation for the land on the true market value from the government of Maharashtra as per new Land Acquisition Act.” The chargesheet stated that to get the compensation, Khadse became instrumental in the illicit purchase of MIDC land and suppressed its true value. Khadse was revenue minister in the previous government led by BJP in Maharashtra when the alleged offence took place in 2016. The police have registered a case for investigation and filed a closure report in the case. The court has yet to make any decision on the police report. After the controversy, Khadse was forced to resign. Last October, Khadse left the BJP and joined the NCP. The ED had registered the money laundering case based on the police FIR and on July 7 this year, they arrested Chaudhari in the case. He is presently in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-khadse-layered-rs-50l-routed-it-to-wifes-account/articleshow/86330651.cms||Vijay V Singh

Singh told TOI that the investigation has begun into the case police were looking into the antecedents of the man who had taken the loan by forging documents.Another official told TOI that the case was of a serious nature because the PAN card was forged in a manner that the bank officials got easily duped and granted the loan. “The woman is a teacher posted in a government school, she was confused as to who could claim the loan on her behalf,” an official said.Singh said the police were also investigating if the man who obtained the loan had defaulted in paying regular EMIs.

Unit XII, led by inspector Mahesh Tawde, on Friday laid a trap and arrested Baisakhi Vishwas (21), Hayat Shah (50) and his friend Vikrant Subhash Chandra Kirat. While Baisakhi is a bar dancer, Hayat and Kirat are estate agents at Squatter Colony in Goregaon. Police said the brain behind the plan to extort money from Dr Vadilal Shah was Hayat. “Vadilal is the family doctor of Hayat and his family. Hayat knew details of the victim and told his accomplices that he can be easily fooled,’’ said Datta Nalawade, deputy commissioner of police (crime). Police said the three used a letterhead with the words ‘Lal Salaam’ (greeting used by communists) to threaten Dr Shah, who owns a clinic in Goregaon (E). On September 15, Baisakhi, a resident of Ghansoli, visited the doctor’s clinic in Goregaon wearing a burqa and left a threatening letter, in which they demanded Rs 50 lakh. In the letter, they said they were naxalites and if he failed to pay up they would kill his only son. Police said the accused got the idea of extortion while watching videos online. Hayat and Vikrant are estate agents and know each other. One of the two knew Baisakhi and they promised her a commission of Rs50,000. Dr Shah lodged a police complaint and during the scrutiny of CCTV footage the woman in burqa was identified and arrested from Ghansoli. She blew the lid off her accomplices, said Tawde. Police then arrested the two. Both accused were booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections for threatening and extortion. They will be produced before the court on Sunday. Police want to know whether they have send such threatening notes to any other victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bar-dancer-2-estate-agents-pose-as-naxals-try-to-extort-rs-50l-from-doc/articleshow/86330672.cms||Ahmed Ali

He also said that the Union government would provide free visas to 5 lakh international tourists, to boost tourism. Calling Goa a state of boundless possibilities, he said that “Goa is not just a state of the country but a strong marker of Brand India”. Modi praised healthcare workers and beneficiaries of the Covid vaccination programme in Goa, which “completed 100% coverage of the first dose” to the eligible population. He was interacting with them to mark the state’s completion of that milestone. The PM also said that the Union government would take all steps to promote tourism in the country. He also said that the “double-engine government” is powering efforts to make the Goan tourism sector more attractive, as well as to give more facilities to the state’s farmers and fishermen. Modi said it is important that Goa has administered the first dose to 100% of the eligible population, stating that when hotel employees, taxi drivers and shopkeepers are vaccinated, tourists will come to Goa with a sense of safety. “This is a major milestone in the fight against coronavirus,” he said. “Every achievement of Goa that epitomises the concept of Ek Bharat-Shrestha Bharat fills me with great joy.” The PM said that he hopes that in the upcoming tourism season that starts next month, Goa gets the “same amount of tourists and international tourists”. Meanwhile, Modi said that even though there is a decrease in Covid’s spread, precautions are still a must. “The maximum (more) we focus on safety and hygiene, the more tourists will come to Goa,” he said. The PM remarked that over the past few months, Goa has fought natural calamities like heavy rains, cyclones and floods bravely, adding that under the leadership of CM Pramod Sawant, the state has fought bravely. “I congratulate Sawant and his team,” he said, adding his congratulations to corona warriors, health workers and Team Goa for maintaining the pace of vaccination amidst natural calamities. He also commended the state’s coordination in dealing with social and geographical challenges. The pace in Canacona, for instance, located in one of the remotest parts of the state, has set an example for the rest of the state, he said. “Goa has shown great results of sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas,” he said. Meanwhile, a day after India administered a record 2.5 crore doses on his birthday, Modi praised the compassion, service and sense of duty of healthcare teams and the people. “I have seen many birthdays, and have always been indifferent to that but, in all my years, yesterday (Friday) was a day that made me deeply emotional,” he said, adding that it was made extra special by the efforts of the country and corona warriors. “Everyone cooperated fully, people connected this with service,” he said. “It was their compassion and duty that made this feat of 2.5 crore doses in a day possible,” he said. Elaborating on the Centre’s decision to prioritise tourism destinations for vaccination, Modi said this was not talked about earlier. “It was important for our tourism destinations to open,” he said. “The Central government has also recently taken several steps to encourage foreign tourists. It has been decided to give free visas to 5 lakh tourists visiting India, loan up to Rs 10 lakh with government guarantee to tourism stakeholders and loan up to Rs 1 lakh for registered tourist guides.” He also said that Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep have completed administering the first dose for the eligible population. Sikkim, Andaman & Nicobar islands, Kerala, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Dadra and Nagar Haveli are not far behind, he added. On the state government, Modi said that the new Zuari bridge between North and South Goa would be inaugurated in a few months and will enhance connectivity in the state. He also lauded the state for various other schemes like har ghar jal, PM kisan samman nidhi, expansion of kisan credit cards and Svanidhi scheme for street vendors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-will-play-important-role-in-reviving-indias-tourism-sector-modi/articleshow/86330676.cms||Murari Shetye

Now, the police headquarters is planning at taking up the cases in the division bench of the high court to ensure that the officers report to their new places of postings. “We had done an internal survey with the help of senior officers of all police ranges and districts. It was found that nearly 300 policemen were either having connivance or nexus with criminals or were having extra martial affairs. Also, following their negligent approach towards their duties, they were transferred to different districts,” said DGP ML Lathar. “We have taken up the matter seriously. Though they got court stays, we have the scope of appealing before the high court’s division bench,” he added. When asked if this survey included the wrong conduct of recently suspended DSP Heera Lal Saini and a woman constable from Jaipur, Lathar preferred not to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/row-over-cop-rejig-to-reach-court-again/articleshow/86331945.cms||---

Although no one was injured, a few department records were gutted. The fire broke out at 6am when the building was empty. The guard noticed the flames and called the fire brigade. Fire tenders took almost half an hour to douse the flames. However, firemen took some time to clear the thick smoke from the entire floor. Mostly, records in the deputy director’s office were burnt. Around 20 firemen led by sub-fire officer were present in the fire fighting operation. “Some records and files were gutted in the fire. Besides, furniture and other electrical items, including computers were gutted. There was no loss to life. Since the fire took place early in the morning, it was easy for us to douse the flames as we did not face any hurdle,” a senior officer said. He added that the exact cause of the fire could not be ascertained but a short circuit could be a possible reason. He said both the fire and police departments were looking into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/records-burnt-as-fire-breaks-out-in-finance-planning-office/articleshow/86328874.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: No water & power for 70 years, Dhangars in Cavrem continue to battle the odds||QUEPEM: CM Pramod Sawant’s announcement of free water supply up to 16,000 litres per month has only rankled the 100-odd members of the Dhangar community in the Cavrem-Pirla panchayat jurisdiction. Their houses have had neither tap water nor power supply for the past 70 years even as they rue that politicians shower them with promises only during election time. Living in this remote forested part of Camona, Maina, they continue to struggle in primitive conditions, away from even the most basic of infrastructure. They lack proper road connectivity too, as their dwellings are located 12km from Quepem town and two km from the main road. “The chief minister has promised free water to Goan families. This appears to be a poll gimmick as the government has failed to provide us with water for seven decades,” said Bhiru Tuko Bhavdhan, a Dhangar (Gawli) resident. The government did try to help by constructing a well around five years ago, but the source dries up during the summers. “No pipeline has been laid and the water from a nullah is available till January. A spring helps us tide over the crisis till the monsoons, but this is far away,” Bhagi Bhavdhan, another resident, said. In Camona, which now has been brought under the Sanguem constituency from the Quepem poll segment since 2012, the other conditions for the Dhangar community are also pathetic. The nearest electricity line is two km away, but no electricity poles have been erected yet. “We have survived on chimney lamps at night for more than seven decades. Solar panels installed by local panchayat in 2016 worked only for three years. Not a single bulb can be lit now, and repeated reminders to illuminate the area have failed,” said Jaya Bhavdhan, a 60-year-old woman. The two-km-long untarred road and an uneven pathway is in a shoddy condition, hardly motorable even for two-wheelers, especially during the monsoon. Earlier, all the families possessed goats and relied on selling their milk to eke out a living. But now, the old goat sheds are empty. “The landlords are not allowing our goats to move in their cashew plantations, so we sold them. They gave us around 500sqm of land for each household, but title documents are yet to be registered,” a local said. Acquiring education, too, is a hurdle. A few families have sent their children to relatives’ home at Valkini, 30km away, and have enrolled them in the government school there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-water-power-for-70-yrs-dhangars-in-cavrem-continue-to-battle-odds/articleshow/86330701.cms||Johnny M
---||Nashik||NMC’s new ‘Tank on Wheels’ initiative makes a big splash||NASHIK: The new ‘Tank on Wheels’ initiative of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for Ganapati idol immersions has received an overwhelming response. The civic authorities even had to turn down several requests due to infrastructure unavailability. “We came up with the ‘Tank on Wheels’ concept to ensure that people bid adieu to Ganpati Bappa in a very safe environment — especially given the ongoing pandemic. As a part of the initiative, a truck, with a water tank on it, will go to the big residential complexes and help people perform the rituals in safety,” said NMC commissioner Kailash Jadhav. The commissioner said the concept launched on an experimental basis has received very good response from residents. The civic body has appealed to the residential complexes — with more than 50 homes — to opt for the Tank on Wheels. The truck will have a water tank and a music system. It would go to the housing societies and spend one-two hours there. Residents will be able to immerse their idols in the tank. Idols would also be collected for further processing by the corporation. Dr Avesh Palod, who is in charge of executing the concept, said people are becoming more responsible in terms of celebrations during the pandemic. Residents have also been very eager to accept the suggestions in controlling the spread of the viral infection. “We have one vehicle for each of the six divisions. Each vehicle can cover at most six societies in a day. However, we had more than 15 requests from the Nashik Road division alone. We were forced to say ‘Sorry for the inconvenience’ to some of the housing societies we were unable to service,” Dr Palod said. The NMC already has 31 bookings across the six divisions. “It is an interesting concept. We have a housing society with over 900 flats. Of them, more than 300 households have Ganesh idols. Thanks to the ‘Tank on Wheels’, about 1,200 people from the society will not have to go to the ghats or other crowded places to immerse the idols. This will help stop the spread of the infection. We are doing our bit,” said Subhash Shirole, of Parksyde Homes in Nashik city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmcs-new-tank-on-wheels-initiative-makes-a-big-splash/articleshow/86326842.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three serial chain snatchers get 7-year jail||MUMBAI: A 75-year-old woman from Sion fell victim to chain-snatching when she was out to purchase vegetables and milk in 2017, and recently a special court convicted and sentenced the three accused, who were charged under Mcoca, to seven years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined them Rs 15 lakh each. The court held that though the investigating agency recovered the mangalsutra, the woman had suffered minor injuries to her neck and the trauma she suffered could not be compensated in terms of money. Finding Jafar Khan Deshmukh (44), Dhiraj Kanojia (31) and Vijay Kale (31) guilty, special judge Dinesh E Kothalikar said they were involved such activities for a long time. The court said that more than 19 cases were registered against Deshmukh. Kanojia and Kale too were facing a series of charges. The court said that there were no chances of reformation or correction. “Considering the fact that the reporting of the incidents of chain-snatching are increasing day by day, if undue leniency is shown to the accused ... wrong message would go to the society. Showing leniency would amount to giving premium to such miscreants by putting the life and property of the society at risk,” the court said. While Kale has been in custody since June 2017, Deshmukh and Kanojia were arrested a month later. Special public prosecutor S E Soshte cited the evidence of 38 witnesses, including the victim and an eyewitness, to seek the conviction of the trio. It was the prosecution’s case that around 6 pm on June 5, 2017, the woman was proceeding to buy vegetables after purchasing milk, when two motorcyclists, later identified as Kale and Kanojia, came close to her and snatched her mangalsutra. The duo sped away while the frightened victim shouted for help. An FIR was registered at the Sion police station, where the victim described the accused and the two-wheeler. It was alleged that Deshmukh was also on his bike nearby. Kale was the first to be arrested and a piece of the mangalsutra weighing 10 grams, his share of the robbed item, was recovered. A month later, the other two were arrested. Deshmukh subsequently led the police to Sion Fort, where a piece of the mangalsutra weighing 16.8 grams was found in a hole dug in the ground and covered with a stone. Investigations revealed that Deshmukh was a gang leader and used to run an “organised crime syndicate” and that the two others were members and, so sections of Mcoca were invoked. The eyewitness corroborated the victim’s version and said that when he was at the spot with his friends he had heard an “old lady” screaming “chor, chor”. The eyewitness submitted that he had tried to chase the motorcyclists, when one of them removed his helmet and threatened him with a knife and abused him. They then fled. The court also relied on CCTV footage and found that the accused were seen taking several rounds around the area on their motorcycles on the evening of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-sees-no-chance-of-reform-convicts-snatchers-under-mcoca/articleshow/86330705.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||India||States with tourism links got priority in vaccination drive, says PM||NEW DELHI: Underlining the importance of the tourism industry which has been hit hard during the pandemic, PM Modi on Saturday said India prioritised tourist destinations in its vaccination efforts and that the government had taken several steps to attract foreign tourists. "It did not get much discussion but India has given a lot of priority to states associated with the tourism sector in its vaccination campaign. It was very important to open up the tourist destinations. Now the Chaar-Dhaam Yatra in Uttarakhand will also be possible. Along with these efforts, 100% vaccination in Goa is very important," the PM said while interacting with healthcare workers and vaccine beneficiaries from Goa as he lauded the state leadership for vaccinating the entire adult population. Modi said, "Initially we did not say so much about it because politics would have started happening on this too. However, the central government has also recently taken several steps to encourage foreign tourists. It has been decided to give free visas to 5 lakh tourists visiting India." He said loans up to Rs 10 lakh with a government guarantee to the stakeholders in the tourism sector and loans up to Rs 1 lakh for registered tourist guides have also been instituted for revival of the sector. “Imagine that if hotel industry people, taxi drivers, shopkeepers all are vaccinated, there will be a sense of safety among the tourists. Now Goa is among a few select international tourist destinations to have the vaccination safety shield,” Modi said. On the record one-day vaccination on Friday, coinciding with his 71st birthday, the PM said, “I have seen many birthdays and have always been indifferent to that but, in all my years, yesterday was a day that made me deeply emotional,” he added. Taking a swipe at the opposition, the PM said there is talk of fever as a vaccine sideeffect, but a political party experienced fever after Friday’s record. “For the first time, I saw that a political party developed fever late last night after India achieved its vaccination record. Is there any logic to this?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-with-tourism-links-got-priority-in-vax-drive-says-pm/articleshow/86333147.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Char Dham Yatra starts, but recurring landslides, rain-battered roads remain cause of concern||Dehradun:Uttarakhand issued detailed SOPs for conduct of the Char Dham yatra following directions given by the high court to prevent spread of Covid as a result of the pilgrimage. While the yatra commenced on Saturday, roads and infrastructure still remains a concern. Roads leading up to the four shrines, many of which are being widened under Centre’s all-weather road, have been battered by incessant heavy rains. The road from Tapovan to Rudraprayag, for pilgrims who want to visit Kedarnath or Badrinath,is damaged at several placed due to landslides and the frequent rains. There are around 20 landslide prone zones on the route and commuting at Totaghati, Kaudiyala, Nagarkota and Sirobagad remains a big challenge. The Lambagarh stretch on the Badrinath route has frequently been blocked due to landslides in the past few months whereas the Yamunotri and Gangotri highways are forced to be closed every few days due to the mountains crumbling. On Badrinath route, owing to incessant rains the debris frequently comes on the all weather road project road leading to traffic holdovers. The water level in seasonal rivulets like Khacda Nala, Pagal Nala and Lambagarh Nala is on the rise. When contacted Public Works Department minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI, “There is no denying the fact that the state has witnessed heavy rainfalls and some roads too have been damaged due to landslides. Our teams are identifying all such spots and we are confident that the road repair and other related work would be completed in seven to 10 days.” The minister pointed out that weather will play a crucial role in the next seven days. Tour operators have welcomed the decision to start the yatra for pilgrims. Tour operator Mahendra Singh Negi said that several enquiries came on the first day itself. “Though most of them did not confirm the booking, it is a positive start. While the work is expected to remain below normal in September due to the rains, the arrival of pilgrims is expected to gain pace in October.” Negi said, adding that most of the enquiries on Saturday were related to Kedarnath and Badrinath. It was a similar response on the official website of Char Dham Devesthanam Management Board. A total of 19,491 e-pass were issued by the Board out of which 4,830 were for Badrinath, 10,010 for Kedarnath, 2,375 for Gangotri and 2,276 for Yamunotri. On the day, 335 pilgrims went to Kedarnath and 84 visited Badrinath. Gangotri and Yamunotri saw the turnout of locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-yatra-starts-but-recurring-landslides-rain-battered-roads-remain-cause-of-concern/articleshow/86325361.cms||Kautilya Singh

The minister’s office has asked the state Public Works Department (PWD) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take necessary measures to ensure the senior citizens do not face hardships due to highway widening work at Bambolim. “Gadkari has taken a serious note of the difficulties faced by the people, particularly the senior citizens, and has instructed that the issues narrated may be taken up for resolution at once. The action taken in the matter intimated to us for information of minister, MoRTH,” Sanket Bhondve, IAS, private secretary to the Union minister has said in his email to the PWD and the NHAI. The residents’ petition has been pending with the Goa State Human Rights Commission and the chief minister’s office, besides the PWD. The elderly residents of Palmar Colony have alleged that the present work is a deviation from the original highway expansion plan on the stretch. The altered plan is illegal and has been causing severe inconvenience to the colony residents, most of whom are elderly, the senior citizens had told the Union minister in their petition. The colony is located near the Goa Medical College complex, Bambolim. “In constructing 4-lane highway; EPC contractor and consultant have encroached the existing St Cruz-Bambolim MDR road reducing the width of this road from 8 to 4.5m. Hence the traffic from St Cruz-Bambolim Goa Medical College, particularly ambulance traffic, is passing through our private residential colony road which creates nuisance and unsafe condition to the residents,” the senior citizens have said, presenting document procured under RTI to back their claims. The residents said that the ill-planned highway work and changes were made with the ulterior motive to safeguard the interest of one person who owns a structure on this road stretch. The contractor has also excavated side of the present highway road to a depth of nearly 12-15m to extract earth to use for filling of the highway road project and has left this excavated stretch in a dangerous condition, locals said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gadkari-tells-pwd-to-resolvesenior-citizens-issue-over-nh/articleshow/86330770.cms||---

The cybercrime team coordinated with the banks and froze the transactions of the accused to get the money back. It was a huge relief for Prateek Saxena, one of the victims, who lost over a lakh. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull said, “Cybercrime complaints should be lodged immediately to ensure the transaction is traced.” According to data from the latest NCRB report, UP has replaced Karnataka as the state with the highest incidents of cybercrime, with over 11,000 cases reported in 2020. The money was lost to cybercriminals who had hacked the customers’ account through phishing. The complainants who were able to contact the police and were guided to the cyber cell within the ‘golden hours’ after the fraud were able to get their money back. Divulging details, Vijay Dhull told TOI, “We take such complaints on priority and deploy cyber experts to trace the money trail. We ensure that the concerned banks are contacted within the prescribed time frame which is called the ‘golden period’. The complainants are also advised to call 155260 and register a complaint by opening a complaint ticket immediately after the fraud. This ticket number can be taken to the bank for registering a complaint with their bank. Alternatively, they can carry their bank statement while lodging a complaint with the police and mention about the bank account or the application to which their money was transferred so that the police can take action before the money is withdrawn or transferred further.” The SSP added, “We are also offering training programmes related to cybercrime to four sub-inspectors and a woman constable at each police station to handle complaints related to cyber fraud. We request everyone to not share the OTP with anyone over the phone and not click links offering loans and gifts, received through messages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-swift-action-up-police-manages-to-trace-rs-4-2l-lost-in-online-fraud/articleshow/86326866.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Mustard, chilli and vegetable crops were also adversely affected, say farmers. Crop loss assessment has been initiated by the agriculture department in Firozabad, Etah and Kasganj districts even as the meteorological department predicted more rainfall over the next two days. Mohan Singh Chahar, regional president of Agra unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said, “Farmers have lost up to 30% of their crop. Firozabad, Etah and Kasganj districts are worst-affected. We have requested the authorities to assess the crop loss in a time-bound manner and provide suitable compensation to the farmers.” Kasganj-based farmer Rambabu said, “My cousins and I had sown bajra in 10 hectares of land. The rain has flatten the crop. Now, we are unlikely to get back our input costs.” In Firozabad, farmer Ram Pratap said, “We have sown chilli and capsicum across eight hectares. Heavy rainfall has caused waterlogging in the field. This will cause the plants to rot. If the rain continues for a few more days, crop yield will be significantly affected.” Ravikant, deputy director, agriculture, Agra division, said, “Following the rainfall, farmers in different parts of the districts have reported crop loss. We have asked them to claim crop insurance within 72 hours. Our teams will be starting assessment of crop loss from Saturday.” Meanwhile, rainfall helped in clearing the air in Agra.

---||Chandigarh||ECT patients for mental disorders in PGI-Chandigarh dropped to 1/3rd during pandemic: Study||CHANDIGARH: PGI registered a reduction in the number of patients who received electroconvulsion therapy (ECT) during the Covid pandemic. The number of such patients reduced from 312 to 90 --almost one third-From March 2020 to March 2021 in PGI. These patients are receiving ECT in OPDs for depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. These findings have been published as a study in “The Journal of ECT” by a team of researchers from the departments of psychiatry and Anaesthesia and Critical Care, PGIMER. Psychiatrists consider the ECT safe for patients who have severe forms of mental illness and do not respond to medicines. The study suggested that ECT should be given with precaution and those centres which have closed this therapy must resume it as out of the 90 patients who received the therapy during the pandemic, only four tested positive. “ECT is the most effective treatment for psychiatric diseases and has never been controversial. With the current level of procedures followed, it is a very safe treatment. As a side effect, there is some amount of forgetfulness lasting for a short duration which improves after sometime,” said Prof Sandeep Grover, department of psychiatry and one of the authors of the study. He added, “It is recommended as a lifesaving procedure for those with suicidal tendencies and who stop eating.” As of now, PGI is getting closer to the pre-pandemic patient count. In most cases, the treatment was given to patients who were hospitalised during the pandemic. What is ECT?ECT is a therapeutic procedure in which a doctor induces a medically-controlled seizure using electrical currents in a patient who is put under general anaesthesia. It is also approved by the FDA. There have been movies and a lot of misconceptions associated with this treatment where it is shown that there is brain damage and the patient is tortured. “This is a misnomer. For patients who do not respond to medicines, this therapy has been most beneficial,” said Prof Grover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fewer-patients-took-ect-for-mental-disorders-in-pgi-during-covid-times/articleshow/86328910.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||You can be I-T chief: Soon, tax games for young minds||MUMBAI: Would you like to be the income-tax commissioner for your city? Well, you may eventually get to do so in the virtual world, as the directorate of income-tax has invited tenders for development of a game suitable for both Android and iOS. The objective of this game? A subtle message that taxes are important—the happiness of a city such as well-built roads and other infrastructure, availability of power and water supply is dependent on taxes. It is thus important to pay the right amount of taxes at the right time. An exhaustive 22-page tender notice points out that the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) collects more than 50% of the total tax revenue of the government. Outreach to taxpayers is important and the core target population via this game is “school children, teenagers and young adults who form the core of the taxpayers of tomorrow”. A former government official states in earlier years, income-tax (I-T) officials visited select schools to explain the importance of paying taxes. Now, with schools shut and the advancement of technology, this seems like a perfect solution. The directorate of income-tax is clear about what it wants. The proposed game is to be divided into two sections —collections and spending from the treasury for public benefit. The player—aka the I-T commissioner—gets to select one of the three metro cities. Some businesses in his or her city do not pay the taxes that are due. The fall in tax collection adversely impacts the happiness of the city. As a first step, the player can send a tax notice requesting payment within the deadline. If the tax collection situation does not improve, warning lights will blink and the player can send a small team of officials to the defaulter’s office for verification. “The animation shall depict people dressed in official attire with briefcases entering the building in rapid movements,” states the detailed tender notice. The last course of action is search and seizure. Here the player will get to select the size and composition of the team, ranging from deputy directors, inspectors, valuers, forensic experts, hackers, security and para military forces. Vehicles with flashing lights and armed guards will zoom from the I-T office to the defaulter’s business. Nearby lanes will also be barricaded, details the tender. In the second segment, the player gets to use the treasury money to keep the city safe (there will be natural calamities and attacks from across the border) and the happiness quotient above a certain limit. In addition, the player can also spend towards improving public infrastructure. One important aspect of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav is the Shatabdi Shapath which is the resolve to lead India through a path of growth and development in the run-up to 2047, which will mark 100 years of Independence.

The drive, to be observed till October 2, will also emphasize on the cleanliness of stations and various approaches to stations by carrying out different initiatives in cleaning activities. “Discouraging the use of plastic, including the single-use plastic, has been one of the focus areas during the Swachhata Pakhwara (cleanliness drive). Different awareness rallies and Nukkad Natak are being held besides distribution of cloth-bag by involving NGOs to raise awareness on discouraging the use of single-use plastic,” SCR chief public relations officer Ch Rakesh said. The cleanliness drive, which is a part of the Swachh Rail Swachh Bharat programme, began across six divisions of SCR, including Nanded by administering a cleanliness pledge and undertaking a signature campaign to sensitize stakeholders. SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya said every individual should take responsibility to desist from littering and also not allow anyone to do so. “We should change our mindset and think positively about maintaining cleanliness in our surroundings. We should inculcate the same culture among our family members and neighbourhood. The ‘father of the nation’ Mahatma Gandhi had a dream of not only an independent India but also of a clean country,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scrs-cleanliness-drive-focusses-on-single-use-plastic/articleshow/86326860.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Upto Rs 75L grants for higher education institutes to establish research chairs||PANAJI: To give further push to research in institutes of higher education, the directorate of higher education has introduced a new scheme which will enable the institutes to establish research chairs. Colleges in the state will be able to invite scientists of repute to serve as the chair and will get government funds upto Rs 75 lakh per chair for a researcher or academic based abroad. The institute has to put in place a panel to make selection of appointees to the chair. It is mandatory to have a representation of the directorate of higher education on the committee. The proposal will then be forwarded to the state government for approval of funds. “Maximum amount of Rs 50 lakh in the form of funds/grant-in-aid shall be sanctioned annually for each research/academic chair (for a researcher/academician from India) on the recommendation and approval of the government. Maximum amount of Rs 75 lakh in the form of funds/grant-in-aid shall be sanctioned annually for each research/academic chair (for a researcher/academician from abroad),” states the scheme. The funds will be released in two instalments. Scheme states that it aims to provide well-equipped centre of learning to intellectuals, academicians and students to undertake studies and research and to encourage inter-disciplinary research programmes relating to history, science, political economy, literature, mathematics, foreign policies, strategic issues, ecology and environment, social, economic, theatre, music and cultural development, etc. The idea is to also strengthen the role of various educational institutions, university or academics in public policy making. “The activities conducted under each of the respective research/academic chair shall be evaluated by the institute concerned and a detailed six monthly report in this regard shall be submitted to the government through the directorate of higher education,” reads the scheme. If any misuse of the funds is noticed, then the amount of grants provided will be recovered with a 5% penal interest. “The academic and research landscape has been expanding at an accelerated pace in all disciplines. It is therefore advisable to match the pace while providing opportunities for growth of senior scientists, even beyond superannuation too. In the absence of these opportunities, eminent academicians and performing senior scientists, at times face challenges to continue research and academic advising,” states the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/upto-rs-s-75l-grants-for-higher-edu-institutes-to-establish-research-chairs/articleshow/86330735.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

On Friday, Sonali Ghosh, deputy inspector general of forests, Central Zoo Authority (CZA), sought the actual status of trees cut from the Uttarakhand forest department. Rajiv Bhartari, head of forest force (Uttarakhand), told TOI he has asked for a factual report from PCCF (wildlife) within a week. In 2019, Uttarakhand had sought approval from the ministry of forests and environment (MoEF) for its first tiger safari which would provide a ‘sure-shot glimpse’ of the big cat to visitors.  In its submission, the state had said that 163 trees would be felled for the project.  The green signal for the Pakhro safari was given and work began soon after. A plea, however, was filed in the NTCA on August 26 this year by Supreme Court advocate and activist Gaurav Bansal, claiming that 10,000 trees were felled in Corbett to set up the safari. It sought verification of the actual number of trees felled and cancellation of approvals given to the project by NTCA and CZA. Talking to TOI, Bansal said, “The project is spread over 106 hectares and a minimum of 10,000 trees have been felled to set up the safari. This is in violation of a Supreme Court order as well.” The Supreme Court in a judgment in 2001 had stated that no tree in CTR should be felled “under any circumstance by the state or anyone else”. According to Bansal’s complaint, in order to use the land in Corbett’s Pakhro block (Sonanadi range) for non-forestry activity, a clearance was required from the forest advisory committee under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. “Uttarakhand forest department gave in writing to the FAC that 163 trees will be felled. The permission granted to establish the safari was primarily based on this,” the complaint said. Divisional forest officer (Kalagarh), Kisanchand, under whose jurisdiction the area of the tiger safari falls, dismissed the allegations and said only 163 trees were marked and felled by the forest corporation. A source in the forest department, however, admitted that “officials knew 10,000 to 12,000 trees would have to be felled for the project”. “Everyone at the higher level knew that thousands of trees would need to be axed for this project to see the light of day. There was probably pressure to get the safari off the ground,” the source said. Notably, director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, Rahul (who only uses his first name), had written to the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Kalagarh on July 6 to ensure "all activities related to the safari project are in accordance with law". "The Pakhro tiger safari was an announcement of the Prime Minister of India and it is one of the most important projects of the state government. Therefore, tree felling and all the other works related to the safari must be done in accordance with law and guidelines so that this important project doesn’t get into any controversy,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-10000-trees-not-163-cut-in-corbett-for-tiger-safari-says-plea-to-tiger-body/articleshow/86326890.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||All samples to undergo genome sequencing in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Now, the sample of each Covid patient will undergo genome sequencing for identification of the variant. Earlier, only random samples were sent for sequencing. This will help in identifying the variant circulating in the state. The health department has ordered officials to send samples of infected persons to the SMS Medical College for genome sequencing. “We have intensified our surveillance to detect if any new Covid-19 variant in the state has entered and it will help us in keeping a watch on it. For the purpose, directions have been issued across the state to get genome sequencing of samples of each Covid patient found infected with the virus on daily basis,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). The variants which have been found in the state are Delta, Alpha, Kappa and Delta+. Over 80% of the samples tested positive for variants are Delta in the state. The state has started its own genome sequencing laboratory at SMS Medical College in June. Earlier, the health department had to send its samples for genome sequencing to a IGIB Laboratory in Delhi, which was allocated by the centre to the state for genome sequencing. Mahajan said, “Since few cases are being reported and we have facility for genome sequencing of sufficient number of samples at SMS Hospital, we have decided to check each Covid-19 patient’s variant which had infected him. Earlier, we were reporting cases in increased numbers some months ago, at that time it was difficult to conduct genome sequencing of each patient, so we were doing it randomly.” For over a month, the state has been reporting less than 20 cases daily. Dr Virendra Singh, member of state’s advisory committee for Covid-19 said, “The decision of checking variant of covid in each Covid-19 patient will be helpful in fight against Covid-19.” Health department officials said that earlier, each district was sending limited number of samples for genome sequencing. They were selecting only those samples for genome sequencing of Covid-19 patients based on severity of disease. Through genome sequencing, the state government had come to know about the second wave caused by Delta variant of Covid-19 in which more than 6,000 people had died. The samples collected from Covid-19 patients from April-May Covid cases, showed that the main variant circulated in the state was Delta, which caused the damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/all-samples-to-undergo-genome-sequencing/articleshow/86331963.cms||---

The children in the district have not been vaccinated against TB, Diarrhea, Rubella, Rotavirus, Chicken pox, Measles, Hepatitis etc., while the pregnant women were not immunized against tetanus.  Earlier, the WHO had alerted the state government about the high number of pending routine immunization sessions since April 2021. According to the health department officials, the immunization programme got affected due to the second wave of Covid-19. In the last four months, most of the staff at the government hospitals, community and primary health centres were busy in Covid-19 vaccination. Dr O P Yadav, senior child specialist, said, “Immunization among children aged 1-2 years is life-saving. Children have low immunity and vaccines help them form a protective shield against various diseases. If immunization is not taking place at the government centres, parents can get vaccines from the market and get them administered to their children after consulting a doctor.” Kasganj chief medical officer Anil Kumar said, “Following a district-wide survey covering 2,13,219 homes from September 7 to 16, all unimmunized pregnant women and children have been identified. No health complications have been reported in these cases. Covid-19 caused hindrance in the routine immunization programme.

The searches were conducted in Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jaipur, Delhi and Gurgaon and I-T officials recovered incriminating evidence pertaining to tax evasion. They also seized Rs 1.8 crore in cash and kept 11 lockers under prohibitory order. Sood was unavailable for comment over the phone. The I-T press note stated, “Investigations so far have revealed the use of twenty such entries, the providers of which, on examination, have accepted on oath to have given bogus accommodation entries. They have accepted to have issued cheques in lieu of cash. There have been instances where professional receipts have been camouflaged as loans in the books of accounts for the purpose of evasion of tax. It has also been revealed that these bogus loans have been used for making investments and acquiring properties.” The I-T press note stated that the infrastructure company was involved in bogus billing of subcontracting expenses and siphoning off funds. It said, “Evidence of such bogus contracts found so far are to the tune of over Rs 65 crore. Further, it has been unearthed that the infrastructure company has entered into a dubious circular transaction to the tune of Rs 175 crore with an infrastructure company based in Jaipur. Further investigations are being carried out to establish the full extent of tax evasion.” Recently, Sood was in the news after his meeting with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, where he was declared brand ambassador of the AAP government’s ‘Desh ke mentors’ programme for guiding students in making career choices. During the lockdown, Sood had helped migrants reach their native places by arranging transportation and food. After the I-T department initiated its searches on Wednesday, Kejriwal came out in his support, tweeting that there are many difficulties on the path of truth, but it always wins. “With Sonu Sood ji, there are prayers of lakhs of families of India who got his support in difficult times,” he wrote. The Shiv Sena also came out in support of Sood and linked the I-T searches with the actor’s decision to become brand ambassador for the Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/soods-infra-co-involved-in-bogus-billing-i-t-dept/articleshow/86330828.cms||Vijay V Singh

The youth who shot himself in the head was the son of one of the five suspects in the corporator's murder. The incident occurred on Saturday morning when police were about to hold a press conference on Ansari's murder. The suicide note smeared in blood is addressed to his mother and seeks forgiveness for taking the extreme step. “I cannot see your tears and bear the thought of the kind of torture my father must be going through. Please forgive me. I am feeling very weak because of all this and cannot bear it,” the note read. Mohd Fatehyab, the deceased’s father, said, “All this has happened because of the police. For the last 14 days, they have been frequently calling and torturing me. At times, they also retained me at the police station for days. There are 4-5 people more like me. I was Ansari’s partner and hence police are trying to frame me. I had told the police my family members would not be able to handle this but they didn’t listen.” Meanwhile, police have denied the allegation. Vineet Bhatnagar, SP (city), said, “Police torturing Ansari’s murder suspects is a rumour.

Whether living alone or with a family, every minute on the street after dusk is fraught with danger. “There have been instances where unknown men linger around till all street dwellers are asleep and then lie down next to a woman,” said Brijesh Arya of Homeless Collective, an umbrella outfit representing groups working for the homeless. “Many homeless women do not venture out to public toilets throughout the night out of fear of being stalked or groped,” he added. According to the 2011 census, Mumbai has a population of 57,416 homeless people. The same year, a study by non-profit BUILD covering 300 homeless respondents, showed that women are at a greater disadvantage in all aspects. Around 77% female respondents had faced abuse compared to 46% men. The average earning of a woman was as low as Rs 121. The study also showed that a majority of homeless did not beg for a living and had stayed on the streets for over 20 years. Apart from seasonal and informal sector workers who do not earn enough for an urban home, Mumbai’s homeless women—living on pavements, railway platforms, under flyovers, inside concrete pipes and other open spaces —include many that ran away from home after facing violence from family or by a trafficker. Some are mentally ill who were either abandoned or lost their way. “We’ve come across instances where women were put on a train by families after they found it difficult to cope with their treatment. That’s why you’ll find a higher number of homeless mentally ill women around railway terminus,” said Mohammed Tarique, director of Koshish, a TISS project on homelessness. “These women take to the streets where they are often picked up by the police under the Prevention of Begging Act and sent to a beggars’ home whereas what they need is medical intervention,” said Tarique. When eventually released these women are worse off because they’re back on the streets untreated and more vulnerable to abuse. One of the reasons why instances of rape or molestation go unreported among homeless women, is the “prejudiced perception” that it’s their lifestyle. To a layman, what may appear as infidelity is actually life under tremendous duress. “Often a woman living alone or with a child on the streets finds a man who can provide some security to her. It doesn’t mean they’re in love but that she’s not available for others. The choice is about being abused by the same person repeatedly or by different people on different days,” said Tarique. When everyday survival is a challenge for a homeless woman — seen as a nuisance by the police and municipal authorities — seeking help from state agencies is not an easy option. Sharda*, who lives on a south Mumbai pavement, has made endless trips to the police station after an undertrial released from jail during the pandemic started living on the same pavement as her and later took off with her young daughter. “We don’t have a mechanism to proactively provide support to the victim. So, one just waits for crimes to happen for machinery to be activated,” says Tarique, rueing the inadequacy of shelters. According to SC guidelines, cities with a population of more than 5 lakh should have homeless shelters for 100 persons and one shelter per one lakh population. Going by this, Mumbai should have at least 125 shelters but presently has only 19. Ujjwal Uke, head of the state level Shelter Monitoring Committee, said availability of land is one of the key issues for shelter construction in Mumbai. “We have had a meeting with municipal commissioner IS Chahal who has offered to study the model of Rain Basera (night shelters) of Delhi,” Uke said. Though the Mumbai Police has introduced ‘Nirbhaya Squads’ that will intensify patrolling crime hotspots, it may not be enough to resolve the plight of homelessness and help the women recover. “We need to find a strategic way that civil society, state machinery and police can work together,” warned Nandita Shah of Akshara Centre. The movement to bring gender concerns to the city’s built environment has been a long and arduous one since 2013 when women’s groups started lobbying for gender inclusion in the planning infrastructure. An entire chapter titled ‘Gender, Special Groups and Social Equity’ was finally added by BMC to the city’s Revised Draft Development Plan (RDDP) 2034 and notified by the state in 2018. “There’s been a big demand for night shelters for women which aren’t just government homes where they are locked up but a safe space for them at night,” said Shah who steered the gender inclusion campaign. “There’s an allocation for it in the RDDP but it needs to be activated.” (*names changed)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-shelter-for-homeless-women-for-whom-each-day-is-fraught-with-risks/articleshow/86330856.cms||Nitasha Natu

Two men, both residents of Bhot town of Uttar Pradesh, who were found to have bought the reptiles from fishermen in Rampur, were arrested. The accused were identified as Vishal Kumar and Pawan Kumar. “Vishal said they had plans to sell the turtles in Kantopa village along Kashipur road,” said sub inspector, Dineshpur, Naveen Joshi. On Saturday, police received a tip off about two men with rare species of turtles who would be visiting Dineshpur on a bike. Cops and forest department officials started checking all vehicles coming to the area. When signalled to stop, the bike with the two accused tried to escape and were nabbed. A case under Wildlife Protection Act 1972 was lodged at Dineshpur police station and the turtles were handed over to officials. Found in wetlands and water bodies, the Indian Softshell Turtle, or “Nilssonia gangetica”, is listed as “endangered” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. According to IUCN, its population is on the decline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/8-turtles-of-rare-species-rescued-in-us-nagar-2-held/articleshow/86326967.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Kochi||Study sees surge in Kochi mercury levels||KOCHI: A study by the World Resources Institute (WRI) on the city’s vulnerability to climate change finds that at least 31% of the city’s population is exposed to temperatures above 30 degrees on an average. The report gains relevance as the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) has indicated that climate change has set in and warned of a sea-level rise for coastal cities, including Kochi. It noted that mercury levels are consistently higher than earlier years. It looked at city temperatures in various local areas from 2017-2020 using satellite remote sensing data. Core city areas like Edappally, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Ernakulam market, Cochin Shipyard, Changampuzha park, Mangalavanam, Mattancherry and Fort Kochi had average temperatures varying from 29 to 32 degrees even in winters, which is normally when there is no cloud cover. The report which is part of documenting ‘Vision for a Resilient Kochi’ points out that drought and flood risks are a concern too. While the campaign for green and open spaces has been taken up by several NGOs, it had only been paper promises for authorities in most neighbourhood local bodies apart from the Kochi corporation. WRI’s resource person in Kochi Aparna Vijayakumar said that only 0.4 percent of the total area of the local body has open and green spaces. “Open spaces are key indicators to ensure a healthy and inclusive city. They are also imperative for vulnerable communities to seek refuge in times of disaster,” she said. “Though the satellite images of Kochi show lots of green areas, in truth most of these are wild shrubs. We have found very few spaces which have trees that can be looked at as urban forestry or tree canopy,” said Achu Shekar of WRI-India. The city which is exposed to heat and flooding has 47% built-up cover and 26% of the population live on the flood plains. It has remained vulnerable to sudden rainfall events since 2018. Areas of south Kochi and southern Fort Kochi with high population are highly susceptible to flooding. “It is not surprising considering that people are in a hurry to cut down trees and plant exotics. As a member of the district tree cutting committee, I have often found that if a member opposes the cutting plan, then the committee will just meet without that person and clear the project,” said CM Joy, an environmentalist and former member of Ernakulam tree cutting committee. He said that beyond trees, one of the greatest carbon sinks have been mangroves, which have been part of the Kochi city and its water-bound areas including islands. “We don’t realize its value. It not only tolerates salinity but also helps in preventing sea surges and capturing greenhouse gases,” Joy said. With Kochi becoming part of the global cities fighting climate change, it has become important for the city administrators to plan projects giving importance to climate resilience and will need to work with agencies recognized by the environment ministry and urban affairs ministry to put documents in place for funding agencies to clear projects for urban development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-sees-surge-in-city-mercury-levels/articleshow/86328987.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Hasan was present in the court. A local had lodged a complaint against the SP MP Hasan and veteran SP leader Azam Khan in Civil Lines police station in Rampur, in 2019. Khan had defeated the actor-turned-politician in the Lok Sabha polls here. The alleged remark was made during one of the poll meetings in Moradabad. A video of the incident was widely shared on social media. A case was also registered against Azam Khan, his son Abdullah Azam, former SP district president from Sambhal, Firoz Khan, former chairman of Rampur nagar palika Azhar Khan and one other person in the matter. The complainant, Mustafa Hussain, a resident of Rampur, had last month moved the MP/MLA court, seeking collection of the voice sample from the viral video for verification and to ascertain the authenticity of it. The court had granted permission for this, following which, the samples were sent to the forensics department in Lucknow. Advocate Shahnawaz Naqvi, who is representing Azam Khan in the case, said, “The reports of the samples that were collected and sent for verification have arrived. The reports have suggested the voice in the video to be of ST Hasan. However, it is a long-term process as there is still lack of evidence in the case. There’s no eyewitness. The charges are yet to be framed.” Advocate Naqvi added, “Feroz Khan, former SP district president from Sambhal, Azhar Khan and few others were not present in the court. The court has now fixed September 20 as the next date of hearing.” Since the court has summoned SP MP Azam Khan, Sitapur jail authorities, where Khan is currently lodged, will also be informed about the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/derogatory-remark-against-jaya-prada-forensic-report-verifies-voice-sample-to-be-of-sp-mp-st-hasan/articleshow/86326970.cms||Maria Khan
---||Kochi||Roy, a popular editor & a consummate activist||The last of the veterans in Malayalam journalism, with the possible exception of P Rajan, has left the arena, leaving memories of a colourful and exuberant life. In his varied career, K M Roy was an editor, columnist, teacher, orator, trade union leader and, surprisingly, a hesitant politician. He was a legend of yore with many facets. Roy, during his college days, was a disciple of Mathai Manjooran. He was initiated to journalism through “Kerala Prakasam”, a daily edited by Manjooran, and Manjooran’s Kerala Socialist Party was his novitiate in politics. Roy could have chosen either of the two as his career but he preferred to be a journalist. He tried his hand in Malayalam and English with equal felicity. After a stint at “Desabandhu”, he joined “The Hindu” and later, the news agency UNI. Roy is best remembered for his association with “Mangalam” daily. He wrote a popular column for more than two decades which contributed to the immense success of “Mangalam” weekly. I used to describe it as palliative in nature offering much needed solace to readers in time of distress. The weekly, for a while surprisingly surpassed the circulation of the number one weekly in Malayalam. When the publishers decided to launch a daily in the highly competitive and murky newspaper market in the state, Roy became its general editor and he made the nascent newspaper, without any political or community backing, readable and at times, sensational. Roy is best remembered by the journalistic fraternity for his role as trade union leader. He made the Kerala Union of Working Journalists a robust organization of journalists with tremendous bargaing power. From my experience I can say it is not so easy to organize journalists and make them a militant force. For a while, he was the general secretary of Indian Federation of Working Journalists. A flamboyant personality with an extraordinary flair for hilarious conversation, Roy was able to break the ice with ease. Tight lipped tongues will be loosened to confide in him. He had a trove of amusing and ingenuous anecdotes relating to politics and politicians of every hue. He was close to them all. I persuaded him to chronicle them but he could not proceed because of the stroke. It was most painful to see Roy lying in helpless silence but keeping the smile that lit his face intact. Roy’s bohemian ways were endearing to all. The alumni at Kerala Media Academy remember him as a venerable teacher. He was friend, philosopher and guide to all. His political legacy inherited from his mentor, Mathai Manjooran, ended with a term in the Cochin Corporation Council. But his enthusiasm was always brimming. He organized a protest, which caught attention because of its novelty, at the site where the Cochin Shipyard now stands. A thousand ships were launched in the backwaters all made of paper in protest against the delay in starting the construction of the shipyard. Roy was one of the evictees from the site. He can be compared with Pothan Joseph who, while keeping his reputation as a great editor, was also actively involved in organizing the journalists. Joseph was instrumental in the enactment of the Working Journalists’ Act in 1955. Like Joseph, Roy was also a popular editor, vivacious writer and a consummate activist, apart from a leader. Comparisons do not stop here. Roy was pungent but he never hurt anyone. Malice to none was his motto. He always remained popular and wanted by all. He was a man for all seasons but he knew his limits and limitations. In 1997, CPM wanted him to contest as an LDF candidate in the by-election to Lok Sabha. His disinclination proved to be a godsend for me. If willing, instead of me, he would have been the MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/roy-a-popular-editor-a-consummate-activist/articleshow/86329018.cms||---

This was the profile of Kavita Bakre just 24 months ago. Several surgeries, physiotherapies, ayurveda medicine and what not, she tried everything for years together. Finally, she realized that the root cause of all her ailments was her diet. She went to a nutritionist and got her diet plan fixed. Along with a proper nutritious diet and exercise, Bakare became fit and fine within a year. Eventually, she also got interested in the nutrition and diet field and completed her formal education to become a clinical nutritionist. Now, she heads a firm that provides nutrition advice. With September being the ‘National Nutrition Month’, TOI spoke to Bakare who claimed that the combination of a proper diet and exercise can reverse any ailment and make you fit. Excerpts... Q. What kind of health complications did you have? A. The list is long. The clinical names of the diseases I had are not even known to many. In a nutshell, I had more than 15 diseases. There was a time in my life, around two years ago, when it was impossible for me to stand up and walk. The pain was tremendous. Vascular, muscular, and orthopedic pain coupled with obesity and hypertension had made my life difficult when I was just in my forties. My blood reports were worse. Doctors once said that my reports were like a 70-year-old woman when I was just 40. Q. Were you having complications since childhood? A. No, I was an athlete in school and had won several medals too. All my disorders started due to a changed lifestyle. Most women in our middle-class households suffer from back pain, joint pain and similar types of pains, especially after delivery. Unfortunately, we ignore this pain and put restrictions on our movements. Even I was like that. After my two kids were born, I was busy with my family and kept neglecting pains and ailments. I stopped exercising and my eating habits worsened. I gained excess weight and other diseases followed. Then started the tests, medicines and physiotherapy, but nothing worked for me. Q. When did you realize that a nutritious diet can be the solution? A. I went on taking medicines, going for therapy and also underwent several surgeries. Despite these treatments, the pain and complications continued. One fine day, I decided that I will come out of this pain, whatever it may take. While we visit specialist doctors, right from orthopaedics to the cardiologists, we hardly think about paying a visit to a dietician or a nutritionist. I was lucky to get a good nutritionist who planned by food intake. My sufferings were so intense that I followed the diet chart dedicatedly. Within months, I started feeling the difference. Gradually, I started light exercises along with the diet. The change became visible in a year. Q. When did you decide to become a nutritionist? A. As good food became my medicine, I developed an interest in this subject. I came to know that nutrition is a specialized field of study and many universities and institutes offer distance learning courses. During lockdown, I joined two such courses and got certificates. I decided to start my own nutrition consultancy, especially for home makers. Q Do you believe that diet can reverse diseases? A. Most diseases are caused due to lifestyle problems. Most of them can be reversed if you eat well and exercise properly. Some of us eat too much while others don’t eat properly. Even the term ‘diet’ is mistaken as ‘fasting’ or ‘starvation’ by most of us. We need to understand it properly. Every person is different and every person’s nutritional needs are different. A proper plan for individuals can definitely make them healthy and fit. Q. Should people visit nutritionists or dieticians like the way they visit doctors? A. I think you should visit a nutritionist even before developing any illness. When I started my practice as a nutritionist, my parents, both senior citizens, became my clients. Within three months, they are feeling more active and cheerful. It’s not just weight loss. In fact, we never think about weight loss. We think about a proper diet while planning the chart. Weight loss happens automatically. Being healthy and fit is anytime better than being slim or skinny. Q. What’s your advice to home makers? A. Don’t neglect everyday pain. The pain will spread across the body and gradually you will become seriously ill. If you have pain, treat it right, then and there. Secondly, our eating habits must change. I have seen many women eating more just to consume excess food and stop wastage. This is the biggest nonsense. Eat right, exercise well and don’t hide any ailment. See a doctor at an early stage and you will be fine within months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nutrition-exercise-can-bring-one-back-from-critical-health-conditions/articleshow/86329034.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Giving details, Amit Kumar Anand, superintendent of police, Moradabad, said Ubaid had confessed to killing Zahid (26) as the latter was unhappy over his brother marrying the accused’s sister. “The accused revealed that his sister, Anam, and Shahbuddin were in a relationship. When their families got to know about the love affair, they met and decided that the duo would be married in two months. However, last Sunday, Ubaid had called Shahbuddin and his relatives at his place, where the couple’s nikah was solemnized.” This was not liked by Zahid who had a showdown with Ubaid. Their families intervened and the matter was settled or so it seemed, the SP said. But when Ubaid saw Zahid in the Katghar area on Friday evening, his simmering anger turned into a rage and he stabbed the latter multiple times, said Anand. Ubaid was arrested and booked for murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dispute-over-marriage-cause-of-e-rick-drivers-murder-police/articleshow/86327009.cms||Maria Khan

Sources said that a team is still in Chandigarh trying to trace Singh, so that they could execute the warrant on him. The next date of hearing by the commission is on Monday. The CID on Monday initiated the process of issuing a bailable warrant against Singh as per the directions of the Justice Chandiwal commission set up by the state government to probe Singh’s allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. If Singh fails to appear before the commission on Monday, the commission could use other legal options like obtaining a non-bailable warrant issued against him. Singh has been on medical leave since April. This is the first time in the Maharashtra police force’s recent history that a warrant has been issued in the name of a serving IPS officer for securing his presence. The state government on March 30 appointed a single-member commission headed by the former Bombay high court judge to probe the allegations that Singh made in a letter to the governor and the chief minister immediately after he was removed from the police commissioner’s post. Singh had alleged that former home minister Anil Deshmukh had set a target of mobilising Rs 100 crore from restaurants and bar owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cid-unable-to-locate-ex-cp-at-homes-in-mumbai-cgarh/articleshow/86330933.cms||---

This vaccine was introduced by the Government of India in 2017 and was expanded to five states. As a part of phased introduction, PCV will be expanded nationwide this year. The PCV introduction will not only reduce the burden of pneumonia due to Pneumococcal Pneumonia but will also address equity issues thereby strengthening the collaborative efforts to reduce under-five mortality. The director of health services (DHS) requested the state government to provide sanction to introduce the PCV in the state under UIP, according to the guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare. The DHS had reported that as per the expansion plan, 19 states have introduced PCV in 2021 and therefore it is available now in 25 states total with nearly 75% of India’s infant cohort having opportunity to access PCV under UIP free of cost to the state. In these circumstances, the state government has now accorded sanction for introducing the PCV in the state under universal immunization programme (UIP). It has been decided to begin this vaccination from October itself in the state. Three doses of vaccines have been planned for the children at the age of one-and-a-half months, three-and-a-half months and nine months. The training for the medical officers and the nursing staff for administering this vaccination is going on in the state. It has been proven that this vaccine prevents the serious pneumonia among the children and provides immunity at the early age. The health department has made it clear that this vaccine is safe and the vaccination is followed by only a mild fever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anti-pneumonia-jab-to-be-used-in-state/articleshow/86329044.cms||---

The survivor, a resident of Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, alleged that police turned her away and refused to lodge an FIR in the matter after the incident on Tuesday. “For three days, I visited the thana, but the FIR was not filed. It was only after the intervention of the Bijnor superintendent of police that a case was registered on Friday evening,” the survivor told TOI. Three people have been booked under sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. The accused are yet to be arrested. According to the woman’s complaint, she had gone to Sabalpur village in Nangal area to attend wedding rituals of her friend who works as an AC mechanic in Delhi’s Mukundpur. “We have known each other for over a year. He is like a brother to me,” said the survivor. On September 14, the survivor left the village after attending the festivities and was waiting for a bus to take her to Bijnor city. “A car with three occupants offered me a lift. I wanted to reach the city at the earliest so I went with them. They stopped the car in a deserted area and gangraped me at knifepoint. A farmer heard my cries for help. The three fled when he ran towards us,” said the survivor in her complaint. The woman said the farmer identified all three accused. She then returned to the village and told her friend about the incident. “I had injuries on my body. (My friend) accompanied me to the Nangal police station, but policemen told us to go away. It was only after members of a right-wing organisation got involved that the FIR was registered on orders of the Bijnor SP on September 17,” she said. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh told TOI the survivor’s medical examination was conducted on Friday and her statement recorded before a magistrate on Saturday. “Family of one of the accused has claimed that he has been framed due to a political rivalry. We are investigating the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/delhi-bpo-worker-offered-lift-gangraped-by-3-in-up/articleshow/86327033.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Varanasi||CM unveils first prototype of Kanpur, Agra Metro projects||Revised: RE Gorakhpur: The flagship Metro rail projects in Kanpur and Agra are expected to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi by the end of November. This was announced by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath while unveiling the first prototype Metro train for the two cities virtually from Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur on Saturday. The development comes after the successful run of Metro in Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in the state. Yogi said that the detailed project reports (DPRs) for five other major cities — Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Merrut and Jhansi -- are in their last leg. “Metro is the need of the hour and it will prove to be a milestone in the development of Agra and Kanpur. It is a matter of time when five more cities will also have this safe, convenient and affordable mode of public transportation,” he said while congratulating the officials of the UP Metro Corporation and M/s Alstom Transport India Limited. He said that with the help of Metro rail service, the PM’s vision of a self-reliant India was also being realized. The CM on the second day of his visit to Gorakhpur, held a janta darbar at Gorakhnath temple and listened to the grievances of people and instructed the officials for speedy disposal. According to UP Metro Rail Corporation, the two Metro trains will have the feature of ‘regenerative braking’, with the help of which up to 45% of the energy through the brakes applied in the trains will be regenerated and used again in the system. These trains will also have a state-of-the-art propulsion system to reduce air pollution. These trains will have a carbon-di-oxide sensor-based air conditioning system, which will run according to the number of passengers present in the train and will save energy. The passenger capacity of Kanpur Metro trains will be 974 passengers and it will have a design speed of up to 90 km/hr. The first and last coach of the train will have a separate space for wheelchairs for divyangjan. The trains will also have fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, etc. These trains have been designed on the basis of state-of-the-art fire and crash safety standards. Every train will have CCTV cameras, the video feed of which will directly reach the train operator and the centre security room. Every train will also have USB mobile phone charging points and LCD screens or panels for infotainment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-unveils-first-prototype-of-kanpur-agra-metro-projects/articleshow/86330930.cms||---

Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar issued an order in this regard on Saturday.  The order comes two days after JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy and former minister Sa Ra Mahesh urged the government to rein in bureaucrats who speak against legislators and their fellow officers. It may be recalled that Mahesh and the then Mysuru DC Rohini Sindhuri locked horns publicly over a swimming pool built on the premises of the DC’s residence. Both had issued statements against each other in the media. “The officers must speak to the media only with regard to programmes of their respective department and that too when it is absolutely necessary,” the order said. The order also banned officials from using their personal social media handles to tell people about their department’s programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-order-bans-officials-from-issuing-press-statements/articleshow/86328687.cms||---

However, instead of using alcometers, all 46 riders/drivers were subjected to blood tests. To decide on which riders/drivers need to be subjected to medical tests, police relied on pre-alcometer era technique: the personnel on duty sniffing people. “Once we could smell alcohol on them, we took them to a government hospital for the test. Following the doctor’s report that the samples tested positive for alcohol, we booked them,” Kuldeep Kumar Jain, deputy commissioners of police (traffic), said. Although the department wanted to resume drink-and-drive checks earlier this year, it was put off on account of a raging second wave. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda said: “In recent times, the city has been witnessing fatal road accidents and most of them occur at night or early morning. Some of them could be the result of drunk driving or driving under the influence of drugs.

Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) managing director Kumar Keshav and Alstom managing director Alain Spohr were present in Savli during the flagging off ceremony. The trial of Kanpur Metro is very likely to commence from November 15, exactly two years after the launch of the Metro construction in the Industrial city. However, for Kanpur denizens, Metro operations will commence in January next year. The first Tetro train set is heading towards Kanpur via road route and after reaching here it would be stationed at the Metro depot constructed at the Government polytechnic. Each set of Metro trains has three bogies and would be able to accommodate over 950 persons. In the first phase, Metro will run between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel. The priority corridor between which Kanpur Metro will run is nine-kilometre-long and will have nine stations. The CM said, “Uttar Pradesh is having the highest number of operational Metro Projects in various cities — Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida. Besides operating Metro services in Lucknow, UPMRC is currently executing Metro projects in Kanpur and Agra. The Uttar Pradesh government is also planning to have Metro projects in the cities of Gorakhpur, Meerut, Varanasi, Allahabad and Jhansi in coming years. Gorakhpur Metro’s DPR has already been approved by the state government and is expected to be approved by the central government soon.” The CM congratulated the UPMRC team for timely delivery of trains in less than 14 months (from the date of awarding the contract) in spite of Covid pandemic prevailing since the last one and a half years. He also congratulated the manufacturer Alstom India for ensuring timely delivery of trains in spite of serious challenges in getting the materials from different parts of India and across the globe in spite of serious impact due to Covid. Kumar Keshav, MD, UPMRC who was present at the Savli plant, congratulated the entire team of UPMRC and Alstom on this occasion. He highlighted that a number of steps were taken to complete the train manufacturing in record time. Earlier UPMRC finalised the integrated contract for Metro trains (rolling stocks) and signalling system to save time. Further, the train design was finalised early after a series of web based close interactions with the German team of manufacturers even during Covid period. Total 39 trains for Kanpur and 28 for Agra, each consisting of three coaches for Kanpur Metro are being manufactured by M/s Alstom in India in view of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ missions, projected by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We are proud to deliver the first metro trains for Kanpur Metro in record time. After successfully delivering Rolling Stock andSignalling solutions for the state’s capital Lucknow, we are happy to strengthen this partnership with UPMRC and redefine the mobility needs of Kanpur & Agra” said Alain Spohr, MD, Alstom India. “Our MOVIA metros are world renowned for their operational reliability, appealing design and enhanced safety features – everything that makes metro an attractive mode of transport,” he added. Inspiration from Uttar Pradesh’s rich cultural heritage combined with best-in-class design has resulted in an attractive look for India’s latest Metro fleet. Aerodynamic modular design of the new metros will offer a host of safety, security and environmental benefits along with great passenger experience. Built with stainless-steel car bodies, the air-conditioned cars will have automated sliding doors, comfortable seating and standing spaces, dedicated areas for entry of specially abled, who use wheelchairs and modern passenger information systems, combining to provide an accessible and welcoming environment for passengers. After successful trials and approvals, the priority section of nine kilometres between IIT and Motijheel is planned to be opened for the public in January-2022 after detailed inspection and approval of all facilities and systems by the commissioner of Metro Railway Safety (CMRS). Kanpur Metro is expected to be the fastest built Metro project in India after starting construction works from November 15, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/first-metro-train-set-for-kanpur-flagged-off-in-gujarats-savli/articleshow/86330977.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Meerut||Not convinced just one man, that too drug addict, could have raped her, says kho-kho player's family||Bijnor: Days after Uttar Pradesh Police claimed to have cracked the brutal rape and murder case of a national kho-kho player by arresting a "drug addict", her family, dissatisfied with the probe, said the police investigation was simply an eyewash with a lot of loopholes. They staged a protest at the district magistrate’s (DM) office on Saturday demanding a proper investigation either by CB-CID or a central agency like CBI. “Our daughter was a sportswoman. She was strong. It is difficult to believe that one man, that too a drug addict, could overpower her. More men may have been present. Her mobile is still missing,” her family said. The family and a few local leaders handed over a memorandum to DM Umesh Mishra, addressed to the UP governor and state chief minister. The 24-year-old Dalit woman was on her way home from a job interview at a private school in Bijnor when she was waylaid, brutalised and killed. Her body was left among a pile of cement railway sleepers. Her face had been battered. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh, however, dismissed the family's allegations. “The accused, Shahjad, has confessed to his crime. Shahjad works as a labourer, unloading goods from trains. He is addicted to smack and alcohol. He was aware of the woman's shorter route home by the railway tracks,” the SP said. “On September 10, the day of crime, there was no work at the station. Shahjad took some smack and was sitting next to a pile of railway sleepers when the woman passed by around noon. In an attempt to rape her, he dragged her away. When she struggled, he panicked and strangled her with a rope. She died,” the Bijnor SP added. The murder mystery was "solved" with the discovery of the rope, a shirt with two missing buttons and a slipper, police said. The 26-year-old man belongs to Adampur village. He is married and has a two-month-old daughter. He was arrested and booked under sections 376 (rape), 302 (murder), 201 (concealing evidence) and 511 (offences punishable with life or other imprisonment) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/not-convinced-just-one-man-that-too-drug-addict-could-have-raped-her-says-kho-kho-players-family/articleshow/86327052.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Varanasi||Govt trying it best to realise Ambedkar’s dream of social justice: Nadda||VARANASI: Mobilising the party’s Scheduled Caste wing, Anusoochit Jati Morcha, for intensified Dalit outreach programme ahead of the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and four other states, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Sunday said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying his best to realise the dreams of Dr BR Ambedkar, but by opposing moves like Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the Opposition is hurting the scholar’s dreams of social justice.” Virtually inaugurating the two-day national executive meeting of Anusoochit Jati Morcha organized at Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre at Lalpur here on Saturday, Nadda said, “Ambedkar wanted that the Dalits left in Pakistan during partition should return. To solve the issue of citizenship for such Dalits, who faced harassment in Pakistan, PM Modi brought CAA which will prove to be an effective tool for the purpose. SC labourers in J&K will also get equal rights with the help of CAA. However, by protesting the Citizenship Act, the opposition is crushing the dreams of Ambedkar.” “Modi government is in the process of materializing the Ambedkar’s vision of social justice by ensuring SC/STs and OBCs their constitutional rights, said Nadda,” adding, “The party’s slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas is the guiding force for the welfare of all. However, the opposition parties are playing the caste card and still considering the scheduled caste community as their vote bank.” “People in country are fed up with the castiest politics of the Opposition. Due to this, they joined BJP and made it the biggest political party of the world. BJP never believed in caste politics and always emphasized that the country’s development is possible only by ensuring development of all. The Central government formulated all its programmes by keeping the Dalits and deprived sections of society in focus. Same style of working remained evident in all BJP-ruled states as well, which brought Dalits close to BJP,” said Nadda. Highlighting Modi governments schemes and programmes, including Jan-Dhan, Ujjwala, sanitation, clean toilet, education, Stand-up scheme for entrepreneurship among Dalit youths, loan, Ayushman, employment generation, housing and others, Nadda asked the SC wing’s office-bearers and cadres to interact with people and talk to them about these schemes and their benefits. “Tell the people what could not happen in 70 years after independence, Modi government made it possible in only seven years,” he said. He also highlighted PM’s efforts for developing the places associated with Ambedkar as memorials in the country and abroad including Panch Tirtha. Earlier, the delegates of Anusoochit Jati Morcha from all states gathered at DDU-TFC, where a meeting of senior office-bearers took place before the inaugural session. The wing’s national president Lalsingh Arya said, “It is BJP’s philosophy to benefit people through government schemes and take action against atrocities on Dalits and other poor communities in those states where it is the opposition. Largescale atrocities are evident in states rule by Congress and left parties. Our scheduled caste wing will finalise a strategy in the next 3-4 months to launch agitation in these states.” Arya also attacked Bahujan Samaj Party, alleging, “Just for the greed of power, BSP joined hands with SP which had committed large scale atrocities on Dalits during its regime.” After discussing various issues in its agenda, the wing’s executive meeting will conclude on Sunday evening when chief minister Yogi Adityanath will address the valedictory session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/govt-trying-it-best-to-realise-ambedkars-dream-of-social-justice-nadda/articleshow/86330960.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Nagpur||5 docs’ widows seek paediatrician’s legal services to move SC for justice||Nagpur: Following his famous victories in the Maharashtra government vs Vidarbha Hospitals’ Association case about capping Covid and non-Covid charges, five widows of doctors have approached Dr Pradeep Arora to file a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court seeking Rs50 lakh compensation. A victory in the apex court will bring relief to 600 people across the country, said Dr Arora. Mumbai’s Dr Nilma Bhamare and Punjab’s Medico-Legal Action Group (MLAG) besides Dr Arora have joined the five widows in the SLP which is likely to be heard on October 18, 2021. Orders from respective local governing bodies to keep their clinics open and treat Covid patients have formed the locus standi for them beside the widows. In March last year, the Bombay high court had rejected the writ petition of Navi Mumbai resident Kiran Surgade who had sought the Rs50lakh cover for Covid warriors after her husband died of Covid infection. Surgade’s husband had to open his clinic following Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s order in epidemic times. Taking note of a Union health ministry letter, the HC had said that for private healthcare providers to be covered under the scheme, he or she must be ‘drafted’ for Covid-related responsibilities. Only private doctors whose services were “requisitioned” were covered under the scheme for Covid warriors, the Centre had told the state. “Claims of the rest of the four such widows who lost their husbands due to coercive order of the municipal commissioners of Aurangabad, Kolhapur and Mumbai were rejected on similar grounds by the public health department. They were following Mrs Surgade’s case and resigned to the situation. They were disappointed,” said Dr Arora. The Nagpur paediatrician, who would be appearing in-person, said doctors were put in a dangerous situation for the larger good to society. “Rs50lakh is a small compensation as far as a doctor’s life is concerned. When the state is compelling a person to do something which can be hazardous to his life, then it amounts to requisitioning only. In the order, they are not using the word, but it doesn’t mean the doctors were not requisitioned,” Dr Arora said. Dr Arora said the orders issued to the deceased doctors were one-sided. “Those were like Army and police orders. But those are governed by a special clause of the Constitution. They join the forces knowing well their life would be at risk. Same is not the case with doctors. We are on par with the other citizens and enjoy the same safety to life,” he said. Accordingly, the Union government had announced a compensation for Covid warriors. “By playing sophistry or using words like “unless it is a formal requisition” they are defeating the spiriting of the scheme,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-docs-widows-seek-paediatricians-legal-services-to-move-sc-for-justice/articleshow/86329049.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Heavy vehicles banned at Pardi Chowk to help speed up NHAI, Metro works||Nagpur: The city police on Saturday issued a notification prohibiting heavy vehicles at Pardi Chowk where traffic diversions and poor condition of roads due to the ongoing infrastructure works have made commuting a stiff challenge. Now, heavy vehicles coming from Hyderabad, Jabalpur, Raipur and other places would have to take a detour of around 30km. As per the latest notification issued by the traffic DCP Sarang Awad, heavy vehicles would not be permitted to enter Pardi till January 17 next year. This has been done to help the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and MahaMetro to complete their projects at the earliest. The NHAI is constructing a flyover whose bhoomipuja was performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014. The project was supposed to be completed in 2019 but it was extended to December 2021. Now, the NHAI has set a new deadline of January 2022. The chowk has earned a notoriety for massive traffic snarls and accidents due to erratic vehicular flow on bad roads interspersed with dug up stretches and trenches. Till August this year, the junction has witnessed nine deaths in eight fatal accidents while another 11 were injured in six serious accidents. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said decision was taken to divert the heavy vehicles to speed up the work spread across a 9km stretch. “A meeting with the public representatives, government agencies, private contractors and others was held last week in which traffic diversion was discussed. We told the private contractors to keep their equipment and materials ready so that the pending work can be completed on a war footing,” he said. BJP MLA from Nagpur east Krishna Khopde said the flyover at Pardi is a five-arm structure. “Heavy vehicles had to be prohibited to facilitate the work. There is no doubt that the work had suffered due to indifferent attitude of officials and private contractors but now it has gathered momentum and the project may be completed by year-end,” said Khopde. Some local people like NCP’s Ravinish Pandey, who has repeatedly agitated against the problems, term the junction a 'death trap' . “It takes one-and-a- half hour to travel from Prajapati Nagar chowk to Pardi. The local population has been suffering for last five years. We will now hit the roads in protest,” said Pandey. NL Yeotkar, project director of NHAI, said a rotary was planned at Pardi Chowk with two concrete roads. “Due to incessant rains, the project got delayed this year. A temporary concrete road was laid but it too got damaged in heavy rain,” said Yeotkar and added that now the work will be monitored daily to ensure it is expedited. MahaMetro is only carrying work at the Prajapati Nagar Metro while rest of the work is already over, according to its spokesperson. “The ongoing work will be completed by December. MahaMetro is taking all measures to minimize obstruction to traffic and ensure safety of motorists,” said the spokesperson. Sources said that the agencies are facing an uphill task in procuring permissions for digging and managing underground cables and pipelines of different utilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heavy-vehicles-banned-at-pardi-chowk-to-help-speed-up-nhai-metro-works/articleshow/86329058.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Deadline set for airport road work||Thiruvananthapuram: With the bad state of Shangumugham road causing many travel hassles, minister for transport Antony Raju directed the officials to complete the work within four months. The minister visited the site here on Saturday and assessed the progress of the construction. The government allotted Rs 6.39 crore under ‘rebuild Kerala initiative’ for the project. The minister directed the officials to prepare an estimate for extending the length of the diaphragm wall from 245 m to 330 metres. He said the work is being executed with the most advanced technology and is expected to withstand strong waves. At present the duration of construction is six months. The work has been delayed for months as the earth brought for transportation got swept away in coastal erosion. Passengers arriving at the airport have been bearing the brunt of the delay in completion of the work. They are being forced to walk with heavy baggage for a fairly good distance till they are able to get a taxi or auto to take them to their destination. The coastal residents are also having their share of concerns since this stretch is the main link between coastal villages and city markets. As the Shangumugham airport road has been blocked for months owing to the damaged condition, the residents have been on a protest mode. Social activists representing Shanghumugham airport road protection committee Madhu Nair and Elias John had staged a satyagraha in front of the secretariat on July 24 demanding immediate intervention of the state government in resolving the issue.  The passengers, including pregnant women and children, have to get off at Shangumugham and then walk all the way to the domestic terminal. Due to Covid situation, many people do not even make use of auto rickshaws. The residents of Shangumugham are even being deprived of medical care. The denial of access has also made life difficult for the fishermen community. In the meantime, the compound wall was partially demolished to make way for the staff at Cargo complex, the committee members said. They had put forward two demands; road shall be restored by the construction of a diaphragm wall along the beach or road shall be restored by acquiring some portion from the cargo complex and aligning it with the old road. The project estimate had to be revised in 2021, three years after the project was finalised to restore the Airport-Shangumugham road which got badly damaged owing to heavy monsoon and strong coastal erosion. The total project cost for two phases of the work has gone up from the initial estimate of Rs 5.39 crore to Rs 8.05 crore. The latest revision in estimate was due to a letter from the Chief Engineer (Roads), PWD. As per the letter, the work was awarded to the contractor in August 2020, however, as a result of the heavy sea attack at the site, scouring occurred and damage of the road extended up to the central line of the road. The soil beneath the road completely eroded which necessitated prohibition of traffic along the road. Since the sea waves reach the underside of the road, it badly affected the stability of the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/deadline-set-for-airport-road-work/articleshow/86329060.cms||---
---||Goa||Cobra takes train to Vasco, caught in port town||Keri: On Friday morning, a king cobra was rescued from the heart of Vasco town, surprising rescuers about how the venomous snake got there. According to wildlifers, the snake is mostly likely to have travelled on a goods train wagon. They suspect that the 1.5m long juvenile king cobra must have traversed at least 90km via a goods train to get to the port town, from the nearest forest. “I was quite surprised when I was informed about the presence of a king cobra in a busy town with meagre forest cover. The area where the snake was spotted is not even 200m away from the Londha-Vasco railway line. The snake must most probably have been on the wagon of a goods carrying train,” rescuer Benhail Antao said. The snake was spotted in the basement of the Thakkar House Building on Swatantra Path. A wildlife rescue team from Margao forest range rushed to the spot and rescued the snake, which was later released in the forest. King cobras are the world’s largest venomous snakes and are endemic to the forests in Southern and Southeast Asia. They prey chiefly on other snakes including their own species. The bite of the snake is fatal. “Presently, the king cobra is threatened mainly by destruction of its habitat owing to deforestation and expansion of human settlement, agriculture and other developmental activities. This king cobra may have entered the wagon of the train when it halted at the Castle Rock station that lies in the Kali Tiger Reserve and from there, travelled nearly 90km to Vasco,” Amrut Singh, President of the Bicholim animal rescue squad said. Margao range forest officer Prakash Naik, whose team rescued the snake, said, “Our rescue team successfully caught the king cobra from the building basement. This is the first time that we rescued a snake that has been listed as a vulnerable snake in the city area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cobra-takes-train-to-vasco-caught-in-port-town/articleshow/86331067.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

He further added that all the health staff have been congratulated for their hard work and unrelenting spirit which helped the department to achieve the target. The department had set a target to administer 1.24 lakh jabs on Friday on the occasion of the 71st birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Health officials, however, maintained that they would be intensifying the vaccination exercise in both rural and urban-based sites to cover maximum target recipients. Officials are also making efforts to cover recipients living in remote village areas and teams of ASHA and ANMs have been assigned to take the recipients to the nearest vaccination sites for vaccination. A senior health official said that the pace of vaccination has been gaining momentum with every passing month and that the department would be setting a new record in September again. Figures too revealed that over 3.03 lakh, 3.42 lakh and 5.18 lakh people were given jabs in June, July and August months respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sangam-city-witnesses-highest-single-day-vaccination-in-state/articleshow/86331030.cms||---

Lakhs of people are likely to participate in the Shobha Yatra. Hussainsagar, which is brimming with water due to the recent heavy rain, might witness the maximum number of idols and people converge for immersion during the nimajjan on Sunday. GHMC has made all the arrangements and deployed 200 ‘Ganesh Action Teams (GAT) with 8,000 sanitation workers to remove garbage and puja material likely to pile up on roads at immersion points across the city. A marathon exercise has been taken up by all major government departments for the past one week to ensure the immersion goes off peacefully. Over 150 static and another 60 mobile cranes have been put in place at nearly 30 water bodies, baby ponds and Hussainsagar to immerse the idols. As Sunday is a holiday, officials expect lakhs of people might converge on Hussainsagar to witness the Shobha Yatra of the 40-foot Khairatabad Ganesh. “A two-layer barricading for nearly 15 kilometres and water proof pandals at 15 locations have been put in place near Hussainsagar,” a senior GHMC official, monitoring arrangements, told TOI. On Saturday, welding works for a special trolley to lug the 35-ton plaster of Paris (PoP) Khairatabad Ganesh (Pancha Mukha Rurdra Maha Ganapathi) was completed. With just a few hours left for the immersions, thousands of people thronged the pandal on Saturday. “After completion of ‘Kalasha puja’, Shobha Yatra will begin at 9 am. We hope the immersion will be completed by 3 pm,” Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee member S Raj Kumar told TOI. On the other hand, Balapur Ganesh procession would start around 11 am after the laddu auction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-gears-up-for-ganesh-nimajjan/articleshow/86331059.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Mumbai||CBI, Jiah Khan’s mom pleas a clear abuse of process of law: Court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order refusing to grant CBI and Jiah Khan’s mother’s pleas for a further probe into her alleged suicide, a special court said relief claimed was nothing but a replica of earlier pleas on issues already decided by Bombay high court, indicating that applications before it were a clear abuse of the process of law. “ Instead of the clear position... these applications filed, which indicate that the complainant (Jiah’s mother Rabia) does not want to proceed further with trial, conduct appears deliberate and intentional to delay and procrastinate the trial. The alleged FIR registered in 2013 and since around eight years it awaits effective trial. Applications present before this court are not maintainable, but it is clearly an abuse of process of law,” special judge A S Sayyad said. Pancholi’s lawyer opposed the pleas and submitted relief sought by CBI and Rabia was decided “six times” by courts. The defence replied that CBI’s plea was in direct contempt of a 2017 HC order. It said Jiah’s mother had moved a plea in HC, making a similar plea, rejected in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-rejects-pleas-of-jiahs-mom-cbi-for-further-probe/articleshow/86331065.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Allahabad||Priyanka Gandhi will be face of upcoming UP polls: Khurshid||PRAYAGRAJ: The manifesto drafting panel of the Congress party, led by former union minister and senior Congress member Salman Khurshid, visited the city on Saturday. Khurshid said that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was the party’s leader and the face for the forthcoming UP polls. The Congress party would contest the assembly elections under her leadership, he added. When asked whether Priyanka would be the party’s chief ministerial candidate, Khurshid said she herself would take a decision on that issue. Khurshid was leading a delegation of Congress leaders in Sangam city on Friday with an aim to interact with the people as well as leaders of his Congress’ frontal organisations before the party prepares and releases the manifesto for the UP assembly elections-2022. The delegation included national secretary of All Indian Congress Committee, Bajirao Khande, Congress working committee member Pramod Tiwari and former MLA Anugrah Narayan Singh among others. Addressing media persons at a guest house in Kalyani Devi locality, Khurshid said, “Congress will be writing a new chapter of success in the 2022 UP polls, and will win more seats than expected.” Coming down hard on the BJP-led state and the central government, Khurshid said that the people were being cheated. “Unemployment is on the rise and atrocities against minorities have become frequent in the state,” he said. Making clear that the Congress would contesting the UP elections keeping in mind the needs and aspirations of the people, Khurshid said that his interaction with various sections of society had helped him understand their expectations and grievances. The interaction has also made it clear that the common man was angry with the ruling BJP, he added. Speaking about several political parties trying to woo members of certain castes, Khurshid said that Congress does not believe in caste and religion-based politics, and instead, tries to visit slums, interact with the poor and the farmers to understand their problems so that their aspirations can find a place in the Congress manifesto. Earlier, Khurshid arrived at the Bamrauli airport on Saturday and directly went to the slum near Bakshi Bandh in Daraganj. There, he and other senior Congress leaders interacted with the residents and inquired about their problems, challenges and hopes. He and his team also spoke to farmers, traders, women and students during their stay at Kalyani Devi. Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said that it was Congress which had actually worked for Dalits and the downtrodden. “The middle class and the poor are suffering today, and the ruling BJP has no answers to rising costs and people’s sufferings,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/priyanka-gandhi-will-be-face-of-upcoming-up-polls-khurshid/articleshow/86331062.cms||---

The fugitive Jahir Hussain turned himself in before the additional chief magistrate court around 12.30 pm on Saturday. He was accompanied by his wife and son. The magistrate later remanded him to judicial custody and sent him to prison. Jahir Hussain told the court that he escaped the prison to meet his family in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. He explained that it was his desire to meet his family, whom he had not seen in a very long time, which made him take the risk of escaping from the prison. The officers of Poojapura police station, who were searching for the fugitive, were also present in the court when the magistrate remanded him. The police said they will file an application before the court on Monday seeking his custody for interrogation to know how he staged the escape, how he reached Chennai, and also the circumstances that led him to return and turn himself in before the law. Jagir Hussain had escaped from the prison on September 7 when he was taken out of the maximum enclosure area that houses the prison blocks to work in the power laundry unit of the prison located in a relatively low secure region of the prison campus. Jahir Hussain is serving a life sentence for a murder and subsequent robbery he committed in the year 2004. In July, 2004, Hussain murdered his distant relative Shamsuddeen who worked for a precious stones dealer in the city. He strangled the victim to death with the help of his friend Jarook and decamped with Rs 5 lakh worth precious stones. Though he was arrested soon, he absconded a year later after getting out on bail. Then, the court went ahead with the trial of his accomplice Jarook, and sentenced him for life imprisonment. In 2009, the police caught Jagir Hussain from his girl friend’s place in Chennai. His trial commenced in 2017 and he was convicted in the same year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/escaped-murder-convict-surrenders-before-court/articleshow/86329087.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Motivated probe shows I’m not involved: Raj Kundra in fresh plea||MUMBAI: After a chargesheet was submitted by crime branch, in a fresh bail plea, businessman Raj Kundra, arrested in the pornography case, claimed “motivated” investigations clearly show that he was not involved in any offence even in the remotest way. Kundra’s bail plea submitted through advocate Prashant Patil said he was not even related to uploading or broadcasting of allegedly questionable content. The plea will come up for hearing on Monday. The plea said the case of the prosecution in the supplementary chargesheet was not that there are victims who were coerced or threatened by him. He submitted that no artist raised any grievance or alarms on alleged filming and broadcasting of erotic content. Kundra was arrested in July with his company’s IT head Ryan Thorpe. Kundra withdrew his earlier bail plea. Kundra’s bail plea said around February 2019, considering the popularity and scope of business of OTT platforms, Saurabh Kushwa insisted he invest in his venture, Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd (AMPL). Kundra said he accepted the proposal as a sleeping partner. He said he was associated with AMPL only till December 2019. Kundra’s plea said during this time he never took an active part in content creation. The plea said the Hotshots app created by AMPL has “nothing to do with pornography or content which is within the purview of an offence”. “There is not an iota of evidence till date with the prosecution that would connect the app of Hotshots with an offence under law,” the plea said. It said AMPL had nothing to do with pornographic content. “The case of the prosecution in the supplementary chargesheet is not that there are victims who were coerced or threatened by the present applicant (Kundra)... that none of the artists (clients of AMPL) raised any grievance or alarms with regards to the alleged filming and broadcasting of erotic content. By their own admission, their dispute is in respect of sharing of financial gains and consequential contractual obligation,” the bail plea said. It said statements of “so-called witnesses ” in the first chargesheet reflects that the victims were adults and they have voluntarily acted in “so-called video shootings”. “There is not a single allegation in the supplementary chargesheet against the applicant (Kundra) that he was actively involved in any video-shootings. In fact, it is a sole discretion of the individual artists to upload content on the app,” the plea said. It also said he was falsely implicated and made a scapegoat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/motivated-probe-shows-im-not-involved-kundra-in-fresh-plea/articleshow/86331098.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Nagpur||NMC illegally earned Rs2.6k cr in taxes, refund citizens: Thakre||Nagpur: West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre has alleged the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) illegally recovered Rs2,648.14 crore in taxes from citizens in the last over four years. He demanded that money collected be refunded to citizens as soon as possible and the taxes be discontinued. Thakre, also City Congress Committee president, has submitted breach of privilege against 26 civic chiefs of the state alleging he was denied appropriate information. He met CP Amitesh Kumar on Saturday to lodge a complaint and demanded officials of NMC be booked for “cheating citizens”. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the MLA said, “The state government on August 2, 2017 had issued a notification announcing monthly goods and services tax (GST) grant to all municipal corporations in lieu of abolishing all types of taxes. The Centre’s GST guidelines and state’s notification clearly mentioned that monthly GST grant will be given for providing basic amenities in the city.” As per Thakre, the NMC received Rs3,851.51 GST grant from the Centre between July 2017 and June 2021, and “yet it recovered Rs2,648.14 crore during the same period through advertisement, property, water, market and other types of taxes”. He said 26 other municipal corporations did the same. In June, Thakre said, he wrote to all the 27 municipal corporations inqiuring about provision for recovering taxes and revenue thus earned. “NMC and 25 other municipal corporations did not give appropriate information,” said Thakre and added that he then collected information from various sources. He threatened to aproach the judiciary if NMC and other municipal corporations do not refund the money. Besides GST guidelines and state’s notification, Thakre said he has a letter from Ahmednagar municipal corporation “which stopped recovering advertisement tax from August 1 after receiving my letter”, to prove his claims. He cited example of Amravati district court which on July 17, 2018, had ordered Amravati municipal corporation to stop recovering advertisement tax. “Allahabad High Court had directed Kanpur municipal corporation to return advertisement tax to the agencies on May 6, 2019. Similarly, Pune and two more municipal corporations stopped collecting advertisement tax. Similar decision is expected from other municipal corporations,” he said. While mentioning government’s notification dated August 20, 2021, directing disciplinary action against officials for not replying to letters of legislators, Thakre said that NMC did not give reply to his six letters. The legislator said the NMC action of attaching and auctioning properties is illegal because it has no right to recover property and other taxes. “The same holds true for action against advertisement agencies,” said Thakre. As per NMC officials, the civic body is only recovering advertisement fees and ground rent from agencies. There are no directives to discontinue property, water and other types of taxes, they said. On this, Thakre said he has copies of many letters the NMC had sent to the government mentioning that advertisement tax is being recovered. “The NMC even produced inflated revenue figures from advertisement to get hike in GST grant. It has never earned more than Rs5.5 crore per annum from advertisement. The NMC claimed it is expected to get Rs12 crore in 2017-18,” he said. MLC Abhijit Wanjari, corporators Sanjay Mahakalkar, Manoj Sangole and others were present at the press conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-illegally-earned-rs2-6k-cr-in-taxes-refund-citizens-thakre/articleshow/86329174.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Delhi: Locked out, they long to go back to Afghanistan||NEW DELHI: Mahram Amini arrived in New Delhi in the first week of August from Afghanistan’s Maymana intending to stay for just 10 days for a brain tumour surgery. She has been stuck in the city for over 40 days with her physically impaired husband, Syed Mohiddin, and nephew, Abdul Shoker. “We have spent around Rs 3 lakh on surgery, medicines, food and lodging and have now run out of money,” said Shoker. “Mahram’s son sold off his taxi in Afghanistan to arrange funds for her surgery and cannot send more money. The doctor advised a healthy diet for Mahram, but we cannot even arrange three square meals. We want to go back to Afghanistan.” The trio have rented a room in Lajpat Nagar’s Kasturba Niketan. If they get back to their country they can get help, he added, when there’s no one in Delhi to help them financially. After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, many people fled and others were desperate to do so. In contrast, scores of Afghans who are in India on medical visas want to return home. Ubaidullah, a native of Mazar-I-Sharif, reached Delhi around 45 days ago for the treatment of his five-year-old son, Zebiudullah Ziyaee, a neurological disorder patient, and his sister, Tahira Noori, a heart patient. He was accompanied by his pregnant wife Tayabi and a two-year-old son. “We have no money now to even buy medicines for my son and sister. We cannot even afford milk for my children. I booked tickets to return home on August 16, but the flight was cancelled after the Taliban overtook Kabul,” said Ubaidullah, whose wife gave birth to a premature daughter on August 29 due to stress. Noori said, “There is no point in staying in New Delhi as it is only adding to our expenses. We appeal to the Indian government to help make arrangements for our return home.” Many Afghans longing to return home have been making the rounds of the Afghan embassy. Maseehullah Hotak, 23, who came for a medical check-up, was exasperated by the lack of anything positive from his daily visits to the embassy.  “When I could not afford to pay the rent, the landlord evicted me. I am now sharing a small room with three others at a rent of Rs 500 per day. If I do not return to Afghanistan soon, I will be forced to sleep on the streets,” the youth said. Hotak’s roommate, Abdul Qadir, got his eyes damaged in an explosion in Afghanistan’s Paktia. Qadir, who can see only from his left eye, said, “My brother also came to New Delhi to help me with eye treatment. Our wives and children are alone back home. We both were in the police force but we hadn’t got salaries for some time and our families are struggling to survive. If we go home, we can work as labourers to support our families.” Though Ahmad Fahim Sadiq is in New Delhi along with his wife and children, he too is waiting for flights to resume. “Only the affluent want to flee Afghanistan,” he declared. “I have my house and job in Kabul and I have nothing in India.” Sadiq arrived in Delhi on July 7 for the treatment of his three-year-old kid. Some people who came to New Delhi on business and other purposes are also stuck. Cloth trader Ashabuuddin said, “I want to go back to my wife and eight minor children in Kabul. People who worked for the Afghanistan government or the United States want to flee, but people like us want to continue staying there.” Mohammad Nadir, 60, who came to Delhi for his cancer-stricken wife, Jamila, is desperate to go back to Afghanistan. “The Indian government, please help us,” the elderly couple pleaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/locked-out-they-long-to-go-back-to-the-homeland/articleshow/86332020.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Collapse of steel span may further delay SCLR extension||MUMBAI: Work on the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension, with a revised deadline of March 2022, is likely to be delayed further in the wake of Friday’s incident in which a steel span of the underconstruction bridge collapsed in Bandra-Kurla Complex. Work on the 3.8km-long elevated bridge had begun in 2016 with the original deadline in 2019. Metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said, “The project will get delayed further as the steel span will have to be procured again. Such steel span design girders take time to be designed and manufactured.” As this span has a sharp curvature, one made of steel was procured instead of concrete. The project was originally delayed because there was no right of way for construction of the bridge due to encroachments. Also, the bridge and the alignment of Metro 2B (D N Nagar to Bandra) overlap. The bridge design at this spot had to be tweaked, which led to loss of several man-hours too. Moreover, a Covid-induced lockdown led to the loss of crucial time. That apart, there was an acute shortage of labour during the stringent phase of the lockdown and the supply chain for construction material too had got impacted. MMRDA constituted a three-member expert committee comprising representatives from IIT-Bombay and VJTI to ascertain the cause of the collapse of this steel span in which 14 labourers suffered injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-collapse-of-steel-span-may-further-delay-sclr-extension/articleshow/86331143.cms||Manthank Mehta

The protesters led by former state secretary of Youth Congress Rahul Puglia shouted slogans and waved banners demanding rejuvenation of Irai. Puglia claimed that Irai is the key source of drinking water for Chandrapur city and irrigation of agricultural land around it. Having a large dam on it, the stretch of river skirting the city has virtually dried up. Due to the reluctance of the administration, the river has turned into a heap of dried up mounds and scattered wild shrubby vegetation. “There’s an immediate need for cleaning and deepening of the river ahead of Nagpur bridge’s confluence with the Wardha river. Presently, a small drain like stream flows through the riverbed, while the remaining part of the river bed is an upheaved stretch of dried land and scattered patches of vegetation,” Puglia said. He demanded beautification of the river bank and building of a barrage on it to raise the water level. Puglia pointed out that the mound developed during the construction of the large bridge on the river at Datala point has hindered the flow of the river. The shrubby patches in the bed too obstructs the flow. He demanded removal of the mounds and shrubs.

The order also stated that the police inaction was a joke on the court process. The fraud case was registered on December 28, 2018, but the Shimlapuri police neither arrested the accused nor submitted the challan. The FIR was lodged on the complaint of Rashpal Singh of Hoshiarpur against the accused identified as Jaswinder Singh, his brothers, Ajeb Singh and Darshan Singh, of Guru Nanak Colony-A, and friend Kulpreet Singh.

The anticipatory bail of the accused was also dismissed as withdrawn on July 9, 2019. Calling this inaction of the police as “basically a joke upon the court process and procedure”, the order stated that the salary of the investigating officer of the case and the SHO of the police station concerned should be stayed till the next hearing if arrests were not made till September 20. “The commissioner of police, Ludhiana, shall file his personal affidavit as to the date when the accused is arrested, as well as, qua the fact whether salary of the above said officials was, in fact, stopped or not,” the order said.Shimlapuri SHO sub-inspector Balkar Singh said he was aware of the order and the police were trying to trace the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/withhold-salary-of-sho-probe-officer/articleshow/86327313.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Mumbai||BMC has to stop herbicide spray in Powai lake: MPCB||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has written to the S ward of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to stop spraying any chemicals, such as glyphosate (a herbicide), in Powai lake as that is likely to disturb or affect crocodiles in it. MPCB has given these directions following a recent complaint by environmentalist of Vanashakti NGO, D Stalin, who had clearly stated that plants like water hyacinths were turning brown and dying due to spraying of glyphosate chemical on them. Talking to TOI, Stalin said: “I am pleased that MPCB has taken corrective measures and directed the municipal body to stop spraying chemicals into Powai lake. Several Indian marsh crocodiles, which are protected species that cohabit in the lake, with fishes and other marine creatures can be affected by the use of glyphosate to eradicate water hyacinths.'' The MPCB letter, signed by regional officer J S Hajare and submitted to the S ward office of BMC, states: “The use of glyphosate may further cause long-term effects on the aquatic environment of Powai lake.” Powai-based environmentalist Elsie Gabriel commented: “Was any Environment Impact Assessment report finalised before giving the contract to spray chemicals on water hyacinths in the lake? Any random knee-jerk action to clean the water body can prove detrimental to the environment.” Gabriel further said: “Already, with the peripheral concretisation of the lake from all sides, including the isolated areas where crocodiles come out to bask, Powai lake is in danger of serious damage.” Meanwhile, Stalin added: ``We are awaiting the formal response of BMC on the use of chemicals. We are also opposed to the construction of cycle track around the lake area; several trees have already been cut for this track project, and crushed stones dumped into the water, which is bad for the environment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-has-to-stop-herbicide-spray-in-powai-lake-mpcb/articleshow/86331238.cms||Vijay Singh

Residents of Faith Co-operative Housing Society opted for an eco-friendly idol for the first time this year. “We have many teenagers in our society and they insisted on getting an eco-friendly idol. We conducted the immersion on the third day in a bucket,” Asmita Karandikar, one of the committee members of the society, which houses over 100 flats, said. At Supreme Palm, a society which houses around 180 flats, drums were made available for individual immersions. “The society Ganapati is made of ‘shadu’ (natural clay) and the immersion is done on the premises only. We have made several water-filled drums available for individuals, who prefer to conduct the immersion on the premises. Around 50-60 households bring Ganapati home and 90% of them prefer to conduct the immersion in the society,” Gautam Gondil, secretary of Supreme Palm, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/balewadi-hsg-societies-take-green-route-to-bid-adieu/articleshow/86329303.cms||Tushar Dutt

An official of Shivai Krishna Ropeways, the private agency which will undertake the work, said the project has received all clearances from the state government but work was put off due to the pandemic. “With the Centre already having warned of a possible third wave, we have decided to start work in November as all clearances are in place,” said Udayraj Shinde, director of Shivai Krishna Ropeway Private Limited. Shinde said they are hoping that the chief minister will lay the foundation stone for the project. Pending since 2014-15, the ropeway is a private project with no government funding. All requisite permissions have been obtained, including environment, forest and from the aerial ropeway authority. The private agency is also seeking government permission to use a chopper to install the ropeway as it will take less time. Once completed, the ropeway will ferry tourists from Atkarwadi village to the top of the fort, covering a distance of 1.8km in six to seven minutes. The project is the second such scheme in Maharashtra after the one at Raigad Fort. The ropeway at Raigad takes around five minutes to reach the top and costs Rs300 per adult. Meanwhile the district planning authorities on Friday, at a meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, reviewed the Sinhagad Fort development plan. In the first phase, plastic will be banned and the use of the PMPML’s e-buses will be advocated. MP Supriya Sule, who was also present at the meeting, had visited the fort last week. She had discussed the development plan to enhance the quality of tourism with the deputy forest conservator, Rahul Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sinhagad-fort-ropeway-work-to-start-in-nov/articleshow/86329331.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Now, open-air restaurants permitted in east Delhi too||NEW DELHI: Following the decision of its southern counterpart, East Delhi Municipal Corporation too will allow open air restaurants in areas under its jurisdiction. It has come out with a policy, received anticipatory approval from the mayor and issued orders to the public health department for implementing it on Friday. While permitting dining in open spaces and terraces abutting licensed restaurants, eateries and hotels, the civic body has also finalised rates and conditions for running such facilities. And EDMC official said, “We are basically targeting the people running restaurants in local shopping complexes, district centres, planned commercial areas and hotels. Many of them are illegally using the open spaces. They now have an opportunity to utilise their terrace or the open area on the ground floor for serving food provided they follow norms and submit documents required for approvals.” The EDMC official added, “Open spaces with good air circulation are considered safer than closed rooms with air conditioning. Not only is the risk of Covid infection lower, but open spaces will also allow more sitting capacity.” Among the various certificates required included mandatory consent of the owner to use the open space for service purposes and demarcation of the open space in the building sanction plan (except for buildings constructed before 1962). As per norms, the open space or terrace should not be covered nor have inflammable material for side enclosures. “Moreover, no act of drinking should be visible publicly and measures should be taken to obstruct visibility,” said the EDMC official. For safety purposes, if the height of the open space parapet is less than 1.5 metre in height, it can be increased by way of glass cladding or grilles. Under the provisions, restrictions have been proposed on the music to be played in such open-air establishments. “Neither live band performances nor loud music will be allowed. Noise has to be within the permissible limit,” another official said. The regulations prohibit noise levels beyond 45-55 decibels in residential areas. However, unlike in some western countries, the pavement space outside the restaurants will not be permitted to be used to seat customers. And to prevent fire accidents, the policy also doesn’t permit the setting up of an open-area kitchen, thereby ruling out barbecues and similar facilities. The EDMC official said, “We are ready to extend support and expect cooperation from eatery owners. The civic body, however, reserves the right to cancel the licence for any violation without any prior notice.” The open-air licence will be valid for three years and will be renewed later alongside the establishment’s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-open-air-restaurants-permitted-in-east-delhi-too/articleshow/86332049.cms||Vibha Sharma

The emphasis of the endeavour was to remove waste from the beaches and spread awareness about keeping beaches clean. The drive on Bogmalo beach saw approximate 140 volunteers participating. “During the clean-up, approximate 30 bags of trash and non-degradable marine litter from the beach area was picked up,” said a Coast Guard official. The day is observed in the third week of September every year under the aegis of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and South Asia Co-operative Environment Programme (SACEP) in the South Asian Region. At Benaulim, seafarers from GSAI joined Coast Guard personnel and locals in collecting trash from the beach. Frank Viegas, the president of GSAI asked the shipping industry to use shore-based facilities for their garbage, waste oil and sludge disposal. Goa’s coast has been marred by tar balls plaguing the coastal areas and beaches it can be due to the negligence of some shipping vessels. “The Goa government has to take the issue to the petroleum minister, shipping ministry and environment ministry to seek a solution to the recurring problem of discharge of oil sludge at sea that washes ashore before as well as after the monsoon,” said Viegas. The Indian Coast Guard will share data of the trash collected with SACEP for analysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waste-removed-from-two-south-goa-beaches-on-clean-up-day/articleshow/86331262.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Temporary parking arrangements to tackle festival rush||Ludhiana: To tackle festival rush, the authorities are zeroing in on locations for making temporary parking arrangements. The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) has decided on a location and is considering others. The municipal corporation is also on the job. The development aims at avoiding traffic jams in markets.The MC has started removing wild growths from eight acres of Glada land opposite mini secretariat, Kapoor Hospital, old court chowk and vacant land near Mohan Dai Hospital with the help of JCB machines. Its officials have been given two days to complete the work, so that parking arrangements could be made there. Glada chief administrator PS Gill said, “We are making temporary arrangements for parking at Glada land opposite mini secretariat at Ferozepur Road. This parking will remain for festival season only. We will run it and very shortly decide the parking fee.” Around two weeks back, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and other MLAs had conducted a meeting with police commissioner Naunihal Singh and senior MC officials on steps to resolve traffic problems in markets in festival season. During discussion, illegal parking was blamed for rush and jams. Therefore, it was recommended that temporary parking arrangements be made around busiest markets.Setting up the facility at Glada land opposite mini secretariat was suggested in the meeting to tackle rush in Ghumar Mandi and nearby areas. Similarly, for parking in Chaura Bazaar, arrangements could be made at BL Kapoor hospital and Glada land at Old Chowk. There was also a proposal to develop temporary parking at the backside of Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital, as there is a big market near it. Sources said, “There are chances that vehicles’ entry might be restricted in very busy markets during festivals.” During festival season, long queues of vehicles choke the city markets. The industrial town does not have adequate parking arrangements and MC could do nothing to make smart lots. The proposal of parking in Feroze Gandhi market and an underground one at national highway could not become a reality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/temporary-parking-arrangements-to-tackle-festival-rush/articleshow/86327341.cms||---

The civic agency is planning to give a 50% discount to people availing of the facility. “Going for a pre-wedding shoot is quite a trend in the city and people prefer picturesque parks/tourist places for the purpose. But we will give them an option to use it even for post-wedding shoots and make the occasion special by taking memorable photographs with their spouses as well as other family members,” said a senior official. “Since the place has replicas of wonders of the world, they have ample options to get different frames and backgrounds during four hours of permissible time. And for us also, it would increase the source of income as more and more people can avail the facility,” said an official. As of now, for a pre-wedding shoot, Rs 26,000 has to be paid out of which Rs 10,000 is refundable security amount and Rs 15,000 is the booking charges (excluding GST). And Rs 1,000 is charged for sanitation purposes. Spread across seven acres and located near Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, the park has replicas of Leaning Tower of Pisa, Eiffel Tower, Pyramids of Giza, Taj Mahal, Statue of Liberty, Colosseum and Christ the Redeemer — all made out of waste. Opened in February 2019, the park has become a popular tourist spot. The entry fee for the park is Rs 50 on normal days and Rs 100 on Sundays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pre-wedding-shoots-okay-at-wonder-park-from-monday/articleshow/86332054.cms||Vibha Sharma

Public Works Department (PWD) officials said the installation of the mesh in a 1,000 square metre area was completed during the recent dry spell of the monsoon. All the major vulnerable sports, located towards the top of the ghat, have been covered, said the PWD. Six other locations, where the mesh needs to be installed, have been identified and the work will begin in phases depending on the allotment of funds by the state government. “We received Rs2 crore in April to fix the mesh. A plan was chalked out and work began in May. The remaining work was completed recently when the rainfall stopped for nearly two weeks,” said the PWD official. The department has been installing the mesh at vulnerable spots in phases. “Given the conditions and challenging terrain, the work is taken up in sections at crucial spots on priority. It was observed that most landslides were reported in the upper section of the ghat towards the top of the hill. Hence, work in those areas was completed,” said the PWD official, adding that now, vulnerable spots towards the lower half of the ghat will be covered. The PWD said that the machinery has been moved from the ghat after the completion of the work. Frequent visitors said the ghat should be monitored regularly. Vikas Raje, a regular visitor to the fort, said, “Sinhagad ghat has been witnessing frequent landslides during the past few monsoons. Though the fort is closed in view of the pandemic, it attracts many visitors. Authorities must regularly inspect the ghat and the road.” PWD officials said the plan for the next phase of work was being chalked out. IIT-Bombay had conducted a survey to identify vulnerable spots in the ghat after frequent landlsides over the past few years. Sinhagad Fort is located around 30km from the city. Besides the ghat road, there is a trail used by trekkers to reach the top of the fort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-vulnerable-spots-at-ghat-covered-with-iron-mesh/articleshow/86329343.cms||Sarang Dastane

Pointing out that several ministers and senior BJP functionaries had given statements about the investigation, Congress questioned the state government’s silence after police hit a dead-end. “We demand that the chief minister must make public the progress of the investigation,” Congress state president Girish Chodankar said. “We support the suggestion made by the BJP state president that if required the case may be transferred to the CBI. Give the case to the CBI to investigate.” Chodankar said Congress had tried not to politicise the death of the girl. The father of that girl, who was found dead on the Calangute beach, is running from pillar to post seeking a probe in the alleged murder of his daughter, he said. “There is no official statement in the case. The blame game has begun between police and doctors on a point as to who should decide whether it was a murder or suicide,” the Congress state president said. “We demand that the DGP take cognisance of complaint lodged by grieved father and register offence of murder against unknown persons.” He said that Congress would support the 19-year-old girl’s family if they decided to approach the courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-wants-cbi-to-probe-teens-death/articleshow/86331326.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A police official from Reengus police station said that the accident took place sometime before 8pm. “The car was barely recognisable after it hit the ground. It was reduced into half of its size and turned into a jumble of crushed metal,” an official said. Police called an ambulance to the scene which took the injured to the hospital. Five were declared brought dead while one is in a critical state. Cops said that several of the car’s parts were torn off and there was a litter of glass scattered all over the place. Sikar police said that passengers were either coming from a birthday party or heading to another celebration. “People who were passing through the flyover claimed that the car was briefly airborne before it spun around after crashing into the diver and fell into the space separating two roads,” an official said. Sikar police looked for survivors in the wrecked vehicle under torch lights. One passenger was writhing in pain, barely clinging to his life. Cops said that other passengers lay motionless when they were ferried to the hospital. All of them died without regaining consciousness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/5-killed-1-critical-as-speeding-car-hits-divider-falls-off-flyover-in-sikar/articleshow/86331313.cms||---

Gujarat Institute of Desert Ecology (GUIDE), Bhuj and National Center for Coastal Research (NCCR) Chennai along with forest department took up a day-long drive under conserving ocean theme and cleaned the beach of around 1.5 tonne plastic waste and other garbage. Gujarat tourism is promoting this 500-year-old beach as one of the major tourist attractions of the state because of its uniqueness and historic importance. Director of GUIDE, V Vijay Kumar said, “Plastic trash in marine and coastal waters impact the ocean on many levels. From harming wildlife and humans to impacting livelihood of people depending on the ocean, it also causes huge economic damage by affecting tourism and recreation activities. Reports say that the majority of the plastics found in the ocean come from land-based sources rather than the marine sources itself.” According to environmental scientists, creating awareness among people to take active part in cleaning up beaches is an important part to support conservation of the ocean. These two institutes also make efforts to spread the ideas and techniques to help reduce plastic trash. Beach cleaners recovered 1.5 tonne marine litter of different categories including cutlery, disposable plastic water bottles and straws, plastic cups, packets of snacks, submerged idols among many more. Interestingly, gutkha pouches and plastic flowers-strings that are used to adorn the idols added most to the garbage. Talking to TOI, president of Mandvi municipality, Hetal Soneji said, “The tourism department maintains the beach. Though we have not been given its responsibility, we still send our tractors to transport garbage and also our labourers to clean the beach. We have also put our dustbins there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/day-long-drive-frees-mandvi-beach-of-1-5-tonnes-of-waste/articleshow/86327458.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

More than 9,000 candidates who aspire to take admissions for PG courses in ayurveda, homoeopathy, unani and siddha courses were to appear but due to an internal issue by the national testing agency (NTA), many missed the exam. A candidate from Jalna, who is presently working as a medical officer in a local PHC in the district, had got the centre in Surat district of Gujarat. He missed the exam as he was 10 minutes late. “I was working in the vaccination drive section on September 17. I administered more than 65 vaccines yesterday and started for Surat on late Friday night. I reached the centre by 9.45am but the gates were closed at 9.30am. I was not allowed to appear despite many requests,” he said. Many students decided to skip the examination as their centre was too far. “My preferred centres were Nagpur, Akola and Pune. I was given Ahmedabad. It was not possible for me to travel so I decided to skip the exam,” said Apurva Jaiswal from Nagpur. Dr Vishnu Bawane, senior functionary of the national integrated medical association (NIMA) said NTA is responsible for the entire mess. “The NTA issued a notification two days ago and accepted that it’s not possible for them to manage the centres in Maharashtra. This notification is nothing but a safety measure by NTA to avoid legal matters,” said Bawane. “Many candidates who missed the exam due to this mess have lost their entire year. Many of them are Covid warriors. It’s an insult to Covid warriors,” he added. AIAPGET exam admit cards were allotted 5 days prior to the exam which is a very careless move by NTA, Bawane said. “NTA Could have notified the same 15 days in advance so that students would have got ample time to manage their traveling in this critical time of the pandemic,” he added. According to Bawane, the clarification given in the public notice by NTA appears to be political in nature. “If the NTA was aware about the clashing of centres then why the same notification not issued on the official website of NTA 15 days in advance? When the other option of rescheduling the exam was available then why was it not adopted in the interest of students?,” Dr Bawane asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-miss-ayush-pg-entrance-test-due-to-mess-at-exam-venues/articleshow/86329381.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Hubballi||Supari murder: Woman among four held for killing blackmailer||Kalaburagi: Kalaburagi police have arrested four accused, including a woman, in connection with a murder case. The woman is said to have given supari to three men for Rs 5 lakh to kill a blackmailer. After a body was found in two pieces on a railway track at Savalagi village on September 6, a the case was registered with Wadi railway police. Seeing the postmortem report, police concluded that the man was killed somewhere else and the body was thrown on the track, apparently to make it look like a case of suicide. Investigating the case, police located the cellphone towers where the accused would have passed by, and came to know the involvement of three persons in what they concluded a supari murder. Sanbeersing, the deceased, was living as a tenant at accused Mahananda’s house since two years. It is said Sanbeersing knew a secret of Mahananda and blackmailed her for the same. Not only he stopped giving her the rent amount, but also started receiving money from her. Fed up, Mahananda planned to kill Sanbeersing, and gave contract to three men — Maruthi Parit, Ashok Thimmaiah and Sunil alias Manjya — for Rs 5 lakh. The trio, who were known to Sanbeersing, called him for a booze party. After getting him drunk, they bludgeoned his head with a boulder at a secluded place. Later, they took the body to Savalagi and threw it on the track.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/supari-murder-woman-among-four-held-for-killing-blackmailer/articleshow/86325984.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ready for drugs test, says Telangana minister KT Rama Rao; 'will Rahul Gandhi follow?'||HYDERABAD: Reacting sharply to allegations linking his name to the drugs racket involving Tollywood celebrities and calling him as a ‘brand ambassador’ for drugs and liquor mafia, TRS working president KT Rama Rao on Saturday said he was ready to provide blood and hair samples for drugs testing. He asked if Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was ready for the same test. KTR also warned the leaders that the state government would not hesitate to book sedition cases against those making baseless allegations against the government and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao. Interacting with reporters at Telangana Bhavan here, he took a dig at both TPCC president A Revanth Reddy and Union home minister Amit Shah without taking their names for their comments at their public meetings at Gajwel and Nirmal respectively on Friday. KTR said some leaders were making baseless allegations and using objectionable language against the CM. “We have all the leaders’ history. We won’t leave anybody and strip them. There is this person who worked as a painter (indirectly referring to Revanth), how did he acquire four houses in Jubilee Hills. If KCR is sleeping in his farmhouse all the time, how is Telangana getting investments. How is development not stopping. How are the unique welfare schemes being implemented in Telangana,” he sought to know. Attacking Congress, he said there has been a real estate boom in Telangana Congress. “There were allegations by Congress leaders themselves that TPCC chief post was sold for Rs 50 crore. Tomorrow, they may auction TPCC posts and MLA tickets too,” he said. On Shah’s remarks in Nirmal’s public meeting on Friday, the TRS working president said they were not scared of AIMIM. The BJP was, in fact, scared of the Majlis party. He charged the BJP with playing communal card for gaining votes. “The BJP state chief (Bandi Sanjay) has been talking about BC Bandhu. Why cannot it be implemented in the entire country. He (Sanjay) should ask PM Narendra Modi to implement the scheme for BCs,” KTR said. Training guns on BJP MPs, he said they did nothing for the state and had even failed to get a tribal university. “The parties and leaders who have been talking about Telangana Liberation Day, could not even get pension for the people who took part in the Telangana armed struggle. Amit Shah did not talk about projects to be given to Telangana,” he said. Taking pot-shots at YSR Telangana Party chief YS Sharmila and BSP’s state coordinator RS Praveen Kumar, KTR said the parties were floated to split TRS vote in the elections. Reiterating that the TRS will win the upcoming Huzurabad by-election, KTR said a senior Congress leader like Jana Reddy was trounced in the Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll by a young TRS leader. He added Eatala Rajender was not such a senior leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-ready-for-drugs-test-will-raga-follow/articleshow/86331422.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Clamour for BC Bandhu gets louder, poses challenge to CM||Hyderabad: While the Dalit Bandhu scheme may turn out to be a ‘vote-spinner’ for the ruling TRS, it is the growing demand for a ‘BC Bandhu’ that has the potential to pose a challenge to the plans of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in defeating former minister Eatala Rajender in the Huzurabad by-elections. TRS leaders are happy that there are 50,000 Dalit voters in the constituency who are singing paeans for KCR. But, they are also worried as there are 1.20 lakh BC voters. In the last two months, both the TRS and Eatala have been trying to win different sections of BC voters with freebies and schemes. The ruling party is on a spree of distributing government-offered schemes to Yadavs, Kurmas, Mudirajs, Gouds, Padmashalis and Munnuru Kapus, among others. In the thick of the strategies and counter-strategies being implemented by the TRS and BJP, various BC welfare associations have demanded that KCR ensure that formal orders are issued by the government for implementation of BC Bandhu for the BC community on the lines of Dalit Bandhu before the bypoll notification, failing which they would campaign against the ruling party in Huzurabad. However, political analysts said these cannot be taken as a serious threat. “What credibility do these organisations have in Huzurabad. Every politically-affiliated caste organisation and individual wants to fish in troubled waters. They do not pose a credible threat to the TRS,” said political analyst professor K Nageshwar. However, political observers sought to caution the TRS government that the only threat to the ruling party would be how well the Dalit Bandhu scheme is being implemented. The CM has already dropped enough hints that his government would extend the bandhu scheme to BCs and other communities in the state in a phased manner. KCR may plan to expand the period of expectations among the people that they too would get the Rs 10 lakh per family sop till 2023 elections, observers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clamour-for-bc-bandhu-gets-louder-poses-challenge-to-cm/articleshow/86329427.cms||Roushan Ali

The tree transplantation policy was notified last year. Thousands of trees are to be transplanted across the capital over the next few months and four expert agencies were empanelled by the Delhi government for this job earlier this month. The agencies will be assisting construction companies and other projects in carrying out ‘safe’ tree transplantation to ensure a high survival rate. During the meeting of Delhi Tree Authority, it was proposed to get a study conducted by FRI to assess the success of transplanted trees. “The chairperson directed that the proposal be placed before him for further necessary action,” said the minutes of meeting of the tree authority. The tree authority of Delhi is the apex body responsible for regular monitoring of the implementation of the prescribed procedure for tree transplantation and for evolving new norms, mechanisms and best practices to achieve the objective of ensuring successful tree transplantation in Delhi. FRI, which is also conducting a third-party audit of plantation done by the forest department for the past few years — 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 — has submitted an initial report on the survey conducted on 50% of the plantation sites. The initial report says the growth of plantation was found to be satisfactory and the overall survival percentage of the plantation for three years varied from 51% to 80%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/study-planned-to-assess-success-of-tree-transplant/articleshow/86332079.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The family that alleged foul play accepted the body of the man only on Saturday night. The man Kasim Hayat was detained while he was carrying meat on his scooter on Tuesday. Forensic tests revealed that the meat was that of a cow and thereafter, Hayat was arrested. On Wednesday night, Hayat allegedly hung to death inside the Godhra B Division police station. Hayat’s body was sent to the SSG Hospital in Vadodara for a postmortem by a panel of doctors. The postmortem was performed on Friday, but the family refused to accept the body till Saturday evening. The family agreed to accept the body on Saturday night and burial was expected to take place later. While the police claimed that Hayat had ended his life, relatives have stated otherwise. A cousin brother of the deceased has submitted a complaint in this regard to the police. A copy of the same has also been submitted in the Godhra court. On Thursday, Congress MLAs from the minority community had demanded justice. AIMIM that has a significant presence in Godhra has also sought justice. Sources said that AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi was scheduled to visit the state next week and hi party members would apprise him of the custodial death. Audio messages have also been made appealing people to support the fight for Hayat. These are being circulated on a messaging application. Panchmahal superintendent of police Leena Patil said that a judicial inquiry was being conducted in the matter of custodial death. She said that they were cooperating with the inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/row-over-butchers-custodial-death-in-godhra-refuses-to-ebb/articleshow/86327847.cms||---

The former Union finance minister held a meeting with Congress coordination committee at Congress house to take stock of the election preparations, the membership drive and the process to overhaul the organisation in the poll-bound state. According to Congress functionaries, Chidambaram met with the heads of the election coordination committee, campaign committee, finance committee, manifesto committee and publicity committee and discussed the roadmap ahead. “Chidambaram reviewed the recent appointment of block presidents and the situation in the remaining blocks. Officebearers for the block committees will be announced soon and members for the various election committees will be announced in a day or two,” said Congress coordination committee chairman Ramakant Khalap. Chidambaram also met with the Cumbarjua and Santa Cruz blocks, where he exhorted them to work unitedly for the party irrespective of the party candidate or block president. “Please cooperate with us,” Chidambaram said while speaking to the block workers. “When the block makes a recommendation make sure you don’t recommend a jumping person. Suggest the name of a candidate who will be 100% loyal to the party.” Chidambaram has asked all the blocks to focus on enrolling primary members and identifying active members who can be assigned party responsibility. “The membership drive has taken on a new shape with a focus now on active members. Due to the paucity of time, the active members will be enrolled first and they will then enrol the primary members. The party wants to have at least four or five dependable active members for every booth in the constituencies,” Khalap said. Congress has already appointed block presidents for 27 of the 40 constituencies and the rest are likely to be appointed in a week or two. Though the candidate selection process has yet to begin, the core party leadership has already begun looking at probable candidates in certain constituencies. Exhorting party workers and supporters to work for the party, he said that Congress can form the government at the Centre only if it wins the assembly elections at the state level. “In 2024 we cannot win in India unless we win state by state. Five states are coming and then six more elections will come. When you win state by state, ultimately the battle for India will be won,” Chidambaram said. Meanwhile, Rao said that the ongoing block meetings and Chidambaram’s visit will strengthen party workers. “It is basically to strengthen the party and the booth workers and to prepare for the campaign that we will be doing from October. We have to work together,” Rao said. On Saturday, advocate Ajay Prabhugaonkar, who represents mining workers from Bicholim, joined Congress. The Mayem resident said he would work for the party in the coming elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chidambaram-takes-stock-of-block-overhaul/articleshow/86331430.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Venkateshwara Rao, a businessman from Saraswathi Layout in Davanagere, was contacted by a stranger pretending to be a bank officer on the phone. The stranger sought details of Rao’s bank account, since the businessman had blocked his ATM card. The stranger convinced Rao to clear his ATM card for use, and after obtaining all the necessary information, including the OTP, required for a transaction, stole a sum of Rs 1 lakh from the victim’s account. A case was registered at the Davanagere CEN police station. CEN inspector Girish said that the cops wasted little time. “Rao lodged a compliant immediately after the money was stolen from his account. The hour that immediately follows the crime is referred to as the golden hour, and with the phone number of the mysterious caller that Rao provided, we were able to trace the transactions to three banks, and freeze a sum of Rs 75,696 that belonged to the fraudster’s accounts. After obtaining permission from the court, the money was returned to Rao on Thursday,” said Girish, appealing to the public to waste no time in registering their plaints after such instances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dgere-businessman-recovers-money-lost-to-cybercriminal/articleshow/86326240.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After Kitex, more Kerala cos make beeline for Telangana||Hyderabad: Kerala’s loss is fast turning out to be Telangana’s gain. After apparel maker Kitex Group accused the Kerala government of hounding it out of the state, more Kerala-based industrialists are quietly trooping into Telangana. STOI has learnt that the Telangana government is already in discussions with nearly half a dozen Kerala-based companies keen on setting up shop here, triggered largely by Kitex’s exit from Kerala and the red-carpet treatment rolled out by Telangana. After Kitex Group’s chairman & managing director Sabu M Jacob announced his decision to exit Kerala, Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao had dispatched a private jet to ferry him to Hyderabad and promised to `meet and beat’ any offer the textile baron received from any other state. Kitex's withdrawal of its Rs 3,500 crore investment from Kerala and investment commitment of Rs 2,400 crore in Telangana was followed by Malabar Group's Rs 750 crore investment in setting up a gold refinery and jewellery manufacturing unit in Hyderabad earlier this week. Jacob,who was in town with his entire family for inking MoUs with the Telangana government, told STOI he was confident that within the next couple of months at least 50 companies from Kerala would set up shop in Telangana. “Because once we commit, that’s a certificate for everyone as we are the leading players and made revolutionary changes in Kerala in terms of how business is done. I know who is coming here to invest. I openly came out (of Kerala) but others are silently doing it as they are scared of being harassed. Malabar group came last week and it became big news there,” he said, adding that there are several companies looking investing over Rs 100 crore in Telangana. Jacob added: “You know how difficult it is in Kerala because it’s a communist ruling state with a lot of unions. Kerala is a place where without pleasing politicians and bureaucrats you can’t run a business be it big or small. You have to go with whatever they demand otherwise they will see to it that you are finished. They will harass you from every angle.” Confirming that Kerala companies are making a beeline for Telangana, Telangana industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said: “Yes that has started. They all know about Kitex and tell us you created a strong value proposition for Kitex. We are in touch with them and I have personally interacted with them.” Ranjan said they are already seeing interest from companies in the life sciences and food processing space. While he refused to divulge any names, he said two medical devices companies will be setting up shop in the Medical Devices Park at Sultanpur on Hyderabad’s outskirts, while a nutraceutical player will be putting up a facility at Genome Valley even as parleys are underway with a player in the food processing sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-kitex-more-kerala-cos-make-beeline-for-telangana/articleshow/86331408.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Realtors and politicians spend lakhs of rupees to buy the laddus. In a new trend, auctions are also being held online.

The consultant had stocked up on these at her office located on Santoshi Mata Road in Kalyan (west). These items were meant to be sold to her clients s as they are considered a talisman for good luck and prosperity. However, dealing in such items is a crime, as it violates the Wildlife (Protection) act. The black coral and monitor lizard’s penis, known as ‘hatha jodi’ in local parlance, are also sold for use in black magic and also as ayurvedic medicine, said Sunish Subramanian Kunju, a volunteer of Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB). The action was taken jointly by the WCCB team and the forest department.

---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad byelection: EVMs or ballot paper?||HYDERABAD: The talk in the political circles is whether the Huzurabad by-election will be conducted on EVMs or the ballot paper. The ensuing bypoll is likely to witness a large contingent of candidates entering the fray if the threats issued by the unemployed youth, private teachers, field assistants and other caste welfare organisations are any indication. Officials of the election wing in the state said a final decision on whether to conduct the bypolls on EVMs or paper ballot would be taken later. It would also depend on the number of candidates who are going to be in the electoral fray. “As per the Election Commission norms, EVMs will be used if the number of contesting candidates, including NOTA option, does not exceed 385. An election or a by-election will be conducted on paper ballot only if the contesting candidates are more than 385,” said an official. Ten candidates in 2018 and nine in the 2014 assembly elections (excluding NOTA) had contested from Huzurabad constituency.  Another two dozen unemployed youth too have threatened to enter the electoral fray with YS Sharmila-led YSR Telangana Party promising to support them in their cause. The Huzurabad bypoll is being seen as a contest of prestige between chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and former minister Eatala Rajender who joined the BJP after being ousted from KCR’s cabinet. While the TRS has announced Gellu Srinivas Yadav as its candidate, the BJP is yet to formally announce its candidate although Eatala is most likely to contest the bypolls. Congress is expected to announce its candidate after September 10. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, turmeric farmers filed over 170 nominations from Nizamabad constituency to highlight their demands.

From an initial announcement of Rs 1,000 crore in one apparel facility, the company has decided to invest Rs 2,400 crore in setting up two integrated fibre-to-apparel manufacturing clusters in Telangana. This will create 22,000 direct jobs and close to 18,000 indirect jobs. The two clusters, which will come up at the Kakatiya Mega Textile Park in Warangal and Sitarampur in Rangareddy district, will ship three million pieces per annum of apparel for kids in the 0-24 months age group to the US market. The details were given out on Saturday after Kitex Group chairman and managing director Sabu M Jacob signed an MoU with the Telangana government. The second largest manufacturer of apparel for infants currently manufactures 1 million pieces of infant apparel at its facilities in Kerala for exports to the US. The company is looking at acquiring about 375-400 acres of land for the two units. The first one at KMTP is slated to begin commercial operations from November 2022, Jacob said on the sidelines of the MoU signing ceremony. “Three months is the time for land preparations and we will start construction by January 2022. In six months we will complete the buildings and by August-September we will start commissioning the machinery at KMTP,” Jacob said, adding that work on the Sitarampur facility will begin 3-4 months after the KMTP unit. Pointing out that the company has already placed orders for the machinery, Jacob said: “These are not just garment factories. We will start from ginning to spinning, knitting, bleaching, dyeing and printing, all the processes will be done here,” he explained. Jacob also said the company will focus on hiring women for 85-90% of the proposed jobs to be created across the two units. Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao pointed out that once Kitex group starts operations, there was a possibility of it purchasing cotton cultivated in about 3 lakh acres in the state. KTR said Telangana was able to bag this marquee investment starting with an SMS that he sent to Kitex Group CMD followed by a phone call and an offer to fly him on a private jet to Hyderabad after Jacob announced his decision to exit Kerala where he was planning to invest Rs 3,500 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kitex-group-stitches-up-rs-2400-cr-investment-plan-in-telangana/articleshow/86331427.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Education secretary Radhika Jha on Saturday released the government order on the resumption of offline classes for primary students. The offline classes will be held on the lines of the ones being held for students of senior sections. The order states that the classes will continue to operate in both offline-online modes; and parents can decide if they want to send their wards to school. The school staff and teachers need to be fully vaccinated, the government stipulated. To make up for the loss in school days, the department has asked teachers to introduce bridge courses in schools, developed by the SCERT (State Council for Educational Research and Training). Also, mid-day meals will not be served for now. But students will be compensated for this, officials said. Further, with schools operating for only four hours, students won’t be allowed to get tiffins. The classes will be held on weekdays, while fogging and sanitisation will be done on weekends. Meanwhile, experts said that parents need to be extra cautious during the initial days of the schools’ reopening. “Now, parents need to fight their fears and encourage kids to adapt to the new normal. This way, things will return to normalcy eventually. Some children may encounter anxiety, which is why parents should accompany them to school for the time being,” said Aditi Arora, a Doon-based psychotherapist and counsellor. New normal Offline classes will be held along the lines of the ones being held for students of classes XI-XII in Uttarakhand.

About 50 people had drowned in the accident, the two little girls aged 3 and 1 were among the victims. Exactly two years after the accident, on September 15, 2021, Bhagyalakshmi gave birth to twins. As fate would have it, both are daughters. The couple says that it is God’s blessing to have twins on the same day they lost their daughters. Tragedy had hit Appala Raju, an employee in a glass manufacturing company, when a double-decker launch had capsized in the Godavari after it was caught in a whirlpool midstream. The couple had cancelled their trip in the last minute after Appala Raju, 32, complained of uneasiness. However, they sent their two daughters, Geetha Vaishnavi, 3, and Dhatri Ananya, 1, with relatives for pilgrimage to the Sri Rama temple at Bhadrachalam. In all, there were 11 members from four families related to Appala Raju. Of them, only one had survived. Even as the tragedy continued to haunt the couple, on September 15, exactly two years after the mishap, Bhagyalakshmi, 28, was blessed with the twins. Bhagyalakshmi told STOI, “The newborns even have the same features of their (deceased) sisters. Both babies are doing well. My mother-in-law boarded the ill-fated boat with her two granddaughters to fulfil the vow of tonsuring her elder granddaughter at Sri Sita Ramachandraswamy temple. The boat accident was a huge loss to us as 10 of our relatives died. However, we are now happy with the arrival of the newborns,” said Bhagyalakshmi. Fertility expert Dr P Sudha Padmasri, who conducted the delivery, recalled that the couple were inconsolable when they first approached her about a year ago. “As the mother had already undergone a tubectomy, I explained to them about the IVF procedure and initiated the treatment. Even though the estimated due date is October 20, she developed labour pains on September 15 itself,” said Dr Padmasri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-couple-has-twins-on-same-date-they-lost-2-daughters-in-19/articleshow/86331435.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The Foods and Drug Administration (FDA) has confirmed it is a violation and started investigating the case. Roongta’s son Praddyuman lodged a complaint with the FDA on September 15. “My dad was admitted at Gracious Institute of Medical Sciences, Sakkardara, on August 27 for PCNL surgery and administered Merocrit 1 gram (Meropenem 1 gram) of Cipla Ltd. I bought 10 vials from the pharmacy (Lotus Pharmacy) in the same hospital. Each vial cost Rs3,633. Due to complications, my father was admitted at Kingsway Hospital on September 3 and recommended the same drug. At this hospital, the same drug of the same company was given at Rs772,” he said. “We had to bear extra expense of Rs30,000. We are also concerned about poor people who cannot afford high prices. Proper inquiry should be conducted and justice should be given to all patients,” he said. Roongta told TOI it was nothing less than cheating with him. “FDA should conduct search and see if similar things aer happening with other medicines. We required the same medicine at another private hospital so we came to know about it. Otherwise, we would have never learnt about this violation. In Covid-19 pandemic, people in large numbers are requiring various medicines. Therefore, FDA should closely monitor and stop this loot,” he said. TOI had on September 15 reported the Supreme Court order to the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) to look into suggestions of city-based resident Arunpal Singh Behal for development of centralized portal or application for hospitalization, supply of medicines etc. He is a pharmacist and filed the petition alleging black marketing and supply of fake medicines during second wave of pandemic. FDA assistant commissioner Pushpadas Ballal said, “Cipla Ltd officials said the company reduced prices in February. Sale of drug at old price is not permissible in case revised prices are approved. Usually, companies inform about revision to dealers, who ultimately pass on the information to retailers. In such cases, dealers should take back old stock and ensure it is not sold in the market. In this case, it is clear the patient was given drug at old price. Therefore, we are investigating and will take action.” Lotus Pharmacy owner Roshan Chute said, “It is not my mistake. We were not informed by the dealer or Cipla Ltd about revision in prices and new stock. Therefore, we continued to sell the drug at the price mentioned on it. Dealer should have taken back old stock and replaced it with new one.” TOI visited the pharmacy on September 15 and saw the old stock was available with the pharmacy and on sale. Nilesh Chanakhekar from Cipla Ltd assured to give a version of the company. Later he did not respond to TOI call and message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patient-given-injection-at-rs3663-despite-company-cutting-rate-to-rs772/articleshow/86329515.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mumbai||Gems & jewels export shines despite Covid gloom||MUMBAI: The Covid pandemic has brought a huge bonanza to the gems and jewellery export industry in Mumbai. The 149 gems and jewellery units at the Santacruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (Seepz), the largest manufacturing cluster in the world, have had far better sales than even in pre-Covid times, said Rajeev Pandya, president, Seepz Gems and Jewellery Manufacturing Association. Any adverse Covid impact was limited to the first fives months of the lockdown (Mar- Jul 2020) when exports contracted sharply by around 58%, said Pandya.  Exports of gems and jewellery from Seepz in the first five months of this fiscal year have zoomed after languishing three years pre-Covid and experiencing a sharp decline in the initial months of the lockdown. Exports for five months (April to August 2021) ballooned to Rs 10,325 crore, a whopping 82% increase over the earlier peak (Rs 5,662 crore in 2016-17) and 88% over pre-Covid 2019-20 levels. The top threeexport markets were USA (72%), Hong Kong (6%) and UK (5%).  Pandya said these highly stressful times have meant people wanting to shower affection on their loved ones. “Jewellery is a feel-good factor and is a very personal gift. This emotional need to give has helped increase sales,” he said. Sales have largely been online and exports from India largely cater to the upper middle, middle and lower middle classes. Many manufacturers have shifted their orders to India due to tensions between US and China.  While the ongoing Covid pandemic has resulted in a lot of economic hardship, governments, particularly the US government, have given trillions of dollars in aid to its citizens to tide over the hard times. “Many have used this money to purchase jewellery,” he said.  When the Centre started lifting restrictions in June last year, the industry was quick to approach the state government to allow them to bring their workers to the industrial units and provided exclusive transport to the workers.  The recovery actually started in September last year with the start of the fall season in the US (when demand traditionally rises) when it roughly reached average levels seen in the past four years and since then has been comfortably above levels of earlier years. The second half of 2020-21 saw exports of Rs 11,053 crore, roughly 35% above pre-Covid levels.  Pandya said this year orders have been placed early in March-April and they are still shipping out consignments. “We hope this is sustained,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gems-jewels-export-shines-despite-covid-gloom/articleshow/86331434.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Hyderabad||Twitter chirps spice up Telangana political scene||Hyderabad: Twitter is increasingly becoming a major platform for political parties and leaders to target their rivals and trade barbs against each other. Thursday’s Twitter war which unfolded between minister KT Rama Rao and TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy vis-a-vis calling Congress MP Shashi Tharoor a ‘donkey’ was only a tip of the iceberg. While KTR is one of the most active leaders on Twitter and even conducts ‘AskKTR’ interaction on the social media platform, several other leaders are also hooked on to the social media platform now. KTR has three million followers on Twitter. Revanth, former TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy, state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay, Union minister G Kishan Reddy and YSRTP president YS Sharmila are all active on Twitter and keep posting their comments on various issues. Among the parties, TRS is a step ahead as it is planning to appoint social media teams at the district level also. “All the political parties and leaders have been using Twitter to reach more people. It has become a major platform for the parties to give vent to their feelings in the last two years in Telangana,” Buggarapu Ramnath, a social media activist, said. In 2017, Congress senior leader Digvijay Singh and KTR fought over the drugs case involving Tollywood celebrities. While Digvijay alleged that the TRS government was shielding high-profile personalities, KTR reacted sharply asking the former to retire gracefully and do something that would suit his age. KTR was also involved in a bitter war on Twitter with Uttam on several issues when the latter was heading Congress in the state. There were heated exchange of words between the leaders. If KTR lashed out at Uttam over Rs 2.5 crore cash burnt in a car near Kodad during the elections, Uttam shot back comparing KTR to a ‘dishwasher’ which sparked an uproar on the social media platform. During the MLC elections this year, BJP leader N Ramchander Rao openly challenged KTR to come for a debate at Arts College on recruitment. Wasting no time, KTR said on Twitter that he was busy collecting information on 12 crore jobs and Rs 15 lakh in all Jan Dhan accounts as promised by PM Narendra Modi. Recently, Sharmila and KTR’s followers were also involved in a feud over Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/twitter-chirps-spice-up-telangana-political-scene/articleshow/86329612.cms||Koride Mahesh

Revanth Reddy threw a “white challenge” at KTR, other politicians and celebrities. As part of the challenge, he wants public representatives and celebrities to undergo tests, the results of which should be placed in the public domain to prove that they were not into drugs. “I will invite two leaders and, in turn, each of them can invite two each for the challenge,” Revanth said and told mediapersons that he was inviting KTR and former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy to be part of the challenge. TPCC chief saOKid he would go to Telangana Martyrs’ Memorial at noon on Monday and would go to any hospital that KTR takes him for drug tests. “White challenge is on the lines of green challenge by TRS MP J Santosh, who started inviting celebrities to promote greenery,” he said. Municipal minister had offered to undergo drug tests and asked Revanth whether Rahul Gandhi was ready to give his hair and blood samples. Referring to KTR’s comment that even sedition cases would be booked if leaders make baseless charges, Revanth said the minister should know what the Supreme Court has commented on the number of sedition cases being booked. “The law is equal for everyone and not a relative of anyone. We will see. Let them book sedition cases,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cong-chief-throws-white-challenge-at-politicos-celebs/articleshow/86329561.cms||---

The Ganesh idols have been divided into two categories, those above 10 feet and those below 10 feet. “Bar-coded stickers have been handed over to Ganesh pandal organisers to help intracking the idol. Also, the pandal organisers have to immerse the idol in the immersion points based on the height of the idol,” Anjani Kumar said. This year, apart from the immersion points on Tank Bund and NTR Marg, GHMC officials and police have made arrangements at People’s Plaza for idol immersion. Small ponds have also been arranged.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 73 years on, Urdu discourse back in Jama Masjid Chowk||HYDERABAD: The Jama Masjid Chowk at Murgi Chowk near Charminar, built over 200 years ago, has reverted to Friday discourse in Urdu 73 years after it stopped the service in the local language. Soon after the ‘Operation Polo’ in September 1948 that led to the merger of Hyderabad state with the Indian Union, the mosque built during the period of Sikandar Jah, Nizam III, stopped the Urdu service and restricted itself to Arabic sermons. This was done to avoid controversies in view of the prevailing political conditions then. The mosque, popularly known as Chowk-ki-Masjid, relaunched the Urdu discourse on first Friday of Moharrum, the first month of Islamic calendar, this year. The devout have welcomed the move as the discourse in Urdu will help them keep abreast of socio-economic and educational problems of the community. Chowk-ki-Masjid is one of the two historical mosques in Hyderabad where the Friday sermon (Khutba) is delivered in Arabic without a discourse (bayan) in Urdu. The other mosque is Mecca Masjid. After the management of Chowk-ki-Masjid reintroduced the Urdu discourse, the state Waqf Board too is planning to follow suit in the Mecca Masjid. The Friday sermon preceding the congregational noon prayers is divided in two parts. Both parts are delivered in Arabic. But since people in India do not understand Arabic, the Friday sermon is preceded by a discourse in Urdu or regional language. As far as Telugu states are concerned, the Arabic sermons for all the Fridays in a year were selected by the ecclesiastical (religious) department of the Nizam government almost 100 years ago. They are simply repeated even now, while the Urdu discourse is largely based on the current topics. The managing committee of Chowk-ki-Masjid felt that the devout attending the Friday prayers are denied the benefit of knowing the religion and social, cultural and educational issues plaguing the principal minority community, as none of them follows what’s said in Arabic. About 2,000 people attend the Friday prayers in the mosque and in the absence of Urdu discourse, many of them turn up only a few moments before the congregational namaz. “We discussed the issue for long and finally decided to reintroduce Urdu discourse for the benefit of the devout. Since the relaunch of Urdu service seven weeks ago, the response from the devout has been quite encouraging. They are turning up in mosque quite early to listen to the Urdu discourse. Mufti Mohammad Haneef Quadri of Jamia Nizamia has been hired for the Urdu bayan or discourse,” said Syed Asim Ahmad, member of the managing committee. Asim Ahmad said the mosque has opened a library for the benefit of students. It also plans to run coaching classes for competitive and public examinations. Mosque committee president Munawar Hussain has been offering incentives to poor and meritorious students. Waqf Board chairman Mohammad Saleem told TOI that he would take steps for reintroduction of Urdu service in Mecca Masjid too as thousands of people turn up at the nearly 400-year-old mosque for the Friday prayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/73-years-on-urdu-discourse-back-in-jama-masjid-chowk/articleshow/86331490.cms||Syed Akbar

Similar situation was also seen near Mahaveer hospital and Shadan College, NIMS Hospital and a few other places. Owing to the slow movement of traffic, many people were forced to take the Metro rail. “The situation was bad for motorists coming from Secunderabad and going towards Lakdikapul via Ranigunj late in the evening.

---||Surat||Gujarat: 7 organs harvested from two brain-dead men||SURAT: A 39-year-old Assam farmer, a 13-year-old Vadodara kid, a 29-year-old man — also from Vadodara — and a couple of others got a new lease of life thanks to the organs donated by two brain-dead patients from south Gujarat on Friday. The process of organ harvesting was initiated after the families of Virendra Dedhia and Jaman Gondalia — who suffered brain haemorrhage due to sudden increase in blood pressure — agreed to cadaver donation after being approached by DonateLife, an NGO working towards spreading awareness about organ donation. The 56-year-old Dedhia, a resident of Amardham Cooperative Society in Valsad town, was rushed to hospital on September 14. After CT-Scan confirmed that he had suffered brain haemorrhage, he was shifted to Kiran hospital in Surat where doctors declared him brain-dead on September 17. After being informed by Doctors, Nilesh Mandlewala, founding president of DonateLife, approached Dedhia’s family members. They agreed to donate his liver, heart and two kidneys. “We have to accept the bitter fact that my husband is dead. His organs will save the lives of others, so we decided to donate them,” Kasturben, Dedhia’s wife, said. Gondalia, a 40-year-old diamond polisher from Katargam, was admitted to Hospital on September 15. Two days later he was declared brain-dead after his CT-Scan showed that he had suffered brain haemorrhage. “Both his kidneys failed in 2012 and he needed a transplant. Our mother Dudhiben donated a kidney to him,” Gondalia’s brother Bharat said. The family hails from Vibhania village in Kalavad taluka of Jamnagar district. “Earlier this year he again suffered kidney failure and was on dialysis. We understand the pain of those who need organ donation. So, when we were informed that my brother was brain-dead, we decided to donate his vital organs,” Bharat added. Gondalia’s liver and two corneas were harvested. After the formal consent of the kin of the brain-dead patients, the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) was alerted about the cadaver donation. Dedhia’s heart was transplanted into an Assam farmer who was suffering from heart problems since 2019. The transplant was carried out at Chennai’s MGM hospital. His one kidney was transplanted into a 13-year-old child from Vadodara at IKDRC in Ahmedabad. The other kidney was transplanted into a 29-year-old man from Vadodara at Kiran Hospital in Surat. This was the first cadaver kidney transplant in Surat. A 46-year-old patient from Bhiloda of Sabarkantha district got the liver donated by Dedhia, the transplant was performed at CIMS hospital in Ahmedabad. Gondalia’s liver was transplanted into a 59-year-old man from Ahmedabad at CIMS hospital. His corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drishti Eye bank in Surat. “Surat is now leading in cadaver donation in the country. Total 19 cadaver donations took place through DonateLife in the last 19 days,” Mandlewala told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/7-organs-harvested-from-two-brain-dead-men/articleshow/86327725.cms||---

While the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has completed 96% of coverage of first doses, so far other parts of the state have reached 50% coverage of first dose. The state health authorities have set a target of vaccinating 2.8 crore individuals in the next four weeks. The health department had already ramped up vaccination by undertaking special drives over the last fortnight. “So far, a total of 1.54 crore first doses have been administered, which is almost 54% of the population above 18 years of age, and 20% have been given the second dose. In the last three days, we have administered an average of 5 lakh doses and we will be administering around 1 crore doses in the next four weeks, so that atleast one dose is completed for the entire targeted population before the third wave strikes,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, Telangana. Among the various districts, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal, Warangal (Urban), Karimnagar, Rajanna-Sircilla and Yadadri- Bhuvanagiri are the top seven when it comes to vaccination coverage. Among the districts with the least coverage are Nagarkurnool, Adilabad, Wanaparthy, Vikarabad, Kumarambheem and Jogulamba Gadwal. Meanwhile, among the different categories of beneficiaries including healthcare workers, frontline workers, those aged 45 years and above and between 18 years and 45 years, mostly persons aged 45 years and above have been administered the second dose. This category accounted for 33.9 lakh of the total 58 lakh second doses administered in the state. The maximum number of first doses have been given to those aged between 18 years and 45 years. Even as the health department races against time to complete vaccinations in view of the festive season having begun and a spike expected after the season, some isolated cases are being reported. “The number of Covid-19 cases are low. We are not seeing any clusters but mostly isolated, sporadic cases so far. Unless there is a new variant of the virus, we do not expect a spike in cases,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/50-coverage-of-first-dose-in-most-of-telangana/articleshow/86331513.cms||Amrita Didyala

Leading the way were upscale gated communities in Hyderabad’s IT corridor where the highest winning bid, as on Saturday, stood at Rs 5.1 lakh. Until 2019 – last year was a dud because of Covid-19 – only a handful of societies were seen ringing in the big money, with the average limited to Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000. “Almost every gated community in the western corridor had a laddu auction this year. The bids started from as low as Rs 30,000 and went up to Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh in many cases. For the first time though, it touched Rs 5 lakh,” said Dr Sai Ravi Shanker, executive member of Cyberabad Residents Welfare Association. The association comprises of over 45 gated communities spread across Gachibowli, Miyapur, Kondapur, Hi-Tec City etc. For Gurupreet Kapoor, the top bidder of the city so far, at Rs 5.1 lakh, it was a social cause that pushed him to raise the stakes. “We’ve decided to donate either to an orphanage or an institution for the blind,” said the CEO of a US-based IT staffing company and resident of My Home Vihanga, Gachibowli. At another community in Kondapur, a family paid Rs 2.8 lakh (approx) for the Ganesh laddu that was later distributed among residents. The money, residents said, was rolled back into the society’s kitty. Ditto with new entrant Sumadhura Acropolis, Nanakramguda and Aparna Sarovar, Nalagandla where the winning bids stood at Rs 1.45 lakh (approx) (for a 5 kg laddu) and Rs 1.35 lakh, respectively. “The money will be used to organise the next Ganesh Utsav,” said G Nagaraju from Aparna Sarovar. He, however, claimed that the auction this time was dull as the community had managed to raise Rs 4 lakh in 2019. “The auction, over time, has become an extension of the Ganesh utsav celebrations for people. Whether one agrees with the extravaganza or not, one cannot deny that it brings people together, often for a good cause,” said Rajat Panda from Accurate Wind Chimes, Narsingi where the laddu was ‘sold’ at Rs 50,000. Not too far away, at Vertex Panache, Kokapet the laddu went under the hammer for the second time last week, fetching Rs 90,001.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hi-tech-hyderabad-raises-laddu-auction-stakes/articleshow/86331564.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Kozhikode||Vadakara: LJD report points at severe erosion of LDF votes||Kozhikode: Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which studied the electoral loss of its candidate Manayath Chandran against RMP’s K K Rema in Vadakara in the assembly election, has found that there was severe vote erosion from the Left in favour of Rema. LJD report has found that there was flow of votes from CPM as well as other LDF alliance partners there and the party was reportedly upset over the front leadership not taking any constructive action in the aftermath, despite sharing their report with them. LJD has found that over 2,000 CPM votes eroded in Vadakara municipality alone. There was severe vote erosion from the party’s account in Eramala, Azhiyoor, Onchiyam and Chorod as well. “LDF did not receive the votes of alliance partners like CPI, Congress (S) and JD (S) in various booths. From four panchayats and the lone municipality, a total of 4,769 votes eroded,” a report of LJD, which surfaced on Saturday, said. It further said that over half of the votes (2,069) were lost from Vadakara municipality alone. “As per the statistics from the local self-government body elections, LDF had a lead of 1,244 votes in Vadakara municipality. It is clear from the statistics that there was severe vote erosion in areas like Nadakkuthaazha and Puthuppanam, which are strongholds of the CPM,” the report said. The report added that the LDF candidate lost votes of JD(S) and CPI in several booths. “Some votes have eroded from LJD also in booth 22. However, there was not much loss of votes from booths 24 and 27, which are LJD strongholds,” the report said. The report was prepared following a meeting of LJD Vadakara constituency committee held in July, in the aftermath of the electoral loss. It was prepared based on the reports filed by the committees of LJD in the panchayats and municipality coming under the constituency. LJD had reportedly shared the document with senior CPM leaders and the party was upset about the front not discussing the loss in Vadakara and taking appropriate action. Rema had made history by defeating the LDF in Vadakara, which has never elected a non-Left representative ever to the assembly. Rema had run with the support of the Congress-led UDF and defeated LJD’s Manayath Chandran by a margin of 7,491 votes. With the win she became the maiden MLA of RMP, an outfit floated by rebel CPM activists led by her slain husband T P Chandrasekharan. Although LJD was the party contesting from the seat, CPM was leading the campaign from the front in order to defeat RMP. The campaign even saw a late appearance of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. However, post-poll, it became evident that Rema was successful in appealing to people, especially women voters, cutting across party lines and had secured support even from traditional CPM sympathizers. Both CPM and LJD are yet to make a formal comment on the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vadakara-ljd-report-points-at-severe-erosion-of-ldf-votes/articleshow/86327837.cms||---

Light to moderate rain will continue during post monsoon season also. A total of 2,868.1mm is considered normal at this stage. While the last four days have added hardly 20mm to the seasonal total, which had already crossed the normal mark on Tuesday, a fairly good spell during the previous week sustained an equitable distribution of rainfall. During the last 24 hours, Old Goa recorded 8.6mm, Canacona 6.4mm, two other centres less than 1mm and other centres didn’t receive any rainfall. Figures were not available for Ponda and Valpoi centres. The monsoon has not yet started withdrawing in north India. The quantum of rainfall is also likely to improve over Goa later next week. During July, the rainfall pattern was irregular, as it rained extremely heavily for 14 days, triggering floods in most parts of Goa, and a lean patch followed for over 35 days. “There is a possibility of slightly better cloud formation and spatial distribution between September 21 and 23, which may lead to increased rainfall activity,” India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, scientist Rahul M said. The four-month monsoon season ends on September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/light-rain-likely-for-3-days-may-continue-post-season/articleshow/86331585.cms||---

Stating that he was happy that KCR had spent Rs 1,200 crore on Yadadri temple project and invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its inauguration, he said the government should not allow any further delay on taking up works on the mosques. The BJP cannot accuse the TRS government of appeasement as it was spending hundreds of crores of rupees on development of temples. “It is a matter of a few crores of rupees for construction of mosques in the secretariat compound,” he said. Owaisi also urged KCR to provide metro rail connectivity from the Old City to Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The government should start and complete original corridor work to lay the metro rail line in the Old City. The government can raise money through sale of land to complete the metro rail project in the Old City, he said referring to the Kokapet land auction which fetched Rs 2,700 crore to the government. The AIMIM is a party of Muslims, Dalits and other downtrodden and it is happy about Dalit Bandhu scheme, he said. In the ensuing session of the assembly, the AIMIM will exert pressure on the government to take up welfare of Muslims too, he said.  AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi issued a stern warning to party corporators that they will not be spared if they are seen anywhere around town planning offices or its officers. “It is not the duty of the AIMIM but the GHMC to take action against buildings which are not constructed as per the sanctioned plan,” he said.

Why is the Union home minister talking about fear when their party is ruling at the Centre. Instead, it is the minorities who should be given confidence. There should be no place for fear in a democracy,” he said. Responding to reporters’ queries on Shah and KTR’s comments, Owaisi said it looked like the stomach of BJP and Congress leaders would get upset if they do not talk about the AIMIM. “They seem to be abusing AIMIM even in their dreams. They should first decide who is their political opponent,” he said. He said Shah seemed to have got hurt when BJP lost two wards in the GHMC polls despite his visit to the Old City. “BJP’s performance in GHMC was sort of a pyrrhic victory. It lost its sitting graduates MLC seat and lost its deposit in Nagarjuna Sagar bypoll. People of Telangana will decide their fate in 2023 too,” Owaisi said, taking pot-shots at Shah’s claims that the BJP will come to power in 2023 in Telangana.  “If AIMIM is polarising the votes, our corporator Sunnam Rajmohan would not have won four elections in the Old City, he said. Owaisi asked party MLCs, MLAs, corporators and other leaders to actively involve themselves in voter enrolment in all assembly constituencies in Greater Hyderabad and not just seven represented by the AIMIM. “Let’s see what happens in 2023,” he said. AIMIM chief said PM Narendra Modi should take note of mob lynching as radicalisation and condemn them. “I agree with Modi that radicalisation anywhere is a threat to rule of law everywhere. Who is responsible for radicalisation of mindset in India against Muslims. The chief minister of a BJP-ruled state calls a Muslim leader ‘abba jaan’ and another farmer leader terms them ‘chacha jaan’. s this not radicalisation,” he wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/majlis-not-scared-of-any-political-party-says-owaisi/articleshow/86329779.cms||Roushan Ali

Come, let’s save our Delhi from dengue,” he addded. Like the previous year, the campaign will, each Sunday, see the cleaning of water accumulated in homes of every minister, MLA and officer.  Along with this, all Delhiites are being made aware of changing the water of their coolers, pots, etc, every week by joining the campaign through various mediums, the government said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/school-kids-to-pitch-in-govts-anti-dengue-drive/articleshow/86327927.cms||---

A group of 20 transgender persons attended a workshop on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), first-aid, and basic life support on Tuesday. “Transgender persons who beg on streets and signal stops are more likely to witness road accidents, and if they are trained to provide basic help and call the ambulance in time, it will help save many lives,” said transgender activist Sonal Dalvi, who also attended the workshop. A transgender participant said, “We were taught to first check if the person involved in an accident is breathing, their responsiveness and call the emergency helpline. We were taught how to act in case of a heart attack and give CPR.” All transgender persons, who attended the workshop, received certificates on completion. Narendra Vaidya, surgeon and managing director, Lokmanya Hospital, said, “The number of patients seriously injured in road accidents is high. We see more than 15,000 accident cases every year in critical condition. Many of them need immediate surgery. Many deaths and impact of injuries can be prevented with first aid if casualties are treated immediately during the golden hour.” This initiative will be extended to residents of housing societies, corporate employees, autorickshaw and bus drivers as well. In Pune, around 145 deaths, caused by road accidents, were reported from January to August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospital-trains-transgenders-to-be-first-responders-to-mishaps/articleshow/86329820.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Apps just a click away for daily help in mental illness||NEW DELHI: A person suffering from mental illness in India might find treatment, but it would be near impossible to find guidance for managing functional problems in daily life. Disha and Saksham, two apps developed by the psychiatry division of AIIMS in collaboration with Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, aim to change this. While Disha is focused on helping newly diagnosed patients of schizophrenia and other severe psychotic disorders, Saksham is meant to help those suffering from chronic illness. The apps have been used successfully by 25 patients and, the researchers reported, they plan to roll them out for the public by January 2022. “The computer engineers involved in the project are currently working to ensure the safety of patient data,” said Dr Mamta Sood, professor of psychiatry at AIIMS, who is also one of the project developers. These apps will be available in English and Hindi. Once individuals download the app and fill in the details about their illness, it will display information about the nature and course of the disease and the treatment and management of its side-effects. The app will also have the option to update details about compliance on medication and daily self-care tasks, Sood added. In the movie A Beautiful Mind, actor Russel Crowe plays the role of mathematician John Nash who suffered from schizophrenia and had delusions and hallucinations.  Constant engagement with doctors, support from family members and at the place of work help the mathematician recover considerably. While this is ideal, the AIIMS doctor revealed there weren’t enough mental health professionals in India, resulting in a treatment gap. According to the World Mental Health Atlas Report, 2017, there are only 0.29 psychiatrists per 100,000 population in India. Child psychiatrists are rarer. The availability of psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and other paid mental health workers that form the backbone of mental healthcare in western countries is also scarce, according to experts. The patients and their caregivers still trawl the internet for information on disease management. But online sources are often not reliable, caution researchers. Also, caregivers too need encouragement. The mobile apps developed by AIIMS and IIIT Delhi experts will have features to motivate them, one example of this being pop-up messages of encouragement to caregivers and questions seeking to know their well-being. The apps provide an opportunity to consider the physical health of a patient, an aspect that is often neglected. “The apps have options to feed data on the weight, blood pressure and other key parameters in addition to suggestions such as eating healthy and leading an active life,” disclosed Sood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/apps-just-a-click-away-for-daily-help-in-mental-illness/articleshow/86327913.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The group has filed for an Indian patent. “Triboelectric effect is a known phenomenon for a long time, in which charges are generated when two surfaces are in friction. The best example we see are sparkling lights while moving blankets/jackets. Lately it has been extensively investigated as a practical alternative for energy harvesting,” said Khare. The electronics and information technology ministry and the science and technology department have supported the project under NNetRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/iit-d-device-generates-power-to-run-gadgets/articleshow/86327965.cms||---

The ED has sent a letter to the state police asking for details of FIRs or any possible offences of money laundering connected with the officers mentioned in the letter. The central agency, as per sources, has sought the details as part of a preliminary probe into suspicious activities by the police officers which are connected to money laundering. ED has sought details of two inspector-level officers, an ASI and a civil police officer as part of the inquiry. The officers in question are working in Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. Sources said that the agency has received information about suspected money laundering activities. The preliminary inquiry was launched before registering a case, said a source. The letter was sent to the state police chief and vigilance director by a senior officer of the ED. ED suspects that the officers own assets disproportionate to their known source of income amassed through corrupt practices.

Sharma was speaking at the awareness campaign of Aarogya Vatika organised by NBT Lucknow and PHD Chamber of Commerce (UP Chapter). “Every household in our country has been using plants with medicinal properties since centuries. Some even worship them. Though these age-old customs and usage of these plants had been forgotten by many, after Covid-19, people understood their importance again and have started using them in their daily life. Our aim is to make the students understand this too and begin Aarogya Vatika initiative in every school,” said Sharma. Aarogya Vatika is a special health corner initiated by Navbharat Times where herbs and plants with high medicinal value and the ones that are immunity boosters will be planted in various city parks in different areas to make citizens aware about the health benefits of these plants available in our surroundings. Speaking on the occasion, scientist at the Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), Rehmankhera, RA Ram highlighted how the public could grow plants at home through kitchen gardens and terrace gardens and how waste could be converted into compost. Panelists threw light on properties of various medicinal plants and how we can consume them in illness. Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) scientist Rajesh Verma said the patients who have been suffering from fever should consume 'Kalmegh' (green chiretta). Similarly those who are suffering from Ulcer or Sciatica can use Sarpagandha (Indian Snakeroot), which can be easily planted and grown at home. Consuming the plants with medicinal properties also benefits in controlling diabetes and obesity, he added. Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) has also started using new techniques in its projects through which results in increasing carbon credit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-up-schools-colleges-to-get-aarogya-vatikas/articleshow/86331633.cms||---

The initiative is also implemented as part of taking the first step towards earmarking areas exclusively for cycling under the smart city project. Besides, initiatives will be launched in 75 urban public spaces in the city as part of the event. Thiruvananthapuram is one among the smart cities taking part in ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, an initiative of the union government as part of celebrating 75 years of Independence. The ministry of housing and urban affairs has directed that the cities may undertake a 75 hour urban transformation mission as part of reimagining public spaces in smart cities. “We are identifying 75 spots in the city which will assume a new look in 75 hours. Besides, an exclusive cycling track will be launched as part of the event. These will be pilot initiatives and based on feasibility, we will undertake activities to sustain the good initiatives,” said Vinay Goel, CEO, smart city Thiruvananthapuram limited. It is planning to convert the corridor from the corporation main office - Vellayambalam - Kowdiar - Pattom - PMG and back to the corporation main office (seven km stretch) for conducting events like marathons and cycling events. It is being planned as a loop and will cover a distance of seven kilometres. Plans are also afoot to engage college students on a competitive mode to identify and transform 75 urban public spaces with quick, cost-effective solutions. The idea is to recreate urban public spaces through place making initiatives towards turning it environment and pedestrian friendly. College students can identify locations within the city limits and pitch designs for urban transformation. The change could be temporary or semi-permanent. There shall be minimal need for digging, excavation or any activities that would affect the utility cables. According to the project officials, the design intervention should ideally aim to offer a good solution to the needs of the poor and marginalized neighbourhoods and vendors. The proposals will be screened and vetted by the nodal person from each chosen college. The district development committee had discussed the proposal for a cycle corridor in 2018. The project aimed at developing Pipeline road from city to Aruvikkara as an exclusive cycle track and walkway. Pipeline road was an unpaved road laid by KWA to lay the huge transmission pipeline in 1933 which connects Vellayambalam to Aruvikkara. The cycle track was planned on the 12 km stretch from Peroorkada to Aruvikkara exempting several intersections in the stretch from Vellayambalam to Peroorkada. However, the KWA had expressed concerns regarding the implementation of the project. The corporation had also conceived a similar project and it was decided that the district panchayat and corporation would execute the scheme together. The civic body had even included budget allocation for the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/selected-stretches-to-turn-into-cycling-track-for-75-hrs/articleshow/86303144.cms||Aswin J Kumar

"Discussed recent developments in the Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan with my friend FM @JY_LeDrian._Looking forward to our New York meeting," Jaishankar tweeted. France is one of India's closest strategic partners and in the Indo-Pacific Region, India, France and Australia have begun a trilateral whose interests and activities could even converge with the Quad in the future. However, with France having withdrawn its envoys from both Canberra and Washington, the trilateral might be in a tough spot for some time. Questioned about this, Australian envoy to India, Barry O'Farrell, said Australia continues to consider France to be a key strategic partner. Paris recalled its ambassadors to Australia and the US in protest against a deal among the United States, Australia and Britain (AUKUS) to supply Australia with a fleet of at least eight nuclear-power submarines. This led to scrapping of Australia's 66 billion dollar 2016 deal with French majority state-owned Naval Group for supply of 12 conventional diesel-electric submarines. The India-France conversation covered a couple of important issues - the EU launching its Indo-Pacific strategy a day after AUKUS was announced, which will have implications for the EU-India relationship too. The EU strategy statement said it would "explore ways to ensure enhanced naval deployments by the EU member-states to help protect the sea lanes of communication and freedom of navigation". The question will be how much military muscle the EU countries would be willing to deploy in the Indo-Pacific. On Afghanistan, France and India see interests converging. Unlike many countries in the EU, France has taken a tougher stand on Taliban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jaishankar-french-minister-hold-talks-on-indo-pacific-afghanistan/articleshow/86333499.cms||Indrani Bagchi

At a meeting inaugurated by Thazhathangady Imam Ellavupalam Shamsudheen Mannani on Saturday, the committee hit out at Vasavan over his remark and said that it was an insult to those opposed to the bishop’s statement. The committee slammed CPM for supporting the bishop. CPM’s statements warning of deliberate efforts by communal forces to lure professional college students for extremist purposes makes the party more dangerous than BJP, it pointed out. The meeting urged the government to take immediate action against those propagating hatred. After meeting the bishop on Friday, Vasavan had said that he is a “scholarly person” and “terrorists” are trying to stir up a controversy over his ‘narcotic jihad’ remark. Meanwhile, in an article in “Deepika” newspaper, widely circulated among the Catholic community, the CPM circular cautioning its cadres about attempts to recruit professional college students for terrorist activities was pointed out as the proof for what the bishop had said in his speech.

The documents were withheld over him not submitting a bond of Rs 2 lakh during his studies in lieu of one-year service in rural areas. While directing the authorities to return the documents to Neil Ramesh Patel, who was admitted to a GMERS college in 2015, Justice Bhargav Karia told the government lawyer, “You cannot retain original documents for any fault committed by the student.” The judge was of the view that there is no rule that empowers the government to withhold original documents, and the rules stipulate that the government has to return documents as soon as the admission process gets over. The student was against executing the bond since the beginning, and his medical studies were completed without having tendered the bond. The government did not return his documents including marksheets and certificates. The student’s father moved the high court complaining that the government’s withholding of his son’s original documents and not issuing him a certificate for his medical studies would adversely affect his son’s career immediately, particularly his plans to go abroad. The state government tried to defend its withholding of the documents and argued that returning them would set a bad example. To this, Justice Karia said, “This will rather set a correct example for all institutes, that they cannot withhold students’ documents.” After the high court assumed this strict posture, the government conceded and told the court that the district collector would initiate proceedings against the student for recovery of the bond amount. This did not go down well with the court, and the judge said that the authority can do anything permissible under law for recovery, but it has no right to retain the student’s documents. It cannot ruin the student’s career without any reason, particularly for its own fault to execute the bond at the beginning of the course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-orders-govt-to-return-medicos-papers/articleshow/86328102.cms||---

Neighbouring state governments have not taken any action so far to support the farmers, he claimed. Kejriwal said, on its own, Delhi’s air was clean and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Saturday was just 69, which falls into the ‘satisfactory’ category. Track the pollution level in your city“Delhi’s air quality will deteriorate from mid-October (due to stubble burning). State governments have not taken any action to support their farmers. On its own, Delhi’s air is clean. On September 18, 2021, the AQI for Delhi is 69 (0 to 50 – Good, 51 to 100 – Satisfactory),” Kejriwal tweeted. The PM 10 concentration was 67 micrograms per cubic metre and the PM 2.5 concentration was 27 micrograms per cubic metre, he added. The 24-hour standards for PM 10 and PM 2.5 are 100 and 60 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. Delhi generally starts recording a spike in pollution with a drop in temperature, aided by stubble burning that picks up pace from the second week of October onwards. As the wind direction changes, pollutants are blown towards Delhi and studies have shown that the contribution to stubble burning in Delhi’s overall PM 2.5 concentration can go up to 44 per cent in a single day.

On Saturday, chief minister, Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurated them in a programme organised at Haryana Niwas. In the first phase, RTDAS has been installed at 90 places across the state. Speaking on the occasion, the CM said as water gets scarce, it becomes essential to manage it. The circumstances are emerging from different studies that if water is being exploited in the same manner, then there is a possibility of a desert-like situation in the upcoming years, he added. He said the Haryana government had prepared a two-year plan for water management last year. Under this, Mera Pani Meri Virasat Yojana is getting good public response, as an incentive of Rs 7,000 is being provided to the farmers’ for adopting the scheme. Khattar also said the Haryana government is also implementing Jal Jeevan Mission and other water management schemes across the state. CM Khattar said RTDAS will enable the tracking of water released into the canal. If there is a case of water theft in the middle of the canal, then a message will be sent to the officer concerned alerting him of the reason why water has been reduced at tail end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-installs-90-rdas-in-the-state-so-far-khattar/articleshow/86331651.cms||---

The residents of Kaulagudda, Siddewadi, Kempawad and other villages have been bearing the brunt as Athani Sugars Limited is allegedly releasing certain chemical waste into water bodies, according to the villagers. They also allege that the contaminated water is also affecting the crops and that they are now forced to fetch drinking water from far away places. Patil is chairman and managing director of Athani Sugars Limited. Despite villagers approaching the factory administration, they denied any wrongdoing, saying that they release little waste into river. However, the villagers claim that the waste flows into lakes and agricultural fields during monsoons. The residents have also filed a complaint with the Pollution Control Board. “A black thick liquid is released into nearby lakes due to which open wells are also contaminated. The factory has been doing this from past ten years and now pollution level intolerable. We see the black liquid on our fields too now,” said farmer Ramesh Wagmore. Speaking to TOI, Shrishail T, a farmer from Kagwad said the waters of open wells and tube wells reek of chemical waste and it is not potable any more. “The district administration has to intervene and resolve the issue immediately,” Pollution control board official Jagadish H said the department has collected the samples of the waste and sent it for testing after conducting a survey as directed by the tahsildar. “It appears there is a problem in these villages and soon it will be addressed,” he assured. Denying allegations levelled by the villagers, Patil said the factory is equipped with effluent treatment plant at a cost of Rs 45 crore. “During rains, some amount of chemical waste may have flown to agricultural lands, but it does not have the potential to damage the crops,” he said. He termed the protest an attempt to defame him and his factory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-mla-patils-sugar-factory-causing-water-pollution-allege-villagers/articleshow/86326081.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi
---||Kolkata||Cops, banks delve into fraud traits||Kolkata: Most online bank frauds take place on second and fourth Fridays, the criminals knowing all too well that not all banks have a 24X7 nodal staff who can liaison with police on the weekend. Similarly, most bank fraudsters prefer to use mobile phone apps (instead of computers and laptops that are slower and more likely to be traced) to target victims. Mobile phones are easier to dump and less costly too. These were some of the recent traits of fraudsters that came up for discussion in a meeting between police officers of the cyber cell, the anti-bank fraud section of the detective department and senior officials and top management of several banks. At the end of the discussions on Saturday, cops have come up with nine specific suggestions to make online banking more secure and to stop bank frauds. According to sources, at least five to six of these suggestions have already been implemented in private banks and even a few public ones. “We now want even public sector banks to adopt these best practices to cut down on bank frauds. Two major suggestions are implementing the device and SIM mining (to stop SIM swap frauds) and appointing nodal officers who will be available 24X7 and work with cops to act immediately on any complaint,” claimed a source. “DC (cyber) Bididha Kalita, along with officers of cyber police station and anti-bank fraud section — held coordination meetings with regional managers of banks and mobile service providers to discuss ways and means to prevent cyber and bank fraud crimes,” tweeted joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. However, sources said that the maximum discussion veered around a detective department request to banks to delay high-value transactions from one account to another by four to six hours so that victims and cops get time to react and halt fraudulent transactions. The banks, though, have clarified that this is impractical and not mandated by RBI. “Not only is this impractical, this will go against the very purpose of mobile banking. However, we have asked the cops that we are ready to help in other possible ways,” said a bank official present in the meeting. The meeting also discussed in detail the presence of Jamtara type gangs in specific pockets of the city like Kestopur, Newtown and some other parts of North 24 Parganas. The police shared details of multiple raids carried out earlier this month across five locations Kolkata and its outskirts - all of them carried out simultaneously to ensure no one could escape - leading to the arrest of 16 such persons. The accused, claimed police, hail mostly from Jamtara, Giridih and Dhanbad in Jharkhand. The meeting ended with an unanimous decision that awareness drives on the importance of OTPs will be organized by both police and the banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-banks-delve-into-fraud-traits/articleshow/86328106.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The accused identified as Hiralal Nisar was nabbed by AFS personnel immediately after he jumped the wall of the restricted zone along the national highway-48. Nisar, a resident of Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, was handed over to Harni police station where an offence of trespassing and under the Official Secrets Act was registered against him. During interrogation, Nisar told cops that he decided to jump the wall after seeing an AFS employee on the watch tower as he wanted food. “The accused said that he thought that the man on the watch tower looked like a soldier so he would give him food,” said a police official. Besides the local cops, Nisar was also interrogated by the officials of the central and state intelligence bureau. Nisar also told cops that he reached Vadodara from Surat by walking along the highway. On the way, he ate whatever people gave him. Cops found a few chocolates and bananas from him. “We found his family’s contact details and contacted them. They said that they had been searching for him since he left home three months ago,” the police official said. Nisar said that he had taken a train to Surat where he worked as a security guard for some days but was removed from the job. He has been admitted to a mental health hospital in Karelibaug for examination. “His family members are expected to reach Vadodara next week. Meanwhile, we have asked the doctors at the hospital to examine him and report about his mental health condition,” a cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mentally-ill-man-trespasses-into-air-force-station/articleshow/86327949.cms||---

Meera, 23, wife of Midhun of Palamoottil house, Kalluvathukkal, who is residing at Parippally raised the complaint against the government hospitals following her delivery of a still born at the government medical college, Parippally, on Wednesday. According to Meera, she went to Ramarao memorial taluk hospital, Nedungolam, Paravoor, government Victoria women's hospital, Kollam, and SAT hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, in the last few days following severe stomach pain. On September 12 she went to the Nedungolam taluk hospital where she was getting examined since the beginning of pregnancy. But the doctors there referred her to Victoria hospital, Kollam. Citing that she came without a woman bystander the authorities there did not admit her. Instead, she was referred to the SAT hospital on September 13. Meera and her husband came to the casualty of the SAT hospital on the same day. But the doctors there did not even examine her, instead told her that there was nothing to worry about and sent her back. As her pain increased she reached the medical college hospital, Parippally, on September 15. In the scanning done there the doctors found that the baby was not moving. Within half an hour she delivered the stillborn. Doctors said the mother’s life also could have been in danger if she had contracted any infection as she was carrying the stillborn for days. Meera, though out of danger, is undergoing treatment at the medical college hospital. The couple has two sons. Responding to the issue, District Medical officer Dr R Sreelatha told media that she could not make a comment without an enquiry. However, she said she has ordered a probe into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pregnant-woman-denied-care-by-3-govt-hosps-kin/articleshow/86303213.cms||---

AP also developed 9,397 chance fingerprints from crime scenes in 2020. The annual report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) says Andhra Pradesh police developed 9,418 and 9,397 chance fingerprints in 2019 and 2020, respectively, followed by Kerala (8,807), Telangana (6,256), Tamil Nadu (6,021), Uttar Pradesh (5,108), and Karnataka (3,808). The data also show that Andhra Pradesh police solved 412 cases with the help of chance fingerprints in 2020 and stood at third position in the country in this category after Kerala (657 cases) and Karnataka (517 cases). In 2019, AP police solved 512 cases with the help of chance fingerprints. Speaking to TOI, sub-inspector of police (fingerprints wing) of Vizag Police Commissionerate T Vijaya said chance fingerprints are minute clues, such as fingerprints and traces left by offenders at the crime scene. In some cases, they collect more chance prints that are further divided into three categories such as patent (blood, dirt and few others that are visible to the human eye), plastic (which are three-dimensional impression of the fingerprints left in soap and wax) and latent (that require special techniques and the use of powder for detection of fingerprints). “At present we are using the software AFIS Papillon for criminal identification system. Soon, police forces across country will use real time criminal identification system National Automated Fingerprint Identification System, which will collect fingerprints of criminals in country and have them in one place,” she added. A senior police officer said fingerprints play a major role in determining evidence and helping investigation officers detect the accused. A case involving the theft of Rs 9.59 lakh from an ATM in Vizag city was solved with the help of chance fingerprints in November 2020. Police arrested one Samar Jyot Singh (35) from Punjab and Zagar Sadeeq (28) from Kerala. With the help of the fingerprints, police visited Bengaluru and nabbed the duo, who were also involved in robbing Rs 27 lakh from an ATM in Bhubaneswar. The NCRB mentions that in the robbery on October 22, 2020 in Vizag, the offenders entered the ATM and broke the case box with a cash cutter and decamped with Rs 9.59 lakh. Fingerprints expert, T Triveni, visited the crime scene the same day and developed 25 chance prints. After comparing the prints with those on the records of State Finger Print Bureau and CID, five were found to match with those of Samar Jyot Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/art-of-detection-ap-cops-top-in-developing-criminal-fingerprints/articleshow/86328083.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Delhi||Record rain, clear sky, but no good air day||New Delhi: For the last couple of days, Delhiites have been seeing an azure sky above their heads. And while people have been taking to social media to highlight the fact, Delhi’s air has actually failed to be in the ‘good’ category in recent days to validate the blue skies. Central Pollution Control Board classifies air as ‘good’ when the air quality index (AQI) is at the 50 or lower mark over a 24-hour period. By this reckoning, Delhi has failed to record a single such day this year, despite recording five good air days in 2020, four of which came in rainy August.CPCB’s daily bulletin is an indicator. Carbon monoxide (CO) and ground-level ozone (O3) are emerging as the prominent pollutants for the day, other than PM10, or coarse pollutants, and PM2.5, which are micro, respirable particles. While the former features as the prominent pollutant in 16 of the 18 days of this month so far, ozone was a prominent pollutant on three days.Despite recording relatively low AQI — hovering between 60 and 70 — high CO readings, which emerged as the prominent pollutant, may have been the reason the capital’s air quality was unable to touch the ‘good’ range. The lowest AQI recorded so far in September is 60, on September 12, a day when both O3 and CO featured prominently in the readings. Meanwhile, the highest AQI for the month was 122 (moderate), recorded on September 6 when both PM2.5 and PM10 featured as the lead pollutants in the absence of CO and O3.Carbon monoxide (CO) is primarily generated from vehicles as exhaust emissions, while it is also an indicator of other sources of combustion.Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), pointed out that September has seen intense rains this year and while PM2.5 and PM10 have remained low, the emergence of CO indicates the impact of the vehicular sector, which becomes more prominent when rain settles down the pollutants in the air. “Particulate matter settles down, but gases are still prominent in the air,” she said. “CO as the lead pollutant means it is generally due to vehicles, because the major chunk of the gas, 80- 90% comes from vehicles. Ozone is also created in a similar way.” Chowdhury said good air was difficult to achieve unless multiple sources were acted upon.Experts said the high Carbon monoxide concentration could affect the amount of oxygen in the body and. It is known as a ‘silent killer’, especially in closed spaces. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said CO was generated by poor engine performance and was released due to unburnt fuel. “Unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide are released into the air and it is a dangerous gas. Therefore, it has 1-hour and 8-hour standards, as opposed to PM10 and PM2.5, which are measured over 24 hours,” explained Saha.Meanwhile, O3 is formed by primary pollutants and gases reacting in the presence of sunlight. At the ground level, the gas can be particularly dangerous to those with respiratory problems or asthma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/record-rain-clear-sky-but-no-good-air-day/articleshow/86328440.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The arrest of Dr Satish Mohite (49) on Friday was the seventh in the case. The police said the doctor had received money in his bank accounts from the fund meant for patients from the economically weaker sections of society. Mohite runs two hospitals, Ashtavinayak Hospital and Arogyadhan in Wagle Estate in Thane. The 2019 case involves charges of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. During the investigation it transpired that between November 2016 and August 2019, Rs 89 lakh was transferred into two bank accounts which were in the name of Mohite. The police said a little over Rs 1 crore was siphoned off from the relief fund. The police said that Mohite also transferred large sums of money from these two bank accounts to the accounts of the main accused in the case, Arti Sighvan alias Amrute. The case goes back to August 2019, when the crime branch arrested Dr Anil Nagrale, Sighvan, her husband, Nitin Amrute, and alleged touts Sandesh Mogvira,Vijay Ghatlikar and Ganesh Mudaliar for siphoning off Rs 75 lakh from the fund by submitting fake bills of 64 bogus patients from Sharda Hospital in Thane. The police said the accused submitted the 64 bogus applications of people who were shown to be suffering from life threatening diseases. The application were attached with fake laboratory reports and the bills were sanctioned from the chief Minister Relief Fund, said police officials. The police said they had arrested six accused and filed the chargesheet against them, and kept the investigations open after taking permissions from the court. A total of 117 witness statements, including of star witnesses, were recorded.

---||Delhi||64% of Delhi’s winter pollution not its doing||NEW DELHI: With winter approaching, Delhi could soon find itself in the all too familiar scenario of being enveloped in smog. However, only 36% of this is Delhi’s own doing. Track the pollution level in your cityA recent source-apportionment study jointly conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) indicates that 64% of PM2.5 pollutants blow into Delhi from upwind areas in the neighbouring states, the rest being locally generated. This again highlights the need for an ‘air-shed’ approach to tackling air pollution in the region. Vehicle emissions are said to account for as much as 30% of the PM2.5 load of Delhi in winter. The other contributors are biomass burning (23%), industries (20%) and dust and construction (16%). This source-apportionment study, the most recent for Delhi, was done in 2018. While Delhi government awarded the contract for a real-time study in 2020 to Washington University, it was later deemed unsatisfactory and the new study was awarded to TERI, IIT Delhi and IIT Kanpur. The results are expected this winter. According to the TERI study, Delhi also contributes 40% to Noida’s winter pollution. Overall, Delhi’s share in the pollution in NCR towns is an average of 16%, signifying cross-boundary transmission of pollutants. The report says, “The average contribution of Delhi’s own emissions in its PM2.5 concentrations was found to be 36% in winters and 26% in summers. In summers, the contribution of outside sources is higher on account of higher wind speeds and enhanced atmospheric transport of pollutants. In the NCR towns, the contribution of emissions from Delhi city varies as per their location with respect to Delhi and prevailing wind directions. Noida city, which is downwind of Delhi, receives 28% and 40% of its PM2.5 concentrations from Delhi-based sources in summer and winter seasons, respectively,” Experts say treating the region as an airshed is crucial if winter pollution is to be tackled efficiently. In its winter action plan, Delhi government has indeed listed inter-state coordination as a key focus area, with environment minister Gopal Rai endorsing an airshed approach. Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board’s air laboratory, said air pollution cannot be restricted to a region and the entire Indo-Gangetic plains are affected every winter. “As an airshed region, the entire NCR region can be taken into account, even Punjab and Haryana, where stubble-burning pollutants originate,” said Saha. “Each state needs to act on its sources simultaneously to bring about overall improvement. If only one state improves its air, wind-borne pollutants from neighbouring states can still nullify the efforts.” Talking about fixing Delhi’s air pollution problem, Karthik Ganesan, fellow and director (research and coordination), Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “The main focus of curbing winter pollution should be to rely on high fidelity forecasting tools that prepare agencies in advance of events of various levels of severity. Timely enforcement of systems such as the Graded Response Action Plan is critical. Restricting activities alone will not suffice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/64-of-delhis-winter-pollution-not-its-doing/articleshow/86328470.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The deceased, C Sathiya, an assistant surgeon at the government hospital in Hosur, was travelling along with her mother-in-law Jayam Ammal, 67, who was rescued. The Keeranur police said the underpass was flooded after a heavy downpour in the area since evening. “Unaware that the stagnant water was deep enough to submerge the car, Dr Sathiya drove on,” said sub-inspector of police B Abdul Razzak. He said the car got stuck when it neared the middle of the underpass where the water was deep. “As the car stopped, she tried to escape but could not unfasten the seatbelt. She got suffocated and died,” the officer told TOI. A truck coming in the opposite direction was also grounded in the flooded underpass. Razak said the driver of the truck who saw the doctor struggling to get out sought help from local people who managed to rescue Jayam Ammal. While the SI said Jayam was in the front seat, deputy superintendent of police Sivasubramanian and revenue divisional officer (RDO) of Iluppur M S Balathandayudhapani said the woman was in the back seat. Local people managed to pull out Sathiya from the car and rush her to hospital but their efforts went in vain. Government medical college hospital dean Dr M Poovathi said Sathiya was brought dead. DSP Sivasubramanian said the woman died due to suffocation inside the car. She is survived by her husband Sivakumar, 40, a native of Thudaiyur, and two children. Though post-mortem was performed on the body, it has been kept at the mortuary for a close relative to return from abroad. Meanwhile, irate local people blocked the road in the night protesting against the lack of safety measure from the railways to keep the underpass, which comes under Madurai railway division, risk-free. The police managed to convince the people to abandon the protest. On Saturday, a peace committee meeting headed by RDO Balathandayudhapani was convened. “Railways should have undertaken safety measures to drain out the water whenever it rained but they failed to do so. As demanded by the people, the unmanned railway gate has been reopened and the underpass closed,” the RDO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/doc-chokes-to-death-in-car-stuck-in-flooded-underpass/articleshow/86329995.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After the meeting, which lasted for 10 minutes, Sudhakaran told reporters that his visit was not a planned one. He said that he calls on Natesan whenever he arrives in Alappuzha. It is after a long gap that a head of the state Congress is visiting Natesan. In the last assembly elections, Natesan had launched scathing attacks on Congress leaders while publicly supporting LDF. Later, Sudhakaran attended a meeting of Alappuzha DCC. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, he termed those leaving Congress as “trash”. When K P Anilkumar left the party after serving for 32 years, not one person went with him, he said. None has gone with the three individuals who left Congress to join CPM. If a leader does not even have 10 followers after all these years, he is of no use to the party.

Teachers said most students are keen to complete the assignment.In Madurai district, government schools have adopted ‘do and drop’ method for the assignments. “Through WhatsApp or phone calls, we give the assignments. Cardboard boxes are kept in schools for each class where parents can drop off submissions. Teachers make a record of assignments submitted and return them to parents with corrections. A majority of students are submitting the assignments promptly,” said S Sasithra, headmistress, Government Model GHSS, Othakadai. Teachers are also connecting with students through WhatsApp or phone calls on their studies and clearing doubts.“Around 80% of students are completing their assignments and submitting them. Parents are also supportive as this is something that is keeping students engaged because otherwise they are too distracted and don’t sit down to study,” said K Anand Raman, headmaster, Government HSS, T Kallupatti, and legal secretary, Tamil Nadu Higher Secondary School Headmasters’ Association. While teachers were reaching out to students through WhatsApp and phone calls last year too, this year the response has been better as students have to do assignments and record them now.“Though teachers were sending assignments since the start of the pandemic, it was neither compulsory nor were teachers properly monitoring or recording what the students were doing,” said K Lakshmi, parent of a Class VI student. She said giving such assignments is helpful for there to be a structure rather than just watch video lessons. At the same time, some government school teachers expressed concern over the effectiveness of giving assignments. “We can say only 25% are dutifully submitting the assignments. Without having regular school, students are finding it hard to pick up lessons and so they are unable to properly do their work. We are trying our best to guide them,” said the headmaster of a government middle school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/do-and-drop-assignments-see-good-response/articleshow/86329989.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Kolkata||Teachers volunteer to hold classes from labs as schools focus on practical sessions||Kolkata: Teachers in several city schools have volunteered to visit the campus and hold lab practical lessons from laboratories, especially for the board year children because they felt practical sessions were seriously hampered last year. When schools affiliated to the CISCE and CBSE boards re-opened for classes IX-XII briefly in February for less than a month, the focus for board year students was on practical sessions and back-to-back sessions were held to help kids cope with the backlog. But this time, schools are taking no chances. They feel that theory lessons can be smoothly finished with teachers lecturing online, but practical sessions should start off with teachers showing the experiments from school labs for the time being. While lab work is mandatory for CBSE X board exams, CISCE children are formally required to do experiments for board exams only at the Plus II level (ISC). However, at the class X (ICSE) level, students are required to explain concepts by writing experiments and that requires teachers to explain by performing them in the laboratories. So the online class routine of XI and XII at St Augustine’s Day School (Shyamnagar) has been re-laid so that chemistry, physics and biology practical classes can be woven into the weekly schedule. Most science teachers at South City International School have started engaging children in lab experiments that they are performing from school. DPS Ruby Park and DPS Newtown are planning to set routines for science teachers to come in for practical lessons. At Heritage School, teachers have been allowed to take the decision themselves and most science teachers are already visiting school according to routines that they have set to take the board children through lab practical sessions. “We have also decided that if schools re-open post pujas, we will make kids finish their practical syllabus first because the rest can be covered online,” said principal Seema Sapru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-volunteer-to-hold-classes-from-labs-as-schools-focus-on-practical-sessions/articleshow/86328148.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

They expressed disappointment over the DMK government not making a mention on implementing the old pension scheme in the recent budget session. Representatives of various government department staff associations, teachers, college faculty federations as well as retired employees expressed their hopes in this regard at the state-level meeting of CPS Abolition Movement here on Saturday. State coordinator of the associations B Friedrich Engels said more than six lakh government employees across ranks and teachers are covered under CPS. “We have been fighting against CPS and demanding implementation of the old pension scheme over the last 18 years. More than 22,000 government employees have retired from service under the CPS and many of them have even passed away during the said period. He said the AIADMK government covered up a report on CPS that was studied by an expert committee formed by it. However they were hopeful as the government had promised to consider the recommendations of the expert committee despite the financial crunch. The movement will organise a series of events from October to grab the attention of the government on their demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/scrap-cps-bring-back-old-pension-scheme-govt-staff/articleshow/86330023.cms||---

After a long legal battle in various courts, including the high court, the Chengalpet district court gave a verdict in favour of the government,” revenue minister KKSSR Ramachandran told reporters after inspecting the reclaimed land along with health minister Ma Subramanian. “The trust had built hostels on the encroached land. Girl students were staying in those hostels. The officials were instructed to discuss with the college management on making alternative arrangements for the students before evicting them. They will be given sufficient time,” he further said. “The value of the reclaimed land was calculated in 2012 as Rs 1,000 crore. It would have reached Rs 2,000 crore in the next nine years,” Ramachandran said. “Chief minister M K Stalin has asked us to clear encroachments on government lands. He has also asked us to reclaim leased government land parcels if they are not used for purposes stipulated in the lease agreement,” the minister said. The state government has also sent a notice to all district collectors seeking details about encroachments on government lands and pending cases. “We will retrieve all government land from private parties as the state government is in need of land for development activities. For example, we are not able to provide land to health department for building hospitals in prime areas due to encroachments. So, we will remove those encroachments and handover the lands for implementing government schemes,” he said.

IMD said this was due to cyclonic circulation over Bay of Bengal, whose movement is in the west north-westerly direction and is likely to bring heavy rain at isolated places in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar. A yellow alert (heavy rain at isolated places) for the three districts has been issued from September 21. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD, said, “There is cyclonic circulation over Bay of Bengal, whose movement is west northwesterly. Due to this, Maharashtra will be impacted, and parts of Marathwada, Vidarbha and Konkan may witness rain. Mumbai and adjoining areas may also see heavy rain at isolated places.” For Sunday, IMD has issued a light to moderate rain spell warning in the city and suburbs. The dry spell over the last 24 hours has seen neither IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatory record rain. This season so far, Colaba recorded 2,185.3mm rain, while Santacruz recorded 2,841.6mm. Maximum temperature due to the dry weather hovered around 31-32 degrees.

This year too, with the Covid restrictions in place, the temples remained closed to devotees. But, large crowds were seen standing outside the temples and offering worship.Flower sellers and lamp sellers witnessed good business as people bought them for offering and lighting them up. In the Thiruvannamalai Seenivasa Perumal temple in Srivilliputtur, nearly 200 police personnel were deployed to manage the crowds. Police checkposts were erected in five places on the three routes leading to this temple. Crowds were also seen in front of the Thirumohur temple, Tallakulam Perumal temple, Koodal Alagar temple, Alagarkoil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/puratasi-sani-temples-shut-but-crowds-worship-from-outside/articleshow/86330026.cms||---

As per the agenda, the city corporation plans to undertake an elaborate survey in five wards covering 12,546 houses in Kovalam - Vizhinjam area as part of compiling data on unauthorised constructions and houses without building numbers. The decision was made in a meeting convened in the chamber of the LSGD minister in August. The BJP which usually criticizes every agenda and calls for discussion surprisingly let the agenda pass without even asking for a debate. It was decided in the meeting convened by the minister that the civic body shall collect data on residents with pattaya land, buildings which can be regularized and other factors. The civic body was asked to compile the data within 60 days. There are 12,546 buildings in five wards under the Vizhinjam - Kovalam area spread across 1,155 hectares. Such a large area could not be covered by the existing workforce of the city corporation. Hence 15 teams comprising two members each shall be deployed for information collection in 60 days and data compilation may be done using two data entry staff. This requires an expense of 20 lakhs and may be met from the own fund. Former officials with revenue and corporation testify to countless data collection exercises done in these areas in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-spend-rs-20-lakh-on-database/articleshow/86328173.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Registrations far exceed UG vacant seats, colleges happy with response to wish lists||Kolkata: Several colleges which turned to the wish-list option, inviting candidates genuinely interested in studying there but with names low on the merit lists, have said the response has been “very good” and registrations have exceeded the number of UG vacant seats by a big margin. In case of some subjects in some colleges, the wish list registrations have crossed 1,000-1,500. Many colleges have taken the wish-list route to ramp up the admissions for vacant seats. Colleges hope this will help them speed up the admission process and fill up maximum seats by September 30, the deadline set by the higher education department. In Maulana Azad College, 1,907 students have shown interest in studying English, 1,259 have shown interest in studying history and 1,662 students have shown interest in studying zoology. “The number of students who have shown interest are much more than the number of vacant seats. Wish-list registrations in other subjects are very encouraging too. We will publish the next merit list from the names on the wish list,” said a college official. In Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, 497 seats out of 549 have been taken. The college invited interested students to register for the wish list last week. “More than 3,000 students registered, but we only have a handful of vacant seats,” said a member of the admission committee. Lady Brabourne College, too, has received a good response as far as the wish list is concerned. In many subjects, the number of students who have shown interest has exceeded 1,500. “Henceforth, merit lists will be drawn from the names on the wish list,” said a college official. In Banbgabasi College, the authorities have received over 4,000 wish list requests for all subjects together. Other colleges, like Scottish Church and Jaipuria, have already started admitting those who expressed interest on the wish lists. “Many seats have filled up after that,” said an official of Jaipuria college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/registrations-far-exceed-ug-vacant-seats-colleges-happy-with-response-to-wish-lists/articleshow/86328175.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Alagarsamy, 60, of Krishnamanayakkanpatti near Sivakasi has been into goat-herding since the age of ten. Though illiterate, his expertise in herding is much-valued in his village where agriculture is next only to fireworks in offering a livelihood. Many people rear goats in the region and also give them to goatherds to manage. In the 50-odd posters he has put up, Alagarsamy specifies his daily fee for herding goats ‘locally’ as Rs 600 and Rs 700 if it is outside the village. Those who require his services outside Virudhunagar will have to shell out Rs 1,000. The owners also have to provide him three vegetarian meals during the day. So what makes Alagarsamy’s work so special? He says he can manage around 350 goats at a time and can identify an animal and keep a head count regularly throughout the day. “Goat herding is not just another job, you have to make the animals listen to you and abide by your commands. You have to ensure that they are all safe and not injured when they are in your care,’’ says the widower, who has married off his only daughter. He says he takes immense pride in his livelihood and loves his job. Villagers vouch for his skills and say goats always remain safe in Alagarsamy’s care. “The loss of a goat could be not less than Rs 5,000, so finding good herds is tough,’’ says S Pandi, a villager. When it is the cultivation season, extra care has to be taken to ensure that goats or sheep do not stray into cultivated fields. Early in life, he used to settle for grains, vegetables or a meal as fee and later began charging less than a rupee. In recent times his fees had gone up to Rs 200 or more. Now with the increasing prices, herding costs have also gone up. He says inexperienced people get paid only about Rs 150 while experienced hands like him get Rs 300 to Rs 400. The printing of the posters had cost him Rs 1,500, which he says is necessary to stay connected with the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sivakasi-goatherd-hardsells-his-skills-via-posters/articleshow/86330044.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Ramakrishna Layout residents seek help from corpn to reclaim encroached land||Coimbatore: Residents of Ramakrishna Layout in Cheran Ma Nagar have urged city corporation officials to retrieve a piece of land earmarked as open space reserve (OSR) from an encroacher. The layout was approved by the directorate of town and country planning (DTCP) in 1990 after 10%, which is 36 cents, was shown as OSR. Meanwhile, the landowner created a separate layout for the piece of land in violation of rules and got approval from the city corporation three years ago. M Suresh, a resident, said he bought a housing plot in 1998 in his mother’s name. “I recently came to know that there was an OSR land and dug deeper to get old land records. I was surprised to know that the owner created a layout for the OSR land in a different name and is trying to sell it. I came to know through newspapers about the steps taken by the civic body recently to retrieve OSR lands. Officials should help us also,” he said. “The owner constructed a house on two cents and is getting Rs 7,000 rent from it. The rest of the land would be lost if the civic body does not act,” Suresh added. The area is being developed at a fast pace and soon there would not be any empty space left, said S Sathish Kumar, another resident. “We want to use the OSR land for recreational purposes. Our kids would not have any place to play if the land is taken away from us.” Several OSR plots across the city have been usurped by promoters and landowners, activist S P Thiyagarajan said. “In many instances, they obtained approval from local bodies after showing it as a new layout. The civic body can take criminal action against such people and retrieve the land,” he said. An official with the town planning wing of Coimbatore corporation told TOI that a team will inspect the place on Monday. “Action would be taken to retrieve the OSR land at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ramakrishna-layout-residents-seek-help-from-corpn-to-reclaim-encroached-land/articleshow/86328235.cms||V Devanathan

These include two flights a week by each of Air India and Kuwait Airlines, confirmed airport sources. These apart, a domestic flight to Indore also started operations recently by TruJet airline, according to the source. A month ago, at least five new flights, among others, began operations from the SVPI airport. These include flights to Delhi, Chennai, Kolhapur, Mumbai and Goa. Flights operations to London resumed as part of the air bubble agreement. While Dubai-bound flights were the first international operations to resume, an additional flight were recently added along the sector. Airport sources also said that another flight along the Ahmedabad-Pune flight is expected to start in the days to come. “As passenger footfalls are improving at the city airport, preference for domestic travel is going up. Therefore, airlines are more bullish on increasing frequency on existing sectors or adding more flights on newer sectors where demand is cropping up,” said a source. According to travel agents and tour operators, both corporate and leisure travel has improved. “Corporate movement is gradually picking up and the bookings are good for leisure travel as well. With this, demand for air travel has gone up and therefore, more flights may be added,” said Manish Sharma, president, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI) – Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2-flights-to-kuwait-launched-from-city/articleshow/86328199.cms||---

The accused, identified as Arijit Ghosh (34) and Amarjit Ghosh (26), both residents of Banerjee’s neighbourhood, claimed that the leader had blocked the petrol pump entrance for a long time. Police have collected CCTV footage. A case pertaining to hurt, threat, criminal intimidation and intentional insult with intent to breach peace has been recorded by the Kasba police. “Banerjee complained that around 7pm on September 17, unknown miscreants had assaulted him and threatened him with dire consequences at the Kasba petrol pump on Bosepukur Road. Banerjee said he had suffered injuries and was treated and discharged from CNMC,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Locals claimed Banerjee’s vehicle was refuelling for a long time. As vehicles began to queue up and the resultant snarl spilled on to the main road, others asked Banerjee to hurry up. Banerjee pointed out that he had little role in the hold-up. This led to an initial argument which later turned violent, claimed sources. Kasba police, too, confirmed that the incident was not a planned attack, but took place at the “spur of the moment”. Banerjee was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/locals-assault-tmc-coordinator/articleshow/86328202.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that is implanted through surgery to help people hear. RMLIMS will be the third government educational institution to provide the service in the city after KGMU and SGPGIMS. At KGMU, the implant is given to children aged 1-5 years for free by AYJNISHD, a Union government-run institute, so patients have to bear only Rs 20,000-30,000. At RMLIMS, it will cost around Rs 5 lakh. However, it will be far lower than the charges at private establishments. The facility at RMLIMS will lessen the burden on KGMU and SGPGIMS where about 600 such children come annually for implantation and the waiting period is long. “About four children with complete hearing loss by birth come here every week. Now, a dedicated OPD will be run every Tuesday for them,” said associate professor ENT department Dr Ashish Chandra. The implant contains two parts: the first is surgically implanted into the temporal bones while the other is externally placed into the ear. Chandra added that the implant’s switch is turned on one month after the surgery. Thereafter, children have to undergo speech therapy every other day so that they can listen and speak like a normal person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cochlear-implant-for-kids-at-rmlims-soon/articleshow/86331668.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The matter has to be taken up by Supreme Court on September 20 and Haryana government wanted to find a solution before the court hearing. The meeting had been called by the Sonipat deputy commissioner at Murthal. Farmers said neither they were impleaded as a party in the court hearing nor did the Supreme Court give any specific direction to the farmers about this. SKM legal cell member Prem Singh Bhangu said the Supreme Court on January 12 had clearly stated that farmers had the right to peacefully protest. “Now a woman has approached the SC for getting the way to Delhi vacated and court has asked Haryana government to look for way out. Haryana government has formed a high powered committee (HPC) to speak to SKM and a meeting was called for Sunday, but we are not impleaded as party in the court, nor has the court given any specific order to farmers, so we have decided not to attend the meeting,” he said. Meanwhile, the HPC. headed by ACS (home) Rajeev Arora, is likely to arrive in Sonipat on Saturday night or Sunday morning. Home minister Anil Vij is still hopeful of a solution. Farm leaders also made it clear that they would be open to talks only if the discussion was related to repealing the three laws. Vij said he had empowered the HPC to negotiate on the issue of opening of roads. “This is the highest committee and is vested with all powers to negotiate on part of the government. Let the meeting happen,” said Vij. He confirmed that Charuni had expressed inability to join the meeting. “Else, all members of SKM have received the message. We are expecting them to join the dialogue,” added Vij. Objection to Charuni’s politics In the meanwhile, farm groups from Punjab have taken serious note of political activities being undertaken by Haryana-based farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni under Mission Punjab, asking Punjab farm leaders to contest elections to grab power to take pro-farmer decisions. They have decided to make an appeal to Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) to restrain Charuni from taking such actions or take action against him. Farm leader Bogh Singh Mansa said they had asked political parties of Punjab on September 10 not to campaign till election process was announced, but Charuni too was violating this edict and talking politics at rallies in Punjab. “He has planned another rally on Sunday. Going by all this, we have decided to take up the matter with SKM in the next meeting whenever it is held to ask them either to restrain Charuni from going further on the matter or take action against him, if he does not stop his activities,” said Mansa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-not-to-attend-haryana-govt-talks-on-freeing-way-to-delhi/articleshow/86331672.cms||Manvir Saini

However, tipplers seem to be an exception and they were seen crowding Tasmac outlets on Saturday to stock enough liquor for Sunday, when the district administration has announced the total lockdown to control Covid-19 spread. While stalls selling meat and fish were kept open till 9pm, they didn’t report any rush on the day. Traders said while the sale was normal throughout the day, the same picked up after 5pm, as people turned out for purchase after work. They attributed the low turnout to the Tamil month of Purattasi. J Aakash, a resident of Ukkadam, said he would usually purchase only fresh meat. “But given the complete lockdown, I decided to purchase meat today (Saturday). We have some relatives visiting us on Sunday. We also purchased some fish, as the prices were reasonable.” The malls and other commercial areas in the city witnessed only a normal crowd on the day. Things were not different at commercial hubs such as Oppanakara Street and Gandhipuram. “There was a decent crowd and the sales were also good. But it is usual on Saturdays. There was no increase in crowd because of the total lockdown on Sunday,” said a manager of a garments showroom at Brookefields Mall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tipplers-crowd-tasmac-shops-ahead-of-complete-lockdown/articleshow/86328195.cms||V Devanathan

Endovascular surgeries become essential when patients develop blocks in blood supply to hands, legs and intestine. “We do diagnostic angiograms to identify these blocks and remove them. After the scarless surgery, patients are able to resume daily activities within two days,” said department head Dr K Rajesh. “Endovascular procedures are suitable for elderly people with heart diseases for whom open surgeries are life threatening. These blocks are removed by angioplasty and stenting procedures permanently in order to establish blood supply to hands and legs throughout the life,” the doctor said. The procedure would cost more than Rs 3 lakh in private hospitals. “But it is done free in CMCH under CM’s health insurance scheme,” said CMCH dean A Nirmala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-celebrates-200-endovascular-surgeries/articleshow/86330121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Moreover, 75% have taken the second dose too. Officers said that the police personnel who are yet to get their first and second doses have been instructed to get their shots as soon as possible. Many police personnel were infected during the first two waves of the pandemic. Few of them had even succumbed to Covid 19. Police officials said that by August-end this year, only three constables still had the Covid-19 infection. This year, so far, 305 police personnel, including 31 officers, were infected. Among them, one officer and four other employees succumbed to the infection. Senior police officials said despite the second Covid wave infecting a large number of people across the state and the country, there were relatively fewer infections within the Nashik police force due to the vaccination programme and various steps taken by the police under the guidance of commissioner Deepak Pandey. The Nashik city police, under Pandey’s guidance, also set up a Covid care centre last year so that the police personnel did not have to run from one place to another for hospitalization. A Covid centre was also opened for the family members of the Nashik city and rural police personnel as well as personnel of the Nashik Road Central Prisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/95-nashik-city-police-personnel-partially-75-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/86326260.cms||---

Outsiders as well as residents are dumping garbage as there are not adequate bins in the area. As door-to-door garbage collection is not done regularly, people justify dumping garbage on the street. Some people set fire to garbage piles, leading to breathing problems, said P Ganesan, a resident. “Children and elderly will be affected if they get exposed to pollution for a long time,” he said. “Garbage dumps not only create an eyesore, but also poses a threat to health. I raised the issue many times with officials, but no action was taken to check the menace,” said Hariharan, another resident. Many people avoid the road and prefer using other roads due to the foul odour from garbage. “Corporation officials should form a team involving volunteers and residents to prevent dumping of garbage. Those who dump waste here repeatedly should be identified and punished,” said G Lakshmipathi, another resident. A health official of the civic body promised to take appropriate action in a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garbage-dumping-raises-a-stink-on-kallukuzhi-street/articleshow/86328266.cms||V Devanathan

The Admission Committee for Professional Courses (ACPC) which carried out the first round of admission for 16,264 seats has been left with 13,837 empty seats, representing 85% of seats. There are 11,065 seats for MBA courses and 5,199 for MCA courses for which ACPC completed the admission round recently. According to data shared by ACPC, of 11,065 seats for MBA courses, only 1,714 have been confirmed at the end of the first round, leaving 9,351 seats empty. There are as many as 84 MBA colleges out of a total of 125 where ACPC has been able to fill less than 10% seats. In only 19 colleges, ACPC has been able to fill more than 50% seats. “The admissions for only 713 students could be confirmed in the case of MBA courses,” said an ACPC official. The poor response is an indicator of the decline in interest in such courses. In the case of MCA colleges, out of 11,065 seats for which admission was carried out by ACPC, 9,351 seats remained vacant as only 1,714 students have confirmed the admission in the first round, said sources in ACPC. Out of 60 colleges offering MCA courses, there were about 44 institutes where ACPC could fill only 10% seats or less.

---||Chandigarh||Mandis in various states on way to collapsing: SKM||Bathinda: Taking on the Narendra Modi government on promises about the mandi system, remaining intact even after the enactment of the farm laws, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has said the reality of the state of mandis in different states is pointing to an opposite direction. Instead of true reforms in the mandi system, so that more farmers are brought under the protective coverage of regulated markets or mandis and with competition increased inside the mandi architecture for better prices to be realised by farmers, the so-called reforms that were initiated by successive governments have led to a weakening and collapse of regulated agricultural markets. The APMC Act thrust by the Modi government to create two unequal markets, where the unregulated trade areas were beset with advantages for corporates and traders, became the proverbial last straw to break the back of the mandi system. Data from the prime minister's home state Gujarat and agriculture minister's home state Madhya Pradesh is damning, stated the SKM. Data published in Gujarat reports that around 114 out of the 224 APMCs in the state are about to close, 15 have already closed down. Twenty two of these APMCs will be unable to pay salaries to their staff soon; in 10 APMCs, salaries have been slashed, according to reports. Given this state of affairs, there is no reason for farmers to believe the assurances of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments that APMC mandis will remain and will be protected. SKM also stated that in Narendra Singh Tomar’s home state of Madhya Pradesh, it is reported that 62% of the APMCs have asked the government to help them pay salaries to their staff. In 49 mandis out of 259 agricultural markets in the state of MP, income reported is zero. In 143 mandis, the income this year is less than 50% of previous years. It is clear that the party does not want to acknowledge the reality that was predicted accurately by protesting farmers, said SKM. Talking about pan India efforts towards the movement, SKM said in Uttarakhand, cabinet minister Banshidhar Bhagat faced a black flag protest when farmers stopped his convoy in Nainital district and started shouting slogans against BJP's anti-farmer attitude. The cycle yatra of 38 farmers of Prahar Kisan Sangathan, which began on September 9 in Arvi in Wardha district of Maharashtra, reached Ghazipur border on Saturday after covering 1200km. SKM has condemned views being presented by the Haryana government in its affidavit related to the Karnal incidents in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “It is shameful that the state government is blaming the peacefully-protesting farmers despite the fact that senior officials, ostensibly with the blessings of senior leaders of the state government, have encouraged brutal violence from the police in Karnal,” said SKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mandis-in-various-states-on-way-to-collapsing-skm/articleshow/86331718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kitex Group inks MoU to invest Rs 2,400 crore in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Kitex Group, which accused the Kerala government of hounding it out of the state, has decided to ramp up its investment committent in Telangana. From an initial announcement of Rs 1,000 crore in one apparel facility, the company has decided to invest Rs 2,400 crore in setting up two integrated fibre-to-apparel manufacturing clusters in Telangana. This will create 22,000 direct jobs and close to 18,000 indirect jobs. The two clusters, which will come up at Kakatiya Mega Textile Park in Warangal and Sitarampur in Rangareddy district, will ship three million pieces per year of apparel for kids in the 0-24 months age group to the US. The details were given out on Saturday after Kitex Group chairman and managing director Sabu M Jacob signed an MoU with the Telangana government. The second largest manufacturer of apparel for infants currently manufactures 1 million pieces of infant apparel at its facilities in Kerala for exports to the US. The company is looking at acquiring about 375-400 acres for the two units. The first one at KMTP is slated to begin commercial operations from November 2022, Jacob said on the sidelines of the MoU signing ceremony. “Three months is the time for land preparations and we will start construction by January 2022. In six months we will complete the buildings and by August-September we will start commissioning the machinery at KMTP,” Jacob said, adding that work on the Sitarampur facility will begin after the KMTP unit. Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao said Telangana was able to bag this marquee investment starting with an SMS that he sent to Kitex Group CMD followed by a phone call after Jacob announced his decision to exit Kerala where he was planning to invest Rs 3,500 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kitex-inks-mou-to-invest-rs-2400cr-in-telangana/articleshow/86328273.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Chennai||All India Radio to convert 4 Tamil Nadu & Puducherry stations into relay stations||SALEM: India’s largest public radio broadcaster, All India Radio (AIR), has decided to convert four ‘primary channel stations’ in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry radio station to ‘relay stations’ from October 3, triggering fears about their possible shutdown. Henceforth, these five stations will relay programmes produced mostly by the Chennai AIR station and may lose their local flavour. According to a letter sent to the additional director general (ADG-content operations) by Saradha Jambunathan, programme head, AIR, Chennai, a meeting was held in Chennai on September 3 to draw a common fixed-point chart (FPC) for the six primary channel stations of Chennai, Madurai, Coimbatore, Trichy, and Tirunelveli districts in TN and Puducherry station. All these primary channel stations will have a uniform pattern of transmission hours, and regional news and central language bulletins will be merged into a single extended news bulletin both for morning and evening transmission, the letter said. The letter also said filmy interactive chunks will be incorporated to augment revenue, relay of English news bulletins will be rationalized to suit local requirements, and stations may have windows for local variations in morning and evening hours. “Local relay stations such as Nallampalli in Dharmapuri district and Yercaud in Salem district, Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district, and Karaikal in Puducherry will have the option to join the state network depending on their requirement,” the letter said. T Suriya Prabu, a radio fan from Salem district, said Prasar Bharati may have taken the first step to wind up its radio stations in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry by discontinuing their independent operation in major districts. “The employees of these primary channel stations may soon be laid off citing zero revenue,” he said. According to an AIR employee, the primary radio stations had the autonomy to generate local programmes on all issues including agriculture. They also inform listeners about local events and make important announcements. These programmes have local flavour and are produced in regional dialect, Suriya Prabu said. “This will be missing if programmes are relayed from Chennai,” he said. Pointing to a letter issued by north-zone ADG Shashi Kant in December 12, 2020, Prabu said Prasar Bharati had taken similar measure in that zone, which included Assam, but rolled it back after protests by locals. “Instead of converting them into relay stations, Prasar Bharati could convert them into FM stations to generate better revenue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/air-to-convert-4-tn-pondy-stations-into-relay-stations/articleshow/86330147.cms||Senthil Kumaran

The court was hearing the petition collectively filed by Krishi Vigyan Arogya Sanstha through its president Omprakash Jajodia, Kisan Manch through its general secretary Pratap Goswami and veteran environmentalist Pradyumna Sahasrabhojanee. The petition highlights various violations of the environmental clearance that was granted to the power plant in 2010 and amended in 2017. It was filed through noted environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta. Stating that Mahagenco has failed to adhere to environmental safeguards mandated by the Union environment ministry, the petitioners alleged that the plant was shifted from its permitted location and was brought about 3 km closer to the city. “Flouting norms, no fresh clearance was obtained for the changed location,” the petition stated. The petitioners have also called attention to the fact that the plant has failed to install the mandatory flue gas desulphurization (FGD) unit – a technology to control toxic sulphur dioxide emissions. TOI has been repeatedly reporting about the environmental, agricultural and health damage the missing of FGD in Koradi is causing in the city. “The power plant is releasing highly noxious gases of SO2 in huge quantities, which is far exceeding the permissible standards. This is causing adverse impacts on the health and well-being of individuals residing in nearby villages and Nagpur city,” the petition stated. As is being reported by TOI, the plant has also not been implementing the norm of 100% utilization of fly-ash. “For the year 2018-19, the Mahagenco generated over 26 lakh metric tonne (MT) of fly ash but has utilized merely about 7 lakh MT. This means that it has utilized only 29.3% of the total fly ash generated,” the petition stated adding that as per the statutory regulations of fly ash notification amendment released in 2009, 100% fly ash utilization within four years of operation of plant is mandatory. Pointing out more violations, the petition stated that Mahagenco have also failed to develop a green belt around the impugned thermal power plant. “KTPS is not permitted to use fresh water for operation of the plant, and is only permitted to use treated water from the sewage treatment plant (STP). Instead, Mahagenco has constructed a weir over Nag River and the river water is pumped to Bhandewadi STP and then to the plant. Even though KTPS claims that only 23% of its water requirement is met by fresh water, in reality the entire water requirement of KTPS is met by it,” the petitioners added. Stressing that despite such malfeasance being evident for several years, no concrete action has been undertaken by the relevant authorities, the petitioners have appealed to the court to issue directives that all conditions stipulated in the environmental clearance letter are implemented. “Directions to also be given for shifting the location of power plant by 2350 meters without seeking fresh environmental clearance for new location. Also, time-bound installation of FGD should be ensured,” they stated. The petitioners also demanded quashing of the terms of reference (ToR) of new 2x660 megawatt (mw) and issue directives to demolish the work already undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngt-pulls-up-env-min-mpcb-genco-for-ktps-violations-issues-notice/articleshow/86330127.cms||Manka Behl

According to the CID’s remand report, Sambasiva Rao who was named as accused no.2 illegally awarded Rs 321 crore worth tender to Tera Software Private Limited which was previously blacklisted by government from tendering process. The IRTS officer was interrogated for the last three days and the CID officials claimed he was not properly cooperating with the investigation. CID officials stated that a separate custody petition is being filed for Rao. N Surendra, the deputy superintendent of police who is the investigating officer, concluded that Rao had colluded with the then e-governing council member Vemuri Hari Krishna Prasad in using a forged document as genuine while awarding the tender to Tera Software. In 2015, INCAP was authorised by the infrastructure department to lay optical fibre cable over electrical towers and poles under phase-I of fibergrid project. The aim of AP Fibernet initiative was to provide internet across Andhra Pradesh. CID pegged the total loss to the exchequer at Rs 119 crore. Officials took Rao to Vijayawada GGH for medical examination and produced him before the special court for ACB cases for 14-day judicial remand.

---||Chandigarh||Despite promises, Afghanistan is sliding back to Taliban 1.1||The recent 21st Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit meeting in Dushanbe has once again brought to the fore the unresolved imbroglio in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his short but focused virtual address flagged challenges of terrorism and the need for theological correctives to promote moderate and inclusive regime. Notwithstanding these very relevant concerns, the great game unfolding in Afghanistan-Pakistan region is degrading into horror show of sorts. The neighbours, including traditional supporter of Taliban like Iran and new breed of backers, Russia and even China, are worried and apprehensive. It is literally a triple-whammy, as there were wide spread expectations that Taliban in its 2.0 avatar will be inclusive and moderate. As a corollary, expectations were that regime will be more tolerant towards women and minorities. It was categorically assured that terrorism will neither be allowed within, nor proliferated across borders. In a country with highest density of war lords, competitive extremism, Tora-Bora type caves and Panjshir like valleys, such assurance amounts to chasing the ever elusive mirage. The planned Taliban make-over projected Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar with Doha group, as brand ambassador. It was also being rumoured that diverse strands of opinion, represented by Abdullah Abdullah, Hamid Karzai, Ismail Khan and Hekmatyar may be included to garner acceptability. Initial draft wishlist included Haibatullah Akhunzada as Emir-ul-Momin, temporal head and Baradar, heading executive Rehbar council. The optimists didn’t cater for the bull-run by Pindi Shura, operating from ISI HQ at Aabpara. Leading the charge, Gen Faiz Hameed made sure that Haqqanis and their lackeys rule the roost. It was repeat of sorts of 2001, when another ISI general, Mahmood Ahmed and Mufti Shamzai of Binori mosque encouraged Mullah Omar to initiate jihad against the USA. Taliban, who were veering around to hand over Osama Bin Laden, were incited to set in motion catastrophic chain of events. ISI compliant, Taliban regime has 17 internationally designated terrorists like Sirajuddin Haqqani and notorious band of five with Guantanamo track record, described as Gitmo-5. ISI, in its obsession of strategic depth has forced Taliban into retrograde 1.1 formulation, with barely notional representation to non-Pashtun tribes. Even among Pashtuns’, ISI has cherry picked, leaving out Iran backed, Abdul Qayum Zakir. Iran has already articulated its angst and asked for investigations of Pakistan role in Panjshir operations. The dispensation described as acting arrangement is headed by low profile Mullah Hassan Akhund, notorious for destruction of Bamiyan heritage site. Haibatullah, the supreme leader, has surprisingly vanished, like Mullah Omar, whose death was announced, years later. Similarly, deputy prime minister Baradar was missing during the recent visit of deputy PM of Qatar. He has sent audio message, handwritten note and even made brief TV appearance, but mystery is getting murkier. Is he injured and recovering in a safe sanctuary, after the reported clash with new Haqqani, enfant-terrible in Kabul, Khalil? In this round, Haqqani clan, has outsmarted Kandahar and other shuras. Sirajuddin, notorious for earning endorsement by Al Qaeda (AQ) leader Zawahiri, has emerged as the de-facto power centre. Many of these leaders carry baggage of linkages with groups like AQ, IS-KP and notable one in this ilk is, Qari Fashiuddin, army chief, with sympathies to East Turkestan Islamic Movement, Beijing’s bête-noire. China has made the right noises in SCO, even calling for release of seized foreign funds. Yet it remains cautious on recognition. Influential think-tank, Chinese Academy of Trade and International Co-operation (CATIC), has sounded note of caution on much vaunted mineral wealth. It feels that except iron ore, it may require 8-10 years of stability, to commercially exploit minerals, subject to initial estimates proving good. It also said projected Afghan leg of CPEC may be additional drain on already financially stressed venture. China has committed modest $31 million, but is unlikely to put boots on ground. Staring at food crisis, it has limitations in immediate food grain criticalities. The new joke in Darra Adam Khel, arms bazar is - after American burgers, its time for Chinese chowmein. President Biden continues to convey his annoyance by refusing to call up Imran and Blinken flagged Pakistan’s duplicitous behaviour, suggesting reworking of relations. Now that USA is no longer dependent on Pakistan logistics bridge head, concrete measures are required to rein in Pakistan mavericks. Immediately, non NATO, strategic ally status should be revoked, personalised sanctions against Pakistan generals and endeavour to downgrade Pakistan to FATF blacklist are warranted. ISI euphoria may not last long, as there are signs of disquiet all over. Panjshir resistance though presently quelled may erupt after winter pause, consolidation, more importantly backing by Iran and Tajikistan. TTP faction under Noor Wali Mehsud has got reinforced with leaders like Faqir Mohammed, released by Taliban. Pakistan army is already bearing the brunt of increased attacks. Nationalist Taliban factions under Baradar, Zakir and Sadr are regrouping to minimise Pakistan interference. Some sections of civil society have stood up for Afghan flag and currency. Two decades of education and development have unleashed some green shoots of yearning for peace, at least in urban areas. Afghanistan faces humanitarian crisis and international bale out and diplomatic recognition should be coordinated and linked with conditionality of inclusiveness, human rights and role for women. For Taliban supporters, some traditional tribal wisdom: “Pusht-e-har teppe, yek Padishah neshast” (Behind every hillock, sits an emperor). In Afghanistan, seminal truth is, “Har saray Khan de” (Every man is a Khan). Pakistan will be well advised to drop fancy notions of controlling destiny of Khans across Khyber and focus on domestic Pashtun and Baloch separatism.

Sharma on Saturday submitted a memorandum to Governor of Punjab, Banwarilal Purohit, for recommending the case to the President and Prime Minister of India. Sharma, said, “We have demanded that by amending the Article 48 of Chapter 4 of the Constitution of India, a complete ban should be imposed on cow slaughter and a uniform law should be enacted in all states in this regard.” A provision of death penalty should be made for the killing of the bovine, reads the memorandum, further stating that government gaushalas should be constructed with state-of-the-art facilities after taking strict steps towards the protection of the cows. The chairman apprised the governor that cow is the backbone of the Indian culture and reflects the spiritual faith of Sanatan Dharma, but the bovine is forced to live by eating garbage. He also said the land mafia is grabbing land depriving bovine of permanent shelters, resulting in bovine-people confrontations and accidents every day. Similarly, he said cows are killed ruthlessly every day, but due to lack of strict law, cow smugglers and killers are able to easily escape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-gau-sewa-commission-chairman-demand-for-declaring-cow-as-national-animal/articleshow/86331755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the restaurant is on Taboot Street, two other outlets are on East Street. They are popular among patrons, said cantonment officials. Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB, said they had issued public notices in this regard. “Notice were sent to some of the outlets, including hotels and restaurants. However, they did not pay any heed to them,” Kumar said on Saturday. “We have come across several outlets operating without licence. To get the licence, the shops need to submit fire audit and hygiene certificates”, Kumar added. These establishments will remain closed till further notice. “The owners claimed that they were not aware of the notice, and do not know how to obtain a fire safety certificate. Small shops can apply to the cantonment fire brigade office for the same, while big establishments can get it from government-designated agencies,” he added. A senior official from the cantonment told TOI that over 30 establishments, including hotels and restaurants, mainly on MG Road and East Street, have been identified for operating without trade licence. “They have been issued notices.

---||Delhi||1km Najafgarh-Dhansa stretch takes Metro into Delhi’s interiors||NEW DELHI: The 1.2km Najafgarh-Dhansa bus stand section of Delhi Metro’s Grey Line was inaugurated on Saturday, taking the rail network to beyond 390km and the number of stations to 286. The event was conducted through video conferencing, with Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as the chief guests. Puri’s junior minister Kaushal Kishore, Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot and West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh were also present on the occasion. Passenger services on the section started from 5pm on Saturday. After flagging off a train on the section, Puri said that the 1.2km stretch might be small from the network length point of view, but from the perspective of providing enhanced connectivity to interior parts of Delhi, it was an important milestone. Puri also said that as the country gradually recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, enhanced mobility requirements of the masses in the cities would play an important role in taking the economy forward. He said Delhi Metro’s ridership had reached 65 lakh per day in the pre-Covid era, while the overall ridership in metro trains across the country was 85 lakh. He also called upon Delhi Government to expedite the approvals pending for projects of Delhi Metro. After flagging off the first train on the route, the chief minister said, “This is a moment of great delight for all the people of Outer Delhi, especially the residents of Najafgarh. Till now, the route of Delhi Metro ended at the Delhi Gate region in Najafgarh. There are about 50 villages in the area from where a huge number of people come to inner Delhi to work and this network is important for them.” Kejriwal said that the route may be short, but it is very significant. “A large number of people come from Jhajjar, Haryana to work in Delhi. They too will benefit a lot from this service,” he said. Gahlot tweeted, “Congratulations Najafgarh! Today is very important to me for two reasons. First as Transport Minister of Delhi - Expanding the existing metro network in Delhi and second as MLA of Najafgarh - a new metro station (Dhansa Bus Stand) is being added in the Najafgarh constituency.” The Dhansa metro station is the first ever subsurface station of the urban train system to have an entire underground floor dedicated to parking. The parking facility will be integrated with the main station area and vehicle users will be able to park their cars and two wheelers and then proceed to the concourse of the station directly using elevators and escalators. “The parking facility will be of great benefit to the local residents because the adjoining areas are extremely congested with very limited space for parking,” said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation spokesperson. “The parking space has ramps on two sides for entry and exit of vehicles. There are two entry and exit facilities that connect the parking lot both with the surface above and the platform below.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1km-najafgarh-dhansa-stretch-takes-metro-into-citys-interiors/articleshow/86330200.cms||---

Recent heavy rain has worsened the condition of the road. Revolutionary Goans (RG), taluka co-ordinator, Prashant Pagi told TOI that shoddy work had left the stretch leading to the beach in a dilapidated condition. He said that mud excavated from the trenches was just dumped by the roadside. He has appealed to road authorities to hot-mix the stretch as soon as the rain subsides. Locals say that tourists face difficulties accesing the beach and this will impact the season, which has already begun attracting domestic tourists. RG constituency coordinator, Sanjam Naique said the bad condition of the road is already affecting footfalls to the popular beach. Locals have also complained of damage to their vehicles due to the road. “This road has not been hot-mixed over the last five years,” said former councilor Divakar Pagi, adding that despite reminding PWD officials and the local MLA, only patches of the road were repaired. A local, Jivesh Pagi, blamed PWD for not carrying out repairs even while the tourist season is in progress, adding that there are no proper signboards or reflectors to divert traffic. “Not only tourists but also lives of locals are at risk. The BJP government should understand this,” said a group of fisherwomen. Assistant engineer, PWD Swapnil Desai said his department has received administrative approval for the tender to repair the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/palolem-road-in-disrepair-access-to-beach-affected/articleshow/86331804.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Linking of students’ Aadhaar to enrolment figures unfair to teachers: Academics||Nagpur: Linking of students’ Aadhaar details to staff hiring approval has posed a challenge, especially for grant-in-aid schools, as this makes them susceptible to be de-rostered from their current institution and transferred anywhere in the state. The number of teachers in any grant-in-aid school is linked to number of students enrolled, but with many of them not having Aadhaar card the ‘enrolment’ figures may go down. If the enrolment figures breach certain benchmarks, then the teacher will be categorized as ‘excess’ and the education department has the authority to transfer him/her to any school in the state where there is a shortage of teachers. Grant-in-aid schools are managed by private trusts but salaries are paid from government coffers, hence education here is free. On September 14, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) issued a letter to principals, saying that Aadhaar details of students have to be uploaded by September 29. Priti Mishrikotkar, education officer (NMC) said “This applies to all schools of all boards.” So far in Nagpur, only 74% students Aadhaar details have been updated. While this applies to both grant-in-aid and non-grant schools, it’s the former which are a worried lot. Ravindra Fadnavis, office bearer of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM), said, “In the worst case scenario, our teachers will be marked as excess and there will be no teacher to teach students.” He explained that the Aadhaar linkage of teacher hiring is not practical. “As per law, we can have one teacher for the first 30 students. Let’s take a hypothetical situation and assume that there are only 30 students in the school, so I get to hire one teacher. But if 20 of these students do not have Aadhaar card then official enrolment of my school will be only 10, which means no teacher shall be allotted and the school will be forced to close down,” said Fadnavis. He said this would be a violation of Right to Education (RTE) Act. “So even though there are 30 children willing to study, the government may shutdown the school because 20 of them don’t have Aadhaar card. It will be illegal,” said Fadnavis. Another academic said due to Covid-19 restrictions, Aadhaar centres were also not functioning and many parents were also scared to take their children there. “September 29 is too close, time must be given till at least December 31,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/linking-of-students-aadhaar-to-enrolment-figures-unfair-to-teachers-academics/articleshow/86328295.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The city has been conducting over 40,000 tests daily against the average of 35,000 previously. The daily positivity rate has been around 1% for a couple of days after rising for a few days. On Saturday, the Covid-19 update showed that 478 cases were registered in Mumbai against 3,391 across Maharashtra. Deaths in Mumbai and Maharashtra increased to six and 80, respectiveley, against there and 67 on the previous day. State health minister Rajesh Tope urged people to not forget Covid-appropriate behaviour as the number of positive cases in certain pockets of Mumbai, Pune and Ahmednagar districts continued to be high.

Out of the 27 people named in the charge sheet, 24 have obtained bail, while the police have sent notices through post to the remaining three people. On June 1, Jaleel along with traders reached the labour commissioner’s office and demanded labour deputy commissioner Shailendra Pol to remove seal of the shops. The interaction soon turned into a heated argument with Jaleel allegedly coming down heavily on labour deputy commissioner. A woman police constable, who was the amongst the police team that rushed to the spot, tried filming the heated argument, to which Jaleel objected and allegedly did not allow her to film. The video of the Jaleel made it to social media attracting mixed reactions.

The Anaimalai police identified the accused as P Ponnusamy, a farmhand from Ganapathipalayam village in their jurisdiction. A police officer said the elderly woman was residing along with her 40-year-old daughter and 50-year-old son-in-law in the farmhouse. “They were taking care of 20 acres farmland. The incident occurred when her daughter and son-in-law went to a nearby village on Thursday evening.” Ponnusamy, the officer said, working on a farmland adjacent to the elderly woman’s property. “He walked through her property on the fateful day in an inebriated state and realized that the woman was alone at her house.

---||Nagpur||After resisting online ‘bandwagon’ in 2020, Vidarbha Literary Festival back in physical mode||Nagpur: Even as Covid struck in 2020 and most of the world jumped on to the ‘online bandwagon’, the Vidarbha Literary Festival (VLF) decided to wait it out to protect the ‘essence of lit fests’. And now, after a long wait, VLF’s first post-Covid event will be held in physical mode on September 25. The event is supported by The Times of India. This will mark the first of the monthly events by the Vid Lit Fest, leading up to the grand finale in February. Though the pressure and temptation to kickstart VLF in online mode was enormous, founder-secretary Sachin Jahagirdar felt it just wasn’t the ‘right thing to do’. “The experience of attending a literary festival can be life changing in so many ways. When you interact with the author directly, listen to anecdotes which contributed to the story, get a personalized autographed version and soak in the rich literary experience, your whole perspective changes,” said Jahagirdar. “After meeting like-minded people, learning about new books, authors, getting feedback from other attendees, a new literary world opens up. And I’m convinced that nothing of this sort can ever happen in an online platform,” he said. Certain experiences of attending online events since last year helped Jahagirdar in shaping his views. “I attended some book-related events and hardly 50-70 participants were present even for well known authors. And many people have a habit of switching off their camera for the entire meet, so the author who’s speaking does not even known whether that virtual audience is even listening. For all we know, that attendee would have gone to another room,” said Jahagirdar. VLF wanted to remain an ‘immersive experience’ for those attending. “It’s all about quality, both for the author and those attending. In the end, both should leave feeling enriched due to the interaction or the talk,” said Jahagirdar. ‘Quality’ will be the keyword for VLF’s event on September 25 as ‘quantity’ will take a backseat due to Covid restrictions. “We will have limited entry to 75 participants only and had started online registrations on www.vidlitfest.com,” said Jahagirdar. The first event will feature author and film critic Namrata Joshi about her book which deals with the multiple facets of the film-making process. “The event will be held indoors at Chitnavis Centre and will adhere to all Covid protocols. We have self-imposed a lower 75 attendance limit to ensure that social distancing is not at all an issue,” said Jahagirdar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-resisting-online-bandwagon-in-2020-vidarbha-literary-festival-back-in-physical-mode/articleshow/86328318.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Poor response to betterment exams||VIJAYAWADA: Intermediate supplementary examinations received poor response from second year students in state on Saturday. Only 10 to 15 per cent of the students who had applied for the exams turned up. In view of the Covid-19 second wave, the board had cancelled the examinations and declared all students as pass. Grades were allocated based on their aggregate marks in SSC and intermediate first year. Many students expressed dissatisfaction over the marks awarded to them and demanded betterment exams. Subsequently, board permitted second year students to appear for betterment exams. The authorities had made elaborate arrangements for the examinations strictly following the Covid-19 protocols. Exams were held at 1,452 centres across the state. But, despite all arrangements, very few second year students turned up for the exams. Of the 4,24,844 students applied for mathematics II-b, zoology II and history II exams, only 5,879 turned up. As many as 4,18,965 students were absent. Students said they were busy taking various entrance examinations. “We were disappointed with the marks awarded by the board and applied for the supplementary exam. But board authorities delayed the exams. The EAPCET,and JEE results are already declared and we are busy with web counselling and moving forward with our studies. So, we decided not to appear for betterment exams,” said K Shanmuk Sai, a student from Gollapudi. Board authorities said many students had a misunderstanding of the issue. “Most of them were convinced after the board explained the procedure of awarding of marks,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/poor-response-to-betterment-exams/articleshow/86328309.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Nagpur||BJP will take a positive stand if Sena agrees for an alliance: Minister||YAVATMAL: Union minister of state for social justice Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said that BJP would take a positive stand if the Shiv Sena shows any signs of making an alliance in the state. At a press conference held at the government rest house, Athawale said the Congress and NCP won’t allow chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to function effectively. “The CM is keeping his anguish close to his heart. If Thakeray wants to implement and achieve the ideology and goal of Shiv Sena Supremo Balasaheb Thakeray then he has to opt for an alliance with BJP as both the parties have a common principle and ideology,” Athawale said, adding, “The only way out for Thakeray is to part ways with both the Congress and the NCP.” In the present political scenario, there can be an alliance with any party, he said. “In Maharashtra, the Sena can run the government with Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister for 21/2 years and the remaining 2 1/2 years with Devendra Fadnavis at the helm,” he added. If the Shiv Sena sincerely thinks of development, it should join hands with the BJP, he opined. “Both parties would gain. Today, the Opposition does not allow the government to function in Parliament. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi continues to dance as per his whims and fancies. Anyway, Congress won’t cross 50 seats anymore,” he said. On the ongoing farmers’ agitation, Athavale said leaders are misleading farmers. “The government is willing to amend the agricultural laws. But a total revocation of the laws is unacceptable,” he added. Regarding reservations, Athawale said the ball is now in the state government’s court. “They must grant reservations to OBCs and Brahmins without interfering with the existing reservation. If the state government can’t do it then it should step down and we will give reservations,” he said. Athawale unveiled the life size statue of Dr Ambedkar in Umarkhed. He was accompanied by BJP MLAs Madam Yerawar (Yavatmal) and Namdevrao Sasane (Umarkhed). In his address, Athawale highlighted the invaluable contributions of Ambedkar, who gave people the right to vote, irrespective of their caste, creed and sex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-will-take-a-positive-stand-if-sena-agrees-for-an-alliance-min/articleshow/86330257.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Double engine effect: Central allocation to Uttar Pradesh rises sharply||LUCKNOW: The Central assistance to the state rose sharply from just over Rs 1.36 lakh crore between 2012-13 and 2016-17 (the tenure of previous Samajwadi Party regime) to more than Rs 2.01 lakh crore during the rule of incumbent BJP government in UP, a data released by the state government on Saturday showed. The data, which came a day ahead of completion of four-and-a-half-year of Yogi Adityanath government, categorically noted that the Congress -led UPA government at the Centre released Rs 17,337.78 crore in 2012-13 and Rs 22,405.16 crore in 2013-14. This increased to Rs 32,691.47 crore in 2014-15, Rs 31,861.33 crore in 2015-16 and Rs 32,536.86 crore in 2016-17 after the Narendra Modi government came to power. A BJP spokesperson said that the allocation showed that no discrimination was done by the Centre with the previous SP government in UP. “The rise in Central allocation to the state was also a strong pointer to the effect of the ‘double engine’ government of BJP, both at the Centre and the state. This ensured effective implementation of various developmental schemes of the Centre,” the spokesperson said. After BJP formed the government in UP with an overwhelming majority, the Centre stepped up the allocation -- Rs 40,648.44 crore in 2017-18, Rs 42,988.48 crore in 2018-19, Rs 44,043.96 crore, Rs 57,487.59 crore in 2020-21 and over Rs 16,415.61 crore in 2021-22 till August 31, 2021. The spokesperson said that the progress of UP went up largely because of the combined efforts of the governments at the Centre and the state. “Time and again, PM Modi has spoken about the benefits of ‘double engine’ government,” he added. “Uttar Pradesh reached the top position in effective implementation of about 90% of the Central schemes which included PM Awas Yojana, PM Employment Generation Programme, Ujjwala Scheme, Saubhagya Scheme, construction of personal toilets, Smart Cities Award 2020 and highest jobs in MSME units,” the spokesperson said, maintaining that this was in sharp contrast to the previous SP government which tried to impede the development and resisted implementation of several welfare schemes of the Centre. “It denied the people of UP the benefits of welfare schemes,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/double-engine-effect-central-allocation-to-up-rises-sharply/articleshow/86331780.cms||---

The toll increased to 14,061 as nine more patients succumbed to the pandemic.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Patients back to rushing to ERs with chest pain, stroke||MUMBAI: When three patients with stroke and two with heart attack were wheeled into Global Hospital’s emergency department in a single day last week, the head of department, Dr Mohit Garg, felt the “Covid fear” had ebbed. “Chest pain and stroke were the most common reasons for emergency room visits till the Covid pandemic struck. Thereafter, the fear of Covid kept many away from hospitals, even though they needed help,” he said. While most emergencies in the past 18 months were related to Covid, the last month has brought back a change. “We are seeing stroke and heart attack patients reaching hospitals in time,” said Dr Garg. Mumbai usually registers 80-plus heart-related deaths daily, but the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020 saw a shocking dip in the number of people going to hospitals with chest pain. “The first few months were a blur. Once the guidelines were drawn up, we started attending to emergencies, but planned heart procedures stopped,” said a senior cardiologist. The only exceptions were public hospitals where procedures didn’t stop. “We operated on patients throughout Covid, though in lower numbers,” said Dr Ajay Mahajan from BMC-run Sion Hospital. Now, as the second Covid wave has dipped and vaccination has picked up, heart patients are reaching hospitals in time for intervention. “I have been busy with PAMI (primary angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction) for the past one and half month,” said cardiologist Dr Nagesh Waghmare from Bombay Hospital near New Marine Lines. PAMI is offered to patients who reach a hospital within the stipulated golden period. Worryingly, most of his patients are in the 30-40 age group. With the opening up of offices and transport, people have got back to their jobs after 18 months of work-from-home routine. “The change could have led to stress that could have triggered a cardiac episode,” said a doctor. Senior cardiologist Brian Pinto said most Covid patients in the second wave were youngsters who were not vaccinated. “Unfortunately, some of them hit the gym after recovering from Covid,” he said. As the Covid viral fever has now been recognized as a thromboembolic event (causing clots in blood vessels), some “ruptured blood vessels, leading to sudden cardiac death,” added Dr Pinto. There is a long way, though, before hospitals reach their pre-pandemic level of non-Covid work. “At our hospital, the number of heart-related interventions and stroke surgeries are at 70% of the pre-Covid period,” said Hinduja Hospital COO Joy Chakraborthy. Dr Prince Surana of Surana group of hospitals said it would take another month of low Covid incidence for patients to gain confidence in entering hospitals without the fear of contracting it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-patients-back-to-rushing-to-ers-with-chest-pain-stroke/articleshow/86330250.cms||---

The survivor, a resident of Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar, alleged that police turned her away and refused to lodge an FIR in the matter after the incident on Tuesday. “For three days, I visited the thana, but the FIR was not filed. It was only after the intervention of the Bijnor superintendent of police that a case was registered on Friday evening,” the survivor told TOI. Three people have been booked under sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. The accused are yet to be arrested. According to the woman’s complaint, she had gone to Sabalpur village in Nangal area to attend wedding rituals of her friend who works as an AC mechanic in Delhi’s Mukundpur. “We have known each other for over a year. He is like a brother to me,” said the survivor. On September 14, the survivor left the village after attending the festivities and was waiting for a bus to take her to Bijnor city. “A car with three occupants offered me a lift. I wanted to reach the city at the earliest so I went with them. They stopped the car in a deserted area and gang-raped me at knifepoint. A farmer heard my cries for help. The three fled when he ran towards us,” said the survivor in her complaint. The woman said the farmer identified all three accused. She then returned to the village and told her friend about the incident. “I had injuries on my body. (My friend) accompanied me to the Nangal police station, but policemen told us to go away. It was only after members of a right-wing organisation got involved that the FIR was registered on orders of the Bijnor SP on September 17,” she said. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh told TOI the survivor’s medical examination was conducted on Friday and her statement recorded before a magistrate on Saturday. “Family of one of the accused has claimed that he has been framed due to a political rivalry. We are investigating the matter,” he said.

---||Meerut||UP accounts for half of country’s illegal arms seizure||MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh accounts for half of the country’s illegal weapon seizures, suggests data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020. As many as 67,947 firearms were seized under the Arms Act in the country in 2020, with UP topping the list (32,776 seizures), the data states. Madhya Pradesh follows UP with a distant 10,841 illegal arms seizures. Even in the licensed category, UP held the distinction with 65% of the total seizures in the country. In numerical terms, out of 2,126 licensed weapons seized in the country, UP accounted for 1,400. However, when it comes to seizure of illegal ammunition, Jammu & Kashmir topped the chart with 27,103 ammunition, including bullets of all calibers that account for more than 50% seized in the entire country. However, only 474 arms were seized in the troubled state. Though incomparable to Kashmir, UP, too, witnessed a substantial ammunition seizure – 12,908 -- with the state closing in with 12,117. Rest seems miniscule in front of these three states, except Punjab with 6,658 seizures. Uttar Pradesh additional director-general (law and order) Prashant Kumar said, “Ammunition supply is certainly an area of concern for us and over the years, we have learnt that a nexus between existing arms licence owners, professional sports shooters and arms dealers in cities, is responsible for the supply of factory made bullets on black market. Accountability is what we are aiming at right now.” “A system is being developed in which all stakeholders and agencies will have to keep an account of every bullet spent. However, rooting out illicit firearms manufacturing units is a Herculean task, particularly where there is a high demand of such weapons in the rural belt. Manufacturing a country-made firearm doesn’t require high-end skills and even the tools are ordinary ones. Assembling a unit even in a remote jungle is easy. But we keep busting these units on a regular basis,” Kumar said. The NCRB data also reveals arms seizure from “anti-national elements”, where UP again accounts for 77% of total seizures in the country. Out of 5,631 such weapons, 4,313 came from UP. Out of 27,103 ammunition seized in J&K, 27,083 was in possession of “anti-national elements”.  The NCRB data placed Manipur second with 4,676 followed by Nagaland 3,116.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-accounts-for-half-of-countrys-illegal-arms-seizure/articleshow/86326366.cms||Sandeep Rai

The notice was issued after activist Santosh Dhaonkar filed a complaint demanding an FIR against the society for constructing the wall in violation of Environment Protection Act. Residents claimed the collector granted permission for the construction and it was in line with an adjoining slum. Early this week, D ward office demolished the wall after heavy rain caused water-logging and the stormwater drain department complained it was obstructing flow of water through Rungta Lane stormwater outfall. The wall was constructed atop the drain.

---||Lucknow||‘OBC morcha to ensure over 350 seats to BJP in UP polls’||Lucknow: The crucial two-day OBC working committee meeting of the state BJP got underway on Saturday in Ayodhya, the Hindutva nerve centre, lauding the steps taken by the saffron party for the backward in the last seven years of rule at the Centre and four-and-a-half-year’s rule in UP. The committee passed the resolution of making the OBC the biggest and electorally most imperative bloc in the state. “Our target is to cross 350 this time. OBC Morcha will play an important role in fulfilling this goal. The BJP is moving fast towards the goal of achieving everyone’s trust while following the path of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas,” said UP BJP OBC Morcha chief Narendra Kashyap. BJP national vice-president and state in-charge Radha Mohan Singh invoked former Union home minister Sardar Vallabhai Patel and said that the interim government formed before independence wanted Sardar Patel to be the prime minister. “But he could not become one because of one person,” he said, making a veiled attack on the Congress leadership. Singh said that after independence, Patel worked for strengthening the poor, exploited and deprived persons. “The Narendra Modi government is doing the same,” he said. He also attacked the SP, the Congress and the BSP for doing politics in the name of backward castes. Addressing the inaugural session, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that the recommendation to raise the limit of creamy layer from six lakh to eight lakh was made in 1993. But it gets implemented by the Modi government in 2021. “The decision to give reservation in NEET came in 1986. But it took 35 years to implement it,” he said. Singh added the state began to prosper after hooliganism ended. “In the previous government, in western UP the door used to close at five o’clock. But in the Yogi government, a robust law and order prevails.” OBC Morcha national president K Laxman said that the BJP made a lot of efforts in the last Parliament sessions to get the Backward Classes Commission constitutional status like SC/ST. “But due to opposition of the Congress it could not be passed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/obc-morcha-to-ensure-over-350-seats-to-bjp-in-up-polls/articleshow/86331814.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Police pick 890 criminals who may be sent away from area||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has identified more than 890 criminals who were involved in multiple crimes and were fit for externment. The externment process is meant to keep criminals away from an area for a certain period to ensure peace in society. Till August 19 this year, the maximum number of such criminals, 215, were identified by Outer District, followed by Outer North (124) and Dwarka (95). They were found fit for externment proceedings under Section 47 of Delhi Police Act (removal of persons about to commit offences), cops said. In the rest 12 districts, more than 500 such criminals were identified. Delhi Police will initially serve notices to such criminals to explain why they should not be externed. If they are unable to give a satisfactory reply, further action will be taken, an officer said. So far, 740 notices have been issued. “Over 170 notices have been issued by Outer district, 90 by Dwarka and 71 by South district,” Delhi Police’s data accessed by TOI shows. In the Outer district, according to a senior officer, they have specific criteria for externment. “We analyse the threat perception. We check whether common people living in an area are scared of the rowdy, and whether the criminal is running a proper network of an organised crime syndicate that needs to be busted. We ensure that no one lives in fear,” the officer said. Another officer from the Outer North district said that criminals involved in body offences and excise act, robbers and snatchers were usually externed. “If they are involved in more than three criminal cases and don’t want to change themselves, they are externed from the city for at least six months.” Till August 19, as many as 134 people were externed from the city. Externment plays an important role in maintaining peace and harmony in society. “After externment, it becomes tough for a criminal to restart his criminal activities in another state. At a new place, he has to create new links, which is not easy,” a cop explained. According to the data, as many as 1,75,327 cases were registered in Delhi till August 15, including 3,246 heinous and 1,72,081 non-heinous cases. Over 5,100 snatchings, 719 hurt and 1,264 robbery cases were reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-pick-890-criminals-who-may-be-sent-away-from-area/articleshow/86330380.cms||Abhay Singh

According to a government spokesperson, the urban development department topped the list with purchase of items worth Rs 3,190 crore, followed by the health and family welfare department which bought items worth Rs 2,720 crore and the department of basic education which made purchases worth Rs 830 crore. The urban development department also hired manpower worth Rs 2,600 crore through outsourcing. Besides, the departments of medical education, home, information and public relations, skill development mission, food and civil supply, general administration and rural development purchased items worth Rs 791 crore, 632 crore, 404 crore, Rs 352 crore, Rs 314 crore, Rs 294 crore and Rs 243 crore respectively. The GeM portal has also facilitated direct and indirect employment of more than two-and-a-half lakh people in the industries listed on the portal. There are 12,847 government buyers and 2,21,450 sellers on the portal, including 62,973 micro and small entrepreneurs. In the past four-and-a-half years, government departments have placed 5,86,651 orders worth Rs 13,597 crore, the state government said. After the Centre launched the portal in August 2016, the UP government made GeM and Trade Receivables Discounting System (TRADES) portal mandatory in August 2017 for sale of industrial goods in government departments. A BJP spokesperson said that the previous SP government shied away from using the portal which aimed to bring in transparency. The state government claimed that it had made the highest procurement through GeM portal for three years in a row. UP government was felicitated by the Centre with ‘Best Buyer Award’ in 2018 and ‘Super Buyer Award’ in 2019. Meanwhile, the state government said that its mission of one district, one medical college is gaining ground as the UP government has paved the way for setting up new medical colleges on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis in 16 un-served districts of the state. The state government spokesperson said that this augmented the health infrastructure and medical education sector in the state. At present, 59 medical colleges have been made functional in 59 districts. The spokesperson said that in 2017, only 17 out of 75 districts had functioning medical colleges or institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-bought-rs-8940cr-items-via-gem-portal-in-4-5-years/articleshow/86331823.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Coconut peelers find life a hard nut to crack in new normal||VIJAYAWADA: Coconut peelers are in dire straits ever since the outbreak of Covid-19. Demand for coconut fell drastically after restrictions were imposed on festivities and religious gatherings. The ‘new normal’ has affected the life of people dependent on cultivation and harvest of coconuts. Coconut is cultivated in vast areas in Krishna, and East and West Godavari districts. Around 1.2 lakh families are dependent on the exports of coconuts to various states of the country. Coconut from Mudinepalli, Khalidhindi, and Juvvalapalem regions enjoys huge demand in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Fine quality coconut is procured for Rs 4 from the farmers and exported to various parts of the country for Rs 8.50. Exporters add the transportation cost and sell the coconuts to retailers. Coconut peelers play a key role in the business. They work throughout the day standing under the sun and peel shells of coconut manually. “It is a very tough job. Each coconut peeler can peel around 600 coconuts if he is in perfect physical condition. The number comes down in summer. Many of us get injured while doing the job,” said K Bullabbai, a peeler from Elurupadu of West Godavari district. Many of them lost livelihood after Covid-19 and have migrated to cities for work. “Our exporter used to pay Rs 1.30 per coconut for peeling. We used to earn around Rs 700 a day. But exports decreased with poor demand and we are now peeling only around 250 coconuts a day. Exporters also reduced the payment to 90 paise per coconut. Many of my co-workers left job and started working as daily labourers at Rajahmundry and Bhimavaram,” said Thota Venkatesam, a peeler from Kalidhindi of Krishna district. People buy coconut for Rs 35 in markets but farmers and labourers are getting less than Rs 7. Exporters and middlemen are gaining huge margins. Government should help us, he demanded. Coconut exporters said the situation is temporary and exports will pick up if Covid-19 situation normalises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/coconut-peelers-find-life-a-hard-nut-to-crack-in-new-normal/articleshow/86328429.cms||Venu Lanka
---||World||The scientist and the AI-assisted, remote-control killing machine||Iran's top nuclear scientist woke up an hour before dawn, as he did most days. That afternoon, he and his wife would leave their vacation home on the Caspian Sea and drive to their country house in Absard, east of Tehran. Convinced that Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was leading Iran's efforts to build a nuclear bomb, Israel had wanted to kill him for at least 14 years. Iran's intelligence had warned Fakhrizadeh of a possible assassination plot, but the scientist had brushed it off. So shortly after noon on November 27, he slipped behind the wheel of his black Nissan Teana sedan along with his wife and hit the road. An elusive targetSince 2004, when the Israeli government ordered its foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the agency had been methodically picking off experts thought to be part of Iran's nuclear weapons programme. Despite several assassination bids, Fakhrizadeh was elusive. So, they decided to try something new. Iranian agents working for the Mossad had parked a Nissan Zamyad pickup truck on the side of the road connecting Absard to the main highway. Hidden beneath tarpaulins in the truck bed was a 7.62-mm sniper machine gun. Around 1pm, the hit team got a signal that Fakhrizadeh, his wife and a team of armed guards in escort cars were about to leave for Absard. The assassin, a skilled sniper, took up his position. He was nowhere near Absard, however. He was peering into a computer screen at an undisclosed location over 1,000 miles away. Reports of a killingThe reports from Iran were confusing, contradictory and mostly wrong. While one reported about a team of assassins, another said a truck had exploded. A few days later, several Iranian news oufits reported that the assassin was a killer robot. Iranians mocked the story, except this time there really was a killer robot. The straight-out-of-science-fiction story of what really happened, published on NYT for the first time, is based on interviews with US, Israeli and Iranian officials, including two intelligence officials, and his family's statements to media. The operation's success was the debut test of a high-tech, computerised sharpshooter kitted out with artificial intelligence and multiple-camera eyes, operated via satellite and capable of firing 600 rounds a minute. Time was running outPreparations for the assassination began toward the end of 2019 and in early 2020 between Israeli officials, led by the Mossad director, Yossi Cohen, and high-ranking US officials, including President Donald Trump, secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the CIA director, Gina Haspel. Israel had paused the sabotage and assassination campaign in 2012, when the US began talks with Iran leading to the 2015 nuclear deal. Now that Trump had abrogated that agreement, the Israelis wanted to resume the campaign. In late February 2020, Cohen presented the Americans with a list of potential operations, including the killing of Fakhrizadeh. The US officials briefed about the assassination plan in Washington supported it, according to an official who was at the meeting. Both countries were encouraged by Iran's relatively tepid response to the US assassination of Iran's military commander Qassim Suleimani in January 2020. By the summer, it looked as if Trump could lose the US election. His likely successor, Joe Biden, had promised to reverse Trump's policies and return to the 2015 deal. If Israel was going to kill a top Iranian official, an act that could start a war, it needed the assent and protection of the US. That meant acting before Biden could take office. Programming a hitIsrael chose a special model of a Belgian-made FN MAG machine gun attached to an advanced robotic apparatus, according to an intelligence official familiar with the plot. But the machine gun, the robot, its components and accessories together weigh about a tonne. So the equipment was broken down and smuggled into the country piece by piece and then secretly reassembled in Iran. The robot was built to fit in the bed of the Zamyad pickup. Cameras pointing in multiple directions were mounted on the truck to give the command room a full picture. Finally, the truck was packed with explosives so it could be blown to bits after the kill. The AI was programmed to compensate for delay, the truck's shake and the scientist's car's speed. Another challenge was to determine that it was Fakhrizadeh in the car. So, a decoy car with a camera to force a U-turn and get a clear image was stationed. The strikeShortly before 3.30pm, the motorcade arrived at the U-turn. Fakhrizadeh's car came to a near halt, and he was positively identified. The machine gun fired a burst of bullets. It is not clear if these shots hit Fakhrizadeh but the car swerved and came to a stop. The shooter adjusted the sights and fired another burst, hitting the windshield at least three times and Fakhrizadeh at least once in the shoulder. The scientist stepped out of the car and crouched behind the open front door. According to Iran's Fars News, three more bullets tore into his spine and he collapsed. The attack was precise, sparing Fakhrizadeh's wife. The Zamyad truck exploded as intended so that no one could piece together what had happened. However, most of the robot equipment remained largely intact. The Iran Revolutionary Guards' assessment - that the attack was carried out by a remote-controlled machine gun "equipped with an intelligent satellite system" using AI - was correct. The operation took less than a minute. Fifteen bullets were fired. The weapon now joins in the arsenal of high-tech weapons for remote targeted killing and might just point to the future of espionage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/the-scientist-and-the-ai-assisted-remote-control-killing-machine/articleshow/86333523.cms||Ronen Bergman

The NHAI is yet to estimate the compensation for the buildings that have to be demolished for the service road. The process may take three more months, only after which, the land acquisition process will pick up pace, official sources said.Revenue department sources said that land in around nine villages was surveyed and prepared for acquisition after releasing the 3D notification in a phased manner from November 2020 till February 2021. Besides the government and private plots in the 14.5-km stretch from Palpanni to Thuvakudi on the NH, several buildings are to be demolished for the service road. “Once NHAI estimates the compensation for the buildings, we will pass an award for compensating both land and property owners. NHAI Thanjavur project implementation unit was instructed to complete the evaluation process,” a senior official in the revenue department said. About 1 lakh square metres of land covering about 5-10 feet from the boundaries of the NH is to be acquired for the road. The NHAI said that they are planning to start the evaluation process in a week. “There are several buildings on the stretch, so it will take around three months to complete the evaluation,” an NHAI official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-progress-in-land-acquisition-notified-for-nh-service-road/articleshow/86330352.cms||Deepak Karthik

Around 1,600 cops from the local arms units and various branches of Mumbai police will be out patrolling the streets, besides 300 constables from outside units, 500 home guards, three companies of State Reserve Police Force and one company of Central Reserve Police Force. More than 4,300 traffic policemen, besides traffic wardens, will be monitoring Ganpati processions and vehicular traffic. “All vital installations will be guarded. Fixed points and mobile patrol will be deployed at sensitive spots and areas. Heavy bandobast will be on at immersion points. Arrangements such as lighting, cranes, swimmers, ambulances and fire engines have been organised in coordination with concerned departments,” said a statement from Mumbai police. Anti-sabotage measures, night patrolling and morning squad operations will carry out checks with high alertness. Traffic police said they have set up five control rooms at key immersion points at Girgaon Chowpatty, Shivaji Park, Juhu, Malwani T-junction in Malad and Ganesh Ghat at Powai. First-aid centres have been set up for offering medical assistance. Watch towers have been erected to monitor the flow of traffic and arrangements made for barricading important roads to segregate crowds going for immersion and returning. “An all-out operation was carried out in the intervening night of September 17 and 18 to weed out criminal activity in the run-up to Anant Chaturdashi. We arrested 57 wanted offenders and 55 others against whom non-bailable arrest warrants were issued by courts. Action was taken against 118 people for buying and sale of drugs and against 31 people for possessing illegal weapons. We also raided 48 locations where sale of illicit liquor and gambling was on and took action against 76 people,” said a police official. Nearly 950 hotels and lodges were scanned and 416 sensitive locations were checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-6k-cops-to-watch-over-streets-vital-installations-for-visarjan/articleshow/86330387.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Saifai bash more important for Samajwadi Party than human lives, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In a scathing attack on Samajwadi Party, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, schemes of earlier governments were not framed by ministers or officers, but by “criminals, mafias and contractors”. Yogi made the remark at the ‘prabuddh samellan’ organized by BJP in Lucknow north assembly constituency on Saturday. “What was the situation in UP more than four years ago? Roads were riddled with potholes, there was no electricity, riots occurred every third day and corruption was rampant. There was complete anarchy with the state ruled by a party that professed nepotism and patronised corruption and criminals. This is bound to raise an identity crisis, stall development and block prospects of youth,” he said. “I am surprised when the Opposition talks about development. When the state faced an onslaught of diseases like dengue and Japanese encephalitis, the then regime enjoyed song and dance by Bollywood stars in Saifai,” he said, unleashing another frontal attack on Samajwadi Party. “Imagine what would have happened if the pandemic occurred before 2017 (when BJP came to power),” Yogi said. “Ministers would have been having fun while people died,” he said, maintaining his government managed to control the first and the second wave. His fresh assertion vis-a-vis pandemic comes amid opposition salvos slamming the BJP regime for failing to control the pandemic. “I visited districts and encouraged the government machinery. When I contracted the virus, I waited for requisite days. But soon after recovering I began touring the state,” he said. In a veiled attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Yogi said: “Some people run to Italy whenever there is a crisis in the country. Many in their family became PM because of UP. But they criticise the state when they go outside. They do the same for India when they go out of the country,” he said. Without naming Congress, Yogi said, their leaders did not believe in Lord Ram and Krishna. “Jo accidentally Hindu banega toh yahi hoga...,” he remarked. The CM said, his government has brought about a sea change by ensuring a robust law and order. “Now, no encroachment on government or private land happens,” Yogi said, stressing bulldozers of his government were always ready for razing illegal occupation. The CM said, UP was now a revenue surplus state, which has amazed finance ministers of many states. Individual interests of people from various caste, sects and religion were “insignificant” in front of ‘rashtra dharma’ (nationalism), he added. Making a veiled reference to the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi, Yogi insisted it was the erstwhile Jan Sangh which stood firmly against the anti-democratic step and powered the constitution of the Janata Party. “And it was under the BJP stalwart Atal Behari Vajpayee that a coalition government was formed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saifai-bash-more-important-for-sp-than-human-lives-cm/articleshow/86331824.cms||Pankaj Shah

The deceased, C Sathiya, an assistant surgeon at the government hospital in Hosur, was travelling along with her mother-in-law Jayam Ammal, 67, who was rescued. Keeranur police which took up investigation said the underpass was flooded in the heavy rain that has been lashing the area since evening. “Unaware that the stagnant water was deep enough to submerge the car, Dr Sathiya drove on,” said sub-inspector of police B Abdul Razzak. He said the Maruti Alto got stuck when it neared the middle of the underpass where the water was deep. “As the car stopped, she tried to come out but she could not unfasten the seatbelt. This suffocated her leading to her death,” the inspector told TOI. A truck coming in the opposite direction also ground to a halt around the middle of the underpass. Razak said the driver of the truck who saw the incident sought help from local people who managed to rescued Jayam Ammal. The deceased, C Sathiya, an assistant surgeon at the government hospital in Hosur, was travelling along with her mother-in-law Jayam Ammal, 67, who was rescued.While the SI said Jayam was in the front seat, deputy superintendent of police Sivasubramanian and revenue divisional officer (RDO) of Iluppur M S Balathandayudhapani said the woman was in the back seat. Local people managed to pull out Sathiya from the car and rush her to hospital but their efforts went in vain. Government medical college hospital dean Dr M Poovathi said Dr Sathiya was brought dead. DSP Sivasubramanian said the woman died due to suffocation inside the car. She is survived by her husband Sivakumar, 40, a native of Thudaiyur, and two children. Though post-mortem was performed on the body, it has been kept at the mortuary for a close relative to return from abroad. Meanwhile, irate local people blocked the road in the night protesting against the lack of safety measure from the railways to keep the underpass, which comes under Madurai railway division, risk-free. The police managed to convince the people to abandon the protest. On Saturday, a peace committee meeting headed by RDO Balathandayudhapani was convened. “Railways should have undertaken safety measures to drain out the water whenever it rained but they failed to do so. As demanded by the people, the unmanned railway gate has been reopened and the underpass closed,” the RDO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/doctor-chokes-to-death-inside-car-in-flooded-underpass/articleshow/86330345.cms||---

Appealing to the people to take benefit of these facilities, the civic administration has called for immersion day festivities in line with Covid prevention norms and eco-friendly celebrations. “To avoid crowding on the immersion day, the local civic body has set up 40 idol collection centres across nine zones. Each centre will have a civic squad and a vehicle for the collection of the Ganesh idols,” said the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). While different dug-wells present in the city are traditionally used to immerse idols, conservationists have appealed to avoid such a practice and encouraged the use of idol collection centres. “Different materials used in the idol-making can clog natural streams through which wells receive the flow of groundwater. Citizens should hand over the idols to the collection centre or immerse it in artificial tanks created by the local civic body,” said honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak. Highlighting that processions among other celebrations involving the crowd have been already prohibited by the city police on the immersion day, AMC has appealed for strict compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour. As a part of preventive orders issued by the city police, assembly of five or more persons is not allowed within the municipal limits of Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/40-idol-collection-centres-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/86326459.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Despite awareness and warnings on part of the authorities, dumping of debris into the Phalguni riverbed was continuing on the stretch between Bagrakuloor and Kuloor in the city. Nearly two acres of riverbed has been converted into a landfill by people, who dump debris, including plastic waste, by flouting rules. While the violation is taking place for several months, the MCC has finally taken up the issue seriously . MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar told TOI that the city corporation will do the needful to protect the river. “We have lodged a complaint against the dumping of debris on the riverbed at Kavoor police station on Saturday. Prima facie, it looks like an effort to encroach upon the riverbed. I have discussed the issue with the regional director of the environment department. We have decided to take action as per law. To prevent such encroachments in future, a joint survey to ascertain the extent of the riverbed and the bank of the Phalguni River at Bangrakuloor will be undertaken. We will erect fences along the riverbanks at identified locations, to prevent dumping of debris,” the commissioner said. The MCC also has plans to install CCTV cameras on the stretch, to spot vehicles transporting debris to the riverbank, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/phalguni-encroachment-mcc-to-fence-riverbank/articleshow/86326457.cms||---

The Ambejogai sessions court on Saturday heard arguments from both sides and kept the matter for further hearing on Monday. After extension of the date of hearing, Sharma-Munde’s lawyer Jayant Bharajkar said: “All the documents and reports have been filed by us as well as the prosecution.” “The regular court was on leave for eight days and resumed today (Saturday), due to which it was overburdened with pending cases, so the matter has been kept for hearing on Monday,” said Bharajkar. On being arrested on September 5, she was remanded in judicial custody, while the other suspect Arun More was sent to police custody for two days. Sharma-Munde then moved a bail application before Ambejogai sessions court. The date of hearing was scheduled for September 14. However, with no one representing either side before the in-charge court, the matter was rescheduled for Saturday. With the latest development, she is all set to complete a period of 15 days behind bars on Monday. Karuna-Sharma after uploading a video message earlier this month had announced of reaching Parli of Beed district and holding a news conference. She had claimed of knowing secrets of several political bigwigs and even had threatened to make them public during the news conference. However, due to the opposition by some locals as well as members of NCP, she could not hold the news conference and allegedly ended up getting into brawl with them, resulting into registration of three FIRs, one for alleged attempt to murder a local and also for allegedly hurling caste based slurs, second for the firearm found in the car she was travelling and the third for violation of covid-19 norms and unlawful assembly during her visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/karunas-custody-extended-by-2-more-days/articleshow/86326514.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Pune||Pune’s vaccination in first 13 days of September highest across Maharashtra||PUNE: Maharashtra’s maximum vaccinations against Covid-19 during the first 13 days of September were conducted in Pune district due to robust supply and improved vaccination infrastructure, a public health department report has shown. The district delivered an average of 61,968 vaccine doses daily during the period, as against 61,666 in Mumbai. Overall, the highest number of jabs have been administered in Mumbai followed by Pune in Maharashtra, the report showed. Health department officials said the number of vaccines administered at some centres crossed 3,000 during the mega-vaccination drives in the last few days in Pune. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “Vaccination infrastructure is robust at the civic body level as well as rural level in the district. We have also augmented vaccination infrastructure at the rural level, which has helped push up vaccination numbers. Similar measures have been taken in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal areas, where apart from large government hospitals, sessions are now being conducted at urban primary health centres (UPHC) and urban community health centres (UCHC). All government health facilities in the district now have Covid vaccination centres (CVCs).” The district also has a good network of cold-chain points, with over 350 such points. “Vaccines can be stored at these centres, which are in close proximity to all the CVCs. Thus, the doses can be delivered without any hiccups. Plans are also in place to push the number of CVCs to 1,000 from the existing 800 government vaccination centres currently operational in Pune district. This will further increase daily vaccination numbers,” he said. He said the biggest factor has been a rise in vaccine supplies in September, which helped Pune administer 1-lakh-plus doses on at least seven days since September 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/districts-vax-in-first-13-days-of-sept-highest-across-state/articleshow/86330403.cms||Neha Madaan

The amount is to develop the plant, install waste bins at secondary collection points and transport waste to the plant and treat it. Kerala state industries development corporation had requested the government to accord sanction to the consortium led by Zonta Infratech Pvt ltd to collect the tipping fee , with a confirmation on maximum per capita based viability gap funding (VGF) of Rs 102.09 crore per tonne as per Swachh Bharat Mission guidelines for the development of the project. But the order does not say whether the local body or the government will give the amount to the agency. “We are planning to make all the municipalities in the district part of the project. There will be a funding mechanism regarding the tipping fee. We have to look at the existing cost local bodies spend for treating waste and the environmental cost due to dumping of waste in public places and water bodies,” said a KSIDC official on condition of anonymity. “We spend around Rs 80 lakh per month to transport waste from various parts of the city and segregate it at the plant. Corporation gets Rs 20 lakh from other local bodies as tipping fee,” said corporation standing committee chairman T K Ashraf. “The tipping feeis to recoup the expenditure we will have to meet for installing the plant and running it for 25 years,” said an official in the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-nod-to-firm-to-collect-tipping-fee/articleshow/86328545.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Young Turk Lalitesh Tripathi quits Congress?||LUCKNOW: In what could jolt Congress before 2022 assembly elections, political corridors on Saturday evening were rife with speculation about the party's young Turk, Lalitesh Pati Tripathi, quitting the grand old party. While most Congress leaders remained tight-lipped or clueless, top sources confirmed to TOI that Tripathi, a fourth-generation Congressman and great grandson of former chief minister Kamlapati Tripathi, had indeed resigned. A second Brahmin leader from UP to desert Congress after Jitin Prasada, he’s rumoured to be in touch with Samajwadi Party and may switch camps soon. However, there was no immediate confirmation from SP on Tripathi’s induction. UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said, “I am yet to receive any intimation from Tripathi or the party leadership and so I cannot comment.” A former MLA from Madhian seat in Mirzapur, Tripathi was anointed UP Congress vice-president and made in charge of party’s activities in eastern districts. While Congressmen appeared rattled, a section in the party said the development may not be true. Talking to TOI, former minister and senior Congress leader Ajai Rai said, “He has not left the party to the best of my knowledge. However, those who would contest elections have been told to quit their official positions as per directives of the party brass.” With Prasada in BJP camp and Tripathi rumoured to join Samajwadi Party, Congress would have to scour for a Brahmin face at a time when all political parties are desperately trying to woo the community, which accounts for 13% of the electorate in the state. Interestingly, Lalitesh was a committed Congressman who had once pledged to wear a turban till the party stormed back to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/young-turk-lalitesh-tripathi-quits-cong/articleshow/86331837.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The collector said the talukas of concern — Ambegaon, Indapur Shirur, Baramati, Junnar and Daund — registered a high weekly positivity rate (WPR). “We have been told to ramp up testing in these areas. The hotspots have been identified and testing would be increased in these areas,” he said. The district administration has also identified 10 villages recording a rise in cases. They are Wagholi, Manchar, Narayangaon, Shikrapur, Nanded, Otur, Nirgudsar, Shelgaon, Rajuri and Hingnibirdi. The district administration carries out detailed surveys every week to enlist new hotspot villages to increase testing in those areas. Health experts iterated that rural areas continued to be of concern in Pune district. Deshmukh, the district collector, said enough rapid antigen test (RAT) kits had been procured to ramp up testing in the hotspots, besides RT-PCR kits. A total of 104 laboratories in the district conduct both RAT and RT-PCR tests. Most of them are in the city areas. The administration was deploying mobile vans to ensure swab samples were quickly transported to these laboratories from remote areas, a health official said. “The collector and commissioners also assured action against the laboratories delaying the Covid test data entry beyond 24 hours, affecting the district’s WPR,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/testing-to-be-increased-in-85-hotspots-collector/articleshow/86330421.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Rajeev Satav had been a member of the state legislative assembly and was later elected to the Lok Sabha in 2014. He was among the two Congress leaders who could win the seats for the part in the 2014 parliamentary elections. He was elected to the RS in March 2020 for his first term in the Upper House of Parliament. Besides Pradnya, Uttamsing Pawar, a former MP and another OBC leader, is the only politician from Marathwada who forms the otherwise long-list of aspirants whose names are doing the rounds for the upcoming polls for the Upper House of Parliament. Pradnya has been given the post of state Congress vice-president recently and is strongly supported by a group of party workers from the region for Rajya Sabha ticket. Satav’s close ties with the party top-brass may help her get the nomination. “Pradnya and Pawar are two possible OBC faces who could get the nomination. However, outside Marathwada, the party has a long-list of Rajya Sabha aspirants, including some senior politicians. The party leadership will take a call on the final name shortly,” a Congress leader from Marathwada said. Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan along with former MPs Mukul Wasnik, Milind Deora and Sanjay Nirupam are considered as hopefuls for the Rajya Sabha ticket. Satav, who had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 22 and died due to post-Covid complications on May 16, was a close confidant of former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and had shouldered different key responsibilities for the party. The Election Commission of India has declared the schedule for six Rajya Sabha seats from five states with polling slated to take place on October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/satavs-widow-lead-contender-for-rs-ticket/articleshow/86326532.cms||---

This is to give in exchange of Asiatic lions which will be brought from Sakkarbaug Zoological Park in Junagadh and Kamla Nehru Prani Sangrahalaya in Indore. Officials said that a consultant had been appointed last year to decide on the availability of zebras which could be given in exchange for the lions. Currently, an approval is being sought from CZA to procure the animals from the foreign zoo under the animal exchange program. A senior zoo official said, “The consultant who was appointed has confirmed the availability of the zebras at the zoo in Israel. Based on that we have made a request to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). Once the same is received, the further process would be initiated with the foreign zoo.” The zebras are being procured as the Gujarat zoo, from where the Asiatic lions are to be brought, has sought a pair of zebras and xthe Byculla zoo does not have the same. Officials from the zoo said that once their exotic facility at the Byculla zoo is ready, they also plan to bring in zebras to the Mumbai zoo. The last animals to have entered the zoo were in February 2019 — two Royal Bengal tigers who are named Shakti and Karishma that were brought to Byculla zoo from Siddharth Garden and Zoo in Maharashtra's Aurangabad city. In exchange for the Byculla zoo, authorities gave the Siddharth zoo two male and two female spotted deer. Tiger Shakti was born in November 2016 while tigress Karishma was born in July 2014. The zoo is currently closed to the public over concerns of the third wave of Covid-19. Last week, the zoo was in the news over the birth of two Humboldt penguin chicks one of whom was born in May and another in August. The same was officially declared last week by Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar. One of the chicks is a male who has been named Oreo while the sex of another is yet to be known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-zoo-plans-to-bring-zebra-pair-from-israel/articleshow/86330437.cms||Richa Pinto

As organising an immersion procession is prohibited, most pandal organisers in the city have decided to keep the affair low key. Food establishments and shops located on the immersion route and in the Irani quarry area have been asked to remain shut on Sunday. KMC municipal commissioner Dr Kadambari Balkawade said, “Artificial immersion tanks will be set up by KMC at 24 places in the city. The pandals are requested to donate the idols. KMC will carry out the immersion process at Irani quarry. If the pandal decides to conduct the immersion on their own at Irani quarry, then only five members will be allowed to accompany the Ganesh idol. Raft and belt conveyor ramp have been kept ready to carry out the immersion.” The Pratham Manacha Ganapati Tukaram Mali Talim Mandal in Kolhapur will be immersed in a tank located at Bhairavnath chowk in Mangalwar Peth at 9.30am. Traffic diversions have been introduced at five routes that will be kept reserved for the immersion Ganesh idols. Police inspector, traffic department, Sneha Giri said, “People should not forget about the Covid-19 pandemic and everybody should follow the guidelines, which have been given by the district collector. On Sunday, all Ganesh idols from the city will be immersed at the Irani quarry next to Rankala Lake. All roads connecting to Irani quarry will be turned into no vehicle zones and no parking zones for all kinds of vehicles except those carrying the Ganesh idols.” Meanwhile, a force of 122 police officers, 1,561 police personnel and 1,500 home guards, under the guidance of police SP Shailesh Balkawade, will be deployed in the city area from early on Sunday morning.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Darshan allowed in most mandals, visarjan to end sooner||MUMBAI: Curtains fall on the 10-day festival of Ganeshotsav at Anant Chaturdashi on Sunday. Most mandals allowed small batches of devotees to visit despite the state ban on physical darshan. Sunday’s visarjan yatra will end sooner than previous years, with fully vaccinated karyakartas in attendance. For the first time in decades, Lalbaugcha Raja will be immersed on the very day of Anant Chaturdashi. Usually, its 21-hour-long procession through South Mumbai makes it the last idol to be immersed the morning after Anant Chaturdashi. This signals an end to Ganeshotsav in the city. “This season we will follow the same route but finish sooner since large processions are banned. We will start at noon and just 10 volunteers will accompany the idol. We will also live-stream the event so people can watch from home,” said mandal president Balasaheb Kamble. Mumbaicha Raja of Ganesh Gully, Lalbaug, will leave its mandap at 10.30am and complete by 1pm unlike the 14-hour yatra of previous years. Despite the ban, devotees arrived in fair numbers to view artistic pandals. Jiten Ganpati in Andheri West had installed an 8x4 ft glass screen for 'mukh darshan' inside the pandal, and a 10x10 ft LED screen outside the society compound for live darshan, said organiser Rohan Uday Singh. “We only allowed visitors in batches of three. Masks were mandatory and all volunteers made sure visitors didn’t pull their masks down. All volunteers were fully vaccinated and made sure all government guidelines were followed,” he said. In Ghatkopar, the old-time Akhil Barve Nagar and Bhatwadi mandal followed a similar protocol. This mandap, said organiser Vilas Chavan, drew sizable footfalls for its advocacy of the postal department’s Sukanya Samriddhi plan. It is sponsoring nearly 150 girl children who each stand to get Rs 5-6 lakh after a few years. Lal Maidan mandal in Parel celebrated its 75th Ganeshotsav with a tableau resembling Ajanta caves. Organiser Surendra Vishwakarma said, “We confined darshan to six or seven people at a time, all wearing masks and keeping distance. Otherwise, all the effort of our landmark anniversary would have gone in vain.” Fort Cha Raja which is observing its 60th anniversary will lead a team of 10 fully vaccinated volunteers for visarjan at Girgaum Chowpatty, said secretary Nayan Dumbre. Khetwadi Mahaganpati of Khetwadi 8th Lane has an idol which resembles Lord Vitthal in keeping with its theme of Pandharpur. It is crafted by moortikar Sunil Varadkar. “Visarjan will take place in traditional warkari style with bhajan kirtan. We have built an artificial pond,” said organiser Nilesh Shirdhankar. The 13th Lane Khetwadi mandal displays a Krishnavatar idol, known as ‘Mumbaicha Anant’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-darshan-allowed-in-most-mandals-visarjan-to-end-sooner/articleshow/86330462.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

According to a complaint, when Devendra Kharvi, 35, who had left Gangolli port for fishing at 6.30pm on Thursday,and did not return home, his brother Krishna Kharvi filed a missing complaint the next day.

He is suspected to have drowned after accidentally falling in the river. Meanwhile, in another incident reported at Byndoor, on Friday, fisherman Charan Raj Kharvi and Annappa Mogaveera drowned, after the fishing boat that they were sailing in capsized. The incident took place about 200m away from Alive Kodi, after a huge wave hit their boat. The bodies were recovered at Ammanavarathoplu in Uppunda on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/three-fishermen-drown-in-two-incidents/articleshow/86326581.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: After Covid break, Kumartuli opens doors to shutterbugs for a fee||KOLKATA: After closing the door to amateur photographers since the start of the pandemic, the Kumartuli artisans’ association has started allowing in shutterbugs for a small fee to survive the pandemic blues and have some extra fund, which goes up to Rs 50,000 a year, handy for medical emergency needs of the potters and their families. Every year in the run-up to Durga Puja, Kumartuli turns into a photographer’s paradise with amateurs and professionals crowding the colony to capture the idols in the making – a subject too lucrative for any photographer to resist. But time and again, artisans have complained that the nuisance created by photographers – both local and foreigners – interrupts the flow of their work. The pandemic gave them just the right excuse to prevent their entry as the Kumartuli Mritsilpa Sanskrity Samity stopped issuing permit cards to completely restrict outsiders at the idol hub. However, with idol prices slashed and profits running low, the Samity has reconsidered its decision and started allowing photographers’ entry again. Not just still photographers, they are also allowing commercial video shoots that fetch more money. “We had stopped entertaining photographers during the Covid period considering safety issues. But now we have started allowing them again against a fee of Rs 50 as we need the money for the artisans’ welfare,” said Babu Pal, secretary of the Samity. Starting from the middle of July, photographers start crowding Kumartuli in groups. A recommended study tour for the amateurs ready to take the steep learning curve in photography, Kumartuli becomes a shutterbugs haunt of epic proportions during the run up to the pujas leaving the idol makers in the potters’ colony dreading the weekends. Shutterbugs armed with cameras, lenses and tripods can be seen squeezing themselves into the tiniest of gaps between idols to capture that one unique frame for posterity. According to veteran photographers, Kumartuli is a challenge for any photographer who wants to learn to shoot interesting subjects in low light and cramped spaces. “All photo schools and photo clubs opt for Kumartuli as it gives photographers a chance to learn about the different formations, patterns and light conditions. It is also preferred by experienced photographers because it presents the challenge of shooting something new in a place that has been captured by thousands of others for years,” said Sudipta Chakraborty, a veteran photographer. If “likes” on Facebook are the reward for a striking picture, the artisans complain of distraction, disturbance and sometimes destruction. “Many a times, the flash lights are a distraction while painting a fine line of the idol’s eye. Some even break idols’ hands or fingers and leave only after an argument. Many photographers are also unapologetic about their behaviour and enter studios and even our homes without permission,” said a veteran idol maker. Another city-based photographer, Sutirtha Basu welcomed the decision but asked photographers to be more courteous and ensure not to disturb artisans or damage their work while shooting at the potters’ hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shutterbugs-welcome-back-at-kumartuli-but-against-a-fee/articleshow/86328623.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Opposition criticises govt over renaming of gram sewaks||JAIPUR: The renaming of gram sewaks as gram vikas adhikari through an amendment in the Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act in the assembly has been dubbed as the ‘mockery’ of assembly proceedings by the Opposition. Leader of Opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria said it was amusing to see how the government listed just renaming of a post in the amendment while deliberately ignoring issues being faced by the department like over 3,386 vacant posts of gram sewaks. “The real empowerment of Panchayati Raj cannot be done until they have their say in all 27 departments while at present, they have said in only four departments. Ideally, the government should have discussed on the problems like funds, the clear mandate of gram vikas adhikaris, inter-department issues and participation of all communities,” said Kataria, who added that exercise doesn’t seem logical until you give them more responsibility to gram vikas adhikaris or gram sewaks nothing will change,” said Kataria. Independent MLA Sanyam Lodha said that mere changing the name of a post cannot help in achieving the larger aim laid down by the former PM Rajiv Gandhi. “Until women will be given larger participation in the Panchayati Raj system, the reforms of the rural Rajasthan cannot be achieved,” said Lodha who added that if renaming can bring the change, the first thing has to rename is collector to pramukh sewak. Replying to the concerns, UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal told that eligibility criteria and roles of GVA have been clearly defined in the rules. “The minimum eligibility criteria of GVAs are graduation in any discipline and they need to be qualified in RSCIT. They have been providing training programs at regular intervals to ensure that they remain updated with the latest changes In technology and rules,” said Dhariwal. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oppn-criticises-govt-over-renaming-of-gram-sewaks/articleshow/86331863.cms||---

This is the same pond which the civic body saved in 2018 from the clutches of land sharks, restored and beautified it. However, due to lack of vigil, a section of local promoters again started filling the same three months ago. Though some residents of the area protested, the offenders continued with their ‘mission’ in the darkness of night. Chairman of the KMC Board of Administrators Firhad Hakim, on Saturday got a call from a local resident who requested him to save the pond again. Hakim said it was unfortunate that despite a restoration, the pond was being filled again. Hakim later said that he would visit the site along with Atin Ghosh and pass on necessary instructions for its restoration. “I need to visit the site and protect the pond from the land sharks,” Hakim told reporters. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cossipore-pond-plaint-reaches-firhad/articleshow/86328586.cms||---

---||Lucknow||UP: Amangarh reserve will be ecotourism site, to be rechristened New Corbett||LUCKNOW: The third tiger reserve of UP, Amangarh Tiger Reserve, will be developed as an ecotourism site on the lines of Dudhwa and Pilibhit reserves, which attract a large number of nature enthusiasts during the ecotourism season. The UP Forest Corporation (UPFC), the nodal agency for ecotourism promotion in the state, will soon hold a meeting with the forest department on the development of Amangarh reserve. The state government has decided to rename the reserve as New Corbett Tiger Reserve. However, Amangarh needs more. “The reserve needs to be developed with basic infrastructure first, like the entry for tourists. Then we need to add facilities like nature guides,” said UPFC MD Sanjay Singh. Amangarh reserve is an 8,000-hectare area in Bijnor district, forming a buffer of the Corbett reserve. It was declared a tiger reserve in 2012 with an intention to manage the fleeting tiger population from Corbett. In 2012, about 13 tigers were counted in the region. The number since has been rising, given the good prey base in the area. In 2018-19, the tiger count was 19, a year later, it went up to 24. In April 2021, over 27 tigers were counted in the reserve. After the formation of Uttarakhand, the tiger population in Amangarh needed management and conservation as there were incidents of man-animal conflict. Being declared a tiger reserve would also mean funds from Project Tiger for its management and development. Sources in the forest department, however, said that Amangarh is getting funds under Project Elephant as of now as it has considerable elephant population. As of now, the reserve does not have a demarcation of core and buffer areas. With its development, it will get all infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amangarh-reserve-will-be-ecotourism-site-to-be-rechristened-new-corbett/articleshow/86331861.cms||Neha Shukla

Besides these, the state has hit another milestone as the number of active cases have come down under the 100-mark for the first time in 16 months. As of Friday, Dumka, Garhwa, Giridih, Godda, Gumla, Hazaribag, Koderma, Pakur, Palamu, Simdega, Ramgarh, Simdega and West Singhbhum did not have any active cases. Due to fewer new infections and more recoveries being reported every day, there has been a regular decrease in the active caseload, which came down to 98 on Friday. The last time active cases were below the 100-mark was on May 18, 2020 when the first wave was gradually picking up and on May 19, it was 112. Ranchi continues to bear the maximum load, almost two-thirds of the active cases in the state. In terms of vaccination figures, 1,23,77,640 persons have received the first dose, out of the 2,47,41,319 eligible population, according to the state health department, as of Friday. As many as 33,93,670 persons, which corresponds to 13.7% of the population, have become fully vaccinated. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said though the situation is encouraging, it was too early to declare a victory. “We cannot be complacent and must continue to take precautions so that there is no fresh outbreak of the infection and the vaccination process must continue at a steady pace,” he added. The head of the state unit of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Dr Praveen Kumar Karn, said that it would be premature to say that the worst is over. “People still need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/over-50-of-target-popn-have-taken-first-dose-govt/articleshow/86328599.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Talking to media persons at Birsa Munda International Airport, Yadav said: “The country would not develop until the area falling under old Bihar progresses. Jharkhand is a mineral-rich state, which makes huge contribution to the nation’s growth. The Centre, however, is not ensuring adequate aid for the state’s growth.” Yadav, who is on a two-day visit to the state, was given a grand welcome by party workers at the airport and along his route, where 31 welcome gates were erected, in the city. Yadav garlanded the statues of Karpuri Thakur at Hinoo Chowk and Birsa Munda at Birsa Chowk upon his arrival. He is scheduled to meet chief minister Hemant Soren and address a meet of the RJD workers on Sunday. Former Union minister and the RJD’s Jharkhand in-charge Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav said the working president is visiting to strengthen party organisation in the state. “The RJD wants to win many seats in the next Assembly elections. Our main target is the BJP as the latter has caused a huge damage to the nation,” he added. RJDs state president Abhay Singh said a large number of workers from across the state are expected to participate in the workers’ meet to be held at Dibdih on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-not-providing-enough-aid-to-state/articleshow/86328548.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The incident occurred at Kadma toll bridge site under the Kadma police station area. The woman was identified as Santoshi her four-year-old daughter Manisha and her one-year-old son Manish. They were residents of Ramjanamnagar. Their bodies were yet to be traced when this report was filed. Her husband Govardhan Sardar, who is a mason, said that she was of unsound mind which might explain why she took the extreme step. “Thrice in the past she had escaped from the house only to be brought back by some relatives,” he added. A local, however, preferring anonymity said Santoshi was upset with her husband for not taking proper care of her and the children. “Govardhan, who was an alcoholic and was jobless, paid no attention to his household responsibilities. His wife used to work to look after the children,” the local, who lives close to Govardhan’s house, said, adding that on Thursday she had a fight with Govardhan. Police said that investigation on the matter is underway and their primary task now to locate the three bodies.

The report of the interview process will be tabled before the syndicate members during the forthcoming meeting on September 21. The post of registrar is the second most important administrative post in the state universities. At MSU, it is since more than a decade now that the university does not have a regular registrar and the post is being handled on in-charge or officiating basis. Dr K M Chudasama, the current officiating registrar is himself handling the post since a year and a half. He was an associate professor at the Department of Economics of Faculty of Arts. Before Chudasama, the post was handled on in-charge basis by university engineer N K Ojha, who in turn was handed over the charge in June 2018 after professor Neerja Jaiswal, who was handling the charge as officer on special duty (OSD) had submitted her resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/attempt-to-get-regular-msu-registrar/articleshow/86328452.cms||---

The incident happened at Manandeeh Tola in Bukru village under Seregara panchayat of the Balumath police station area on Friday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chief minister Hemant Soren and BJP state president Deepak Prakash on Saturday expressed shock at the incident. In a tweet by the PMO, the prime minister said, “Shocked by the loss of young lives due to drowning in Latehar district, Jharkhand. In this hour of sadness, condolences to the bereaved families.” Balumath circle officer Aftab Alam said three of the victims, Rekha (18), Rina (11) and Laxmi (8), are sisters and daughters of Aklu Ganjhu. The four other deceased are identified as Sushma Kumari (7), daughter of Charan Ganju; Meena (8), daughter of Laldev Ganjhu; Pinki Kumari (15), daughter of Jagan Ganjhu, and Sunita Kumari (17), daughter of late Bifa Ganjhu. The girls had gone to the pond early in the morning for immersion of Karam tree branches as part of the puja. Locals said all seven of them drowned one after another as they stepped into the pond. Since it was early morning, there was no one around to help them immediately. Later, some boys noticed them and rushed in to help but five of the girls had already died while two were fished out in an unconscious state. “Both were rushed along with the five others to the Balumath community health centre but the doctors declared them brought dead,” Alam said. The circle officer also said the bodies were sent to the sadar hospital for post mortem after getting consent from their respective parents. Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Abu Imran has directed the Latehar civil surgeon, Dr H C Mahto, to set up a three-member medical board to conduct the post mortem, following which a panel comprising Akhilesh Prasad, Ak Orya and Hari Om Prasad was constituted. Expressing grief at the incident, Soren tweeted, “Shocked at the drowning and death of seven girls in Latehar. May they rest in peace and may the family members get the strength to bear the pain...” BJP state president Deepak Prakash while expressing grief urged the state government to announce compensation for the bereaved family. “The Hemant Soren government must announce an ex gratia relief of at least Rs 10 lakh each for the kin of the victims,” he said.

SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, parachuted into the sea around 7pm EDT, shortly before sunset, after an automated re-entry descent, SpaceX said during a live webcast shown on its YouTube channel. The return from orbit followed a plunge through Earth's atmosphere generating frictional heat that sent temperatures surrounding the outside of the capsule soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,927 degrees Celsius). The astronauts' flight suits are designed to keep them cool if the cabin heats up. Applause was heard from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles as the first parachutes were seen deploying, slowing the capsule's descent to about 15 miles per hour (24.14 kilometers per hour) before splashdown, and again as the craft hit the water. Recovery vessels were shown headed toward the water-proof Crew Dragon as it bobbed upright, nose up, in the water. SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla Inc electric automaker CEO Elon Musk, said it should take about an hour to get the crew out of capsule. A camera shot from inside the cabin showed them sitting calmly strapped into their seats. SpaceX supplied the spacecraft, launched it from Florida and flew it from the company's suburban Los Angeles headquarters. The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of just over 363 miles (585 km) - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972. It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings. The Inspiration4 team was led by its wealthy benefactor, Jared Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, who assumed the role of mission "commander." "That was a heck of a ride for us," he radioed from the capsule moments after splashdown. "We're just getting started." He had paid an undisclosed but reportedly enormous sum - put by Time magazine at roughly $200 million - to fellow billionaire Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon. Isaacman was joined by three less affluent crewmates he had selected - geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, physician's assistant and childhood bone cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42. Isaacman conceived of the flight primarily to raise awareness and donations for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tennessee, where Arceneaux was a patient and now works. The Inspiration4 crew had no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which was operated by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, even though Isaacman and Proctor are both licensed pilots. SpaceX already ranked as the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the space station for NASA. Two rival operators, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and Blue Origin, inaugurated their own astro-tourism services in recent months, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, each going along for the ride. Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's three days in orbit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/spacex-capsule-with-worlds-first-all-civilian-orbital-crew-splashes-down-off-florida/articleshow/86333582.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Healthy living: Plant-based, organic diet grows popular||BENGALURU: The pandemic has prompted many people to switch to a more organic, plant-based diet that includes nutraceuticals or supplements. The trend is gaining popularity globally, said panellists during a discussion on the developments in the food sector. The discussion took place on Friday as part of the 17th India Innovation Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Sushma Vasudevan, managing director and partner, BCG Group, said that an entire movement was focused on health and nutrition. “Consumers are looking for personalised nutrition products and there is a growing interest in the nutraceuticals market,” she said. Nutraceuticals, like immunity boosters or sports drinks, are products derived from food sources which provide nutrition and medicinal benefits. Vasudevan added that the nutraceuticals market in India would grow from the current $4 billion to $18 billion by 2025. She explained that the global focus on health and nutrition had also opened up an export segment for Indian superfoods such as turmeric and moringa. “There is also a trend where people are interested in locally grown and sourced food. We must encourage R&D and innovation in this field,” she said. C Anandharamakrishnan, director, Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (GOI), said that the institute had developed vegan meat, vegan milk and rice kernels fortified with iron to meet the nutritional needs of populations. “We have also developed edible plates from jackfruit, which can provide good nutrition, and we are looking at teacups on similar lines,” he said, adding that making environmentally friendly choices was also pushing demand for these products. Sujatha Jayaraman, VP (R&D), Unilever Beverages, said that plant-based meat and alternative dairy products were still a niche area but with a bright future. “We are looking at making one billion sales from these products in the next five to seven years,” she said. Piruz Khambatta, CMD, Rasna Pvt Ltd, said that apart from vegan and organic foods, other trends include inclination towards ‘aatmanirbhar’ food sourcing and nutritious and climate-friendly food. “We can relook at genetic and biomolecular science to transplant DNA and create nutritious food like higher protein banana, high-fibre and low-sugar potato, and allergen-free nuts,” he said, adding the government, industry and NGOs must join hands. The demand for health and sustainability is also reflected in innovations in packaging. Yatindra Sharma, MD, KHS Machinery Pvt Ltd, said that it had introduced a technique to package natural beverages such as coconut water without adding preservatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/healthy-living-plant-based-organic-diet-grows-popular/articleshow/86337603.cms||Farheen Hussain

The descent of Punjab Congress in less than a year from seeing the assembly polls as an apparently one-way affair to a picture of trepidation among legislators about their prospects had the towering figure of Amarinder Singh at its core. The humiliation of Akali Dal in 2017 ensured the regional party struggled with regaining its credibility, given a debilitating blow by Singh's campaign, while the protests over the three new farm laws raised the prospect of a friendly field.

Amarinder had come out unscathed from that crisis by appointing Bhattal as deputy chief minister. Another major difference this time is that most if the party MLAs, apparently worried about anti-incumbency, did not stand by him. Even the two Aam Aadmi Party turncoats, who had joined the Congress in Amarinder’s presence recently, supported the move to dethrone him. MLAs Pirmal Singh Khalsa and Jagdev Singh Kamalu, who were elected on AAP ticket but joined the Congress with months to go for assembly elections, stated that they were bound to act as per the directions issued by the party (Congress). MLA from Bhadaur in Barnala, Khalsa said: “After joining the Congress, we are the soldiers of the party. When the party convened the meeting, we attended it. We did not get any information about the meeting convened by Captain Amarinder Singh. We are bound to act as per the directions of the party president.” MLA from Maur in Bathinda, Kamalu too said he had no knowledge about the meeting of MLAs convened by the CM. “I got a call from party office in Chandigarh about the meeting convened by party president Navjot Singh Sidhu, also to be attended by observers from high command. I attended that meeting,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-turncoats-in-cong-stand-by-their-new-party/articleshow/86332056.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Kagwad MLA’s sugar factory polluting water, say villagers||BELAGAVI: Residents of Kagwad taluk are furious at their MLA Shrimant Patil as the sugar factory owned by the legislator is allegedly polluting the water bodies in the region, affecting the quality of drinking water. The residents of Kaulagudda, Siddewadi, Kempawad and other villages have been bearing the brunt as Athani Sugars Limited is allegedly releasing certain chemical waste into water bodies, according to the villagers. They also allege that the contaminated water is also affecting the crops and that they are now forced to fetch drinking water from far away places. Patil is chairman and managing director of Athani Sugars Limited. Despite villagers approaching the factory administration, they denied any wrongdoing, saying that they release little waste into river. However, the villagers claim that the waste flows into lakes and agricultural fields during monsoons. The residents have also filed a complaint with the Pollution Control Board. “A black thick liquid is released into nearby lakes due to which open wells are also contaminated. The factory has been doing this from past ten years and now pollution level intolerable. We see the black liquid on our fields too now,” said farmer Ramesh Wagmore. Speaking to TOI, Shrishail T, a farmer from Kagwad said the waters of open wells and tube wells reek of chemical waste and it is not potable any more. “The district administration has to intervene and resolve the issue immediately,” Pollution control board official Jagadish H said the department has collected the samples of the waste and sent it for testing after conducting a survey as directed by the tahsildar. “It appears there is a problem in these villages and soon it will be addressed,” he assured. Denying allegations levelled by the villagers, Patil said the factory is equipped with effluent treatment plant at a cost of Rs 45 crore. “During rains, some amount of chemical waste may have flown to agricultural lands, but it does not have the potential to damage the crops,” he said. He termed the protest an attempt to defame him and his factory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/villagers-mlas-sugar-factory-polluting-water/articleshow/86325689.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi

All of them were vaccinated in the first phase of the drive. Datta Meghe Medical College (DMMC) dean Dr Dilip Gode said the students were kept in the college’s Covid hospital as a precautionary measure though none of them has developed any symptoms since September 6. Dr Sandeep Shinde, medical officer at the police hospital, said all the infected cops are doing well and were shifted to the MLA Hostel Covid care centre (CCC) as per the civic body norms. Both Dr Gode and Dr Shinde confirmed that no more close contacts of the infected persons tested positive in the same chain. Dr Shinde said 630 high risk close contacts of the 12 cops and 1,600 staffers of different police stations were traced and tested but none was found positive. “Different teams were formed to cover 10 police stations where the 33 cops had been deployed and may have possibly come in contact with the staff there,” Dr Shinde said. The 12 infected cops were among the 33 cops who had returned from training at Pune. On Sunday, a second Covid test will be done and based on the CT value, the cops would be discharged. A CT value above 25 will ensure discharge even if they test positive again. MLA Hostel CCC incharge Dr Varsha Deosthale said none of the patient quarantined since Aug 25 has tested positive in the second sampling. The MBBS students would be completing their 14-day isolation at the college’s hospital on Sunday. Dr Gode said once the students are discharged, classes would resume to in-person teaching. Over 100 other first year students were quarantined. Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a member of the district task force, said the situation can be seen in the context of what is happening in the US. “Admission rate is very high of the unvaccinated patients in the US. ICU beds are getting full there with those who did not get vaccinated. The MBBS students and police cases are a strong indicator for those who are still not sure of taking the vaccine,” he said, stressing that still there is a chance before the third wave. Besides vaccination, Dr Sarnaik added that the decision to quarantine has helped control the spread. “This is the strategy to be followed. We quarantine them and ensure they don’t spread the infection to others and remain under monitoring,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-oxygen-drop-or-symptoms-vaxxed-mbbs-students-cops-set-for-discharge/articleshow/86329501.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Goa||Goa: August witnessed sharp rise in dengue cases||PANAJI: August saw 117 dengue cases as against 36 reported for the corresponding period in 2020. However, doctors said that the steep rise in dengue infections last month cannot be likened to that seen last August as the period had overlapped with the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “With Goa reporting Covid-19 cases from June last year, novel coronavirus was the focus. Several areas were declared containment zones, and surveillance (for vector borne diseases) was affected. This year, Covid infections started dropping from May-end, and we could do better surveillance,” health officers in charge of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in Goa, Dr Kalpana Mahatme said. But, overall, there has been a rise in dengue cases in 2021. As many as 383 dengue infections were reported from January till August-end as against 248 cases for a similar period in 2020. August saw more cases with the majority reported from Vasco and Panaji. Goa’s first wave of the pandemic started in June last year with an outbreak reported from Mongor Hill, a congested and densely populated area of the port town. Within a month, Vasco turned into a hotspot. The second wave peaked in May, and cases started dropping drastically from June onwards. “Not only has surveillance been better this time, but more tests were done as health centres tested all cases of fever for malaria and dengue, besides Covid-19,” Mahatme said. While the spread of dengue in Cortalim was under control in August, Vasco did not see a downturn. In July, it had 41 cases, and last month 46 were reported from the town, while Cortalim’s tally dropped from 24 to 12 cases in August. Panaji and Vasco have been the areas of concern for the directorate of health services (DHS). “Panaji and Vasco have been our major concern,” she said. The DHS has intensified its efforts by involving the civic body in Vasco. It also wrote to the South Goa collector as several major establishments such as the Goa Shipyard Ltd, Mormugao Port Trust, railways and Navy are based in the port town. “We want them to chip in and look after their areas as our limited workforce cannot be inspecting their areas as frequently as needed. They also have sanitary inspectors. It is high time they too help us,” Mahatme said. The problem with Vasco, she said, is because several of the areas pockets have slums such as Baina, New Vaddem, Vaddem, and irregular water supply is a perennial problem. “The PWD has been asked to supply those areas water 24X7 to discourage residents from collecting water in pots and pans which facilitates mosquito breeding,” she said. Since residents don’t listen to health workers, she said they also had a meeting with officers of the municipality and councillors requesting them to form groups and visit their respective wards to create awareness and undertake source reduction drives. The groups are yet to be constituted, Mahatme said. While fogging is done wherever cases are detected, it is not the solution to stop the spread of dengue. “Fogging will kill adult mosquitoes, but the larvae will remain intact and reproduction will continue. That’s why we wanted the municipality to carry out house-to-house awareness,” she said. The areas of the capital that had dengue infections were Miramar Bhatlem and St Inez. North Goa had 59 cases in August reported from Panaji, Chimbel, Aldona, Siolim and Candolim. The erratic monsoon also contributed to the problem. During dry spells water accumulated in objects like containers and tires turn into potential breeding grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/august-witnessed-sharp-rise-in-dengue-cases/articleshow/86329974.cms||---

---||Goa||Bid to woo investors for Tuem tech hub hits wall||PANAJI: The state government failed to woo large investors and electronic manufacturing companies to set up shop at the greenfield electronic manufacturing park Tuem despite lowering the plot rates. The Tuem electronic manufacturing cluster, delayed by four years, has seen all the interested investors flee due to slow bureaucratic process in Goa. In August, the state government had offered industrial plots ranging from 7,000sqm to 38,900sqm for electronics system design and manufacturing at the Tuem electronic manufacturing cluster (EMC), but not a single large firm showed interest in setting up an anchor unit. “Only one application was received. A single Goan firm showed interest in setting up a small manufacturing facility at Tuem,” said a member of the screening committee that has been constituted to scrutinise the applications. Ironically, Info Tech Corporation of Goa (ITG) had rejected an offer from IFB Industries Ltd to set up a massive manufacturing facility with ancillary units at Tuem. Prior to that, aerospace firm Aequs Pvt Ltd had offered to setup a Rs 500 crore precision engineering facility at Tuem, while Smartlink Network Systems, GIT Electronics and Optel Vision had also evinced interest in the facility. The lengthy delays and lack of supporting infrastructure compelled the firms to look elsewhere, said industry sources. The department of information and technology has put up 45 micro industrial zone plots at Tuem, ranging from 300sqm to 800sqm, for allotment to component manufacturers who are part of the larger supply chain. The department has offered larger industrial plots, which range from 7,000 sqm to 38,900sqm, at a lower rate of Rs 540 per sqm to attract investors, while the micro industrial plots are being offered at Rs 1,200 per sqm. The Union ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has granted financial assistance under the EMC scheme to set up the Tuem greenfield electronics manufacturing cluster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bid-to-woo-investors-for-tuem-tech-hub-hits-wall/articleshow/86338631.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Goa||Uguem locals approach minesdept against stone quarry ops||Quepem: Uguem locals on Thursday filed a complaint with the director of mines and minerals against illegal excavation of minerals by a quarry operator. During his recent visit, chief minister Pramod Sawant had assured the locals of stopping the laterite quarry operation at Uguem. The locals had brought to his notice that illegal basalt stone quarries are in operation and blasting is being carried out, resulting in weakening of their houses. In their complaint, locals alleged that four persons are involved in extraction of laterite stones and several trees have been felled. A dispute of ownership has arisen over the land where the ‘illegalities’ are taking place. Locals alleged that the lease agreement between Sociedade Patriotica dos Baldios Novas Conquistas, Uguem and the operators has expired. The government recently included its name in the form I&XIV in the entire area along with the tenants and single owners, but deleted the names of Sociedade from the survey records based on the 1966 Official Gazette. The complaints further state that extraction of basalt stone has done ecological damage to the rivers as polluted water is pumped into it from the quarries. They also complained that low-lying paddy fields have sustained massive damage as the mining refuse is being channeled into it. Copies of the complaint have also been addressed to the chief minister, chief secretary, chairman of the Goa State Pollution Control Board, south Goa collector and Sanguem police inspector. Sanguem PI Praveen Gawas told TOI that he has summoned quarry operators as well as the complainant at the police station. “I told them to submit all relevant documents and lease licences for verification,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/uguem-locals-approach-minesdept-against-stone-quarry-ops/articleshow/86330116.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Maternity leave hiked to 12 months from 9 months||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has issued a letter to all secretaries and heads of departments, confirming the government order increasing the period of maternity leave for government employees to 12 months from the existing nine months. The letter was issued from the office of the chief secretary on Friday, making official the announcement made by state finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan during the assembly session last month and the subsequent government order passed on August 23. “The maternity leave admissible to married women government servants with less than two surviving children, which is nine months (270 days) at present, be enhanced to 12 months with effect from July 1, with full pay, which may be spread over from the pre-confinement rest to post confinement recuperation, at the option of the women government servants,” the letter stated. Government employees who proceeded on maternity leave prior to July 1 and continue to be on that leave shall also be eligible for maternity leave for a period not exceeding 365 days in total. Women employees who rejoined duty between July 1 and August 28 (date of GO) after 270 days of maternity break may also be given leave for three more months, the letter added. The announcement was one of the DMK’s poll promises. The policy will help the state’s target of increasing the number of infants who are breastfed in the first six months of life. It will also help mothers get back to good health, said officials from the social welfare department. “Tamil Nadu provides cash benefits, free vaccination and nutrition supplement for mothers and babies. But several mothers are not able to take care of themselves and their babies because they don’t have enough time,” said a senior social welfare official. The longer maternity leave will change this, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-maternity-leave-hiked-to-12-months-from-9-months/articleshow/86333762.cms||---

---||India||Resignations have defined Amarinder’s political career||JALANDHAR: All his political career, Captain Amarinder Singh never played on the side-lines, hence his third resignation, although the first two were out of own volition, a perceived sacrifice that built his stature. The Punjab chief minister may be out for now due to compulsion but he can't be written off, since he still has his cards close to his chest. He became a Congress MP in 1980 and joined the negotiations to sort out the Punjab issue before Operation Bluestar happened and he resigned from both Parliament and the party in 1984 despite being a personal friend of the Gandhis. This gave him a place in history that, later, helped him dominate the Punjab Congress affairs for more than two decades. Whoever remained Punjab Congress president, Amarinder remained tallest in the party's state unit. He switched to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and became a minister in Surjit Singh Barnala's government in September 1985. Seven months later, he quit that cabinet in protest when police entered Darbar Sahib on Barnala's orders. By this, he endeared himself to the Sikhs. After the Akalis denied him ticket in the 1997 elections, he moved back to the Congress in 1998. Sonia Gandhi made him the state chief of the party and he led it to a sterling performance in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls. Public dissatisfaction was working against the Parkash Singh Badal government but Amarinder had the hard task of bridging the gap between the Congress and the Sikhs. In 2002, he led the party to victory and sent Badal and his son, Sukhbir Singh Badal, to jail in corruption cases in which they were, later, exonerated. Another high point of his political career was the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act in 2004, for which he called a special session of the assembly. It nullified all the agreements with other states and the Centre on the sharing of river waters. It had inter-state consequences. In the early 1980s, Congress CM Darbara Singh had withdrawn a petition from the Supreme Court on river waters' issue. Capt became a "saviour of Punjab waters" in the party's eyes, even as the SAD also claimed to have championed the cause. In a previous tenure, he survived an open rebellion by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. The Punjab Congress lost the 2007 and 2012 assembly elections, both times under his command, but his charisma was not lost. On Sonia Gandhi's prodding, he contested the parliamentary election from Amritsar in 2014 as outsider in the game and defeated BJP giant Arun Jaitley, which pushed Amarinder's national appeal and helped him not only wrest the Punjab Congress presidentship from Partap Singh Bajwa but also win the state by a huge mandate of 77 seats. When his charisma worked Amarinder could force party high command to appoint him as Punjab Congress president even after he made some not-so-charitable remarks about Rahul Gandhi in an interview in September 2015. He was undisputed leader of Punjab Congress and had his way for six years both in the government as well as in the party. If the party's central leadership had weakened after 2014 parliament election, he had grown stronger at the same time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/resignations-have-defined-amarinders-political-career/articleshow/86333809.cms||IP Singh
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Teen deleted messages, photos, videos before shooting himself||BENGALURU: Police probing the alleged suicide of second PU student Rahul Bhandari said the motive behind the extreme step is still a mystery. Rahul, a student of Army Public School (Parachute Regiment Training Centre) in JC Nagar and younger son of Bhagat Singh from RT Nagar, shot himself in the head using his father’s licensed pistol at a bus shelter behind IAF training centre on Sanjaynagar Main Road early Friday morning. A CCTV footage had shown Rahul checking his cellphone while walking towards the bus shelter. This had led cops to think he might have been sending some messages. However, now police have found that Rahul hadn’t sent any messages. Instead, he deleted many WhatssApp messages, photos and videos before entering the bus shelter. “Rahul’s father Bhagat Singh told us that Rahul had been quieter than usual for a couple of days and was interacting little with friends and others. Around 2am Friday, he woke up his mother, asking for a picture of her and his elder sister. She convinced him saying he could get them in the morning. These actions indicate he was upset. But we are yet to find reason behind the same,” said an investigating officer. During initial interaction with police, parents, close family members and teachers from Rahul’s school said he did not face any academic pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/teen-deleted-messages-photos-videos-before-shooting-himself/articleshow/86328603.cms||---

According to locals at Kalicharanpur in Block No.1 of Nandigram, the trio found the round object in an abandoned house and started playing with it. It slipped out of one of their hands and exploded. The children were rushed to Nandigram super speciality hospital. Jahirun Khatoon was later shifted to Tamluk district hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The others, a boy and a girl, are battling for life. The incident triggered a political blame game, with local BJP leader Pralay Pal saying: “The area is a typical Trinamool citadel where bombs were stored to attack a Bajrang puja procession.” Trinamool leader Abu Taher claimed there was a conspiracy behind the blast. “I am making inquiries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/9-yr-old-killed-as-kids-mistake-bomb-for-ball-in-nandigram/articleshow/86330615.cms||Suman Mandal
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee alone can bring change in 2024: Abhishek Banerjee||KOLKATA: “If anyone uses the name of TMC or my name to harass you, lodge a police complaint... If anyone intimidates you saying he is well connected, tell me and I will throw him out. No dadagiri will be tolerated,” Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress’ national general secretary and CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, said on Saturday at a closed-door interaction with 80-odd Hindi-speaking voters from the business community.  He was campaigning for the CM ahead of the September 30 Bhowanipore by-election and stressed that she was the only one who could bring change in Delhi in 2024. Buoyed by former Union minister Babul Supriyo’s entry to the partyfold, Abhishek walked into Lakshmi Narayan temple on Sarat Bose Road at 6pm and performed a brief puja. It followed the by-invitation-only meeting, which was held in the first floor hall adjoining the temple. More residents were accommodated in the ground floor hall where LED screens aired the campaigning. “B stands for Bhowanipore and B also stands for Bharat. If Bhowanipore wins, Bharat will win too,” Abhishek kicked off his interaction in English. The next 40 minutes saw him speak in Hindi to woo the non-Bengali business community. He said the voting on September 30 “is not an ordinary vote”, but one the entire country was looking forward to. “From UP to Haryana, people are coming to us and saying Mamata Banerjee alone can bring change in Delhi. Today, Babul Supriyo has also joined us. Wait and watch the level our party will reach in the next three months; the game hasn’t started yet,” he told the attendees. Abhishek said in 2024, it would not be a fight between the BJP and the Trinamool, but one between the BJP and the people of India. “People even came from Gujarat to meet me. There is no state that has not found hope in Mamata Banerjee. If there is anyone who can defeat the BJP, it is Mamata Banerjee. It will not be TMC versus BJP in the next general elections, but BJP versus the people of India,” he said. On the issues of cut money and extortion — two of the major allegations made by the BJP against Trinamool ahead of the assembly polls — Abhishek asked his audience not to be afraid of goons and extortionists, and write directly to him if there was any case of harassment. He even cited an example of how he had recently rescued a businessman from the clutches of an extortionist who was allegedly using the party’s name. “If anyone uses the party’s name or my name to harass you, lodge a complaint and then meet these leaders (pointing to party seniors like Subrata Mukherjee, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay and Subrata Bakshi). You can also write to me. I will throw them out. No dadagiri will be tolerated,” he said. Replying to a couple of questions on Centre-state non-cooperation, Abhishek finished the meeting on the janeu (sacred thread worn by Brahmins) note, the second leader to do so after Congress’ Rahul Gandhi. “The BJP has only three issues to talk about — Hindus, Muslims and Pakistan. I am a janeu-dhari Brahmin and I don’t need a certificate of Hinduism from them,” he said, signing off with the plea to come out in large numbers and vote on September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-alone-can-bring-change-in-24-abhishek/articleshow/86329951.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Young entrepreneurs brew a cup of cheer||Kolkata: A handful of budding entrepreneurs are hoping to offer a truly energising morning cuppa by breaking free from the tea industry’s age-old practices and by leaving behind a debilitating slump in business. In the absence of a home-grown global brand, domestic tea planters were not just realising lower value on their produce, but also losing profit to foreign brands that were blending Indian brew with tea from other countries. Tea-focused startups in India, mostly owned by third- or fourth-generation tea traders, have spotted the lacunae and plan to reverse the trend. Startups have come to realise that the need of the hour is to remove middlemen and deliver estate-fresh brew directly to tea aficionados across the globe, along with a range of value-added products. Vahdam India founder and CEO Bala Sarda feels the country should emerge as one of the top global exporters to retain value. “This is also one of the long-term sustainable ways. Some startups are influencing this welcome change,” Sarda said. From omni-channel sales platforms, swanky carts and cafes to tech-aided logistics support and exports, these newbie tea outfits are taking baby steps in every possible domain in the agro-based industry. Young entrepreneurs, more than their senior counterparts, are catching up with the idea of reaching out to their target audience through branding. “Countries in the West and the US consume ready-to-drink tea more than others. The Indian tea market is yet to follow the trend, but experiments have already started, courtesy startups,” said ITA secretary Sujit Patra. Tea Research Association (TRA) secretary Joydeep Phukan believes the arrival of entrepreneurs has led to positive social media buzz. TRA facilitates new technology for startups like Agnext and Fasal. “Traditional players have reoriented themselves and are aggressively selling tea directly by telling their stories. The more tea producers sell directly, the better it is for the industry,” he said. Tea consumption in India before the Covid-19 pandemic was broadly driven by traditional means of marketing through distributors, wholesalers and retailers. “The considerable growth in online tea orders has also helped create awareness of Indian specialty teas across the world,” said Kaushal Dugar, founder of Siliguri-based Teabox, one of the pioneers among Indian tea startups. According to Dugar, by leveraging technology, startups have sparked new hope in an industry that has been hit by Covid-induced crop losses, logistics bottlenecks and lockdowns in destination markets. Adoption of unique sales plans too has given hope to the industry that has suffered price pressures for decades. Dorje Teas in Darjeeling has been offering a subscription plan to home-deliver each of the four flushes of loose-leaf teas as seasons change. Udyan Tea, which originated in Siliguri, is not only supplying tea to clients but also doing end-to-end business collaborations. “Convenience of ordering online helps consumers try new brands and varieties from non-traditional players,” said Sarda. Thanks to the startup culture, people, particularly millennials, have started sipping specialty Darjeeling teas, which were mainly exported to EU/US, and other newer tea varieties such as wellness and herbals. “The challenge now is to sustain the momentum, create newer experiences for customers, particularly with respect to taste, flavours and customer engagement,” said Dugar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/young-entrepreneurs-brew-a-cup-of-cheer/articleshow/86330466.cms||Sovon Manna

Bank officials, who attended the meeting at Nabanna, are learnt to have assured Dwivedi that the loan payout system will be streamlined within a fortnight. The credit card scheme, a flagship initiative of the Mamata Banerjee government in Bengal, was among promises made in the Trinamool Congress manifesto ahead of the assembly elections earlier this year. Under the scheme, economically weak but meritorious students can avail a loan of up to Rs 10 lakh at a nominal interest rate, depending on the term of repayment. However, soon after the scheme was rolled out, complaints swamped district officials about banks being reluctant to sanction loans without collateral — such as mortgage of land deed/house or a fixed deposit of equivalent amount — despite the state being the guarantor for every student needing this financial assistance. The government had issued standing instructions to the state-level bankers’ committee on the need to issue hassle-free loans to students, but the same received a tepid response. After complaints poured in at a review meeting on Friday, the chief secretary decided to intervene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/banks-to-fix-glitches-in-student-credit-card-loans-in-14-days/articleshow/86330019.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Battle of the Kettle||Nepal, with its 157 tea gardens, produces 25.2 mkg leaves annually and more than 50% of this output finds its way into India, reveals data from the National Tea & Coffee Development Board, Nepal. With similar-looking leaves, the unregulated influx of its poor cousin from the neighbouring country is slowly turning Darjeeling tea cold Kolkata: If the lightness and aroma of the Darjeeling cuppa, the Champagne of Teas as it is fondly called worldwide, is missing, blame Nepal. Over the last decade, the erstwhile generous approach to import regulation and the porous Indo-Nepalese border have allowed an uninterrupted entry of Nepalese tea into India. Once blended with its Indian counterpart, these leaves are being passed off as the iconic ‘Darjeeling Tea’ by deceiving unsuspecting consumers, damaging the reputation of India’s first GI-tagged product. GI or geographical indication stamp on a product ensures that none other than those authorised within a legally earmarked region can produce, use and sell it. Tea planters in Darjeeling have sought a permanent end to the import and sale of “cheap, low-quality and spurious Nepalese brew, which falls short of complying with Indian food safety norms”. “Selling it in India or abroad in the name of ‘Darjeeling Tea’ is an infringement of intellectual property rights,” says Anshuman Kanoria, chairman, Indian Tea Exporters’ Association. Since 2005, unfortunately, the GI on Darjeeling tea has helped little to weed out illegal ‘Nepalese Darjeeling’ leaves from the market. Industry experts say a lenient India-Nepal Free Trade Agreement has further empowered traders to legally import tea from Nepal. The confusion increases manifold when buyers are told that estates of the Himalayan nation bordering Darjeeling enjoy all four climatic factors for producing good tea — sunshine, rainfall, elevation and the mist. But, according to Hills planters, Darjeeling tea possesses a distinctive character and rare muscatel flavour owing to soil chemistry, terrain slope and scientific plucking. Over the years, the Darjeeling Tea Association (DTA), the umbrella body of 87 tea gardens in the Hills, has made a series of representations to the Union commerce ministry, regulator Tea Board and the West Bengal government seeking a blanket ban on tea import from Nepal. Citing Clause 22 of the Tea Distribution Export Control Order, 2005, the DTA has urged government authorities to stop sales and distribution of imported tea in loose format “without proper labelling and clear marking”. With “traceability and pesticide compliance questionable in Nepal”, the full price realization of Darjeeling tea also gets affected by this ‘bought-leaf’ production from Nepal, adds Kanoria. Around 67,000 people are involved with the Hills tea sector directly and four lakh indirectly. “Unless import of Nepal tea is banned, the livelihood of those dependent on the Darjeeling variety may reach a point of no return, with more Hills tea gardens shutting shop,” says Sandeep Mukherjee, the principal adviser to DTA. Some experts also feel that a fall in overall Darjeeling tea quality and quantity and lack of generic portion over the years have given Brand Nepal or ‘Himalayan Tea’ a wider acceptance with its price advantage. Prabhat Kamal Bezboruah, the chairman of Tea Board, thinks that Darjeeling tea has its own problems too. “A part of the crisis is due to vicious undercutting of prices among producer-exporters, who want to squeeze the middleman out. Also, the GI requirement of Darjeeling tea percentage in the blend has made some packers turn to Nepal teas,” he adds. The “Darjeeling” name and logo have also been registered as certification trade marks in the name of Tea Board of India. Experts corroborate the Tea Board chairman’s view by saying that Nepalese brew isn’t the only culprit. “Domestic retailers particularly in eastern India who are passing off greenish broken and fannings from not just Nepal but also Kangra and south India as Darjeeling to naive buyers should also be blamed. Due to this, demand and prices for smaller grades have become unsustainable,” adds Kanoria. It is ironic that the very Darjeeling tea industry players, especially traders, who clamoured for GI protection, are arguably big buyers of Nepal teas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/battle-of-the-kettle/articleshow/86330752.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Kolkata||Power companies must pay dues, 10% interest: Calcutta high court||KOLKATA: A Calcutta high court division bench on Friday upheld a single-bench order on payment of dearness allowance to employees of state-run power utilities. West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd (WBSEDCL) and West Bengal State Electricity Transmission Co Ltd (WBSETCL) were told to pay DA in accordance with the central rate between 2016 and 2019, with an additional 10% interest on the dues. The payout will amount to a few hundred crores. The engineers’ associations of both companies had moved the HC in 2016 after they stopped getting DA as per the central rate, as was agreed to by the two companies in the 2009 Revision of Pay & Allowance Agreement. An interim order in 2019 directed the companies to adhere to the central rate. WBSEDCL and WBSETCL challenged this before a division bench and were turned down; the matter was sent back for a final order to the single bench. The final order ruled that the companies were required to meet their ROPA commitments and pay DA at the central rate. This was challenged again by WBSEDCL and WBSETCL. The division bench of Justices Soumen Sen and Saugata Bhattacharyya ruled in favour of the single-bench order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-power-utilities-must-pay-da-dues-with-10-interest-hc/articleshow/86330611.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Mohammed Mujahid, Mohammed Ikbal and Asif, in their late 30s, were in possession of 120 sim cards and over 150 Aadhaar cards. They have supplied more than 5,000 cards to fraudsters in Rajasthan and surrounding areas in the last two years, sources said. After questioning the arrested accused, the CID submitted a report to the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).  “We've carried out a detailed data analysis and established links of the arrested persons in 3,951 cases across India. The accused are members of the core gang. We have to visit Rajasthan and other places to secure other members, who are involved in the sextortion racket,” a senior CID officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/trio-linked-to-3-9k-cybercrime-cases-lands-in-cid-custody/articleshow/86328613.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal goes past 5 crore jab milestone, last 1 crore shots given in just 18 days||KOLKATA: Bengal on Saturday went past the five-crore jab mark, the last crore coming in record 18 days. More than 12.33 lakh shots were administered during the day and data was still being uploaded till late night. The highest single-day achievement for the state is 12.9 lakh doses on August 31. “We have reached another milestone by crossing 5 crore vaccinations and ensuring at least one dose to 50% of the state’s eligible population,” said director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. With 48 lakh doses of vials in the state’s kitty on Saturday morning, health officials activated 4,859 vaccination sites, setting a target of about 15 lakh doses for the day. “By 2pm, we had crossed the 5-crore mark. This time, we gave 1 crore doses in record 18 days. The last crore took 29 days,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. The Centre had announced a quota of around 1.33 crore doses for Bengal for the month of September. So far 80 lakh plus jabs have already arrived. More than 40 lakh Covishield doses arrived this week alone, making this the biggest single consignment of vaccine to reach the state so far. Starting Thursday, three consignments of a total 21,25,816 doses reached the state over three consecutive days. Health officials said the better supply in terms of regularity and quantity have facilitated raising the vaccination bar. In fact, 40 lakh jabs had been administered on the first eight days of this month.. “We need steady and adequate supply to set higher vaccination goals. We will keep ramping up the inoculation pace as and when we have a comfortable stock to jack up the drive,” said a senior health official. In August, Bengal was to get 95 lakh doses but received a little over 1 crore by month-end. This month, too, health officials believe it could get more than the initial estimate of 1.3 crore doses. Of the 4,859 vaccination sites that were pressed into action on Saturday 4532 were government vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-goes-past-5cr-jab-milestone-last-1cr-shots-given-in-just-18-days/articleshow/86331865.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rana Kapoor’s wife, daughters sent to custody||MUMBAI: A special CBI court on Saturday rejected the bail pleas of jailed Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor’s wife, Bindu, and daughters Roshini Kapoor and Delhi-based Radha Kapoor Khanna in a corruption and cheating case involving DHFL and sent them to Byculla prison till September 23. The three were present in court. Roshini broke down after the court’s order. “Considering the gravity and nature of the offence, and in the larger interest of society, as the accused are involved in causing wrongful loss to the huge public money of Rs 4,000 crore, the applications deserve to be rejected,” special judge S U Wadgaonkar said, adding no grounds exist to release the accused. ‘Women complicit... don’t deserve sympathy’The court said they are remanded in custody till September 23 and will be taken to Byculla women’s prison. This is their first arrest. Radha’s defence urged the court not to reject the bail, submitting that she had two small children with the younger one being only 10 months old. “…the accused involved in grave offence affecting the economy of the country and continue to reap the benefits of the crime committed by them, do not deserve any indulgence and any sympathy to them being women or mother of small kids...” the court said. A money laundering case is also pending against the women in the special PMLA court. The defence is going to move Bombay high court against the order. Last month, the court took cognisance of the chargesheet against Bindu, and Radha and others and issued summons. Roshini Kapoor was named in the first chargesheet in the case. She was granted bail by the magistrate court when the matter was pending there. The CBI said that new charges were added against her. Rana Kapoor has been in jail since his arrest in March 2020. DHFL promoters, Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, are also in custody. CBI, in its probe, said Rana Kapoor received Rs 600 crore kickbacks from Kapil through his daughters’ company DOIT Urban Ventures. The Rs 600 crore was in lieu of Rs 3,700 crore loan (debenture investment) Yes Bank, then headed by Kapoor, gave to DHFL group. DHFL had defaulted on repayment. The women are directors in DOIT. The court said that accusations prima facie show the complicity of the women with other co-accused, particularly Rana Kapoor, in the conspiracy, adding that they fraudulently received the illegal amount pretending to be a corporate loan of Rs 1,200 crore. It said that the actual beneficiary are the Kapoors. “They availed this amount by allowing wrongful loss to M/s Yes Bank Ltd, which is of around Rs 4,000 crore. Lakhs of depositors, who deposited the amount in Yes Bank Ltd, shareholders of Yes Bank Ltd as well as M/s DHFL have been duped and the banking credibility of the nation has received serious setback,” the court said. Opposing the bail pleas of the women, special public prosecutor Ashok Bagoria submitted that they could influence witnesses, many of whom are the bank’s staff. The CBI in its replies to bail pleas, submitted that time and again in various judgments courts have termed economic offences as of ‘very serious nature’ which ruin the economy of the country. “In the light of these judgments, the applicant doesn’t deserve any leniency and her application for bail is liable to be dismissed,” the CBI had said. The probe agency apprehended the accused may abscond. In July, the court said that a prima facie offence under Prevention of Corruption Act was made out against Rana Kapoor. The matter will be heard on Monday when the court is likely to pronounce orders on bail pleas of other accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rana-kapoors-wife-daughters-sent-to-custody/articleshow/86333859.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu anti-national, dangerous, unstable, incompetent & security threat to Punjab & nation: Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Dubbing Navjot Sidhu as “anti-national, dangerous, unstable, incompetent and a security threat” to the state and the country, Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday said he will fight any move to make the Punjab Congress president the chief minister of Punjab “tooth and nail”. Making it clear that he had no intention of quitting politics, Amarinder said there was no question of supporting Sidhu, who was clearly mixed up with Pakistan and a danger, as well as a disaster, for Punjab and the country. “I cannot allow such a man to destroy us, I will continue to fight the issues that are bad for his state and its people,” said the outgoing chief minister, lashing out at Sidhu for his close alliance with the leadership across the border. “We have all seen Sidhu hugging Imran Khan and General Bajwa, and singing praises for the Pakistan PM at the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, while our soldiers were being killed at the borders every day,” he said, pointing out that the ex-cricketer had attended Imran’s swearing-in even after he (Capt Amarinder) categorically told him not to. “The government of Punjab means the security of India, and if Sidhu is made the face of the Congress for chief ministership, I will fight him at every step,” he added. In a series of media interviews, Captain Amarinder, who has been asked by the governor to continue as the CM till alternative arrangements were made, said Sidhu could never be a good leader for Punjab. “How can a man who could not handle a ministry, handle the state?” he said, adding that there was no question of backing an incompetent man whom he had removed from his cabinet. As local government minister, Sidhu failed to clear files for seven months, he claimed. Amarinder ruled out leaving politics and said that as an Army man, he has a lot of will and will remain active in the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab. “I am not hanging my boots,” he declared, reiterating that he will decide on his future course of action after talking to people close to him, including MLAs of the Congress, which Sidhu had divided just months ahead of the polls. He revealed that he had himself asked MLAs who were supporting him to attend the CLP meet, and the presence of the large number of legislators at the meeting did not mean they were supporting Sidhu. Rejecting claims by the Congress leadership that he had lost the confidence of the MLAs, Amarinder termed it a lame excuse. “Just a week ago, I had sent to Sonia Gandhi a list of 63 MLAs who were supporting me,” he said, adding that MLAs usually respond to what they think Delhi wants, which was the case at the CLP meeting too. In any case, it is not possible to make all MLAs happy, he added. Pointing to the sweeping wins by the Congress under his leadership since 2017, Amarinder said he failed to understand the decision by the party to replace him. “The people of Punjab were clearly happy with my government,” he said, adding that till 3-4 months ago, the tide was completely in favour of the Congress in Punjab but “they have cut their nose to spite their face, and ended up from a winning to a losing position”. Expressing pain and shock at the way he was humiliated into quitting, Amarinder said, “Even today, I was not informed about the CLP meeting even though I was the leader. The way everyone was called in the night and informed about the meeting, it was clear they wanted to remove me as CM,” he added. He said he felt sad and humiliated that his contribution to the state was not recognised, and he had been misread despite having done the best for it, including on the sacrilege and drugs issues. Amarinder said even after the leadership change in Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, he had not expected to be humiliated in this manner “perhaps because of my association with Sonia Gandhi and her children”. He definitely felt let down, he said, adding that he failed to understand the party’s objective in letting him go after his success in governing the state for 9 and a half years. “Punjab has been doing so well in every sphere. I do not understand why the party felt the need to make a change,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-anti-national-dangerous-unstable-incompetent-security-threat-to-punjab-nation-amarinder/articleshow/86331968.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||How ‘Sikh factor’ worked for and against ex-Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh||JALANDHAR: It was due to his resignation from Lok Sabha against Operation Blue Star that Captain Amarinder Singh retained his appeal among Sikhs not just in Punjab but in other parts of the country as well as in diaspora even as he joined the Congress 14 years later in 1998. It was Bargari sacrilege and subsequent police firing cases which pulled down Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP and worked favourably for Amarinder to become chief minister for second time in 2017. Ironically, it was the same case which precipitated the crisis for him. It was Amarinder’s acceptance among Sikhs that helped the Congress revive itself in Punjab in 1999. For three consecutive elections, the 1996 and 1998 parliamentary polls and the 1997 assembly election, the party had received a drubbing as it had almost become untouchable for Sikhs. Similarly, the sacrilege and police firing cases became biggest issues before the 2017 polls, along with drugs and illegal mining, and led to the Akali Dal losing considerable support base among its core panthic vote base. SAD got relegated to third position in Punjab in the last assembly elections. Analysis showed that 40 of the 77 assembly constituencies the Congress won were rural and had a predominantly Sikh population. The traditional “panthic belt” in Majha region stood out, with highest success rate for the Congress. In fact, after the formation of the government, these cases actually never left the limelight. Amarinder set up Justice Ranjit Singh Commission to probe the cases and latter gave a thorough report. It was discussed in a special session of the Punjab Assembly. This again worked for the Congress and added to negative perception of SAD, but at the same time it further raised expectations from Amarinder government to deliver justice. While close to a year was lost as CBI refused to have over the Bargari sacrilege probe back to Punjab, even as the state assembly passed a resolution to this effect in August 2018 and later also issued a notification, there was progress in Behbal Kalan police firing and a little progress in other sacrilege cases. Several ministers and MLAs have been flagging the issue that they were facing questions on these cases. The CM also faced criticism from the community for some of his adverse remarks about Kartarpur corridor, which incidentally pushed Navjot Singh Sihdu up in their perception. Finally, it was the Punjab and Haryana high court’s order in April 2021 to quash investigation in Koptkapura firing case which precipitated the crisis for him. Not only Sidhu, a few ministers and MLAs also questioned the CM on the issue. Some claims by then IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh, who later joined AAP and is now set to contest assembly election, gravitated the crisis. Even as he went on record to say that he was told by chief minister’s office that he should go by merit, he blamed the state government for a lot of other issues. Though a SIT was later constituted which also started working quickly and extensively but the political crisis kept brewing. The government’s performance on other issues just added to the trouble for the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/how-sikh-factor-worked-for-and-against-amarinder/articleshow/86331989.cms||IP Singh

The Punjab chief minister may be out for now due to compulsion but he can’t be written off, since he still has his cards close to his chest. He became a Congress MP in 1980 and joined the negotiations to sort out the Punjab issue before Operation Bluestar happened and he resigned from both Parliament and the party in 1984 despite being a personal friend of the Gandhis. Following Operation Blue Star in 1984, Amarinder had resigned both as an MP and party memberThis gave him a place in history that, later, helped him dominate the Punjab Congress affairs for more than two decades. Whoever remained Punjab Congress president, Amarinder remained tallest in the party’s state unit. He switched to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and became a minister in Surjit Singh Barnala’s government in September 1985. Seven months later, he quit that cabinet in protest when police entered Darbar Sahib on Barnala’s orders. By this, he endeared himself to the Sikhs. After the Akalis denied him ticket in the 1997 elections, he moved back to the Congress in 1998. Sonia Gandhi made him the state chief of the party and he led it to a sterling performance in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls. Public dissatisfaction was working against the Parkash Singh Badal government but Amarinder had the hard task of bridging the gap between the Congress and the Sikhs. In 2002, he led the party to victory and sent Badal and his son, Sukhbir Singh Badal, to jail in corruption cases in which they were, later, exonerated. Another high point of his political career was the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act in 2004, for which he called a special session of the assembly. It nullified all the agreements with other states and the centre on the sharing of river waters. It had interstate consequences. In the early 1980s, Congress CM Darbara Singh had withdrawn a petition from the Supreme Court on river waters’ issue. Capt became a "saviour of Punjab waters" in the party’s eyes, even as the SAD also claimed to have championed the cause. In a previous tenure, he survived an open rebellion by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. The Punjab Congress lost the 2007 and 2012 assembly elections, both times under his command, but his charisma was not lost. On Sonia Gandhi’s prodding, he contested the parliamentary election from Amritsar in 2014 as outsider in the game and defeated BJP giant Arun Jaitley, which pushed Amarinder’s national appeal and helped him not only wrest the Punjab Congress presidentship from Partap Singh Bajwa but also win the state by a huge mandate of 77 seats. He exhibited great manoeuvrability in this tenure but his fading charisma due to the questions about performance forced the high command to take note of a revolt and take the final step for his removal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/resignations-defined-capts-political-career/articleshow/86332025.cms||IP Singh

Bloggers said the intensity and frequency of rain may increase after September 20 and many parts of the state, including coastal areas like Chennai and neighbouring districts, are likely to receive good spells. For the next 48 hours, the IMD has forecast thunderstorms with light rain over some areas in the city and the neighbourhood, while the sky condition is likely to be partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 36°C and 26°C. While a few places in south Tamil Nadu and delta districts are expected to receive thunderstorm with rain of varying intensity between September 19 and 21, the IMD has forecast thunderstorms with heavy rain over northern Tamil Nadu districts like Tiruvannnamalai, Vellore, Ranipet and Tiruvallur on September 22. “This is due to the weak westerlies which will allow the entry of easterlies that may lead to wind convergence and convective spells,” a meteorologist said. Since June 1, Nungambakkam has recorded 503.4mm of rain and Meenambakkam 436.9mm, which are 118.1mm and 13.5mm in excess. Chennai subdivision has recorded 431mm so far in the June-September season against a normal 397.4mm, an 8% excess. Blogger Pradeep John said there is a possibility of rain in the city and neighbouring districts as well as interior districts during the last 10 days of September due to favourable wind conditions. “In Chennai, day temperatures may be around 34°C or 35°C but the relative humidity may be high. There are chances of rain almost daily in the evening or late nights if convergence shifts from interior parts of the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-may-get-intense-rain-starting-next-week-say-meteorologists/articleshow/86333992.cms||---
---||World||Hong Kong's first 'patriots-only' election kicks off||HONG KONG: Fewer than 5,000 Hong Kong people from mostly pro-establishment circles vote on Sunday for candidates vetted as loyal to Beijing, who will pick the city's next China-backed leader. Pro-democracy candidates are almost absent from Hong Kong's first election since Beijing overhauled the city's electoral system to ensure that "only patriots" rule China's freest city. Police have ramped up security across the city, with local media reporting 6,000 officers are expected to be deployed to ensure a smooth vote, in which about 4,900 people are expected to cast ballots. Changes to the political system are the latest in a string of moves - including a national security law that punishes anything Beijing deems as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces - that have placed the international financial hub on an authoritarian path. Most prominent democratic activists and politicians are now in jail or have fled abroad. China's rubber-stamp parliament in May changed Hong Kong's electoral system, reducing democratic representation in institutions and introducing the vetting mechanism for election candidates and winners. This all but removed any influence the opposition was able to exert. The changes also dramatically reduced the influence of the city's powerful tycoons, although groups close to their business interests retain a presence in the 1,500-strong committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive. China promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing. Democracy campaigners and Western countries say the political overhaul moves the city in the opposite direction, leaving the democratic opposition with the most limited space it has had since Britain handed its former colony back to China in 1997. Tycoons out, sons remainCommittee membership for 117 community-level district councillors, dominated by democrats, was scrapped, while more than 500 seats designated for Chinese business, political and grassroots groups were added. The new electoral list includes community-level organisations such as Modern Mummy Group and Chinese Arts Papercutting Association, Cable TV reported. Representation from professional subsectors that traditionally had a bigger pro-democracy presence, including legal, education, social welfare, medical and health services, was diluted by the addition of ex-officio members, reducing the number of elected seats. Twenty-three of the 36 subsectors that are open for contest, totalling about 600 seats, will not see any competition. About 70% of the nominees did not feature in the last two polls for the committee, which will expand by 300 members to 1,500, Reuters calculations based on the election committee website showed. Many prominent tycoons, including Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing, will not be on the election committee for the first time, as Beijing seeks to rebalance power from big conglomerates to small businesses. Three property moguls - Li, 93, of CK Asset Holdings, Lee Shau-kee, also 93, of Henderson Land and Henry Cheng, 74, of New World Development, withdrew from the race, although their sons will retain their seats. The election committee will select 40 seats in the revamped Legislative Council in December, and choose a chief executive in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/hong-kongs-first-patriots-only-election-kicks-off/articleshow/86333981.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Resignation is acceptance of Congress failure in Punjab: SAD||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal said on Saturday that Capt Amarinder Singh’s resignation was a self-admission on the part of the Congress as well as its high command that the party had failed to perform in the state and had nothing to show for more than fourand-a-half years of governance. Declaring that this was a testimony to what the SAD had been saying all along, Sukhbir said Amarinder had been punished by nature for lying with Gutka Sahib in hand and that every member of the Congress would suffer the same fate. The SAD president said a mere change of guard would not save the Congress’s sinking ship in Punjab. The entire state cabinet as well as Congress MLAs were steeped in corruption and were running various kinds of mafias, including sand, liquor and drugs, alleged Sukhbir. The devious ploy of the Congress high command to avert a backlash against the party by putting the blame on one person alone would not succeed, he added. “Punjabis know that the entire Congress party in Punjab is known for open loot and lawlessness. Its ministers and MLAs patronized gangsters. Its ministers looted the state exchequer of thousands of crores. It failed to undertake any development or infrastructure projects in the state,” the SAD president said. “First of all Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were the force behind the election manifesto of the Congress for the 2017 assembly elections. The Gandhi family not only kept Amarinder in power, but also failed to move against any of his corrupt ministers. It also failed to prevail upon Amarinder to fulfill the promises made to the people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/resignation-is-acceptance-of-congress-failure-in-punjab-sad/articleshow/86333901.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Amarinder Singh’s successor likely to be named today||CHANDIGARH: After chief minister Amarinder Singh resigned on Saturday following a quick turn of events, names for the top post are already doing the rounds with former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar, present incumbent Navjot Singh Sidhu and Amarinder's detractor Sukhjinder Randhawa being touted as front runners. A formal announcement about the new CLP leader is expected to be made on Sunday after a goahead from the Congress chieft. With the sharadh period starting from Monday, the Congress leaders want the new name to be announced on Sunday itself. If Jakhar is chosen, it will be for the first time in the history of the state after the reorganization of Punjab that a Hindu leader gets the top job. Besides, PPCC president Navjot Sidhu could settle for his own name. Sources said that his name cropped up at the late evening discussions by a group of MLAs after the CLP meeting. Observers tried to build consensus over new CM nameThe Sidhu camp went into a huddle after the CLP meeting and a meeting was held at a Chandigarh hotel late evening to discuss the new team. Earlier, there had also been buzz about Rajya Sabha MP Pratap Singh Bajwa and outgoing cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa as probables. Sources said that even though the AICC panel of observers did not take up the matter during the CLP meeting, the matter did come up in subsequent deliberations with senior leadership of the party. Sources said that the observers tried to build a consensus among the senior party leaders over the new chief minister. By late evening, Navjot Sidhu’s own name was being considered as a strong possibility for the top post, apart from Sunil Jakhar and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Rajya Sabha member Ambika Soni too is seen as a possible choice even though she reportedly had opted out of the race initially. “While Jakhar is considered close to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka, many MLAs feel that it was Randhawa who led the charge against Amarinder and should be considered for the top post,” said a party MLA. Problems for Amarinder mounted when various factions within the state’s ruling Congress party joined hands with a secret meeting May 7 to put more pressure on him to “act in the sacrilege case.” Apart from Sidhu, Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi had attended the meeting held in Panchkula. This followed a series of meetings, where other ministers including Tript Bajwa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria joined in. Another CLP meeting todaySources said that the Congress MLAs will meet again on Sunday to endorse the appointment of the new CLP leader at 11 am. Meeting at Rahul house Late at night, Rahul Gandhi held an important meeting of Congress leaders on Punjab at his residence which was attended by AICC gen secy in-charge organisation KC Venugopal and Ambika Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-hectic-lobbying-on-as-clp-leader-likely-to-be-announced-today/articleshow/86333938.cms||---

More than 4 lakh jabs were given in Bengaluru (BBMP limits) and over 2.5 lakh in Belagavi, according to the data shared by the Union health and family welfare ministry. This is a big confidence booster for Belagavi, which struggled to increase coverage during the initial days because of vaccine supply woes. Ballari district, which has seen the highest number of online medical consultations in the state under a central scheme, is in the 10th position in the vaccination drive. It administered more than 1.5 lakh jabs. The numbers are up to date till 7.45am on Saturday; the data is still being updated as there was huge traffic on Friday. The other districts/ regions that performed well are East Champaran, Surat Corporation, West Godavari, Mumbai, Muzaffarpur, Sri Potti Sriramulu Nellore and Ahmedabad Corporation. Belagavi deputy commissioner MG Hiremath told STOI that the district had set a target of achieving 3 lakh doses. “Although, we could not reach the goal, we stood second in the country on Friday, a remarkable achievement,” he said. He stressed that this would not have been possible without the coordinated efforts of health, revenue, rural development and other local departments. District immunisation officer IP Gadad said that vaccinations were very close to 3 lakh on Friday. The actual number of doses is 2.9 lakh, which was not updated. He said the district administration roped in every registered medical practitioner to expedite the process. The DC started conducting rounds at 7am and remained in the field till 7pm . Ballari district health officer Jagadish HL said that jabs were given at 938 centres. In rural areas, staff members were sent in a day early to ensure the drive began on time. He said that the final data was still being uploaded and the numbers were above 2 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-belagavi-top-districts-in-vaccination-drive-on-pm-narendra-modis-birthday/articleshow/86334030.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Nagpur||Some schools reopen in Chanda city without permission||CHANDRAPUR: Even as government is yet to take decision regarding reopening schools in urban areas, a bunch of schools in Chandrapur city have started the physical classes. Sources claimed that recovery of pending fees, pressure from parents and competition from schools functioning in rural areas compelled those in the city to restart the classes. There are at least half a dozen big private schools in gram panchayat areas on the city’s outskirts. They have started classes for Std VIII to Std XII from July 15 as per the state government guidelines for reopening schools in rural areas. The decision about schools in urban areas has been kept lingering. Collector Ajay Gulhane said that he has not received any orders or directives from the government for reopening schools in urban areas. “So, no order was passed to reopen schools in Chandrapur city,” he said. Education officer (middle school), Ulhas Narad agreed that some schools in Chandrapur city have reopened but made it clear that his department has not issued permission for it. The school education department had issued a GR allowing schools in urban areas (municipal corporation and municipal council areas) to reopen on August 10. The GR was put on hold after a week and education minister Varsha Gaikwad had issued a statement that final decision will be taken after taking views of stakeholders. “When the GR was withheld, no directives or circulars regarding postponement of reopening schools in urban areas were issued. It is likely that some schools have presumed that government has not cancelled the GR,” said Narad but maintained that reopening schools in urban areas is illegal and action would be taken if complaint is received. Educationists termed it blatant violation of pandemic law. They claimed that though government has not cancelled the GR, it is clearly mentioned that the collector is empowered to take decision. When collector has not issued any such orders, reopening schools in Chandrapur city is illegal, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-schools-reopen-in-chanda-city-without-permission/articleshow/86327923.cms||---

Neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh had a moderate rise in these cases. The environmental offences in Punjab and Haryana account for 0.2% of the crime each for every 1 lakh population, while in Himachal Pradesh, the figure is 2.7% opposed to 4.6% in the country, which has increased from 2.6% in 2019. The National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) released the data on Wednesday. Punjab recorded five environmental offences in 2015 and 4 in 2016, which climbed to 35 each in 2017 and 2018, declined a bit to 29 in 2019, and then more than doubled to 72 in 2020. Haryana had 20 of these cases in 2015, 44 in 2016, 42 in 2017, 37 in 2018, 53 in 2019, and 57 in 2020, while Himachal Pradesh recorded 113 cases in 2015, 178 in 2016, 196 in 2017, 270 in 2018, 188 in 2019 and198 in 2020. Out of its 72 environmental offences cases in 2020, Punjab recorded 4 under the Forest Conservation Act,10 under the Wildlife Protection Act, 19 under the Environmental Protection Act, 24 under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003, and 15 under the Noise Pollution Act. Out of Haryana’s 57 cases of environmental offences, 2 related to forests, 17 to wildlife, 5 to environmental protection, 5 to air and water pollution, 13 to Tobacco Act violation, and 15 to noise pollution. Out of Himachal Pradesh’s198 cases,169 were about forests, 21 about wildlife, and 9 about noise. Punjab arrested 110 offenders in these cases in 2020 and charge-sheeted 98 of them. Haryana arrested 64 and charge-sheeted 59, while Himachal arrested 253 and charge-sheeted 338, adding many from the previous year. Punjab recorded no offence for air and water pollution, as the state pollution control board reported these matters to the courts directly. Thousands of farmers burn their crop and almost all the water bodies of the state are contaminated, yet the NCRB recorded no case under the air and water laws. Even Himachal Pradesh recorded none of these cases, while Haryana registered five. In none of these states was any case recorded under the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010. Confronted, Punjab Pollution Control Board member secretary Karunesh Garg told TOI: "We report air and water pollution not to police but straight to the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMIC). Since the NCRB collects its crime data from police, it has no record of air and water pollution, whereas we have filed 200 cases of stubble burning between April 2020 and this August 31. Earlier 350 cases of water pollution were pending and now the figure is 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/green-crimes-up-in-punjab-but-no-foul-air-case-in-land-of-field-fires/articleshow/86334070.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Ghaziabad||Gzb saw 57% dip in crimes against women in pandemic year||Ghaziabad: While there was an overall dip in the crime rate in the district last year, partly owing to the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown, cases of crime against women in Ghaziabad plummeted sharply — by 57% — between 2019 and 2020. According to the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the number of such cases registered under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special and Local Law (SLL) had come down to 341 last year against 793 cases recorded the previous year. During the same period, the national capital registered a nearly 20% dip in cases – 10,093 cases of crime as against women were registered in Delhi last year while around 13,340 such cases were recorded in 2019. Ghaziabad’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Pawan Kumar said the “significant” decrease in crime against women could be attributed to better policing by officials and the Covid restrictions even as some activists questioned if the “decline” was real. “Pandemic-induced restrictions definitely had a role to play in bringing down cases of crime against women but the resolve of the state government and zero-tolerance policy in such cases had a cascading effect. And this cannot be undermined, Covid or no Covid,” the SSP told TOI. He added nothing could change overnight. “Sensitising the police force against crime against women that started say 10 years ago, is now showing results,” Kumar said. As per the NCRB data, released on September 15, among the total 341 cases of crime against women in 2020, cruelty by husband or his relatives formed a major chunk at 104, while cases of kidnapping or abduction of women to compel her for marriage numbered 65 and dowry deaths 11. While there was a sharp decline, more than 65%, in assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (68 cases in 2020 compared to 197 in 2019), it remained the second-highest of the total cases of crime against women registered last year in the district. Twenty rape cases were also recorded last year when 59 such cases were registered in 2019. In 2020, child rape cases (up to 18 years), registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, declined by 62% -- 53 cases reported in 2019 and 20 last year. A total of 63 girls, meanwhile, fell victims to kidnapping and abduction with intent to compel her for marriage and 42 others were reported to be sexually assaulted in 2020 compared to 101 and 55 cases, respectively, registered in 2019. According to Uttar Pradesh State Women’s Commission chairperson Vimla Batham the state government had come up with measures like anti-Romeo squads, Pink police station, and women’s health desk, which had the desired effect in controlling crime against women in the district. Mala Bhandari, the founder of Noida-based NGO Social and Development Research & Action Group (SADRAG), which advocates women rights, however, disagreed. “The pandemic saw entire machinery collapsing one after another and yet we are led to believe that during Covid-19 that is in 2020, the redressal system for crime against women was working fine. This is something which I am not ready to accept and that is crimes against women were under-reported in 2020, which has resulted in NCRB data showing a decline in cases,” Bhandari said, adding that the data compiled by NCRB was an “official” data. “Street crime against women had decreased during Covid restrictions due to obvious reasons but this is equally true that crime against women within the confines of home, for instance, cruelty by husband or his relatives, must have definitely increased,” she added. Ghaziabad has a total population of 23.5 lakh, of which 11.1 lakh of them women, the NCRB data states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gzb-saw-57-dip-in-crimes-against-women-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/86331656.cms||Abhijay Jha

He told the officer trainees that there was no greater job satisfaction than serving the poorest, and that whoever performed a constitutional duty must be mindful of this responsibility. "Empathy will take us to our national goals," he said. He said the government’s processes were being digitalised for reducing the distance between the state and the citizens. "Direct benefit transfer that get money to the poorest citizen in the remotest corner at the push of a computer button. From the audit perspective, this is a small challenge and a huge opportunity," the President said. He thanked the advanced data analytics tools for a more focused and efficient audit that raised systemic red flags much quicker than before. He said audit engagements were a unique opportunity for understanding the system and these helped the CAG suggest improvements. He said while overseeing records, the CAG needed to be aware of these opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/prez-covid-relief-owed-to-future-generations/articleshow/86331545.cms||---

Titled Regularisation of Unauthorised Hindu Temples Bill, 2021, it will come up for discussion on September 23. Ramadas said he will make an appeal to Congress members, including Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar, and JD(S) members HD Kumaraswamy and HD Revanna to support the bill and save temples. “The absence of a law to regularise Hindu temples has resulted in demolition of a few. In other states, temples are protected from demolition through a separate law/ rule,” he said. Ramadas added: “The bill allows shifting of those temples which can’t be regularised or cause grave inconvenience to the public. A competent authority is proposed to regularise temples at taluk level. I will withdraw the bill if the government decides to come out with a new Act.” We will rebuild razed temple: Arun SinghBJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka BJP Arun Singh said the party has plans of rebuilding the temple that was recently demolished at Hucchagani village in Nanjangud taluk. Speaking to reporters in Davanagere on the sidelines of the BJP’s state executive meeting, Singh said the party believes in building and preserving temples, not demolishing them. “We will rebuild the temple on the same spot,” he said. He chided Congress for criticising BJP government over the demolition. Calling opposition leader Siddaramaiah anti-Hindu, Singh said: “I wonder since when has he started talking about temples. He always talked about mosques.” BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said the government is looking into the documents of the land on which the temple stood and, if possible, it will be rebuilt on the same location. The matter also came up for discussion in the BJP core committee meeting and it was decided to make efforts to protect temples earmarked for demolition in a legal way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/bjp-mla-sa-ramadas-moves-private-members-bill-to-regularise-temples-in-karnataka/articleshow/86334101.cms||---

"We will get around 20 crore doses of Covishield and 3.5 crore doses of Covaxin. Production is increasing and gradually it will rise even more as new vaccines are likely to be approved in coming months," the source said. The improved supplies of jabs assume significance as availability of vaccines remains crucial for expansion of coverage. Buoyed by a substantial increase in daily inoculation numbers, India's total vaccination numbers crossed the 80-crore milestone on Saturday with the latest 10 crore doses administered in just 11 days. On Saturday (till 9:45pm), 84 lakh doses were given. Increased supplies and intense efforts by the Centre and several state governments have led to a significant rise in the pace of vaccination in the recent weeks. While the government is targeting to cover more than 80% of the adult population above 18 years with at least the first dose by October, it will need consistent supplies to achieve the goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/september-vaccine-stock-23-5cr-up-4-5cr-from-august/articleshow/86334133.cms||Sushmi Dey

On September 15, data released by the NCRB stated that the districted had recorded 341 cases of crime against women last year and chargesheets were filed by the police in as many as 248 cases. The chargesheet rate, the data stated, stood at 73.40% in 2020. This, the data indicated, was a mere one percentage point less than 2019 when 793 such cases were registered of which chargesheets were filed in 706. “The numbers do not give the true picture. The police are known for their reluctance to lodge cases in cases of crime against women, a chunk of which were already unreported due to the Covid restrictions,” Mala Bhandari, the founder of Noida-based NGO Social and Development Research & Action Group (SADRAG), said. Activists also pointed out that with more people staying at home there was a spurt in domestic violence cases. As per the NCRB data, 104 cases of cruelty by the husband and his relatives and 11 dowry deaths in the district last year. The police efficiency in relative terms increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 as per the NCRB report. Out of the total 341 cases reported in 2020, charges under crime under the crime against women head chargesheet were filed by police in 248 cases. Ghaziabad SSP Pawan Kumar, however, said the good work by his predecessors had led to the relative improvement in the disposal of cases by the local police. “Last year, Covid-19 had led to a decrease in overall crime rate in Ghaziabad. But the whatever cases that were registered in 2020, the NCRB data goes on to prove the efficiency with which police worked in dealing with cases under crime against women,” the SSP said. As per the NCRB data, the pendency rate in cases of crime against women had improved to 0.80% in 2020 against 3.20% in 2019. In 2019, there a total of 31 pending cases, which came down to just three in 2020. The police also arrested 244 people in such cases.

Now, more than 2,500 vachanas, edited by slain rationalist-scholar MM Kalburgi, have been translated into Arabic by scholars from Kashmir University and Jamia Millia Islamia. The Bengaluru-based Basava Samithi has published ‘Vachan’ under its multilingual translation project launched in 2008 under the editorship of Kalburgi. “Arabic is the first foreign language in which we are releasing this book comprising 2,500 vachanas authored by 173 Sharanas of the 12th century,” said Aravind Jatti, president of Basava Samithi. Samiti plans to translate Vachana into 80 languagesKalburgi, the scholar of Vachana literature, was shot dead outside his residence in Dharwad in August 2015 allegedly over his progressive views. “The book, ‘Vachana’, has been published in 23 Indian languages and will soon be published in Persian, Angika, Dogri, Bajjika, Mandarin, French and Spanish. Kannada Vachana is the first in the history of Kannada literature to be translated in 31 languages. The Samiti hopes to translate it in 80 languages in the next five years.” M Zaman Azurdah, retired professor of Kashmir University in Srinagar, who coordinated the Arabic translation of Vachanas, said: “Imagine, Lord Buddha left the throne and served the cause of justice, human rights and the rights of weaker sections. Immediately after that, we have vachanas composed, recited and propagated by men and women. Think of Basavana, the finance minister of his time, when the aristocratic attitude of those empowered, would violate all the natural and righteous responsibilities...he approached human beings in a very humane way,” said Azurdah. “Perhaps till then the rest of the world was less concerned with human behaviour when our saints in the form of vachanas pleaded for the rights of children, women and weaker sections. We are fortunate that late professor Kalburgi collected these,” he said. Professor Shad Hussain of Kashmir University, editor of the translation, said he was first introduced to Lingayat philosophy by Azurdah. His team, including scholars of Jamia Millia Islamia university of Delhi, translated the discourses. “The vachanas are already available in English and Urdu. Shivasharanas from different walks of life have imparted the nectar of wisdom employing symbols of their respective professions. Many of the higher values of morality depicted in this profound Lingayat literature are attuned to the teachings of Islam,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/12th-century-kannada-vachanas-translated-into-arabic/articleshow/86334158.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Lucknow||Aryan-Dravidian dispute is baseless, all Indians have same DNA, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||GORAKHPUR: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the Aryan-Dravidian controversy is baseless as Aryans were not outsiders and all the citizens of the country have the same DNA. Terming the period when Aryans were called invaders as a “dark phase”, the CM said, “Cunning Britishers made us read history written by leftist historians. According to these historians, Aryans came from outside which is not true. In the Ramayan, ‘Mata Sita’ addresses ‘Prabhu Ram’ as ‘Aryaputra’ (son of Arya). In our religious books, Arya means supreme while anaryais used for vicious and unprincipled people.” “When we read that we are outsiders, how can we have the feeling of ‘ Maata bhumi putroham prithvya’ (The nation is my mother and I am her child). It was a conspiracy and the country has been facing its consequences for long,” Yogi said, addressing the inaugural function of the week-long tribute programme to mark the 52nd death anniversary of Mahant Digvijaynath and 7th death anniversary of Mahant Avaidyanath. “A new theory has found that the DNA of all of us is the same and the country is one,” he added. Yogi said PM Modi gave the mantra of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ and ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and added that the 500-year-old dispute in Ayodhya was resolved under the PM’s leadership. No power can bully India any longer, says CM YogiMany are unhappy that the Ayodhya dispute has ended as they have lost their source of earning,” he added. Criticizing previous governments, the chief minister said no power could bully India any longer. “Earlier, when China used to encroach our borders, we used to stay silent but our leader gave a befitting reply to China in Doklam.” “There would hardly be any Indian who is not aware of our sacred scriptures and books like the Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat. People have been listening to religious stories and getting inspiration,” the chief minister added. Paying tribute to Mahant Digvijaynath and Mahant Avaidyanath, Yogi said they dedicated their lives for the welfare of people, nation and religion. “Although Gorakshpeeth is the seat of Shaiva tradition, it played a vital role in the constriction of Ram temple (of Vaishnav tradition). They didn’t limit the ‘peeth’ for only religion but also for public welfare,” he said. Prof Harsh Sinha of DDU Gorakhpur University said Prime Minister Modi had been appreciating the BJP leadership in Uttar Pradesh and the chief minister had made many impossible things possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aryan-dravidian-dispute-is-baseless-all-indians-have-same-dna-says-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/86334182.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Man held for killing paramour, her 3 kids||LUCKNOW: A man and two of his aides were arrested on Saturday for the murder of a woman and her three children whose bodies were recovered in sugarcane fields with their throats slit in Fakharpur area of Bahraich on September 11. The arrested men were identified as Nanku and his aides, Salman Khan and Danish Khan, all residents of Fakharpur. Nanku is the main culprit in the case while Salman and Danish helped him in executing the crime for money. Cops recovered three mobile phones, the woman’s phone and a knife. The 35-year-old victim was a resident of Thane in Maharashtra. The state government has announced Rs 1 lakh cash prize to the team which worked out the case within a week. Superintendent of police, Bahraich, Sujata Singh, who led the probe, said Nanku of Bahraich worked at a small eatery in Thane. “Nanku came in touch with a woman, a divorcee, who also used to work in the eatery with her three children (aged 4, 7 and 11 years),” said Singh. She said Nanku, who was already married, lied to the woman that he was single and befriended her. “The woman, who wanted to marry Nanku to support her children, fell into his trap,” the SP said. Cops recovered bodies of 2 kids on September 11The woman asked Nanku to run his own business in Thane. When Nanku said he had no money, she sold her small house to help him,” the SP said. After getting money, Nanku thought of getting rid of the woman and her children. “Nanku asked her to accompany him to his house in Bahraich when she insisted for marriage. They reached Lucknow via train on September 9 and then to Bahraich by road. Nanku called his aides who helped him execute the crime. They dumped the bodies at two different places to mislead the police,” the officer said. Police had first recovered the bodies of two children on September 11 and then of a woman and a child on September 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-man-held-for-killing-paramour-her-3-kids/articleshow/86334215.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Babul Supriyo joins Trinamool, says decision made in ‘last 3 days’||KOLKATA: Babul Supriyo, a former Union minister of state in the Narendra Modi government, joined the Trinamool Congress on Saturday. The move, capping a few days of speculation in political circles and the media in Bengal, ended the two-time Asansol MP’s tumultuous relationship with the BJP since being dropped from the ministry in July. Babul, whose first response to his former party’s decision to drop him from the ministry was to quit politics altogether, said on Saturday that he did not know “a huge opportunity to serve the people of Bengal” would come his way so soon. “That is what I did with full conviction and whole-heartedly for the past seven years. That is what I want to do now. This decision was made in the last three days,” Babul told reporters immediately after being welcomed into the Trinamool fold by party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee at his Camac Street office. Babul, who spoke to Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee over phone, said he would meet her on Monday. “I will play by the rulebook. I will play it ethically. I will, as advised by Derek, do whatever needs to be done over the next two days,” Babul said, confirming he would resign from the Lok Sabha. Trinamool leader Arpita Ghosh quit from the Rajya Sabha earlier this week, which coincided with the “three-day” time-frame Babul gave during Saturday’s media interaction. Babul, however, did not say whether he had been promised the Rajya Sabha seat vacated by Ghosh. Babul’s decision is part of a broader trend of BJP leaders joining Trinamool in Bengal after its landslide win in the assembly polls earlier this year. Veteran politician and Krishnanagar MLA Mukul Roy started the process and was followed by Bagda MLA Biswajit Das, Bishnupur MLA Tanmay Ghosh and Kaliaganj MLA Soumen Roy. Abhishek and Trinamool seniors have claimed that “at least 25 BJP MLAs have queued up to join the Trinamool”. The former junior union minister’s induction into the Trinamool came days after the BJP named him as a star campaigner for its Bhowanipore by-poll candidate, Priyanka Tibrewal; Babul, however, was conspicuously absent from campaign events. The Trinamool announced the decision first on its social media handles around 3 p.m. “Former union minister and sitting MP Babul Supriyo joined the Trinamool family today in the presence of national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien. We take this opportunity to extend a very warm welcome to him!” the statement read. The party then put out four photographs of Abhishek inducting him into the party with a Trinamool uttariya (scarf) and later released a 24-second video of Babul, Abhishek and O’Brien. The hashtags Babul Supriyo and BJP MP soon started trending on social media. “I am a workaholic. I did not want to lose such an opportunity to work for the people of Bengal,” Babul said. “I know I will be subject to intense criticism, there will be social media trends against me. But I know what is trending in my mind now. I want to work for Bengal with the same conviction and passion as I have done for the last seven years,” he added. “People who wish me well have all told me I should not quit politics. But I was disillusioned. You know the brief of a junior minister. Shashi Tharoor had summed it up very aptly once,” he said, adding that he had consulted his family and friends and they all supported his move. “I have shifted base to Bengal completely. Everything is here now, even my pet dogs and birds. My family is here. So, when an opportunity came to keep working for Bengal, I wanted to make the best of it,” Babul said. Babul, asked whether he would now campaign for the Bengal CM in the Bhowanipore by-poll, said: “Mamata Banerjee does not need anyone to campaign for her. I will do as directed by the party.” The Asansol MP shares a cordial personal relationship with the Bengal CM. He had famously hopped into her car to take a ride to Raj Bhavan during a 2015 visit to Kolkata by PM Narendra Modi and shared “jhal-muri” with her. A stung Bengal BJP reacted sharply. Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said, “Irrespective of our personal relationship with Babul, it is a fact that whatever he does is only for a few days. He worked in a bank for a short while. He was in Mumbai for a short while. He was in the BJP for a short while. Who knows whether he is going to the Trinamool for a short while? The party is bigger than individuals. The BJP will contest and retain Asansol.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-joins-trinamool-says-decision-made-in-last-3-days/articleshow/86331925.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Shots of a different kind at Barwani bar in vax push||BARWANI: Customers at a bar in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani had a real taste of the ‘slip between the cup and lip’ when Covid vaccine jabs got between them and their drink on Friday evening. The makeshift sit-down bar, known as ‘ahata’, on Anjad Road had begun taking the first orders of the evening when a team of nurses and other health workers marched in, carrying boxes of vaccines. Most of the customers had just popped their liquor bottles and readied their glasses when the jab team, led by SDM Ghanshyam Dhangar, arrived. The health team was moving in the district as part of a door-to-door drive, and the crowd had caught their eye. They went around asking the customers, “Vaccine liye hain?” Some were yet to get even their first shot, others were due for their second. “We matched their mobile numbers, Aadhar cards and immediately generated slots for vaccination. Around 12 of them were vaccinated on the spot,” said SDM Dhangar. ‘No evidence that alcohol is harmful in vaccination’  The jabbed dozen could not take even the first sip of the liquor they had bought. There were many who had taken alcohol but not taken the vaccine, but the team refrained from vaccinating them. Vaccines were administered to those who bought liquor but were yet to start drinking it,” said Dhangar, adding they were advised to refrain from consuming alcohol in the night. However, chief medical and health officer Dr Anita Singare said there is no evidence to indicate alcohol is harmful when vaccinated. The purpose of a vaccine is to boost immunity by producing antibodies, she said. People in the adjacent liquor shop bar met similar fate. “It was easy to convince those who were due for their second dose. Hesitancy was seen for the first dose,” the SDM said. In Barwani, about 65,000 people have been vaccinated in the last two days. It was among the districts with less than 70% first-dose coverage last week, and the vaccination drive has been stepped up since then. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shots-of-a-different-kind-at-barwani-bar-in-vax-push/articleshow/86332604.cms||Animesh Jain

Making it clear that he had no intention of quitting politics, Amarinder said there was no question of supporting Sidhu, who was clearly mixed up with Pakistan and a danger, as well as a disaster, for Punjab and the country. "I can't allow such a man to destroy us, I will continue to fight the issues that are bad for this state and its people," said the outgoing CM. "We have all seen Sidhu hugging Imran Khan and General Bajwa, and singing praises for the Pakistan PM at the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor, while our soldiers were being killed at the borders every day," he said, pointing out that the ex-cricketer had attended Imran's swearing-in even after he (Capt Amarinder) categorically told him not to. "The government of Punjab means the security of India, and if Sidhu is made the face of Congress for chief ministership, I will fight him at every step," he added. In a series of media interviews, Captain Amarinder, who has been asked by the governor to continue as the CM till alternative arrangements were made, said Sidhu could never be a good leader for Punjab. "How can a man who could not handle a ministry, handle the state?" he said, adding that there was no question of backing an incompetent man whom he had removed from his cabinet. As local government minister, Sidhu failed to clear files for seven months, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-unstable-dangerous-anti-national-amarinder/articleshow/86334243.cms||---

Neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh had a moderate rise in these cases. The environmental offences in Punjab and Haryana account for 0.2% of the crime each for every 1 lakh population, while in Himachal Pradesh, the figure is 2.7% opposed to 4.6% in the country, which has increased from 2.6% in 2019. The National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) released the data on Wednesday. Punjab recorded five environmental offences in 2015 and 4 in 2016, which climbed to 35 each in 2017 and 2018, declined a bit to 29 in 2019, and then more than doubled to 72 in 2020. Haryana had 20 of these cases in 2015, 44 in 2016, 42 in 2017, 37 in 2018, 53 in 2019, and 57 in 2020, while Himachal Pradesh recorded 113 cases in 2015, 178 in 2016, 196 in 2017, 270 in 2018, 188 in 2019 and 198 in 2020. Out of its 72 environmental offences cases in 2020, Punjab recorded 4 under the Forest Conservation Act, 10 under the Wildlife Protection Act, 19 under the Environmental Protection Act, 24 under the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003, and 15 under the Noise Pollution Act. Out of Haryana’s 57 cases of environmental offences, 2 related to forests, 17 to wildlife, 5 to environmental protection, 5 to air and water pollution, 13 to tobacco Act violation, and 15 to noise pollution. Out of Himachal Pradesh’s 198 cases, 169 were about forests, 21 about wildlife, and 9 about noise. Punjab arrested 110 offenders in these cases in 2020 and charge-sheeted 98 of them. Haryana arrested 64 and charge-sheeted 59, while Himachal arrested 253 and charge-sheeted 338, adding many from the previous year. Punjab recorded no offence for air and water pollution, as the state pollution control board reported these matters to the courts directly. Thousands of farmers burn their crop and almost all the water bodies of the state are contaminated, yet the NCRB recorded no case under the air and water laws. Even Himachal Pradesh recorded none of these cases, while Haryana registered five. In none of these states was any case recorded under the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010. Confronted, Punjab Pollution Control Board member secretary Karunesh Garg told TOI: "We report air and water pollution not to police but straight to the court of judicial magistrate first class (JMIC). Since the NCRB collects its crime data from police, it has no record of air and water pollution, whereas we have filed 200 cases of stubble burning between April 2020 and this August 31. Earlier 350 cases of water pollution were pending and now the figure is 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pbs-green-crimes-up-no-foul-air-case-in-land-of-field-fires/articleshow/86330929.cms||Neel Kamal

---||World||France accuses Australia, US of 'lying' in 'serious crisis'||PARIS: France on Saturday accused Australia and the United States of lying in a crisis over a security pact that saw Canberra scrap a contract to buy French submarines in favour of American vessels. "There has been lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt," French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France 2 television. "This will not do." A "serious crisis" was now in progress between the allies, he added. Le Drian was speaking a day after Paris, on the orders of President Emmanuel Macron, recalled its ambassadors to Canberra and Washington, an unprecedented act that revealed the extent of the anger in France over the rupture of the contract. He described the withdrawal of the ambassadors as a "very symbolic" act which aimed "to show how unhappy we are and that there is a serious crisis between us and to re-evaluate our positions to defend our interests." "The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries," he said. He also issued a stinging response to a question over why France had not recalled its ambassador to Britain, when London was also part of the security pact that led to the rupture of the contract. "We have recalled our ambassadors to (Canberra and Washington) to re-evaluate the situation. With Britain there is no need. We know their constant opportunism. So there is no need to bring our ambassador back to explain," he said. Of London's role in the pact, he added: "Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel." NATO would have to take account of what has happened as it reconsiders strategy at a summit in Madrid next year, he added. France would make a priority now of developing a EU security strategy when it takes on the bloc's presidency at the start of 2022, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/france-accuses-australia-us-of-lying-in-serious-crisis/articleshow/86334300.cms||---

Several areas of Kolkata received showers that led to waterlogging even as the Met office predicted more consistent, ‘moderate’ rain in the city on Sunday. While Kolkata received 20 mm rain till 5.30 pm on Saturday, Dum Dum recorded 12 mm and Salt Lake 52mm. The city is set to receive around 50 mm-60 mm rain between Saturday and Sunday, said the Met office. While a cyclonic circulation over northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal has been triggering rain since Friday, another has formed over south Bangladesh on Saturday that has been generating rain-bearing clouds which floated into Gangetic Bengal on Saturday. While the former extends between 1.5 km to 5.8 km above sea-level, the latter exists at a height of 900 metres. The circulation over the Bay, however, is titling towards Odisha and is likely to move towards the coast of the neighbouring state on Saturday evening. The circulation in Bangladesh, though, will continue to provide clouds that may cause rain in Gangetic Bengal. “We expect light to moderate rain in Kolkata and its neighbouring districts on Sunday. But they may include one heavy spell either late on Saturday or early Sunday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. Some city areas on Saturday witnessed sporadic rains which led to waterlogging in some parts. Going by rainfall as recorded by the KMC drainage pumping stations, some north Kolkata areas such as Ultadanga, Beliaghata, Belgachhia, Thanthania received more rainfall than south Kolkata areas like Jodhpur Park, Kalighat, Mominpore, Behala or Tollygunge. Water receded from most parts of north Kolkata except a few pockets by afternoon. Waterlogging was negligible in most south Kolkata. Some areas of Salt Lake and New Town were under water following the heavy rains that splashed the city for about an hour, but the water receded from most of the places within a few hours as rains stopped. Both the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) and the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities operated all its pumps to flush out the excess water as quickly as possible. While parts of Kolkata, Howrah, Hoogly, East Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas received heavy downpour on Saturday, another heavy rain alert has been issued for all south Bengal districts on Sunday. A weather bulletin issued by the RMC on Saturday said the possible impact of the rain could be a rise in water level of rivers, waterlogging in low-lying areas and damage to crops. Lightning deathA Class-XI student died after being struck by lightning while flying kite on the roof of his apartment at Belur. The boy was identified as Jit Hazra (16), a resident of Lalababu Sayar Road. Jit along with his cousin brothers Suman and Riddhi had gone to the roof to fly kite on the occasion of Vishwakarma Puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/twin-cyclonic-circulations-trigger-rain-in-kolkata/articleshow/86334341.cms||Suman Chakraborti

A four-member team of researchers from the department of pharmacology, Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Amritsar, examined data of 1,054 healthcare workers given shots of Covishield to assess the safety and to assess the risk assessment in the general population. After immunisation, each health worker was given a card for correct reporting and the participants were asked to report any AE on a specially created WhatsApp group. They were also encouraged to report solicited and unsolicited AE’s to the pharmacovigilance cell of the hospital within a week from vaccination. A higher rate of AEs was observed in males with 664 complaining of side effects, while 390 females informed the pharmacovigilance cell about facing minor AEs. The analysis of the data revealed that a total of 1,122 adverse drug events were reported by the participants of which 1,091 (97.3%) were solicited and 31 (2.7%) were unsolicited with the most common being pain at the injection site (53.3%), followed by temperature less than 100.5°F, malaise (15%), injection site swelling (3.8%), headache (4.4%), myalgia (2.1%), chills (1.3%), rigors (1%) and nausea (1%). Non-significant events such as arthralgia, influenza-like illness and vomiting were reported by less than 1% of the participants. The mean duration of pain and mild fever was two days while the duration of myalgia and arthralgia was three days. Malaise, injection site swelling, headache, chills, rigors, nausea, influenza-like illness, and vomiting were noted for one day. Among the 31 unsolicited AEs, the most common effects were moderate to high-grade fever in 54% of cases, decreased appetite for two days in 22% of unsolicited cases and 16.1% dizziness for two days. None of the participants complained about any serious life-threatening adverse reactions. The team of experts —Rahat Kumar, Jaswinder Singh, Narinder Singh and Vikram Bhandari, observed that the results of the study were encouraging and can help to tackle the vaccination ‘psychological fear’, thus improving vaccination coverage. In ‘A Study of Covid-19 Vaccine (COVISHIELD) Pharmacovigilance in Primary Healthcare Workers in Punjab’, it was observed that the incidence of solicited and unsolicited AEs was low, thus, establishing safety of Covishield vaccine. “Mass vaccination with Covishield is recommended for the prevention of severe infection with high mortality due to Covid-19 infection.” The findings of the study have been published in AMEI’s Current Trends in Diagnosis and Treatment (CTDT), the official journal of Academy of Medical Evaluators and Interpreters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/healthcare-workers-vaccination-asr-study-encouraging/articleshow/86331286.cms||Vinod Kumar

Experts said that the state will be in the plateau phase for a long time till everyone is vaccinated and infected too. Between June 26 and July 24, the average new cases per day in a week plateaued between 11,000 and 15,000. Then from July 25 to August 21, it was plateaued between 18,000 and 20,000 cases. And now again, it has touched a plateau of 24,000 to 25,000 cases. Since August 14, the average TPR continues to be above 15%. “Plateau is what we want in Covid control, or otherwise it will overwhelm the system. This shows that people have learnt Covid appropriate behaviour, and it helps reduce the rate of transmission. Till your mortality rates are low and hospitals not overburdened, you have to grin and bear it,” said one of India’s leading epidemiologists Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil. But how long will this high plateau phase last in the state? “With natural infection, reinfection will be low, but with vaccination, you may have breakthrough infections. People need to get a high level of immunity,” added Dr Muliyil. “Till we get herd immunity — with infection and vaccination both — we will continue to be in a plateau phase,” said Dr A Sukumaran, former state epidemiologist. Kochi based Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, who conducted a study amongst Covid-19 infected person to see if one develops hybrid immunity once vaccinated and had Covid-19 and how this hybrid immunity compares with vaccine immunity or natural immunity, said that until and unless people achieve hybrid immunity, a high number of Covid cases will continue to be reported from the state when compared with others. “Several states in India have achieved hybrid immunity,” Dr Shenoy added. “Covid cases in Kerala will slowly come down to a baseline that stays in a low plateau phase - which will continue in pockets with periodic flares for a long time. There are so many susceptible people even now who can get infected,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, vice-chairman, research cell, IMA Kerala. In other states and countries, after a peak there has been a decline to near-zero, but not in Kerala. Few experts said that Kerala’s situation can be changed if a one-week quarantine for all primary contacts is strictly enforced. “It is difficult to say why Kerala’s pandemic curve has always been different. There are multiple interlinked factors related to the host and environment that determine the course. I am inclined to believe Kerala's statistics more because of its robust surveillance, testing and reporting, with the highest case detection rate in the country,” added Dr Jayadevan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-19-kerala-in-plateau-phase-for-third-time-in-second-wave/articleshow/86334359.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: ‘Smart system’ to let you book parking slot through mobile app||GURUGRAM: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is working on a plan to set up a ‘sensor-based parking management and guidance system’ to ease parking woes in the city. The authority is currently looking for spots where such a plan can be adopted, GMDA officials said on Saturday. According to the officials, the system would be adopted on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis, along the lines of the one already implemented in Lucknow and in the pipeline for Bareilly. GMDA is also exploring the possibility of setting up electric vehicle charging stations. “This is a concept of smart parking using sensors, wherein the entire parking system will be connected to GMDA’s integrated command and control centre. Payment can be made by the customer through either credit cards or FASTags. People can reserve parki-ng slots using the ‘My Gurugram’ mobile application,” a senior official from GMDA told TOI. “We are also exploring the possibility of including electric vehicle charging stations. As of now, we are still discussing this plan and hope to adopt it soon. We believe smart parking is one way of resolving the issue of haphazard parking in the city,” said the official. Although GMDA was initially considering adopting the system at three locations — Udyog Vihar, Sadar Bazaar, and near Rajiv Chowk, some of the busiest places in the city — it was found upon further examination that parking in these areas was “not feasible”, said officials. This is because parking management is already being undertaken by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation at Udyog Vihar, and by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon in Sadar Bazar. Meanwhile, the land available near Rajiv Chowk does not belong to GMDA, officials said. Lack of designated parking spaces in Gurgaon has been a constant issue for commuters and residents for several years.  In the absence of sufficient demarcated parking spots, people tend to park their vehicles on main roads or the roadsides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/smart-system-to-let-you-book-parking-slot-through-mobile-app/articleshow/86331536.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Around 1.45am, a police patrol spotted some suspicious activity at the ATM kiosk. Sensing the presence of police nearby, the six men fired one round at the approaching cops and tried to speed away. However, the bullet missed its target. Police said they had chased the car till Kaliawas, where it hit a divider on the road. “As the car came to a halt, the robbers got off and escaped in the dark,” a police official said. Cops are checking the footage of all the nearby CCTV cameras to identify the robbers. “For now, we don’t have any clue about who the men were, but we are checking all the nearby CCTV cameras. We are hopeful of nabbing them soon,” said a police official at Rajendra Park police station. There’s no clarity on the amount of money stolen from the ATM as the bank has not submitted a complaint to the police. An FIR has been filed at the Rajendra Park police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/chased-by-cops-but-atm-robbers-escape-with-cash/articleshow/86331561.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Gurgaon||MCG panel pushes for 67% hike in park upkeep rates||Gurgaon: The committee constituted by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) to fix the rate for maintenance of parks in the city has recommended a hike of nearly 67% from the existing Rs 3 per square metres (sqm) to Rs 5 sqm. While RWAs have been saying the existing rate is sufficient for maintenance, the committee said that the cost has been revised in accordance with the deputy commissioner’s (DC) rates to be given to a gardener. The committee, which comprises MCG officials and some councillors, was constituted in the last House meeting held on July 31. In the meeting, councillors had said a gardener in Gurgaon charges at least Rs 20,000 monthly. According to the report submitted by the panel to MCG, if a gardener is employed as per the DC rates, the park maintenance rate should be Rs 5 per sqm. Of this amount, Rs 4 will be spent on the salary of gardeners and Rs 1 on gardening tools. The report will be tabled in the next House meeting. “The hike has been proposed in accordance with labour laws. In Rs 5 per sqm, the EPF and ESI components in the salary of a gardener, besides gardening tools, can be covered. Maintenance of parks has suffered because efficient gardeners aren’t affordable at the existing rates,” said Subhash Yadav, nodal officer of MCG’s environment and sustainability wing. According to the report, Gurgaon has a total of 875 parks, out of which 831 parks are maintained by the RWAs and ward committees. These parks have a total area of 24,61,980 sqm. While most councillors are in favour of the hike, RWAs have opposed the decision. “We submitted a memorandum to the MCG commissioner recently, in which we had requested that upkeep of parks should be retained by RWAs. Moreover, another point that we made was that Rs 3 sqm is sufficient to maintain parks. Councillors want a hike in rates because a councillor is the head of the committee maintaining parks, and corruption is the only motive. Hike in rates would mean wastage of public money,” said Udaybir Yadav, president of Sector 10A RWA. “We have been maintaining our parks very well. We don’t see any necessity for increasing the rate,” said Puneet Pahwa, general secretary of Sector 45 RWA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-panel-pushes-for-67-hike-in-park-upkeep-rates/articleshow/86329702.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The MCM has sanctioned Rs 75 lakh for the construction of a 7-metre-wide, 1km-long RMC road. The officials hope to complete the project before Diwali as it was the first project after the formation of a new municipal body. “The full-fledged construction work will be started in the coming days. The deadline has been set at the end of four months but we will try to complete it before that,” said Vijay Dhaka, superintending engineer, MCM. In the absence of a 24m internal sector road, the residents have had a tough time commuting on the road riddled with potholes. They have been raising the issue with the authorities concerned, local MLA and even hold street protests numerous times. Amit Shekhar, vice-president of LRWA said, “We did everything we could to highlight the issue at every platform through various means. We had also spent from our pockets to repair the road to make it motorable, but that was a temporary measure.” Shibashish Rudra, a resident, said: “This is the only road that connects our society to the rest of the city. Now, there is a sigh of relief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/for-vipul-lavanya-residents-a-5-year-wait-for-link-road-to-end/articleshow/86329731.cms||Akanksha Gupta
