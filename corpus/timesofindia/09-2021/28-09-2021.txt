---||Mumbai||Withholding freedom fighter's pension for so long not justified: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Withholding of freedom fighter's pension, that too for such a long period--since his death in 1965—is not justified, said Bombay high court while hearing a petition filed by a 90-year-old widow of Laxman Chavan who took part in the 1942 Quit India Movement. The HC asked the state government pleader Purnima Kantharia to obtain instructions from the concerned department and apprise it by September 30. Shalini Chavan, through her counsel J M Pathade, said her late husband had even undergone imprisonment in Byculla Jail from April 17, 1944 to October 11, 1944, for six month for participating in the Quit India Movement. She approached the HC for its intervention. The HC in its order on Friday noted, “though the State of Maharashtra has framed a pension scheme for freedom fighters called Swatantrata Sainik Sanman Pension Scheme, 1980, benefit of the said scheme has not been extended to the petitioner.’’ Her lawyers Pathade and Shrikant Raokar said she has not benefited under the scheme because “old records in the Byculla District Prison containing details of late Laxman Ramchandra Chavan's imprisonment may have been destroyed.’’ The HC bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Madhav Jamdar said, “Be that as it may, from the available materials on record, there does not appear to be any dispute as to the status of late Laxman Ramchandra Chavan as a freedom fighter’’ and that of the petitioner being his widow. The HC will hear the matter next on September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/withholding-freedom-fighters-pension-for-so-long-not-justified-bombay-hc/articleshow/86566095.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 3 years on, agency awaits SC nod to restore mining-ravaged districts||BENGALURU: Karnataka Mining Environment Restoration Company (KMERC) has been waiting for nearly three years to execute an action plan to restore greenery and carry out development work in the mining-ravaged districts of Ballari, Tumakuru and Chitradurga as it’s yet to get nod from the Supreme Court. Following an SC directive to set up a company under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956, with an initial corpus of Rs 3,500 crore, the government in 2014 had set up KMERC to take up work under the Comprehensive Environment Plan for Mining Impact Zone. It now has a corpus fund of over Rs 18,000 crore (Rs 11,000 crore principal and Rs 7,000 crore interest) which was accrued by auction of ‘C’ category mines and fines collected from miners. KMERC was touted to be the nodal agency to restore the damage caused to the environment and develop the districts that suffered due to illegal mining. It had prepared a 10-year action plan to reclaim the lost environment and improve quality of life in these districts. The SC had appointed senior advocate Shyam Divan as amicus curiae to oversee the action plan drawn up by the government. The company even got the amicus curiae’s consent to file its action plan before the court in October 2018. However, since then, with the Covid-19 pandemic also creating an unfavourable situation, approval for the plan has been delayed. “We have filed three mentioning applications and had even roped in the Solicitor General to mention the case to the CJI four times in the past three years but to no avail,” said KMERC MD Prabha Chandra Ray. The government has incurred a wasteful expenditure of over Rs 3.2 crore in three years purely to rent an office and pay salaries to the skeletal staff, apart from deputing IFS officer Ray to the post. Realising there is no work amid the delay, the KMERC MD requested for a transfer back to his parent department (forest) and took on the additional responsibility of additional PCCF (forest resource management) and even tried to move to a smaller office. KMERC has been paying Rs 6 lakh as office rent since 2019 and spending another Rs 2-3 lakh on salaries per month. “While there was little work for me as a full-time MD, I took the option of coming back to my parent department and decided to move to a smaller office earlier this year. However, the cooperation department which owned the building requested me to stay back and told us they will reduce the rent by 50%,” said Ray, who is now preparing detailed project reports (DPR) for KMERC schemes in anticipation of the SC approval any time. As on date, KMERC is waiting for CJI NV Ramana to look into constituting a special bench to hear the case and approve the action plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-years-on-agency-awaits-sc-nod-to-restore-mining-ravaged-dists/articleshow/86566501.cms||Sandeep Moudgal
---||Guwahati||Assam: Congress says not opposing eviction drive||GUWAHATI: All hopes of getting political support to reclaim their hearth died down on Monday, when the Assam Congress made it clear they are not opposing the ongoing eviction drive in Dholpur in Darrang district, which has rendered thousands of encroachers homeless. The Bengali-speaking Muslim migrants in Dholpur had been supporting the Congress for decades and they got several schools as well as health facilities during the Congress tenure. But the Congress, too, abandoned them, saying all they were demanding is that their rights be safeguarded. "The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) wants to make it clear that we are not opposing the ongoing eviction drive. The party has never objected to eviction drives, but it should be done in consonance with the Supreme Court guidelines. Human rights must not be violated," said Assam PCC spokesperson, Partha Pratim Bora, at a news conference at the party state headquarters at Rajiv Bhavan in Guwahati. “Women and children had to spend nights in tarpaulin tents when a storm lashed the area. The government cannot compel people to die,” said Bora. He went on to say that ‘muktahatya’ (open killings) in the name of eviction should stop. "What was the need to kill a villager who came out with a piece of stick before a huge armed police force?” asked Bora, accusing the government of trying to give a religious colour to the incident. The Congress leader alleged the incident is a devious ploy to polarise people on religious lines for the upcoming by-elections where a swing in non-Muslim votes can help the BJP win. "Congress leaders came to Darrang to oppose muktahatya, not to favour any community," he said, adding that the party has opposed the killings in Dholpur, protested against CAA and opposed the killing of the Assam Police personnel along the Mizoram border. While questions are being raised about the nationality of those killed in Dholpur, Bora said it is the duty of his party to raise its voice against the killing of any human being. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has promised 6 bighas of land to the evicted landless. "If they were illegal Bangladeshis, why should 6 bighas of land be given to them? The government must clarify whether it wants to evict Bangladeshis from Assam or wants to rehabilitate them," said Bora. The Congress mocked at the enquiry announced by the state government to probe the Dholpur incident without shunting out of the DC and SP, who were leading the charge. The families in Dholpur were once witness to the bloody clashes during the anti-foreigners’ movement (1979-85) and now they are themselves facing the bullets. There’s actually no one they can turn to now, because the Congress has decided to look the other way and so has the AIUDF. Adequate compensation to the evicted is the feeble cry of the AIUDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-congress-says-not-opposing-eviction-drive/articleshow/86566393.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: BJP brass ensures Yediyurappa’s state tour is collective venture||BENGALURU: After successfully ensuring the smooth exit of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, the BJP brass has so far done a fine balancing act to keep the party veteran quiet. The party has consulted him on important issues and converted his solo statewide yatra into a party event. Soon after quitting as CM, Yediyurappa, 78, announced he’d embark on a solo state tour to strengthen the party for the 2023 assembly polls.  BJP leaders were apprehensive the tour would jeopardise the transition to the new team and give rise to a parallel power centre. They were concerned it would cast a shadow on successor Basavaraj Bommai. The party brass has addressed these concerns by announcing that four teams involving senior functionaries will join his yatra. While BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel said he’ll follow Yediyurappa on his tour, Basavaraj Bommai said he’ll lead one of the teams. This sent a strong message to the veteran that he must follow the party’s plans. “The schedule is being finalised under the supervision of Yediyurappa and Kateel and once we get dates from the CM,” said a senior party functionary. Bommai has taken pains to give Yediyurappa due respect. Party officials said they have no intention to sideline Yediyurappa. “He’ll be our star campaigner for the 2023 assembly polls and 2024 Lok Sabha polls. The party wants to capitalise on Yediyurappa’s organisational talents and tremendous mass appeal. But it doesn’t want a situation where he imposes terms on the party and outshines Bommai,” they added Some MLAs close to Yediyurappa clarified that the former CM doesn’t nurse any personal ambitions but only wants to ensure the political future of his younger son BY Vijayendra. Yediyurappa’s controversial statements are a clear message to the leadership not to discount him, yet. At the first BJP state executive meeting recently, Yediyurappa said the party can’t win elections in the state using Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name alone. But during the monsoon assembly session, he praised Modi’s leadership, countering the Congress attack over inflation. Bommai said there’s no objection to the former CM travelling across the state and he and BJP would support him in strengthening the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjp-brass-ensures-yediyurappas-state-tour-is-collective-venture/articleshow/86566531.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Bengaluru||When insurer tries to avoid liability, it has to show probable evidence: Karnataka high court||BENGALURU: When an insurer attempts to avoid liability, it has to establish the ground on which it is doing so with precision and probable evidence, the high court observed while rejecting an appeal filed by Oriental Insurance Company Limited. The insurer had challenged the August 8, 2012 award passed by the Commissioner For Workmen Compensation, Raichur, directing it to settle Rs 4,07,784 compensation along with 12% interest to the legal heirs of farm labourer Mounesh, who had died after falling from a tractor-trailer of his employer on February 11, 2010. The insurer contested the award, citing that in the statement given to police, claimant Amaresh and another witness had stated Mounesh was sitting on a harvesting machine loaded on to the tractor-trailer and died when it fell on him. The insurer argued that the said risk was not covered and hence the company is not liable to pay the compensation. However, the owner of the tractor-trailer claimed it was nobody’s case that Mounesh was sitting on the harvesting machine and the insurer had just attempted to take advantage of their statement. After going through the rival submissions and available records, Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy noted the insurer did not utter a word about Mounesh sitting on the harvesting machine in its statement of objections before the Commissioner For Workmen Compensation. “In the present case, except taking advantage of the statement made by prosecution witnesses, who are not eyewitnesses to the accident, the insurer has done nothing more. Therefore, the claim of the claimants cannot be rejected as the vehicle in question was covered by a policy of insurance. Since there is a statutory liability on the insurer’s part to cover the employees travelling in the tractor-trailer, the Commissioner was right in holding that the insurer was liable to pay the compensation determined by it,” the judge further observed while turning down the insurer’s appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/when-insurer-tries-to-avoid-liability-it-has-to-show-probable-evidence-hc/articleshow/86566546.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Teachers team up to paint govt schools in Koppal||KOPPAL: The debate for opening schools amid fears of a potential third wave of Covid is on but a group of teachers in Koppal is losing no time in prepping for a bright start. Ten of them have been painting government lower primary schools on the last Sunday of every month, with the motto: ‘Shaale Nimmadu Seve Nammadu’ (school is yours, service is ours). “As the government school has nourished us as students and is now taking care of us as teachers, this is our bit for schools. Our initiative is aimed at attracting students to lower primary school, which is left without students for more than a year due to the pandemic,” said Suresh Kambali, a cluster resource person in the education department. Under the banner ‘Kalarava Shikshakara Seva Balaga’, the teachers have been visiting schools every month, spending from their pocket to buy paint, and turning painters as well. Beerappa Andagi, Kashinath Sirigeri, Sharanappa Radder and other team members say the Balaga is a collective effort and there are no posts. “We take two cars and go to the school on the morning of the last Sunday. We have painted two lower primacy schools in the past two months and have notified 20 schools in Koppal taluk,” said Other members of the group are Chandrashekhar Helavar, Hanumantappa Kuri, Hulugappa Bhajantri, Annappa Halli, Mallappa Gudadannavar and R Guruswami. They say the paint costs Rs 30,000-40,000 per school. Koppal ZP CEO B Fouzia Taranum said, “The initiative touched my heart; some physically challenged teachers are also part of the campaign.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/teachers-team-up-to-paint-govt-schools-in-koppal/articleshow/86566551.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Bengaluru||BBMP & BWSSB not on same page, 2,500km roads suffer||BENGALURU: Thanks to lack of coordination between civic agencies, when a road is relaid, it’s dug up within no time. For instance, soon after BBMP finishes road works, BWSSB digs them up. After chief minister Basavaraj Bommai expressed concern over the deplorable condition of roads despite spending Rs 20,000 crore over the past five years, the two civic agencies are busy in a blame-game. BBMP officials said the biggest challenges have been restoring 2,500 kilometres of road in outlying areas damaged by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board and the inordinate delay in completing road works within the central business district under Smart City project. BWSSB officials claimed there is a consistent misrepresentation of facts by the Palike. “In 2018, when the government finally decided to provide underground drainage and drinking water to 110 villages added to BBMP jurisdiction, BWSSB was asked to do it. It was decided that the board will lay pipelines and BBMP the roads. Now, we’re being blamed for the bad roads,” said BWSSB chairman N Jayaram. He said BWSSB paid Rs 86 crore to BBMP for levelling roads even though that’s not its responsibility.  “Subsequently, in early 2021, Rs 1,000 crore more was allocated to the Palike to repair roads damaged during laying of pipelines,” he added. As per data provided by the CM in the legislative council last week, the government has allocated only Rs 485 crore for fiscal 2021-22. Bengaluru Smart City project managing director Rajendra P Cholan said the Special Purpose Vehicle has upgraded 22 of 32 roads and that too, only for 29 kilometres. “As it’s within the CBD, we’re getting brickbats. Asphalting is pending on 10 roads due to rain. We’ll do it by this year-end,” he added. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the Palike is taking up road infrastructure projects sanctioned in the last fiscal and completing them. Both the Palike and BWSSB said there is a coordination committee chaired by the chief secretary, but most issues of lack of coordination appear to be misrepresented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-bwssb-not-on-same-page-2500km-roads-suffer/articleshow/86566565.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

It will be inaugurated in a couple of weeks. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who inspected various civil works in Rajajinagar assembly constituency on Monday, instructed his officials to quickly complete the pending minor works on the flyover. Work on constructing a flyover at Manjunath Nagar, an underpass at Shivanagar Junction and another flyover at Basaveshwaranagar Junction, all three along West of Chord Road, began in 2016. While Manjunath Nagar flyover was completed and opened to traffic, the project at Shivanagar Junction was upgraded from an underpass to a flyover. Basaveshwaranagar Junction flyover is also under construction. Chief commissioner Gupta said, “The Shivanagar flyover will be ready in a couple of weeks. The ramp area is yet to be asphalted. Along with this, beautification works such as streetlighting and planting saplings on the median and under the flyover are pending.” Officials have been instructed to complete the construction work on Basaveshwaranagar Junction flyover swiftly and open it for traffic. The playground near Rajajinagar Parents School is being developed at a cost of Rs 2 crore. Gupta also inspected the stretch from Havanur Circle to Shankar Mutt Circle in Basaveshwaranagar and instructed officials to asphalt the road. In addition to this, 40% of work on building a multi-purpose structure on Rajajinagar 9th Main Road had been completed, but construction had to be stopped due to lack of funds. Gupta instructed his officials to complete the work. Rajajinagar MLA S Suresh Kumar, zonal joint commissioner Shivaswamy, chief engineer (projects) Lokesh and zonal chief engineer Vishwanath were present during the inspection tour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shivanagar-flyover-to-be-ready-in-weeks/articleshow/86566589.cms||---

Sharing details of the recovery, BSF spokesperson DIG S P S Sandhu said, “Acting on a specific input, a search operation was conducted near the international border in Akhnoor area and a bag hidden in thick wild grass was found. It contained four pistols, eight magazines, 190 rounds of ammunition, one packet containing narcotics (likely heroin) weighing about one kilogramme and fake currency worth Rs 2,75,000.” The DIG added that the consignment was likely to be delivered to anti-national elements of the area. In a similar operation in J&K’s Poonch district on August 9, security forces seized a huge cache of arms and ammunition including two AK-47 rifles, AK-47 rifle magazines, one Chinese-made pistol and magazines, four grenades, detonators, fuse detonators, AK-47 ammunition, two mobile phones and phone batteries. Earlier on May 14, BSF troops recovered an AK-47 rifle, a pistol and some ammunition dropped by a Pakistani drone from the border belt of Jammu’s Samba district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-recovers-arms-drugs-counterfeit-currency-along-ib-in-jk/articleshow/86566779.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Experts found that the tigress, nearly two years old, had multiple internal injuries. Its hip bone was fractured and its hind limbs were crushed under the tyres of a vehicle. The feline had recently separated from its mother and was searching for its own territory when it met with the accident. The spot falls under Mailani range of Dudhwa tiger reserve. Anil Patel, deputy director, DTR (buffer), told TOI, “The tigress was probably hit while it was crossing the road that cuts through the Mailani range. The pressure on this road is very high and commuters often drive at high speed despite sign boards in the forest area to maintain speed limit and drive cautiously. People should understand that wild animals are the country's wealth and they are extremely important for our ecosystem.” He added that a few tiger deaths were earlier recorded on this stretch of the road before the Mailani range was included as part of the tiger reserve in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dudhwa-tigress-killed-by-speeding-vehicle-says-autopsy-report/articleshow/86560690.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Delhi’s border with Ghaziabad – one of the staging grounds of the sit-in agitation since last November against the new central farm laws – saw maximum disruptions after farmers closed all lanes of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway at UP Gate for nearly 10 hours. This led to the entire Anand Vihar-Kaushambi-Vaishali area remaining choked throughout the day as the expressway traffic was diverted into internal roads of Ghaziabad. Jams were also witnessed on the Chilla and DND borders with traffic diverted from the DME taking the Noida route into Delhi but choking at barricades set up by Delhi Police. There were no protests at the Gurgaon-Delhi border, but heavy checks triggered a massive snarl on the Gurgaon-Delhi lanes of the expressway between 7am and 9am. Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait claimed the strike was a success and accused the Centre of continuously trying to discredit the agri movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bandh-and-barricades-delhi-ncr-choke-on-travail-routes/articleshow/86568070.cms||---
---||World||A narrow win for Social Dems against Merkel bloc in election||BERLIN: The party that narrowly beat outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bloc pushed on Monday for a quick agreement on a coalition government, but Europe’s biggest economy could still be in for weeks of uncertainty after an election that failed to set a clear direction. Olaf Scholz, the candidate of the center-left Social Democrats, called for Merkel’s center-right Union bloc to go into opposition after it saw its worst-ever poll result. Both finished with well under 30% of vote, and that appeared to put the keys to power in the hands of two opposition parties. The SPD, Germany’s oldest party, won 25.7% of the vote, up five percentage points from the 2017 federal election, ahead of Merkel’s CDU/CSU conservative bloc on 24.1%, provisional results showed. The kingmakers, the Greens came in with 14.8% and the FDP won 11.5%. It will likely take at least three parties to form a government and both the Social Democrats and the CDU/CSU were planning to hold talks to do so. Scholz said he hoped to agree a coalition before Christmas, “if possible”. However, his conservative rival Armin Laschet, 60, said he could still try to form a government despite leading CDU/CSU bloc to their worst ever national election result. Scholz dispelled concerns that lengthy haggling and a new, multiparty government would mean unstable leadership. “Germany always has coalition governments, and it was always stable,” he said. If Scholz succeeds in forming a coalition, the former mayor of Hamburg would become only the fourth post-WWII SPD chancellor and the first since Merkel took over in 2005. Merkel’s outgoing government will remain in office until a successor is sworn in, a process that can take weeks or even months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/a-narrow-win-for-social-dems-against-merkel-bloc-in-election/articleshow/86568521.cms||---

Training his guns, especially, on the Congress, Dalal dared its leaders to project Rakesh Tikait as the chief ministerial face during the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh to see for themselves the “reality of the farmers’ strike and his popularity”.  “This Bharat Bandh has caused a lot of inconvenience to the general public at the cost of politics of opposition. The opposition parties, especially the Congress, should apologise to the entire state for this. Rest, this has benefited none but has disheartened the masses,’’ said Dalal.  Notably, Dalal is first BJP minister who has given his reaction to media over the bandh call by SKM, a joint forum of farmers’ organisations protesting the Centre’s farm laws.  The opposition parties have openly announced their support to the bandh call. The INLD had announced the same from dais on Saturday during its Jind rally, while Congress legislative Party leader Bhupinder Hooda and HPCC president Selja asked the party workers to support the call.  In a related development, Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda has urged the Union government to fix time, place and date for a meeting with farmer leaders. Bhupinder Hooda had insisted on unconditional dialgoue from both the sides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bandh-has-caused-inconvenience-to-public-at-the-cost-of-politics-of-opposition-haryana-minister/articleshow/86568115.cms||Manveer Saini
---||World||Biggest one-year spike in murders across US in 2020, reveals FBI data||The US experienced its biggest one-year increase on record in murders in 2020, according to new figures released on Monday by the FBI, with some cities hitting record highs. Although major crimes were down overall, an additional 4,901 murders were committed in 2020 compared with the year before, the largest leap since national records started in 1960. The significant rise in homicides has roughly coincided with the 18 months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The high murder rate has continued into 2021, although the pace has slowed. Overall, the toll of some 21,500 people killed last year is still well below the record set during the violence of the early 1990s. Still, several cities, like Albuquerque, Memphis, Milwaukee, Tulsa and Des Moines, are recording their highest murder numbers ever, according to the report.  A number of key factors are driving the violence, including the economic and social toll taken by the pandemic and a sharp increase in gun purchases and drug use. Chief Harold Medina of the Albuquerque police department cited Covid-19, the fallout from social justice protests, and bail reform efforts that in some cities saw more incarcerated people released back onto the streets as reasons for more violence. The report from the FBI, which tabulates crime numbers reported by almost 16,000 law enforcement agencies across the US, also showed that murders were more widespread. Gun violence claimed a larger share of victims than ever before. The wider geographic distribution differs from past decades, said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst. In 1990, New York City and Los Angeles accounted for 13.8% of US murders, compared with 3.8% in 2020, he said. Murders so far this year rose about 10% from 2020 in 87 cities whose current numbers are available, Asher said. The pandemic undoubtedly played a significant role, causing economic and mental stress. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, businesses and in some cases their housing. The sense of desperation helped to fuel social friction and crime. Many also experienced the trauma of losing loved ones. The pandemic also meant that police departments sometimes struggled with the number of officers under quarantine, while the pandemic curbed public services like mental health counselling and simultaneously aggravated related problems like homelessness. The report also breaks down the murder victims by race, ethnicity and sex, with 9,913 Black people killed in 2020, 7,029 white people, 497 from other races and 315 of unknown race. There were 14,146 men killed and 3,573 women. Certain major cities were well down from their worst years. New York City experienced about 500 murders in 2020, compared with 319 in 2019, but both figures were far below the city’s worst year, 1990, when there were more than 2,200. Chicago had 771 murders last year, compared with about 500 in 2019 and 939 in 1992. There were 351 murders last year in Los Angeles, versus 258 in 2019; its record is 1,010 murders in 1980. The protests that erupted after the killing of George Floyd were also an important factor, although experts differ about why. Some argue that the police, under intense scrutiny and demoralised, pulled back from some aspects of crime prevention. Others put the emphasis on the public, suggesting that diminished respect for the police prompted more people to try to take the law into their own hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biggest-one-year-spike-in-murders-across-us-in-2020-reveals-fbi-data/articleshow/86568849.cms||Neil MacFarquhar

---||India||With big guns, Army keeps combat posture along LAC||NEW DELHI: The Army continues with its strong combat posture along the entire frontier with China, which includes high-volume artillery firepower ranging from the older 105mm field guns, Bofors and rocket systems to the spanking new M-777 ultra-light howitzers, amid no signs of de-escalation in eastern Ladakh. The M-777 howitzers can be airlifted from one sector to another in forward areas by Chinook helicopters, while the swifter mobilization of heavier artillery guns has been made possible by the roads constructed by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) over the last couple of years. “As the BRO further takes the road network to forward areas, we will be able to deploy our guns in more locations,” said director general (artillery) Lt-General T K Chawla, a day ahead of the Gunners’ Day on Tuesday. The Army is also trial-evaluating whether the new K-9 Vajra self-propelled tracked guns, procured for operations in plains and deserts, can be effectively deployed in high-altitude regions as well, he added. The force has inducted 100 of 155mm/52-calibre K-9 guns, which have a range of 28-38-km, under a Rs 4,366 joint project of L&T and South Korean Hanwha Defence. “We are also examining whether more K-9 guns are needed,” said Lt-Gen Chawla. As for the M-777 howitzers, primarily meant for the China front, around half of the 145 guns ordered for over Rs 5,000 crore from the US have been delivered so far. With a strike range of 30-km, three M-777 regiments have been deployed along the Line of Actual Control with China. There is, however, slow progress in two major indigenous artillery guns, both of which have faced problems during trials. The first is the 155mm/45-calibre Dhanush howitzers, the electronically upgraded version of the original Bofors guns. The Army had earlier placed an order for 114 of these guns for Rs 1,260 crore from the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB). The second is the 155mm/52 caliber advanced towed artillery gun systems (ATAGS), which the DRDO contends is the best in its class in the world with a 48-km strike range. The Army needs as many as 1,580 such guns. “A lot of handholding has been done by the Army, both for ATAGS and Dhanush. We want the indigenous efforts to succeed. There are major advantages in having indigenous systems and not being dependent on foreign technologies,” said Lt-Gen Chawla. After “constructive discussions” with both OFB and DRDO, the senior officer said he was “optimistic” that “certain parameters not achieved” during trials of ATAGS and the “few teething issues” with Dhanush will both be resolved soon. “We want robust guns. Guns which are able to fire accurately, consistently and with a high degree of reliability as per laid down parameters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-big-guns-army-keeps-combat-posture-along-lac/articleshow/86569237.cms||Rajat Pandit

Nineteen vaccine vials, including Covaxin, Covishield and tetanus injections, along with 155 syringes have been recovered from the two men, police said on Monday. Only four of the vials, police added, were sealed. The accused, police said, had allegedly administered vaccines to around 20 people before the police raided their rented house around 8pm on Sunday. As per the police, all vaccine vials had been sourced through an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) employed at Budh Vihar UPHC. The woman, whose role is currently being investigated, is allegedly also related to one of the accused. In-charge of Bisrakh PHC Dr Sachindra Mishra told TOI they had received information that some people had received Covid-19 jabs on payment of Rs 250 at a house in Kheda Chauganpur village. “The Gautam Budh Nagar CMO was informed, following which the police raided the house, belonging to one Kunwarpal, on Sunday evening and arrested two men — Ravi (35) and Sushil (30),” Mishra said. The house owner, Kunwarpal, claimed he had rented the premises to Ravi and had no knowledge about the illegal vaccination camp, police said. The accused, Mishra said, had mostly administered the vaccines to acquaintances and were merely noting down the names in a register. No vaccination certificates had been issued to the beneficiaries. Meanwhile, during questioning, Sushil, who works as a ward boy at the Budh Vihar UPHC, is said to have told police that they had obtained the vaccine vials from Ravi’s sister-in-law, Renu, an ANM at the same UPHC. A police officer told TOI that the accused possibly had stolen the vaccine vials which were given to the ANM and other officials for administering free doses to beneficiaries turning up at the urban primary health centre. “It is possible that the accused were stealing partially used vials from the PHC or those that were shown as wasted and sold them illegally,” he said, adding that the other officials of the PHC will be questioned in the matter. Police said the accused had vaccinated more than 20 people on September 19 in another illegal camp organised at the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/vax-stolen-from-phc-sold-for-250/articleshow/86570289.cms||Shikha Salaria

Singh, posted with 102 Engineer Regiment, had joined the Indian Army in 2011. At the time of his death, he was a co-driver of Indian Army's high mobility vehicle (HMV), which fell into 500-ft gorge in Assam sector about 3 pm on Friday.  As per the information shared by the Army officers with the family members, the HMV was negotiating a blind turn, when it went down a deep gorge, trying to avert a civilian vehicle parked in the middle of the pass and another speeding vehicle coming from the opposite side. Other soldiers were rescued but Gurjant was declared dead on September 24 about 5 pm.  On Monday morning, a team of Indian Army, led by Naib Subedar Hoshiar Singh, brought the remains of Gurjant, wrapped in the national flag, to his village Rai Majra. The villagers showered flower petals when the remains were being shifted to the soldier's house.  Later, at the cremation ground, full state and military honours were given during the wreath-laying ceremony.

---||India||SC puts government on notice, says ‘don’t play football with lives of young doctors’||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday accused the National Medical Council, National Board of Examinations and the health ministry of “playing football” with the lives of young doctors aspiring to do their specialisation by changing the pattern of questions for the NEET-Super Speciality Examination more than a month after notifying the exam date. As many as 41 doctors through advocate Javedur Rehman had moved SC alleging that though the examination dates of November 13 and 14 was notified on July 23, the NMC/NBE issued a notification on August 31, arbitrarily changing the pattern of questions and subject-wise distribution of marks to jeopardise the future of young doctors. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Shyam Divan said months of preparation for NEET-SS has been affected by the decision of the authorities to change the rules of the game much after the play has begun. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna came down heavily on NMC, NBC and the ministries of health as well as social welfare for arbitrarily effecting the change and asked additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, NBE counsel Maninder Singh and NMC counsel Gaurav Sharma to ask all the authorities involved in the change of question pattern to urgently hold a meeting and “put their house in order”. Justice Chandrachud-led bench said, “We are putting you to notice: If we are not satisfied with the reasons for effecting the change in question pattern mid-way, then we will pass strictures against the authorities.” When Singh said the change was in the offing for a long time and that the notification was issued as soon as all necessary clearances were received, the bench said, “The change in pattern could have been made effective from next year. The students have been preparing for months in advance. Why would you change the rules of the game mid-way? Tell the authorities that we are very dissatisfied with the way they are playing with the lives of young doctors.” “Don’t treat the young doctors like footballs just because you have the power (to change the examination pattern). Hold a meeting this week and put your house in order. We will not permit you to play with the lives of young doctors,” the bench said, adding, “The pattern of preparation for any examination depends on the pattern of question papers. If you (authorities) change it mid-way, then it will leave many ruffled.” “Since 2018, a pattern of questions and subject-wise distribution of marks has been followed — 60% of questions from the area of specialisation and 40% from feeder courses. How could you suddenly make it 100% from the general medicine subject?” the bench asked. The NMC counsel said that it was to ensure that not many seats in the super speciality courses go vacant. The reply, however, did not satisfy the SC, which asked for a better explanation by next Monday with a warning that if a plausible explanation did not come, it would pass strictures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-puts-govt-on-notice-says-dont-play-football-with-lives-of-young-docs/articleshow/86570452.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Addressing the UN security council meeting on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), foreign secretary Harsh V Shringla said, “There is a need for the international community to pay closer attention to the illicit proliferation of networks of nuclear weapons, their delivery systems, components and relevant technologies.” Shringla added that while India has joined three of four global non-proliferation regimes— Australia Group, Wassenaar Arrangement and Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)— it has harmonised its controls in accordance to the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India is yet to get entry into the NSG because China has blocked India’s membership. Given the state of bilateral relations, that block is not likely to be lifted anytime soon. Shringla said India did not sign on to CTBT because it did not address India’s core concerns. “India maintains a unilateral moratorium on explosive nuclear testing,” he said, leaving the door open for simulated and other means of testing. India also recommitted to negotiations for a fissile material cutoff treaty (FMCT), on the basis of the mandate of CD/1299. These negotiations have not moved anywhere because of Pakistan’s objections. “India has played a leading role in global efforts towards nuclear disarmament. India was the first country to call for a ban on nuclear testing in 1954 and a non-discriminatory treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as distinct from non-dissemination, in 1965,” said Shringla, as he underscored India’s commitment to a nuclear weapon free world. “Without prejudice to the priority we attach to nuclear disarmament, India has expressed its readiness to support the commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT)” in the Conference on Disarmament on the basis of the mandate contained in CD/1299, Shringla said, adding that in this context, India has also participated in the work of the Group of Governmental Experts on FMCT and the High-level Expert Preparatory Group on FMCT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pay-closer-attention-to-n-proliferation-india-says-at-unsc/articleshow/86570967.cms||---

Now they're seeking to make amends by throwing the spotlight on a member of Rhode Island's Narragansett tribe who won the race twice in the 1930s and inspired the name "Heartbreak Hill" to describe the most iconic and dreaded - section of the course. The Boston Athletic Association, which administers the marathon, said Monday it will honor the legacy of the late Ellison ``Tarzan'' Brown, Boston's champion in 1936 and 1939, in the run-up to the race's pandemic-altered Oct. 11 staging. The Boston Marathon traditionally is held in mid-April on Massachusetts' unique Patriots' Day holiday. In 2020, it was canceled in its traditional format for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic, and because of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, it's being run this year in the autumn rather than the spring. Next month's running falls on Indigenous Peoples Day - observed in some places as an alternative to Columbus Day - and that rankled enough people for the BAA in August to issue ``sincere apologies to all Indigenous people who have felt unheard or feared the importance of Indigenous Peoples' Day would be erased." Massachusetts does not officially recognize Indigenous Peoples Day, but Newton - which lies on the marathon course - does. Eighty-five years after his historic first win, Brown's descendants cheered the recognition of their acclaimed ancestor. "Running and winning the Boston Marathon was something grandpa loved," said Anna Brown-Jackson, a granddaughter of Brown. "Being an Indigenous person meant everything to Grandpa because he was very competitive to begin with,'' she said. "If someone told him he couldn't do something, whether it was winning the marathon or crossing through a path of land to gather shellfish for his family, he'd make sure to prove them wrong and do it." Patti Catalano Dillon, a member of the Mi'kmaq tribe, a three-time Boston Marathon runner-up and a former American marathon record holder, also will be honored at next month's race. Brown, whose tribal nickname was Deerfoot, set a world record with his second victory at Boston and represented the U.S. in Hitler's 1936 Olympics in Berlin alongside the great Jesse Owens. But he's best known for bursting onto America's nascent distance running scene in his initial victory in 1936, when multiple Boston champion Johnny Kelley was heavily favored to win. Media reports from 1936 say Brown had established a commanding lead in the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race when Kelley caught him near the 20-mile (32-kilometer) mark in the Newton hills. Kelley, it's said, gave Brown a patronizing pat on the back as if to say, "Nice try - I'll take it from here." That backfired badly. Brown took off, leaving Kelley in his dust and breaking his heart. "He ran like a bat out of hell,'' The Boston Globe reported at the time. Brown won in 2 hours, 33 minutes, 40 seconds; three years later, in his second win, he was the first to break 2:30 with a time of 2:28:51. Brown became an instant hero to native people across North America. But like other top Indigenous athletes of his era, he struggled greatly with discrimination and marginalization. In 1975, he died at age 60 after he was deliberately run over by a car in the parking lot of a Rhode Island bar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/boston-marathon-paying-tribute-to-2-time-indigenous-champion/articleshow/86571003.cms||---
---||India||Chhattisgarh CM, SIT members weakened PDS scam case: ED||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED), investigating the money laundering aspect of the PDS scam in Chhattisgarh, has informed the Supreme Court that the chief minister, members of the SIT, and a top law officer had allegedly weakened the case against two senior bureaucrats involved in embezzlement of crores of rupees in the purchase and transportation of foodgrains. Seeking cancellation of anticipatory bail to the bureaucrats — former MD of Nagrik Apurti Nigam (NAN or Public Distribution Corporation) Anil Kumar Tuteja and former chairman of the corporation Alok Shukla -- the ED said that after the high court granted anticipatory bail in August last year, most witnesses have resiled from their statements. This is a strong indicator of the two accused abusing their positions of influence in the state. Providing transcripts of messages on mobile phones seized by the income tax department, and shared with the agency in a “sealed cover”, to the SC, the ED said, “Message conversations seized by I-T department shockingly revealed that both the main accused (Tuteja and Shukla) in connivance with successive chiefs of prosecuting agency Economic Offences Wing, Anti-Corruption Bureau of Chhattisgarh, a very senior law officer in the Chhattisgarh HC, members of the SIT and with intervention of the chief minister have weakened the offence of corruption against them by procuring favourable reports from the SIT and by actively threatening witnesses of predicate offences as well as offences of money laundering.” The CM under reference is the current incumbent Bhupesh Baghel. “The transcript of such messages clearly reveal the nature of misuse of power in Chhattisgarh, tampering of evidence and influencing the witnesses going on and a potential conspiracy involving some constitutional functionaries also,” the ED said in its affidavit drafted by advocate Kanu Agrawal and settled by solicitor general Tushar Mehta. “Considering the sensitivity of the contents of the transcript, the ED, at this juncture places the transcript in a ‘sealed cover’, subject to decision to be taken by the Supreme Court on whether to put the same in public domain or not,” the ED said. Interestingly, a senior police officer of the state, Mukesh Gupta, too had moved the SC alleging that he was being persecuted “to protect the prime accused in the multi-crore NAN-scam and to satisfy the vindictive urge of chief minister Bhupesh Baghel” for going hammer and tongue against the accused persons while heading the EOW, ACB. The ED sought custodial interrogation of Tuteja and Shukla and a stay of the anticipatory bail granted to the two by the HC. The accused remaining on anticipatory bail would frustrate the cause of justice and cause subversion of the criminal justice system, the ED said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chhattisgarh-cm-sit-members-weakened-pds-scam-case-ed/articleshow/86571066.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The observation was made by a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana when senior advocate C U Singh mentioned a corporate matter for the priority hearing. “We have to wait. We are streamlining the (mentioning) system and here corporations want their matters to be listed first,” the CJI observed. The bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, then referred to criminal appeals, family disputes, and cases of poor people pending adjudication and said that they would take backstage. “There are pending criminal appeals, bail matters, and other cases of people of weaker sections too. They are lagging behind,” the bench said. Earlier, the CJI had said that a new system of mentioning cases for urgent hearings before apex court officials instead of its benches directly has been put in place to ensure that senior lawyers are not given “special priority” over their junior colleagues. “We do not want to give any special priority to senior lawyers and deprive junior lawyers of their opportunities. So this system was made, where all can make the mention before the mentioning registrar,” the bench said. “First you go to the mentioning registrar, and if it is disallowed, your right to mention before the bench is automatic,” the bench had told lawyer Prashant Bhushan. CJI Ramana has discontinued the practice of allowing direct mentioning of cases for urgent listing before benches and has instead asked lawyers to mention their cases before the designated official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-ticks-off-corporate-lawyers-on-pleas-for-urgent-listing/articleshow/86571139.cms||---

Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar on Monday tweeted an image of the new cover featuing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos under “#Amazon: East India Company 2.0” headline. “Panchjanya means talk of India. Read the next issue — What does Amazon do wrong that it needed to offer a bribe? Why do people consider this giant company a threat to indigenous entrepreneurship, economic freedom & culture?” he tweeted. Amazon has set up proxy entities, given crores in bribes, says Panchjanya. Why do people consider this giant company a threat to indigenous entrepreneurship, economic freedom and culture?” Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar tweeted with #Vocal_for_Local, a theme PM Modi has espoused to boost locally produced goods as part of his ‘Aatmnirbhar’ campaign. When the story grabbed the media limelight, Shankar once again tweeted, “The latest issue of Panchjanya is in discussion. The cover story highlights the Amazon business style, which is akin to East India Company.” The weekly refers to allegations that Amazon’s legal representatives bribed Indian officials. “Whatever the East India Company did in the 18th century to capture India, the same is visible in the activities of Amazon,” the article reads. Claiming that Amazon wants to establish its monopoly in the Indian market, it says, “For doing so, it has started taking initiatives for seizing the economic, political and personal freedoms of Indian citizens.” The Hindutva weekly also hit out at Amazon’s video platform, Prime Videos, saying it has been releasing movies and web series that are against Indian culture. It also alleges that Amazon has established many proxy entities and “there are reports that it has distributed crores in bribes for policies in its favour”. Amazon is also locked in a legal tussle over the takeover of Future Group and is facing a probe by the Competition Commission of India. Reports last week said that the US e-commerce giant is investigating bribes allegedly paid by its legal representatives in India, and that it spent Rs 8,546 crore or $1.2 billion in legal expenses for maintaining a presence in the country during 2018-20. “It is time to think where all it is going... the whole system seems to work on bribes and that is not the best of business practices,” the journal quoted unnamed Indian government officials as saying. Significantly, RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch has also demanded a probe into the alleged bribery by Amazon. Panchjanya’s attack on Amazon came days after Congress also demanded a probe against it on the same count. This is not the first time Panchjanya has hit out at companies. Earlier, it had attacked Infosys, alleging that the company may be deliberately trying to destabilise the Indian economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rss-linked-magazine-calls-amazon-east-india-co-2-0/articleshow/86571174.cms||---

It has also opened a Taiwan Education Centre on its campus to facilitate cooperation among the higher educational institutions of Taiwan and India.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on Monday, in presence of a delegation from Taiwan, including Ambassador Baushuan Ger; director of the Education Division of Ministry of Education, Peters Chen; director of Science and Technology Division, Ministry of Science and Technology, Chin Tsan Wang; assistant director Ellie Chiang and secretary, Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre (TECC), ministry of foreign affairs, Charles Cheng, besides Professor Rajeev Ahuja, IIT Ropar director, and Dr CC Reddy, dean, International Relations.  The Taiwan Education Centre at IIT Ropar is going to offer Mandarin language courses for beginners.  The programme is being undertaken in collaboration with TECC, the Taiwan government representative office in India. It is responsible for promoting Taiwan and India’s bilateral relations in the areas of economy, trade, investment, media, tourism, culture, education and science and technology.  Professor Ahuja said they decided to offer a course in the language as some of the students from the institute had shown a keen interest in learning Mandarin.  “The world we inhabit today is more interconnected than it has ever been before. And language is the common medium to understand the culture of one country. Opportunities in Taiwan are emerging both in terms of academics, research and placements. Taiwanese universities are looking forward to collaborating with our Institute. The increasing dynamism between the two countries will create a lot of openings for our students in future,” said Professor Ahuja.  Reddy said training in Mandarin language will help students to be able to work in Taiwanese companies established in India and overseas. “The language skills will be an asset over and above the technical knowledge and help them become global leaders,” said Reddy.  Ambassador of Taiwan Baushuan Ger said today's MoU sets a significant milestone for closer academic collaboration between India and Taiwan. “Developing academic ties with Indian institutions has been important for the establishment and strengthening of our bilateral relationship. Taiwan and India are like-minded partners when it comes to our democratic values and policies. India’s NEP (National Educational Policy) and Taiwan’s New Southbound Policy are proof that our future goals are aligned. With this MoU, we hope to connect the educational society of our nations and give scholars and students of both sides an opportunity to collaborate, interact and conduct exchange programmes on subjects of languages and mutual interest in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iit-ropar-to-start-certificate-course-in-mandarin/articleshow/86571236.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||India||Forcible unnatural sex with wife a heinous offence: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said forcible unnatural sex with wife by husband is a heinous offence, especially as it had led her to die by suicide, and refused bail to the man who has been in custody for more than two years on charges of dowry harassment, domestic violence and rape. An FIR was lodged in 2019 by the victim’s brother at Bhiwani Sadar police station in Haryana’s Bhiwani district, under Sections 148, 149, 323, 377 and 306 of the IPC. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli refused bail to one Pradeep, who allegedly tortured his wife by forcibly committing unnatural sex with her after her family failed to meet his dowry demands. The CJI-led bench said Sec 377 (rape) is a very serious offence and that the accused husband did not deserve leniency at the stage of probe. “We do not know what the police are doing. You started demanding dowry. When her family could not meet those demands, you started harassing her. You circulated her private pictures and videos on social media and tried to blackmail her. Above all, you allegedly had forcible unnatural sex with her leading to her suicide. You deserve no leniency as this is a heinous crime.” When the petitioner’s counsel said that the man is a government servant and would lose his job if not granted bail, the bench said, “It is ok if such persons lose their jobs. You better stay in jail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/forcible-unnatural-sex-with-wife-a-heinous-offence-supreme-court/articleshow/86571409.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Over 1.6 crore people (32%) of the target population of 4.9 crore have received both vaccine doses in Karnataka, according to data at 7am on Monday on the CoWin dashboard. The state ranks fifth in terms of absolute number of people fully vaccinated in the country. Maharashtra (2.2 crore), Uttar Pradesh (1.8 crore), Gujarat (1.8 crore) and West Bengal (over 1.6 crore) are ahead of Karnataka. In terms of proportion, Gujarat (37%) has done better than Karnataka, while Maharashtra (24%), West Bengal (23%) and Uttar Pradesh (12%) are lower in the table. The percentage data for West Bengal was not available. The vaccines may not be able to completely prevent infections and stop transmission of virus but they do prevent mortality and reduce severity of the disease. Among South Indian states, Andhra Pradesh has fully vaccinated nearly 1.3 crore people, Tamil Nadu 1.1 crore and Kerala 1 crore. Telangana has covered 67.4 lakh persons with both doses. Kerala has covered the highest proportion of target population with both doses (39.6 %) while Andhra Pradesh is a close second (36%). ‘67% of target population yet to get 2nd jab’ We have yet to cover 67% of the target population with the second dose in Karnataka,” said Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka. The focus in Karnataka is now on covering persons due for second dose and reminder messages are being sent to them. “We're planning for special campaigns and targeted approach in districts not doing well,” she added. “To reduce the intensity of the third wave, more people must be fully vaccinated with both doses.,” said senior health department officers. Meanwhile, Dr MK Sudarshan said: “In Bidar, Vijayapura, Yadgir and Kalaburagi districts bordering Maharashtra, the first dose coverage itself has to be improved. If there are spillover cases from Maharashtra, they will be first noticed in these districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-fully-inoculates-1-6cr-highest-no-in-south-india/articleshow/86571469.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||India||Kerala HC lifts ban on online rummy games||KOCHI: Online rummy, played with or without stakes, “is a game of skill”, the Kerala high court held on Monday while setting aside a state government notification prohibiting online playing of the game for money. The ruling, which comes as a relief for many companies engaged in the business of developing and offering online games of skill, was pronounced by Justice T R Ravi who said that the Kerala government’s February 23 notification was “arbitrary, illegal and violative of the fundamental rights” of such companies. The HC said that the Supreme Court has already held that rummy was “a game of mere skill” and “playing for stakes or not can never be a criterion to find out whether a game is a game of skill”. Therefore, for the same reasons that rummy was held to be a game of skill, online rummy was also a game of skill, the high court said. “Online rummy played either with stakes or without stakes remains to be a ‘game of skill’,” it said and added that even without a notification the game will come within the purview of the Kerala Gaming Act and will enjoy the exemptions provided under it for games of skill. “Since the game does not come within the meaning of ‘gambling’ or ‘gaming’, providing a platform for playing the game, which is in the nature of business, can’t be curtailed,” the HC said. It further said the state government notification was a prohibition on playing of online rummy for stakes and was “not a reasonable restriction” under the Constitution. “In the result, the notification is declared as arbitrary, illegal and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and hence not enforceable,” the HC said. The order came on a batch of petitions moved by various companies, engaged in the business of developing and offering online games of skill in India, challenging the notification. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for one of the petitioner companies,said the notification was without any rationale and arbitrary as offline rummy played for stakes was valid, but online rummy when played for stakes was being prohibited. The HC’s decision was welcomed by the online skill gaming industry. Former SC judge Justice Vikramjit Sen, who is a member of the Skill Games Council, in a statement said, “The SC and multiple high courts have reiterated numerous times that online games of skill are protected by the Constitution. We see the Kerala HC’s judgment as a positive move for the online gaming sector.” Dinker Vashisht, corporate affairs vice-president of Games24x7, welcomed the verdict and said, “The judgment is yet another addition to the jurisprudence that has consistently held that games of skill are not akin to gambling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-hc-lifts-ban-on-online-rummy-games/articleshow/86571536.cms||---

On the whole, the city received an average 28 cm of rainfall. This is said to be the highest one-day rainfall the city has received in the last 30 years. Torrential rains wreaked havoc in Vizag city on Sunday night following the landfall of the cyclonic storm Gulab, leading to the inundation of several low-lying areas and severe disruption of services such as electricity and transportation. The rains were much more severe than in Kalingapatnam in Srikakulam, ground zero of the cyclone. In fact, the top 20 locations in terms of rainfall numbers in Andhra Pradesh due to the cyclone are in Vizag city or its suburbs. As the rain bands stuck near Vizag city after the weather system crossed the coast, there was massive downpour starting Sunday midnight, particularly between 1 am and 5 am. The intensity of the rains can be gauged from the fact that Simhachalam, which received only some nine centimetres of rainfall till 10 pm on Sunday night, crossed the 33 cm mark by 6 am on Monday. Areas such as Adavivaram, Kancharapalem, Railway New Colony, Darapalaem, Gopalapatnam, Dwarkanagar, Peda Waltair, MVP Colony, Maddilapalem and Seethammadhara received a record 30 cm of rainfall between 8 am on Sunday and 8 am on Monday. On the whole, the city received an average 28 cm of rainfall. This is said to be the highest one-day rainfall the city has received in the last 30 years. The last time the city witnessed nearly 20 cm rainfall in a day was during Cyclone Pyaar in 2005. There was waist-deep water in some colonies where rainwater entered houses. As many as 88 colonies saw waterlogging. Officials from the district administration and the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) swung into action, clearing trees and restoring services. A woman named D Bhavani (37) died in a wall collapse in Pendurthi on Monday. Speaking to TOI, Sai Praneeth, a weather blogger, popularly known as Andhra Pradesh Weatherman on social media, said; “The rain bands, which were supposed to pour in Srikakulam, came down to Vizag due to wind shear after the cyclone made landfall. This resulted in torrential downpour for several hours. This was the most intense rainfall event in the last 30 years for Vizag city. Under the system’s pull effect, there were on and off rains in Vizag on Monday too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-flooded-rains-break-30-yr-record/articleshow/86571608.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||India||Community leaders turn ‘influencers’ to boost vaccination drive in tribal districts||NEW DELHI: In many of the tribal-majority districts, it is not celebrities but community leaders and members of self-help groups, mostly led by women, who have emerged as key “influencers” to push the Covid vaccination drive. The data of vaccination for around100 districts with significant tribal population across states shows that over 6.73 crore doses (including first and second shot) have been administered. As part of its on-ground outreach with Unicef and WHO, Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation shared this data for the districts where the grassroots campaign for vaccination took off on July 15. Two districts — Mandla in MP and Bastar in Chhattisgarh — were the launch pads for the campaign. It has since spread to other districts with localised campaigns aimed at quelling myths and fears regarding vaccines and accelerating the vaccination drive. TOI followed up with both districts to know the current vaccination status. Mandla district collector Harshika Singh told TOI that of 7.47 lakh eligible population, almost 96% have got their first dose. She said after initial hesitancy, vaccination picked up after June 21 in mission mode. “We hope to touch 100% coverage this week for first dose and since most people took the vaccine from mid-June onwards and Covishield was the dominant vaccine, the second dose will pick up now,” Singh said. She said due to very high hesitancy in tribal areas, local influencers were identified, citing the particularly vulnerable tribal group called Baiga, 40,000 of whom are based in Mandla. “This tribe has a lot of influence on other tribes and since they were reluctant, we reached out to a respected tribal elder who had the power to influence others. Once he took the vaccine, the whole village started coming forward and then this village became the messenger for the 300 plus other villages where the tribe lives,” Singh further said. Bastar district collector Rajat Bansal highlighted the role of tribal women in helping break vaccine hesitancy. The district has so far administered the first dose to 61.7% of the eligible population while 33% have received their second dose as well. Officials said taking the message to the weekly ‘haats’ and setting up vaccination camps in coordination with health department at these community spaces also gave impetus to the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/community-leaders-turn-influencers-to-boost-vaccination-drive-in-tribal-districts/articleshow/86571684.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||India||Bombay HC bars open-court hearing of workplace sex harassment cases||MUMBAI: Issuing guidelines for sexual harassment at workplace cases, the Bombay high court has directed that henceforth all such matters will be heard in-camera or in the judge’s chambers and not in open court, and the orders are not to be uploaded on the official website. The HC has also barred the media from publishing the proceedings without court permission. The bench of Justice Gautam Patel, in its September 24 order, said it is imperative in the interest of both sides to protect the identities of the parties from disclosure, even accidental disclosure, in proceedings under the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. “There appear to be no established guidelines so far in such matters. This order, setting out a working protocol for future orders, hearings and case file management, is a first endeavour in that direction,” it said. “The prohibition on publishing names, address or other personal identifiable information of the parties is absolute,” it said, and directed all persons, including media, to ensure strict compliance and any failure would amount to contempt of court. Witnesses too must sign a statement of non-disclosure and confidentiality. “Both sides and all parties and advocates, as also witnesses, are forbidden from disclosing the contents of any order, judgment or filing to the media or publishing any such material in any mode or fashion by any means, including social media, without specific leave of the court,” the bench said. “In the order sheets, the names of parties will not be mentioned,” said the court, adding that the endeavour will be to anonymise the identities of parties, such as email ID, mobile number and address. The names and addresses of the witnesses will also not be noted, it said. The order was passed in a suit filed under Posh Act this year by ‘P’ versus ‘A and others’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-bars-open-court-hearing-of-workplace-sex-harassment-cases/articleshow/86571799.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||Rift in CPI over promotion may have resulted in Kanhaiya Kumar's exit||NEW DELHI: An internal split within the Communist Party of India (CPI) over promoting Kanhaiya Kumar at the national level may have triggered the former student leader’s imminent exit from the party. Party sources said that Kanhaiya, with his fiery speeches and connect with the Hindi heartland, had come to be regarded as a crowd-puller at public rallies, a factor that had also led to some consternation in the top echelons of the Communist party. While some said Kanhaiya felt slighted by the party’s Bihar leadership (backed by some national leaders), his desire for a more prominent role in the party put him at loggerheads with the leadership, which maintained that ideology, not individuals, matters in the party. While party sources acknowledged that Kanhaiya was successfully deployed to address rallies across the country, his exit is unlikely to impact the party significantly because of its cadre base and emphasis on ideology. “CPI is a party that emphasises on politics and ideology rather than individual. So Kanhaiya’s departure may only be a temporary setback, not a permanent one,” a leader said, citing the past instance of farmer leader and CPI stalwart Yogendra Sharma being suspended from the party without significant impact. While party chief D Raja did not comment, another leader said Kanhaiya’s exit will show he has “compromised with his ideology” and taken the “opportunist way out” of CPI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rift-in-cpi-over-promotion-may-have-resulted-in-kanhaiya-kumars-exit/articleshow/86571947.cms||Swati Mathur

Dr Sanjiv Kumar, the nodal officer for corona at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, advises parents to get their kids tested for Covid if they show symptoms of viral fever. He also urges all hospitals to be fully prepared “in case the children’s health deteriorates”. A consultant physician, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, claims that the next two months are crucial as there may be a possibility of the third wave. “Everyone, especially children, should, therefore, not forget to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour, wear masks, sanitise hands, and follow social distancing norms,” he adds. Echoing similar views, Dr N K Lal, the medical director of a private hospital in Patliputra, urges people to be careful as “they may become the carriers of Covid and jeopardize children’s lives”. Even Patnaites, who faced the brunt of the second wave of the pandemic, are surprised to see others violating the safety protocols openly. Sandhya Singh, the regional manager of a bank on Gola Road, rues, “When I step out of my house, it seems there is no pandemic. Nobody wears a mask or maintains social distancing.” A resident of Patliputra Colony, Ajay Kumar Singh, says, “If everyone continues to be careless, the third wave of the pandemic is imminent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3rd-wave-of-cov-imminent-if-people-flout-safety-norms/articleshow/86563175.cms||---

Only those who have taken at least one dose of Covid vaccine will be allowed to visit pandals and fairs. Kumar Ritesh, a member of Mithapur-Jakkanpur Durga Puja Samiti, said a team would be formed to manage crowd and ensure that people wear masks before entering the pandal. “The pandal will be simple. This time, we have not selected any theme or iconic buildings. Also, only one idol of standard size of goddess Durga will be there,” he said, adding only 20 people will be allowed inside the pandal at a time to maintain social distancing. Sanjeev Prasad Toni, chairperson of Navyuvak Sangh Shree Durga Puja Samiti Trust, Dak Bungalow Road, said, “Our members, priests, artisans, workers and electricians are all vaccinated. At the entry point of pandal, a team will be deputed to check vaccination certificates of the visitors. CCTV cameras will be installed at the pandal.” Brajnandan Prasad Singh, one of the founding members of Shri Shri Navyuvak Durga Puja Samiti, Kadamkuan, said the height of the pandal would not be more than 25 feet while an eight-foot idol of goddess Durga will be placed. “Limited visitors will be allowed to avoid crowding. Arrangements for sanitiser and thermal screening will be made. Teams have been formed to ensure the compliance of Covid-19 protocols,” he said. Saurabh Bhattacharya, assistant secretary of Bangali Akhara Durga Puja Samiti, said, “Our pandal will have a simple pattern with two sides largely open.

Inaugurating the first online meeting of the critical care working group (CCWG) of AIIMS-P in virtual presence of civil surgeons of all the districts and other doctors, Dr Singh said many valuable lives could be saved by providing prompt medical help to critical patients at the nearest health facility. Dr Sanjeev Kumar of AIIMS P said the Covid-19 pandemic necessitated many improvements for managing critical patients and there came the concept of constituting CCWG at the AIIMS-P. He said the capacity building in hospitals included an electronic grand round (e-mail grand) concept for discussing individual cases between any hospital and the AIIMS-P. Addressing the participants, Dr Neeraj Kumar of AIIMS-P said there would be different modules of CCWG for PHCs, district hospitals and state medical colleges. Another important feature of the CCWG at all government hospitals is using tele ICU to be monitored by the AIIMS-P. Altogether 65 officials, including civil surgeons, participated in the first CCWG meeting. Others who addressed the meeting were A Kumar of United States Agency of International Development and Dr Abhyuday Kumar of AIIMS-P.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-p-gives-critical-care-tips-to-dist-hospitals-phcs/articleshow/86563225.cms||VK Tripathi

The stagnant water has left the entire park out of bounds for morning walkers, bird watchers and members of clubs on Lake premises. “The filth on the ground is now mixing with the lake water, polluting it. Moreover, the stagnant water is giving off an unbearable stench and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” said Gopal Chowdhury, a retired judge and a regular at Rabindra Sarobar. Chowdhury has decided to write to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) about the immense neglect by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of the Lake. “KMDA seems to have no reaction, even though the water has been stagnant for the last seven days, even after water receded everywhere else,” he said. According to local KMDA officials, there are more than 150 gully pits in the Lake area which seem to be choked with dry leaves and plastic, stopping the water from flowing into the municipal drains. KMDA director general Supriyo Maity said, “It is completely wrong to say that we don’t clean the gully pits. We clean them periodically. But the water level of the outfall channels, like Adi Ganga, is still very high. So, the stagnant water could not recede. Hopefully, if there is no further rain, the water will flow out in a couple of days.” “I hired labourers and tried to clear only one gully pit, and water steadily flowed out. But surprisingly there is none to carry out this simple task,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist and a regular at the Lake. Even though NGT has asked not to allow any accumulation of garbage on the Lake premises, there are waste dumps and pollutants are getting mixed with lake water, he said. “Even the pathway, where the water has receded a bit, has become slippery with green algae because of the stagnant water. I have seen many elderly morning walkers fall on the walkway. Many were grievously injured,” said Sumita Banerjee, a Lake enthusiast. The lily pool has become a mosquito-breeding zone, and despite several requests to KMDA officials, nothing has been done, she added. “Since there is no fish in the stagnant water, the larvae will live in it for four to 14 days to turn into mosquitoes,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/choked-gully-pits-keep-lake-grounds-flooded/articleshow/86566063.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The trust has surrendered the land back to the state. The HC reminded that everyone should have acted as per law since the apex court had earlier struck down this allotment. The HC said the state could recover the fine from the state officials who had allotted the land. The New Town land allotment was made in 2013. A case was filed challenging it in 2016. Sourav and his trust told the HC that the land has been surrendered and the deposits made for it has been refunded and there is nothing to challenge the allotment order any more. The Left Front government had first made a land allotment in 2009. The SC had turned it down. In 2012, the Trinamool government made a fresh land allocation. This was to build a school over 2.5 acres. Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal who authored the judgment said, “The country always stands by the sportspersons, especially who represent country in international events. It is also a fact that Sourav Ganguly has brought laurels for the country in cricket. But when it comes to law, our Constitutional Scheme is that all are equal and no one can claim to be exclusive, above the law and seek benefits from the State, especially when question arises for allotment of plots for commercial ventures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-land-hc-fines-state-hidco-sourav/articleshow/86566123.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

As the rain bands stuck near Vizag city after the weather system crossed the coast, there was massive downpour starting Sunday midnight, particularly between 1 am and 5 am. The intensity of the rains can be gauged from the fact that Simhachalam, which received only some nine centimetres of rainfall till 10 pm on Sunday night, crossed the 33 cm mark by 6 am on Monday. Areas such as Adavivaram, Kancharapalem, Railway New Colony, Darapalaem, Gopalapatnam, Dwarkanagar, Peda Waltair, MVP Colony, Maddilapalem and Seethammadhara received a record 30 cm of rainfall between 8 am on Sunday and 8 am on Monday. On the whole, the city received an average 28 cm of rainfall. This is said to be the highest one-day rainfall the city has received in the last 30 years. The last time the city witnessed nearly 20 cm rainfall in a day was during Cyclone Pyaar in 2005. There was waist-deep water in some colonies where rainwater entered houses. As many as 88 colonies saw waterlogging. Officials from the district administration and the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) swung into action, clearing trees and restoring services. A woman named D Bhavani (37) died in a wall collapse in Pendurthi on Monday. Speaking to TOI, Sai Praneeth, a weather blogger, popularly known as Andhra Pradesh Weatherman on social media, said; “The rain bands, which were supposed to pour in Srikakulam, came down to Vizag due to wind shear after the cyclone made landfall. This resulted in torrential downpour for several hours. This was the most intense rainfall event in the last 30 years for Vizag city. Under the system’s pull effect, there were on and off rains in Vizag on Monday too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/wind-shear-behind-highest-single-day-rain-in-decades/articleshow/86564054.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Of them, property worth Rs45.81 crore belonging to 28 outlaws has already been confiscated by the ED, ADG (EOU) Nayyar Hasnain Khan said. The EOU has also initiated action against those involved in duping people in the name of providing them oxygen cylinders, remdesivir and other lifesaving drugs during the Covid-19 pandemic, he added. The EOU has been moving at full throttle since the last one and a half months and initiated action against six senior police and administrative officials, including an IPS officer, for allegedly amassing assets worth several crores disproportionate to their known sources of income. During searches of their residential premises, the EOU detected unaccounted properties worth more than Rs20 crore. Five of them have been accused of having their close links with the sand mining mafias, who obliged them allegedly for being lenient and allowing them to carry out their illegal operation. The officers are R K Dubey (former Bhojpur SP), Sunil Kumar Singh, who was SDM of Dehri, Tanveer Ahmad, former DSP of Paliganj, P K Rawat, former DSP of Ara, Vinod Kumar, former MVI of Ara, and Narendra Kumar Dheeraj, constable and BPA state president. All of them have been suspended. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. The action against the six public servants booked under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 will have its far-reaching impact. It will be reflected in the days to come,” a senior officer of the EOU said. According to authoritative sources, altogether 41 police and administrative officers are facing the heat of the EOU for having their connections with sand mining mafias. In all, 53 DA cases have been lodged against corrupt public servants since its inception in 2011. While chargesheets have been submitted in the courts in 35 cases, the remaining 18 cases were under investigation. In addition, 17 DA cases have been lodged under the Bihar Special Court Act, 2009. The process to confiscate the property worth Rs57.25 crore belonging to 25 corrupt public servants has also been initiated recently. Earlier, 12 accused were awarded sentences in 11 trap cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-proposes-confiscation-of-ill-gotten-assets-worth-rs-300-crore/articleshow/86563324.cms||Ramashankar

The government sent its memorandum in this regard to Niti Aayog last week. Development commissioner Amir Subhani said the Niti Aayog used a common set of parameters and 115 developmental indices for each of the 16 SDG goals to assess the overall performance of all the states, without taking into account the geographical, social and economic conditions or the special efforts made and achievements reached, “despite limited resources”. To give a glaring instance of the flawed selection of the parameter, both Yadav said Subhani separately pointed out that the Niti Aayog employed the required 33% forest cover of the total area of the state as one of the criteria and the northeastern states with 75% forest cover will naturally score high. But Bihar had only 9.79% green cover in 2011, which increased to 15% in 2017. “The green coverage of its land has improved, but the parameter of “green coverage” was dropped and forest cover used. Therefore, Bihar’s score was low on this parameter also,” Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/niti-aayogs-sdg-report-ignores-efforts-of-bihar-says-minister/articleshow/86563269.cms||Abhay Singh

There has been a 25% increase in demand for talent in cyberspace on an annualised basis since the pandemic broke. Industry experts say there’s a war for talent in this segment and, according to TeamLease Services, India is expected to have over 1.5 million unfulfilled job vacancies in cybersecurity by 2025. However, even as organisations scramble to fill in the vacancies, typically from engineering colleges, there’s a big piece that’s missing in the pie: Women. The percentage of women in cyberspace is extremely low currently. TeamLease Services co-founder & executive VP, Rituparna Chakraborty, said India’s cybersecurity industry is growing fast and the demand for skilled workers in this space has risen accordingly. But, she said, the forecast that has been made for women is only around 11% of the sector’s workforce by 2025. It turns out organisations are looking for talent where they wouldn’t be too many women candidates, that is, in engineering colleges. The pace of change in cyberspace is pushing some organisations to look at diversity hiring from graduate colleges. They reckon diversity is required to solve complex cyber challenges, given the rate at which cybercrime is growing. Deloitte India partner Deepa Seshadri said, although organisations look at cyber as technology related, cybersecurity is more of a business issue. “Looking at the rate at which cyberattacks are taking place, it has an inherent human element as well, which also is the weakest link in the chain. Thus, hiring strategies need to be different. When a company is hiring for cyber, they usually look for someone with an engineering background. That’s an unconscious bias. For data and privacy kind of matters, HR professionals would also be suited for such roles,” said Seshadri. The manner in which cyber is evolving, no matter how skilled a person is at the beginning, they would need to be reskilled and upskilled all the time. That’s the reason why diverse candidates are being encouraged to get into this space. “Diversity can help solve complex issues because, by definition, diversity brings in different perspectives,” said Seshadri. The number of women in engineering colleges today is still low. Seshadri said the firm is encouraging organisations to recruit from other graduate colleges to ensure diversity hiring in cyberspace. Deloitte has a 'women in cyber' programme with the objective of having a diverse talent pool as part of its cyber workforce. The firm focuses on introducing cyber curriculum in non-engineering colleges as well. “In the last 3 months, our recruitment in cyber has been 23% BSC/MSc/BCom/MCA, and 77% BE/BTech/MTech. Earlier, the number was tilted largely towards BE/BTech,” said Seshadri. She believes the sector needs additional women role models who can interest, attract and motivate more women professionals to take up jobs in cybersecurity. Akamai India MD & VP Prasad Mandava said hiring solely from engineering colleges may not be the best answer as many of the cybersecurity practitioners would have been self-taught or would have upskilled through various online platforms, and hence diversity hiring becomes a game-changer. “Innovation is only possible when the various viewpoints and experiences of a collective culminate to make a great idea. It is the variety of these ideas that is important. To bridge the talent gap, we as an industry must think differently and create opportunities for building a pool of talent that is not only skilled but also diverse,” said Mandava.Cyber Shiksha, the cybersecurity skilling programme by Data Security Council of India (DSCI), is doing its bit through an exclusive programme for women who want to upskill themselves in cybersecurity. Chakraborty said it would be much easier for women who are in senior roles and are returning to work after a break from their professional career to pivot to cybersecurity. According to a cybersecurity skills report by DSCI & FutureSkills Prime (a MeitY-Nasscom digital skilling initiative), there are over 50,000 jobs that are open in the cybersecurity space. Enhancement of cybersecurity is one of the priorities for 74% of organisations in 2021, according to TeamLease Services. The Indian cybersecurity workforce is likely to be 9% more than the global average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cybersecurity-jobs-why-so-few-women/articleshow/86567069.cms||Namrata Singh

The finance company has said that the 62 loans will be sold all together for an upfront cash payment. Interested parties have been given until October 19 to submit a binding bid. Last week, the RBI allowed lenders to sell even those loan accounts that have been classified as fraudulent. The loans that IL&FS is trying to sell are those advanced to third-parties that are not part of the group. The financial services arm has also advanced loans to group companies which are non-performing. According to sources, the scope of recovery in these loans is limited. In July the board had said that it expects to recover Rs 58,000 crore or 95% of the recovery target by March 2022. The group’s overall debt stood at Rs 99,000 crore as of October 2018, of which it expects to recover Rs 61,000 crore. A presentation on the recovery update filed by IL&FS said the corporation plans to recover Rs 2,250 crore after September 2021. This included the recovery from sale of IFIN NPAs, recoveries from non-group investments, and release of non-fund-based limits. Banks have classified loans to IFIN as fraud. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) had observed shortcomings in the operations, risk management and compliance of the company for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ilfs-fin-to-sell-bad-loans-worth-rs-4k-cr/articleshow/86568276.cms||---

The Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has set the target to cover 50,000 houses by March 2022. According to GAIL, at least 4,000 households in Patna are already using the piped natural gas (PNG). “Piped cooking gas connection has seen a jump of nearly 402% in a year as only 785 houses were using the facility in 2020. The jump was the result of rise in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder prices. Due to this, many households switched to PNG cooking gas supply,” a GAIL official said. The GAIL has set the target to reach out to 14 lakh households using LPG cylinders. The Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga Yojana scheme was launched in February 2019 to provide PNG connections to all households in the district with an estimated expenditure of Rs 2,500 crore. Another GAIL official areas like Jagdeopath, Jalalpur, DRM Colony, R P S Colony, Rukanpura, Gola Road, AIIMS Colony, Vijay Nagar, Ved Nagar, Raja Bazaar and Ashiana-Digha road have already been covered. “The work is in progress near Boring Road. We will then move to areas around Gandhi Maidan, Exhibition Road and Fraser Road,” the official said. A K Sinha, general manager of GAIL-Patna, said, “The work got delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. We have set the target to provide gas pipeline to 50,000 households by the end of the current financial year. Two more district regulating stations (DRSs) will be created by March next year,” he said. Sinha added four DRSs have been set up at AIIMS-Patna, BIT-Mesra, IGIMS and Danapur Railway Colony. “The state government has provided land to the GAIL to set up another DRS near Subhash Park through which cooking gas will be provided to nearby areas, including Exhibition road, Gandhi Maidan and Fraser Road. Each plant has the capacity to generate 5,000 standard cubic meter of gas per hour and each household consumption capacity is only 0.5 of gas per day. Each station can easily provide piped cooking gas to over 10,000 households,” Sinha said. A cubic meter PNG costs around Rs 32. The bill per month is calculated according to consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/piped-cooking-gas-to-reach-50k-households-by-march-22-gail/articleshow/86563132.cms||Faryal Rumi

Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday inaugurated the newly-constructed underpass near the Chandor railway station gate, which has been built at a cost of Rs 95 lakh. Chandor and Guirdolim come under the jurisdiction of Cuncolim constituency. The underpass was the need of the hour, as people of both villages often had to wait for more than 20-30 minutes each time a train passed. Even funerals and religious processions were stopped for hours sometimes, said Cuncolim MLA Clafacio Dias after the inauguration. Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral, who was also present at the inaugural said, “Many MLAs and ministers have ruled this constituency in the past, but all failed to give justice to the people. I myself travel on this road as it is a shortcut for people of Curchorem to proceed to Margao or Panaji.” Sawant also assured locals that the remaining development works will be completed within three months, before the upcoming assembly elections. “Dias joined BJP for the sake of development of his constituency,” Sawant said, adding that infrastructure as well as human development is on the government’s agenda and that people of Cuncolim will never be neglected, including for government jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-50-years-chandor-rail-underpass-finally-a-reality/articleshow/86568621.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The rape survivor lodged an FIR in May 2021 in which she had alleged that the accused had blackmailed and raped her for two years. Almost four months after the case was registered, a police team raided an examination centre and nabbed the accused. According to the police, the accused (police wished not to name him to protect the identity of the rape survivor) was wanted since a case of rape was lodged against him in May 2021. “It was alleged in the FIR that the rape survivor was living in Jaipur in February 2019 when the accused was preparing for competitive exams at their house. He had first raped the woman and later by threatening to kill her child raped her several times and also videographed the act. Following the FIR, he absconded,” said Mahaveer Singh Rathore, station house officer, Shipra Path police station told TOI on Monday. While the police visited his house and inquired about the accused it was found that he had gone to Alwar for REET on Sunday. “We got his examination letter and found his examination centre. We first detained him from Matasya College, Alwar. Our team acted as anti-cheating squad and brought him to Jaipur. After interrogation and final investigation, we arrested him on Monday,” Rathore added. Police let the accused complete his exam and later was not told the reason for his detention. “He was clueless but finally we told him that he was wanted in the rape case of his maternal aunt and was arrested,” he added. Police have registered a case under appropriate sections of IPC and IT Act against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-police-arrest-rape-accused-from-alwar-reet-centre/articleshow/86568605.cms||---
---||Lucknow||My nomination is a victory for the community: Sanjay Nishad||LUCKNOW: A day after being nominated as a member of the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Parishad, national president of the Nishad party, Dr Sanjay Nishad, said his nomination is also a victory for the Nishad community. Expressing gratitude to the media for amplifying the problems faced by the community that he represents, Nishad said there was no problem that could not be solved. On Saturday, the BJP had announced an alliance with the Nishad party for the 2022 state assembly elections and had assured the party that it would be given a “respectable” number of seats to contest. Nishad’s nomination as an MLC on Sunday came as another shot in the arm for the party. When asked about the status of the party’s demands for the welfare of Nishads he said that the paperwork was on. Speaking on the road ahead for the party, Nishad said the party would ensure BJP’s victory. Nishad had been bargaining hard for his party with the BJP leadership. He met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda at least four times since June to discuss his party’s prospects for the state assembly elections. He has been vocal about his political ambitions, be it the aspiration of being named as a contender to the post of deputy CM after the assembly elections – though he later backtracked after meeting CM Yogi Adiyanath and said that it was just a “message from the Nishad commuunity” – or that of bagging a Rajya Sabha seat. After his son and BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar, Praveen Nishad, did not find a place in the Union cabinet rejig in July, the party president had his hopes pinned on the state cabinet expansion. In UP, Nishads have been fighting for inclusion in the SC category under four generic castes – Majhwar, Gond, Shilpkar and Turaha. In April 2019, the Yogi government did issue the ‘majhwar’ certificate to Nishads in some of the districts but after the court stayed it, the government did not pursue the matter. The other demands of the party are restoring the rights of Nishads on ponds and water bodies in every gram sabha and withdrawal of cases against Nishads filed since 2015 in Agra, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur and Ghazipur in different protests and agitations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/my-nomination-is-a-victory-for-the-community-nishad/articleshow/86570383.cms||Neha Shukla

Apart from viral fever cases, several patients suffering from typhoid, very high fever, diarrhoea and vomiting are also making a beeline for JLNMCH. Sources at JLNMCH said the need for a special ward was felt following a sharp increase in cases of viral fever that also affect throat and lungs. “More than 100 viral fever patients have visited JLNMCH in the past 10 days. Private hospitals are also seeing a rise in such cases,” the sources added. JLNMCH medical superintendent Dr Asim Kumar Das said special ward for segregating the patients with viral fever has been set up at the hospital, including 30 beds at the paediatric intensive care unit. “Similarly, neonatal intensive care unit has also been readied to take special care of newborns contracting viral infections,” he added. “There is no need to panic from viral fever. We have ample infrastructure and resources at JLNMCH to treat the patients of every age. People should not also panic thinking about Covid-19 with the symptoms of viral fever. We are taking precautions under Covid-19 protocols to admit and treat patients,” Dr Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/special-ward-for-viral-fever-patients-at-bhagalpur-hospital/articleshow/86563253.cms||Kumar Rajesh

These and 14 other full-grown trees at the Abhishikta crossing were recently removed to facilitate the station construction. RVNL, implementing agency of the 32km New Garia-Airport project, will soon start compensatory plantation. TOI on September 7 had reported about residents’ protest against chopping of trees to ease the Metro deadlock. The development had been fresh trouble for the priority Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch of the Metro corridor. RVNL could not fell the 23 trees as residents had doubts about the survival of the transplanted trees. Over the last three weeks, RVNL officials held meetings with residents of Abhishikta housing complex, explaining that KMC had granted them permission to cut the trees in lieu of compensatory plantation. Finally, the nine trees were transplanted on the same side of the boulevard, 50m from the station site. Piling work for the two entry structures has started. A senior RVNL engineer said, “We will be planting 115 saplings on the western side of EM Bypass shortly. Assuming that the transplanted trees may wither, we will plant five times the trees sacrificed, according to forest department rules.” Much construction has been going on at the Avishikta crossing since RVNL finally got the site this February. Tracks have been laid along most of the 5km viaduct, except the 120m gap at Avishikta crossing that is now being filled up by constructing two piers. Work was stalled for nearly two years as the proposed Ruby flyover’s design overlapped with one of the piers. Just as RVNL was trying to make up for time lost, some residents of Abhishikta wrote to the state environment and forest departments that the trees lined up at the boulevard next to the service road shouldn’t be axed. Kavi Sukanta is one of the five stations along the priority section of the Metro line from New Garia to Airport that is veering towards completion so the New Garia (Kavi Subhas terminal) and Ruby (Hemanta Mukhopadhay) stretch can be thrown open. Among the five stations, construction of entry points of three — Kavi Subhash terminal (New Garia), Satyajit Ray and JN Nandy — are over. One of Kavi Sukanta’s four accesses is also complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rvnl-transplants-9-trees-removed-for-metro-work/articleshow/86567551.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Business||E-frauds from India halve in Q1||MUMBAI: Online fraud attempts originating from India almost halved in the first quarter of FY22 when compared with Q1FY21 even as they rose globally. According to TransUnion’s latest quarterly analysis, fraudsters in India are re-focusing their efforts from financial services to travel & leisure, online forums and logistics industries. The decline in fraud in India is being attributed to stronger fraud control measures being adopted by the financial services industry. Across industries, the rate of digital fraud attempts rose 16.5% globally when comparing Q1FY22 to Q1FY21. However, for transactions coming from India, the percentage of digital fraud attempts decreased at a rate of over 49% during the same period. Gaming and travel & leisure were the two most impacted industries globally for the suspected digital fraud attempt rate, rising 393% and 156% in the last year, respectively. For transactions originating in India when comparing these same periods, this rate rose 54% for gaming and nearly 270% for travel and leisure. The industries monitored worldwide include gambling, gaming, financial services, healthcare, insurance, retail and travel & leisure. The conclusions are based on intelligence from billions of transactions and more than 40,000 websites and apps with traffic coming from countries across the globe, including India. Global financial services online fraud attempt rates had risen 149% when comparing the first four months of calendar 2021 and the last four months of 2020. However, when comparing Q2 2021 and Q2 2020, the rate of suspected online financial services fraud attempts have still risen globally, but at a much lower rate of 18.8% globally. When comparing those two periods for transactions coming from India, that rate has declined by more than 15%. TransUnion measures the rate of suspected or risky digital transaction attempts based on those that TransUnion customers receiving TruValidate services have either denied or reviewed due to fraudulent indicators compared to all transactions it assessed for fraud. “It is quite common for fraudsters to shift their focus every few months from one industry to another,” said Shai Cohen, senior VP of global fraud solutions at TransUnion. “Fraudsters tend to seek out industries that may be seeing immense growth in transactions. This quarter, as countries began to open up more from their Covid lockdowns and travel and other leisure activities became more mainstream, fraudsters clearly made this industry a top target.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-frauds-from-india-halve-in-q1/articleshow/86566906.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Non-Covid hospital admissions rise to pre-pandemic level||KOLKATA: The numbers of non-Covid patients and surgeries have crawled back to the pre-pandemic level across most private hospitals in Kolkata. Since August, they have seen a sharp surge in both while the number of Covid admissions remained low and stable — below 50 on an average. The reason is a rush to get deferred surgeries and treatment done ahead of the possible third wave. At AMRI Hospitals, around 550 non-Covid patients are admitted across its three units at Mukundapur, Salt Lake and Dhakuria — the highest since March 2020. The number had dropped to less than 50 during the second wave last April-May, while the OPD had to be shut down. “Since August, our non-Covid patients have been spiralling sharply and has now reached the pre-pandemic level. In fact, the number of non-Covid admissions and the OPD footfall are rising every day,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. AMRI has been receiving around 22,000 OPD patients a month since August. “There’s a huge backlog of patients requiring surgeries, procedures and consultations that were deferred during the first and second waves,” said Barua. AMRI has 50 Covid patients across its three units now. Peerless Hospital has seen non-Covid admissions jump to 320 while the number of Covid patients is 23. Fifty surgeries have been done each day on an average this month, which is more than double that of the pre-pandemic period, said CEO Sudipta Mitra. “Since the pandemic, we have never had more than 300 non-Covid patients,” he said. OPD footfall, which had dropped to less than 200 after the second wave, has touched 550 a day at Peerless. “Before Covid, average footfall at our OPD was 700 since we received patients from Bangladesh, which has now stopped. Otherwise, OPD attendance would have reached the pre-pandemic level,” Mitra said. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), the number of non-Covid patients has swelled to 430 while the hospital has just 21 Covid patients. “We have seen a constant increase in non-Covid admissions over the last few weeks and it has reached its highest since the beginning of the pandemic,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. OPD footfalls are currently at 1,300 per day compared to 350-400 during the second wave. No bed is vacant at Belle Vue Clinic that has 20 Covid patients out of 200 admitted. “There’s still a huge backlog of non-Covid patients waiting for admission,” said CEO P Tondon. OPD footfall has reached 700 a day compared to less than 10 during and after the second wave. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, 280 non-Covid patients are admitted — the highest since the first wave. “We have just 19 Covid patients,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. The OPD footfall here has touched 1,000 a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/non-cov-hosp-admissions-rise-to-pre-pandemic-level/articleshow/86567462.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Congress alleged that, during a BJP party event in Dehradun on Sunday, Gautam targeted Rahul Gandhi, his father Rajiv Gandhi and grandmother Indira Gandhi by questioning their religion and religious beliefs. Congress claimed that the BJP leader also called Rahul a close associate of Pakistan. The videos that surfaced on social media generated strong reactions from Congress members, who also protested and burned effigies of Gautam in different districts of Uttarakhand on Monday. Congress leader and spokesperson Garima Dasuni made the police complaint and demanded that an FIR against Gautam be registered and a detailed probe into the matter be launched. “Such derogatory remarks have no place in politics. The BJP leader should apologise, and strict action must be taken against him,” Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal said. Dasauni told TOI, “In the complaint, I have asked for a thorough probe into the matter and the guilty persons be arrested. BJP calls itself a disciplined party, and so, Gautam should be immediately expelled for his comments against the Gandhi family.” Dasauni added that the sacrifices made by the Gandhi family for the country can never be forgotten. “It is shameful that BJP leaders have stooped to such a level,” Dasauni said. Meanwhile, SHO Kotwali police station, Ritesh Sah, told TOI, “We are probing as to where were the statements made. Once we verify the jurisdication, an FIR will be lodged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-files-police-complaint-against-bjp-state-in-charge-for-derogatory-remarks-against-rahul/articleshow/86563942.cms||Kautilya Singh

However, no incidents of damage to railway property were reported from any part of the East Central Railway (ECR). According to ECR chief security commissioner (CSC) and IG (RPF) S Mayank, the bandh supporters had stopped Patna-Gaya MEMU special (03353) at Jehanabad for a few minutes.

The private lender has also not followed RBI norms in relating to the composition of the board of directors. The RBI said that the action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and does not pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. After considering the bank’s reply to a show-cause notice, oral submissions made by senior executives and additional submissions made by the bank, the RBI concluded that the charge of contravention or norms and non-compliance with the directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of a monetary penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbl-bank-fined-rs-2cr-for-violating-rules/articleshow/86568091.cms||---

The borrowing projection for H2FY22 also factors in the requirements “for release of balance amount to states on account of back-to-back loan facility in-lieu of GST compensation during the year”, the government notification said. Despite the pressure of extra spending during the pandemic months, robust revenue collection is aiding the government to borrow less than it planned earlier, bond market players said.The notification also showed that of the total borrowing, about 25% will be through bonds of less than 10-year maturity, 28.4% through 10-year papers and the balance of nearly 47% through securities of 14 years and more. Given that a higher proportion of the borrowing is through the long-dated bonds, yields at the longer end of the curve would be steep, a bond dealer said. “The yield on 10-year bonds is expected to be stable and in the 6.05-6.25% range,” the dealer said. On Monday, the benchmark yield on the 10-year paper closed at 6.21% — marginally higher than Friday’s close at 6.19%, official data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-sticks-to-rs-5l-cr-h2-cap-for-borrowing-amount-may-dip/articleshow/86567744.cms||---

The increase in advance tax is seen as a reflection of rise in revenues. For the September 2020 quarter, HDFC had reported a net profit of Rs 2,870 crore. The profits were lower than the previous year on account of exceptional gains in Q2 of FY19 following dividend income from HDFC Bank and other subsidiaries and profit from sale of investment.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Downpour plunges homes into darkness||VISAKHAPATNAM: Power supply was hit in many coastal areas of the state due to the impact of cyclone Gulab. With hundreds of electric poles uprooted, and various feeders lines suffering major damage, many areas are still in darkness more than 20 hours after the passing of the cyclone. Preliminary estimates have put the cost of damages at over Rs 65 crore, with Srikakulam district suffering the maximum damage. Officials of Eastern Power Distribution Co Ltd said 186 teams have been deployed — 70 in Srikakulam, 44 in Vizianagaram, and 72 in Visakhapatnam — for restoration works. Around 70% of restoration works were completed by Monday evening. Of the 433 33/11 KV substations in north Andhra districts, 285 were affected by the cyclone of which 212 had been repaired by Monday evening. Around 222 out of 286 33KV feeders were affected in the three districts, out of which 157 feeders have been repaired. Around 10km of 33KV lines and 94 poles have been damaged. A senior EPDCL official said around 1,213 11KV feeders were damaged out of which 829 have been repaired within 12 hours, including around 673 in Visakhapatnam district. Around 598 11KV poles were damaged and 221 have been repaired, while 264 out of 899 LT poles damaged poles have been repaired, he said. Of the 67 affected mandals in the three districts, power has been restored in about 40 mandals, while restoration works have been completed in nearly 440 villages out of the 2,023 affected villages in north Andhra districts. Gulab revived the scary memories of cyclone Hudhud that devastated the port city on October 11, 2014. “Cyclone Hudhud hit the city during day time, whereas Gulab hit us in the night. Power is yet to be restored in our area though it’s nearly 20 hours since the cyclone passed,” N Ramya, a techie staying in PM Palem, said. Those living in the hill slope areas passed the night with fear as boulders fell at various places across the city. “Due to power disruption for hours together, we faced water problems. There is also disruption in milk supply while most vegetable shops and tiffin centres are closed. For people like us who depend on eateries to feed our hunger, it’s a big problem,” said Rema Roy, who works in a construction firm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/downpour-plunges-homes-into-darkness/articleshow/86564095.cms||Siva G

Top priority is being given to screening of suspected dengue, malaria and chikungunya cases. District collector J Nivas, after receiving complaints from patients about long queues at OP wards, has asked officials to arrange special wards to handle fever cases and set up additional counters. “We are committed to providing better treatment to fever patients. Right from primary health centres to district hospitals, each and every unit is equipped to provide quality treatment. Hospital superintendents have been directed to take measures to provide quick and timely treatment. I will monitor the hospitals through CCTV surveillance system,” Nivas said. Meanwhile, patients are complaining about denial of treatment for dengue fever under Aarogyasri scheme.  Corporate hospitals are charging around Rs 15,000 per day from inpatients, which is against the fee prescribed by the government. “Seasonal fever treatment has become costly. I paid a bill of Rs 2 lakh to treat dengue fever,” said K Nagaraju, a private employee from Machavaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/more-op-counters-as-seasonal-fever-cases-surge/articleshow/86564289.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Goa||Goa: Congress puts up a brave front, calls Luizinho Faleiro’s exit ‘blessing in disguise’||PANAJI: Congress put up a brave face after its former state party president Luizinho Faleiro resigned as an MLA on Monday, and even said Faleiro’s exit is a “blessing in disguise” for the party. All India Congress Committee desk in-charge for Goa, Dinesh Gundu Rao said that Faleiro’s resignation would infuse fresh energy into the Congress workers and challenge them to work harder for the coming elections. Though Faleiro’s resignation has dealt a severe blow to the morale of the party workers, senior Congress functionaries welcomed his decision, saying that the former Navelim MLA had lost touch with the voters. “I never thought that after benefiting from the party, and at this juncture, I did not expect a man of his stature to do such petty and selfish things,” said Rao who rushed to Goa on Monday as Congress went into damage control mode. Congress claimed that Faleiro had distanced himself from the party, failed to participate in agitations and party events and was working at the behest of the anti-Congress camp. “We had information that he had lost his touch with the people. We had actually surveyed and were reassessing what to do with the constituency because the zilla panchayat results were also bad and there was a lot of negative feedback against him in the constituency,” said Rao. Former Navelim MLA and minister Avertano Furtado is expected to join Congress in the coming days. “Sometimes these kind of events actually give us more energy. Now we have something to prove. I think this is a blessing in disguise,” said Rao. State party president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that Faleiro’s resignation was an unfortunate development for the party. “The message that has gone out is that Luizinho is trying to stop Congress from winning the elections. You cannot fool the people of Goa,” said Chodankar. Meanwhile, amidst speculation that he may go the TMC way, former Calangute MLA Agnelo Fernandes has been summoned to Delhi by the Congress high command on Tuesday. He is likely to meet senior leaders, including Rahul Gandhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-puts-up-a-brave-front-calls-faleiros-exit-blessing-in-disguise/articleshow/86568592.cms||---

As Rozina did not withdraw her candidature till 3pm, she was declared ‘elected’ to fill the vacancy caused in the death of Tanweer Akhtar,” returning officer-cum-Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told TOI. Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad (representing BJP), education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, rural development minister Shrawan Kumar, building construction minister Ashok Choudhary from JD(U), animal husbandry and fishery resources minister Mukesh Sahani (VIP) and several other NDA leaders were present in the Bihar Vidhan Sabha’s library hall where Nazish received the certificate. The byelection was necessitated following the death of JD(U) MLC Tanweer Akhtar on May 8 this year. The JD(U) fielded Akhtar’s widow Nazish for the seat. With Nazish’s election, the number of JD(U) MLCs in the 75-member legislative council increased to 23, eight more than its ally BJP, which has 15 members. Other NDA allies – the VIP and the HAM(S) have one member each in the state’s upper house. Among the Mahagathbandhan partners, RJD has five members, Congress three and CPI two. Sarvesh Kumar, who was elected from Darbhanga graduate constituency, is the only independent MLC. The other 24 seats, which are filled up through election by the members of local authorities, are vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rozina-elected-jdu-has-max-23-mlcs-now/articleshow/86563131.cms||Madan Kumar

The state is headed for polls early next year. Commenting on two-time chief minister Luizinho Faleiro quitting Congress, Sawant said that when Congress doesn’t have leaders at the national and state level, "how will MLAs continue in the party?" The CM said that Congress has no future and that’s the reason Faleiro, “who has become so big in Congress”, has to quit. “Other Congress MLAs should also quit, and if somebody wants to join Congress, it would be political suicide,” he said. “In the next six months, political tourism will start in Goa in a big way, and we are also welcoming it,” Sawant said. “Since 2017, it has become a habit for Congressmen in Goa to resign as MLAs and join other parties. Nobody wants to continue in a sinking ship,” Sawant said. When asked if senior Congress leader and former chief ministers Pratapsingh Rane and Ravi Naik are in touch with BJP to join the party, Sawant said that he “is not aware of it”. Recently, BJP’s election in-charge for Goa, Devendra Fadnavis met Rane, which raised eyebrows in political circles. Sawant also said that to boost tourism in the state, “we are welcoming domestic and international tourists to Goa”. He also said that the state government has already asked for permission to allow charter flights to Goa, and that soon “we will get the permission”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/political-tourism-has-begun-we-welcome-it-cm/articleshow/86568644.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED team waits at hospital as ex-Sena MP admits himself||MUMBAI: Drama unfolded at former Shiv Sena MP Anandrao Adsul’s home in Kandivli (East) on Monday when he complained of chest pain soon after Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials began questioning him in a Rs 98-crore money laundering case and got himself admitted to a private hospital. The team of ED officials has parked themselves in the hospital for Adsul’s health to improve to take him to the agency’s office for questioning. The ED suspects that Adsul is a beneficiary of misappropriated funds of City Co-operative bank and recently searched six premises linked to him in the case. Adsul is the chairman of the City Co-operative bank. The ED case is based on the Mumbai police FIR related to the City Co-operative Bank fraud, where Adsul is the complainant. However, ED investigation has found that Adsul received commission from borrowers for using his authority to sanction loans after inflating the value of mortgaged properties, causing losses to the bank. Adsul has been a five-time MP but lost in the 2019 general election. On Monday morning, a team of ED officials, along with CRPF security personnel, reached Adsul’s house at Ashok Nagar in Kandivli and asked him to accompany them to their office for further questioning. At this point, Adsul complained of chest pain and his family members called an ambulance. Two ED officials accompanied Adsul in the ambulance as he was taken to admitted to Lifeline Hospital in Goregaon (West). Senior ED officials asked two of their colleagues to stay put in the hospital till doctors conduct all tests and let them know if Adsul can be taken to the agency’s office for questioning. Earlier, a relative of Adsul had said that the ED started the investigation in the fraud case under political pressure to harass them. Adsul was one the petitioners in the Bombay high court in the fake caste certificate issue of Amravati MP Navnit Kaur Rana. Rana had defeated Adsul in the 2019 election from Amravati by around 37,000 votes. In June, the Bombay high court cancelled Rana’s caste certificate. She challenged the order in the Supreme Court which has stayed the high court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-team-waits-at-hospital-as-ex-sena-mp-admits-himself/articleshow/86568675.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||Common cold virus landing many kids in ICU across Pune: Doctors||PUNE: Paediatric intensivists across city hospitals are seeing a rise in children in need of intensive care following infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a type of seasonal common cold virus. More than Covid, RSV and dengue are currently keeping hospitals’ intensive care unit doctors on their toes. RSV is a common cold virus that affects children mainly under five years of age and does not have a specific therapy. “Last year there were hardly any RSV patients at our paediatric ICU. Even in 2019, we didn’t have as many cases as now. This year, in addition to dengue, we started seeing kids with RSV in the ICU from the last week of July and now, such cases are peaking,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s paediatric intensivist Sumant Patil. Surya Mother and Child Care superspeciality hospital’s chief paediatrician and neonatologist Sachin Shah said, “Since July, we have had nearly 50 admissions per month to the paediatric ICU due to respiratory infections. Quite a few test positive for RSV.” Outbreaks of respiratory infections are common during the monsoon. “But the awareness is higher this year due to increased testing facilities. PCR-based diagnostic modalities are available which — though costly — can be performed for diagnosis of influenza viruses and RSV,” Shah said. Bharati medical college and hospital has one of the biggest paediatric units in Pune. “We see 7-10 cases every day. About 25% of these kids with RSV need PICU care,” said hospital’s deputy medical director Jitendra Oswal. RSV causes inflammation of the respiratory system, collection of excessive mucoid secretions clogging tiny airways, causing inadequate oxygenation, breathing difficulties, and prolonged and very bad coughing. The kids become infected suffer from exhaustion and weakness as their feeding is significantly reduced. Their breathing becomes abnormal and fast due to inadequate oxygen intake, weakening them further and needing ICU care. Not every child clinically suspected undergoes a swab test for the confirmation of RSV. “We are treating 10-12 kids with confirmed RSV in our paediatric ICU every month,” Patil said. Kids who turn severe following RSV mainly need prolonged respiratory support in the form of oxygen therapy and high flow nasal cannula or CPAP support. “Besides, poor feeding leading to malnutrition, bacterial infections, long-lasting coughing episodes, hypoxia (low blood-oxygen levels) affecting the brain and other organs in the body, oxygen dependency even at home, long hospital /PICU stay are some of the other complications we are noticing in children with RSV,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/common-cold-virus-landing-many-kids-in-icu-doctors/articleshow/86566169.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||U’’khand govt to knock HC doors to raise daily number limit of Char Dham pilgrims||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government is planning to to approach the High Court court again to increase the cap on daily limit of devotees coming for Char Dham Yatra. The government’s plea is that due to the existing cap set by the court, many devotees are being forced to return without having a darshan of the dhams. In protest against the cap on number of pilgrims and limited issuance of e-pass, traders of Kedar Ghati kept their shutters down on Monday. Whereas, the locals of Uttarkashi district staged a protest at Tourism Development Office and district collectorate. The priests have already raised their demand to allow locals to Char Dham without e-pass. The HC has allowed 800 pilgrims daily for Kedarnath, 600 pilgrims for Gangotri, 400 for Yamunotri and 1,000 for Badrinath. On full capacity, 2,800 devotees can offer prayers in the four shrine on a given day. When contacted, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said that due to the daily limit on number of devotees visiting the revered shrine, a number of tourists were returning without going to Char Dham. “We are trying to repair all roads at the earliest and provide best possible facilities. We will soon make our request before the Court,” he added. Meanwhile, Brijesh Sati, the spokesman of of Char Dham mahapanchayat, said, “We have already written to CM Pushkar Singh Dhami and sought his intervence in the matter. We have also appealed that the compulsion of e-pass should be removed on the locals.” Through a Facebook post, former CM Harish Rawat said that the start of Char Dham yatra is a win of the people of the state. “However the state government is not mending its ways. Only half of the registered pilgrims are coming for the yatra. While the High Court wants to ensure that all Covid-19 protocols are followed, the state government is trying to discourage the yatra and it will directly hit the livelihood of people associated with the pilgrimage,” wrote the former CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-to-knock-hc-doors-to-raise-daily-number-limit-of-char-dham-pilgrims/articleshow/86563992.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Lucknow||Surplus sub-tropical fruits on mind, UP offers incentives to set up wine industry||Lucknow: To promote manufacture of wine in the state, senior officials of the excise department met the wine manufacturers association on Monday to discuss ways of establishing a wine industry in UP while taking a cue from the Nashik model of wine manufacturing. UP now boasts of surplus produce of sub-tropical fruits which are now increasingly being used in wine making. Nashik in Maharashtra has emerged as the centre of Indian wine production. UP, which has a policy for wine manufacturing, does not have a single unit so far. Additional chief secretary, excise, Sanjay Bhoosreddy told the association members about the various incentives given by the government to encourage wine manufacturing in the state. “Several sub-tropical fruits like mango, jamun, jackfruit, guava, grapes, litchi, amla and papaya are grown in UP and the huge quantities produced are not even fully utilised. A lot of the produce gets wasted due to lack of proper storage facilities for fruits,” Bhoosreddy added. “If wineries are set up here, then the industry will get a boost though incentives, farmers will get the right price for their produce and the state will earn revenue through sale of wine. All the fruits will also be used,” he said. Excise commissioner Senthil Pandiyan C said, “Under the one-district-one product scheme, the excise department will identify districts where fruit cultivation is high, and the produce is not used fully so that wineries can be established in such areas.” All India Wine Producers Association president Jagdish Holkar assured the UP government that he would apprise potential investors about the incentives being offered by the UP government for setting up wineries in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/surplus-sub-tropical-fruits-on-mind-up-offers-incentives-to-set-up-wine-industry/articleshow/86570423.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But whether the recent political slugfest that ensued over the completion will help to make the project operational remains a question and a challenge before the civic bodies. TimesViewThe Dravyavati beautification project that saw progress during the previous BJP government has come to a halt after the change of power in the state in 2018. Even three years after inauguration, the Rs 1,676-crore project is only partially open to the public though a majority of the work has been completed. Infrastructure projects should be completed on time without politics intervening for the benefit of the public.The Dravyavati beautification project that saw progress during the previous BJP government has come to a halt after the change of power in the state in 2018. Even three years after inauguration, the Rs 1,676-crore project is only partially open to the public though a majority of the work has been completed. Infrastructure projects should be completed on time without politics intervening for the benefit of the public. As project adds up to the list of public properties that remain non-functional due to the disinterest of Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), the condition continues to deteriorate. The issue came into focus after a recent visit by transport minister Pratap singh Khachariyawas. A senior official source, however, said till the time the state government clears the dues of the awarded firm, Tata Projects Limited, the deadlock will not be resolved. The source said, “There are three key issues. The government approximately has to clear Rs 200 crore of the firm. Moreover, as the JDA is not willing to take the possession of the project, the firm has expressed helplessness to continue the maintenance for long as the civic body is not releasing outstanding amount for maintenance.” Due to ongoing tussle over payment, the firm had reduced the manpower at the project drastically. As per the contract, the JDA will release the operation and maintenance costs once the project is completed and handed over to the user. However, the firm is stressing to take possession of the completed portion of the project. The JDA is asking to complete the project before releasing payment. But, it cannot be finished in absence of political will. “Work on the 450-metre stretch near Hassanpura cannot be initiated due to a court stay. No initiation were made to provide the land,” said source. According to the JDA, works including development of sewerage treatment plants (STP), parks, jogging and cycle track have been completed. Parks developed under the project are also under utilised as the firm close them after sun down to save electricity bills. “The firm claims it requires approximately Rs 40 crore to maintain three parks developed under the projects. As JDA is not taking the possession, it has also reduced upkeep to save costs,” added the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/politics-hurdle-to-completing-dravyavati-riverfront-project/articleshow/86568663.cms||---

The postal department has been asked to vacate the rented building where the post office has been for several decades now. Local residents have strongly opposed the closure of the post office and have demanded suitable space elsewhere in Landour to continue running it. “Father of renowned hunter turned conservationist Jim Corbett - Christopher William Corbett worked as a postmaster in Landour post office from early 1850s to 1862. The post office has been at its current location for over a hundred years,” local historian Gopal Bhardwaj said. In fact, when there were talks of closing the post office last year, renowned author Ruskin Bond had also expressed his displeasure.  “It is sad that authorities are proposing to shut down the post office at Landour, I have been using it since 1964. I have even written about one or two postmen in my stories,” the author had told TOI. On Monday, a large number of residents staged a protest outside the post office against its closure. They also purchased over a hundred postcards from the post office and wrote appeals to PM Narendra Modi.  “This post office provides important service not only to the residents of Landour, but also to people from the adjoining villages.

According to the planning department, the number of LPG consumers with subsidised connections in the state has gone up to 4,26,33,197. Out of these, 4,07,10,440 consumers (95.49%) have been linked to the digitised database. “No other state in the country has such a high percentage of LPG consumers with subsidy connections linked to digitized database,” the state government spokesperson said. “In 2014, UP had just 1.67 crore LPG consumers. As per planning department data, this number has increased to 4.26 crore in August 2021. Not only have the connections increased, even the LPG coverage area has grown,” the spokesperson added. “Even during Covid-19 crisis, the government provided gas connections to the poor and needy. Just this year, from February to August, the government linked 4.10 lakh beneficiaries with Ujjwala Yojana,” he said, adding that the state government aims to provide gas connections to 20 lakh more people under Ujjwala 2.0 scheme. “Till five years ago, people faced a lot of difficulties in getting an LPG connection and cylinders refilled. The situation has changed drastically, and the government is itself identifying beneficiaries for giving free LPG connections,” he said. Now, 18.34% of the total Ujjwala Yojana beneficiaries in the country are from UP, the spokesperson added. In the second phase of Ujjwala Yojana, a campaign has been launched in 10 districts — Sonbhadra, Banda, Mahoba, Chitrakoot, Rae Bareli, Hardoi, Badaun, Amethi, Fatehpur and Farrukhabad — to provide gas connections to the beneficiaries and link them with digital database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-now-has-largest-no-of-lpg-consumers-in-country/articleshow/86570441.cms||---

If the idol gets wait at this stage there is no wayit will dry up on time and we will surely miss the deadline.” Mahalaya is still more than a week away but there is a rainforecast for almost two to three days this week but that is not stopping theidol makers from working on the form and shape of the deity. “I have rented some space in a fellow idol maker’s studioand will be working there. Otherwise I will have to stop the work for the nextfew days when it rains,” said Sourabh Pal, another idol maker in Kumartuli. Kumartuli does not have a problem of waterlogging due to agood drainage system but since most establishments are very old, the roofs leakand walls get damp.

They asked him to ensure that their rehabilitation isn’t disturbed owing to the high court’s order directing the government to set up five stalls that operated prior to their July 1 demolition. The stalls were demolished as they came in the way of the highway expansion plan. Most of these were operating for years. “The plan will have to be revised to accommodate the five gaddas,” said Fernandes. Earlier in the morning, there was commotion owing to fruit and vegetable vendors who came to claim their old spots.

---||Delhi||Commuters in farm’s way as Bharat Bandh halts traffic in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Delhi-Meerut Expressway was out of bounds for 10 hours from 6am on Monday as hundreds of farmers laid siege to both the carriageways to mark Bharat Bandh. At UP Gate, the lanes leading to Delhi have remained blocked ever since the agitation began 10 months ago. On Monday, a group of 300-odd farmers placed barricades on the lanes exiting Delhi and blocked traffic till 4pm. Police officers in Delhi and Ghaziabad had both prepared a traffic diversion plan in the wake of Monday’s bandh. While vehicles coming from Delhi were diverted towards the Ghazipur mandi along the canal road, those headed for the capital were made to take the Kaushambi and Anand Vihar routes. But as the entire expressway traffic was diverted on to the arterial roads, snarls were witnessed inside Ghaziabad city as well. Areas such as Indirapuram, Dabur Chowk, Maharajpur and the EDM Mall junction witnessed snarls for as long as three hours. Delhi resident Rohit Singh, who had stayed the night at a friend’s place in Vasundhara, was stuck in a snarl for hours while getting back home. “I had to take the Kaushambi route, which was choked. It took me 45 minutes just to get into Delhi,” he said. Protests were also held at Duhai, Hapur Chungi and Modinagar. “Traffic from Hapur Chungi was diverted through Shastri Nagar, which is an arterial road. There were snarls throughout the day,” said Shivangi Mishra of Shastri Nagar. In Ghaziabad, 200 cops had been deployed at various junctions to manage diversions. “It was only in the latter half of the day that the congestion eased. But it was tough managing traffic during rush hours. We had deployed all our reserve forces on the city’s roads,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, SP (traffic). Inside Ghaziabad city, however, it was business as usual. Most shops and commercial establishments were open and people went about their work. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been leading the agitation at UP Gate since November last year, said the bandh was successful. “There were attempts to discredit the farmers' agitation. But the support we got from the common man is for everyone to see. The Bharat Bandh was successful across the country,” he added. In Greater Noida, hundreds of farmers on tractors and other vehicles moved towards the Zero Point and Pari Chowk. Stopped at the Jewar toll plaza, they occupied several lanes and stalled traffic. The blockade was, however, lifted soon. Snarls were also reported on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway for around two hours. At Pari Chowk, a group of farmers protested for over an hour before some of them headed towards the Yamuna Authority’s office to discuss problems related to enhanced compensation, plots and employment to local youths. Additional DCP (Greater Noida) Vishal Pandey said, “The farmers were stopped near Galgotias University and talks were held with them.” On the Delhi Noida Direct (DND) Flyway, the line of vehicles grew longer at the border as Delhi cops resorted to strict checking. As complaints poured in, traffic police officers in Noida urged their counterparts in Delhi to ease the checking a bit and allow vehicles. The snarls eased somewhat around 10.30am. Apart from the DME at Ghazipur, Delhi Police had blocked the Dhansa border and some internal roads leading to the Red Fort. At the Rajokri toll plaza, there were reports of snarls that stretched up to a kilometre around 10 am. GhazipurA central government employee travelling from Noida to near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium battled slow traffic on the DND. “I left home early today. But traffic was extremely slow on the DND. Police had been deployed in good numbers, but better traffic management could have eased the situation,” he said. Businessman Prashant Sonkar spent an hour on DND itself. The effect of the bandh on traffic was felt till the Akshardham temple. On Monday, Delhi Police had significantly increased check points across the city. Roads around the Red Fort were closed for traffic and the site fortified to prevent a repeat of the January 26 incident when farmers had climbed atop the Fort’s rampart. “Traffic movement was closed on Red Fort on both the carriageways Chhatta Rail and Subhash Marg are closed from both sides… Traffic movement is closed on Dhansa Border Both Carriageways (sic),” Delhi Police tweeted.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds life sentence in decade-old rape of 5-year-old||MUMBAI: Bombay high court held that a 35-year-old man convicted for raping a five-year-old girl deserves no leniency and upheld the life sentence awarded by a trial court in decade-old crime. “The victim was barely five years old and the appellant was over 35 at the time of the incident. The victim had suffered bleeding injury. She had innocently gone to his house on his inducement. We are not inclined to show leniency,’’ said the HC bench of Justice Sadhana Jadhav and Justice Sarang Kotwal, dismissing his appeal on September 22. The convicted man had appealed in 2014 against a July 2013 guilty verdict passed by the special judge (Atrocities Act) at Alibag. He was arrested for the crime in November 2010 and has since been in prison. He was also convicted under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act and sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment. Both sentences were to run concurrently. The trial court had directed him to arrange for rehabilitation of the child and directed the district special social welfare officer (Raigad-Alibag) to pay a compensation of Rs1.20 lakh to the victim’s mother. The HC, after hearing the man’s counsel, Niranjan Mundergi, advocate Rebecca Gonsalvez, appointed by court for the child’s mother, and additional public prosecutor S V Sonavane, said, “We have considered the injuries and trauma suffered by the victim. Therefore, there is no reason to reduce the sentence. Hence, we do not find merit in the matter.’’ The HC said the prosecution proved that the man has committed these offences of rape under Section 376(2)(f) of Indian Penal Code and under Section 3(1)(xii) of the Atrocities Act. The convict said the child’s father had tutored her while she gave her testimony and she admitted that she had said was what her father told her to. Sonavane said the case stands proved by the doctor’s evidence, which shows injuries on the child’s private parts, blood on the chair and articles in his house. The mother deposed that she had seen the man take away her child and the HC noted that blood on the chair and on a wedding card in his house was among the “most incriminating circumstance in this casse’’. But the blood grouping was inconclusive, the HC noted. The HC said “as rightly submitted by Gonsalves, the victim’s family had immediately approached police. Medical examination was conducted immediately and there was no scope for concoction of a story falsely implicating the appellant’’. The HC also said admissions of the child were inconsequential. “Even without referring to her deposition and her admissions about her father showing her the appellant, and father instructing her, there were other clinching circumstances,’’ said the HC, satisfied that the “prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt’’.

---||Lucknow||BSP national general secretary meets SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow; calls it a ‘courtesy call’||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary RS Kushwaha on Monday called on Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav at the party headquarters in Lucknow. The meeting, which was described as a “shishtatachar bhent” (courtesy call) may eventually end up in a major embarrassment for the BSP as sources did not rule out the possibility of him siding with the SP ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls. Samajwadi Party, though parried questions related to the meeting, the party’s national secretary and chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said SP has emerged as the only alternative to the ruling BJP. “Even BJP MLAs are in touch with the party leadership and many of them will formally join SP in the near future,” Chaudhary told TOI. Talking to reporters, Kushwaha admitted to have met the SP chief describing the meeting as a “courtesy call” but refused to divulge anything more. Sources said Kushwaha had come in direct contact with Akhilesh during his stint as state president of BSP in 2018 when the two parties entered into an alliance ahead of Lok Sabha polls. He has been in touch with the SP leadership ever since. A former MLA who has also been an MLC, Kushwaha hails from Lakhimpur and had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha polls against Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli. In 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BSP fielded Kushwaha against BJP’s sitting MP Ravindra Kushwaha. Putting up a good fight, he finished second with 38%votes. Sitting MP Ravindra polled 50% of the votes polled. The BSP national general secretary’s “shishtachar bhent” comes days after expelled BSP leaders Ramachal Rajbhar and Lalji Verma called on the SP national president describing it a “courtesy call”. Their meeting with Akhilesh was followed by reports that they were likely to join SP formally at a mega event probably in Ambedkarnagar in the second week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-natl-gen-secy-meets-sp-chief-calls-it-a-courtesy-call/articleshow/86570464.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, Tuesday and Wednesday may witness widespread rainfall across all the regions of Gujarat. Manorama Mohanty, the head of IMD Gujarat, said that the activity is the aftermath of Cyclone Gulab. “It has now taken the shape of deep depression, which will further weaken as it travels westwards,” she said. “Coupled with a shear zone over the state, the system will result in heavy rainfall in many parts of Gujarat.” IMD forecasts chances of heavy rain at isolated places in Valsad, Narmada, Bharuch, Surat, Dang, Tapi, Navsari, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad, Ahmedabad, Anand, Panchmahal, Dahod, Vadodara, Chhota Udepur, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Junagadh, and Gir-Somnath districts on Tuesday. Rajkot, Valsad, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Panchmahal, Dahod, Chhota Udepur, Bharuch, Surat, Navsari, Surendranagar, Gir-Somnath, Botad, and Kutch districts may receive such rain on Wednesday. An analysis of the rainfall pattern so far reveals that of the 701mm received till Monday morning, 339mm or 49% was in September alone. According to the IMD data, the rain deficit has reduced to 10% against the average rainfall till September 27. Saurashtra and Kutch have 4% excess rain, whereas the rest of Gujarat has 11% deficit —primarily due to the deficit in the eastern belt. On Monday, 165 of the 251 talukas received at least 1mm of rain; 21 talukas got over 50mm of rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gets-19mm-whiff-of-gulab-in-air/articleshow/86566251.cms||---

The average vaccination was 75,000 shots per day in August. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have been told to prepare ourselves for consistent supply of Covishield and Covaxin doses in October. With a possible allotment of 30 lakh, it will enable average vaccination of one lakh doses per day.” According to Deshmukh, the instruction from the state government is to exhaust the incoming doses at the earliest to get more stock. “We have managed to pick up speed in giving first dose, and over 70 lakh beneficiaries in the district have received them. But we have to pick up pace in administering the second dose, which will eventually offer protection from the contagion,” he said, adding that micro planning will remain the key for successful management of vaccination next month. Meanwhile, the Bajaj Group in collaboration with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) conducted a mega vaccination drive on Monday in the civic limits across 187 vaccination centres and slum areas. The Bajaj group provided one lakh doses to the PMC. On Monday, the district recorded vaccination of 90,000 beneficiaries till 7pm. Vikram Kumar, commissioner, PMC, said, “The initiative aims at administering Covid-19 vaccines to cover more citizens. The support will accelerate the PMC’s objective to cover 100% of the eligible citizens. This is truly a special initiative from the Bajaj Group of companies under corporate social responsibility (CSR).” Ajay Sathe, CSR head, Bajaj Finserv said, “The mega drive organised last month in rural Pune was a massive success and the drive administered more than 2.5 lakh doses across the district. Now, our target is to assist the authorities in vaccinating the urban population in Pune.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-aims-for-1-lakh-shots-per-day-in-october/articleshow/86566207.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Lucknow||Converting waste into a sustainable business option||Hardoi: Rajkishore Kashyap, 33, of Akbarpur village in Hardoi used to run a hardware shop which was well established and fetched him a moderate income which was sufficient to sustain his family comprising his wife and two children.However, he yearned to do something meaningful. He started a new journey when HCL Foundation reached the area with IGA (income generating activity). The Foundation stressed on the importance of self-help groups which could serve as a platform for development. Chhabi Kashyap, wife of Rajkishore, formed a self-help group with the help of other residents of her village and named it ‘Manthan Mahila Swayam Sahayata Samooh’. After receiving training and guidance from HCL Foundation, Rajkishore got the green signal to convert waste into a lucrative business option. Rajkishore wanted to make organic farming as the source of his livelihood. He closed down his shop and started dairy farming in 2019. Currently, he is managing 12 cows/buffaloes and gets around 30-40 litres of milk every day. He found that cow dung also has some commercial value. He understood the value of manure and engaged in vermicomposting to manage the excreta of animals. However, vermicomposting was a sensitive, costly and time consuming process. Meanwhile, FINISH Society started a project with the vision of ‘Clean Village’ and introduced an inoculum (a substance used for inoculation) waste decomposer (WD) to manage biodegradable solid waste by aerobic composting method. Use of WD was an experiment for him but seeing the good results within 30-35 days along with increasing the number of vermi pits and reducing the temperature of dung in a short span, he started production of organic manure by applying WD inoculums. Today, he is working as an entrepreneur and earns around Rs 20,000 per month. It was not easy to shift from a well-established business to organic farming as he did not have enough land for large-scale farming. He also didn’t have any expertise or experience in large scale farming, but his passion and motivation to bring about this change helped him succeed. He is managing 23 beds of organic waste managed by WD inoculums application. “After the intervention of FINISH Society, I adopted the method of aerobic composting by WD inoculums in which the process of composting became very easy, both in terms of cost and time requirement for quality manure production,” says Rajkishore. The project not only made the village cleaner but also brought about a change in the mindset of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/converting-waste-into-a-sustainable-business-option/articleshow/86556379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But the aspiring cricketers from poor families in the rural areas are all set to get a helping hand to achieve their dream of playing the game under floodlights. The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) has joined hands with Aditya Birla Capital to nurture the cricketers from rural areas of the state.  “The company will fund the expenses of the aspiring young cricketers and facilitate their training. The rural areas have a lot of talent that is yet to be tapped. This initiative has been taken to give opportunity to the players from remote areas,” said Shishir Hattangadi, BCA CEO who came up with the proposal of this project.  “The selected players will get the best of training and facilities apart from professional coaching. We will pick up players between the age of 15 and 17 years. This is a first-of-its-kind initiative in the state,” Hattangadi told TOI.  The BCA covers district areas in Patan, Mehsana, Navsari and Bilimora that fell under the erstwhile Baroda state. “BCA runs academies in Mehsana and Navsari and hires staff as well as coaches. But it used to cost us a lot. So, we have decided to give accreditation to the private academies in these districts and select their players for our tournaments,” said Sheetal Mehta, BCA vice-president.  “Aditya Birla Capital has committed Rs 50 lakh funds to the BCA that will be used for nurturing men and women cricketers from poor families in the rural areas. Sometimes they aren’t able to compete at the professional level due to lack of proper facilities. will cover their all expenses,” Mehta added. If the association succeeds in this project, the management will extend it next year too.  “The proposal has been sent to the BCA apex council for approval,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/aspiring-cricketers-to-get-a-helping-hand/articleshow/86564200.cms||---

The India meteorological department (IMD) has issued an alert for heavy rainfall exceeding 6.4cm at one or two places over Goa on Tuesday and Wednesday with a warning for fishermen not to venture out to sea. Panaji received 8mm of rainfall as of 5.30pm, on Monday. IMD had issued a warning for heavy to very heavy rainfall exceeding 11.5cm at isolated places in Goa for Monday.“There are chances of short intense spells of rainfall and wind speed of 40kmph in the coming days, depending on the intensity and location of the weather system,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. As the system moves north-westward, the wind speed may touch 60kmph off the coast over the sea. Fishermen have therefore been warned to avoid venturing into the sea along the Goa and Maharashtra coast on September 28 and 29. Cyclone Gulab had landfall over North Andhra Pradesh and South Odisha on Sunday, following which it has moved west-northwestward. It weakened into a deep depression on Monday and will continue to further weaken into a well marked low pressure area, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-issues-heavy-rainfall-warning-for-today-tomorrow/articleshow/86568863.cms||---
---||Lucknow||No advantage of being Brahmin, will work for all: UP minister Jitin Prasada||LUCKNOW: Jitin Prasada, the newly inducted minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, on Monday dismissed the narrative that his Brahmin identity gave any advantage to him after switching over to the BJP and said he would take along people from all sections of the society. Speaking exclusively to TOI, a day after being sworn in as a cabinet minister and nominated as an MLC, Prasada maintained that people like him, who are in public life, work for all sections of the society, irrespective of caste and community. “I’ve been doing so since the early days of my political career,” said Prasada, asserting that he was “unable to figure out” why the narrative of being a Brahmin leader (in BJP) was being given so much prominence. According to experts, Prasada’s observations are in sync with the BJP plank of not going overtly after the Brahmin community despite the aggressive upper caste outreach by the opposition ranks, especially the SP and the BSP. “As a minister in the BJP government, I will stand for the interest of the people whenever the situation demands...be it bringing development to any unaddressed region or resolving the issues related to social injustice,” said that the 48-year-old management post-graduate and an alumnus of the Sri Ram College of Commerce, New Delhi, and Doon School, Dehradun. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ was of prime importance to him and the party leadership. “Keeping that in mind I will work towards strengthening the hands of PM Modi, CM Yogi Adityanath and the party in Uttar Pradesh,” he said. Prasada was the only new inductee to be given the rank of a cabinet minister, a move that might silence BJP’s adversaries who claim that Brahmins are distancing themselves from the party. Of the remaining six inclusions, three were from the Most Backward Caste, two from SC and one from ST. The move is being seen as BJP’s attempt to bolster caste and regional equations in the run-up to the state assembly elections due early next year. The Congress turncoat and a former Union minister in the Congress-led UPA government, Jitin joined the BJP in June earlier this year after facing electoral setbacks in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections from his traditional Dhaurahra parliamentary seat and also in 2017 UP assembly elections while contesting from Tilhar in his home district of Shahjahanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-advantage-of-being-brahmin-will-work-for-all-prasada/articleshow/86570493.cms||Pankaj Shah

Kolvenkar, then Ponda block president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had wrested the post of the chairperson on May 18, by defeating his own party candidate Ritesh Naik, son of Ponda Congress MLA Ravi Naik. He had joined hands with five MGP backed and two Goa Forward Party backed councillors. Stating that they have no trust in Kolvenkar, seven of the 15 councillors, including deputy chairperson Virendra Dhavalikar, Ritesh Naik, Vishwanath Dalvi, Archana Dangui, Yatish Sawkar, William Aguiar and Anand Naik, have asked the director of municipal administration to convene a special meeting to discuss and vote on the motion. The notice has been served under Section 56 of Goa Municipalities Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-trust-move-against-ponda-chief/articleshow/86568739.cms||---

Till Monday, less than 3,000 people had applied to procure the lease deeds. An official said, “Since September 8, the civic body has received approximately 4,800 applications for all land related works including sub-division, reconstitution, lease deeds, name transfer and others. But application for lease deeds is fewer than expected. On Monday, out of 642 total applications, applicants for lease deeds were less than 200.” During the abhiyan, the (JDA) targets to issue approximately 3 lakh lease deeds to plot owners living in regularised and unauthorised colonies in its jurisdiction. This will comprise 30% of the overall target as the state government plans to issue 10 lakh lease deeds across the state. An official said, “People who want the lease deeds will come forward now as most of them are expecting that JDA will start accepting applications from October 2. Also, not many people who are living in colonies where JDA has constructed roads, sewerage and other infrastructure will come forward, till the time they have to sell their plots or take a loan.” According to estimates, out of 1,036 approved schemes developed on private land, the JDA plans to issue 50,396 lease deeds to plot owners. The civic body eyes to earn a target of Rs 54 crore after regularising these plots. Similarly, the authority plans to earn Rs 46 crore revenue after issuing 15,819 lease deeds to owners whose houses are situated in 142 unapproved colonies. After examining the list of 990 housing schemes approved by the housing co-operative societies in JDA region, it was learnt the lease deeds were not issued to 26,275 plot owners. The lease deeds to plot owners in the approved societies will be distributed from October 2 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lease-deeds-fail-to-generate-interest/articleshow/86568751.cms||---

(This pain has become like a mountain, it must melt; a Ganga must flow out of this Himalaya… My aim is not to just kick up a ruckus, the entire effort is to change the scenario). Quoting the revolutionary poetry of Dushyant Kumar, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched the deshbhakti curriculum for the children of Delhi government schools on the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh. “The idea envisioned two years ago has finally taken shape. The curriculum will create an environment for children where they feel a sense of patriotism 24x7,” said Kejriwal during the mega event at Chhatrasal Stadium where teachers and students holding the national flag swayed to patriotic songs. The CM said, “There could be no better day to launch the curriculum than the birth anniversary of Bhagat Singh. I’m sure all of you must have seen the movies made on his life. The feeling you went through after watching the movie is deshbhakti. The goosebumps and vibration you get when you see the Tricolour is deshbhakti. The feeling we get when we sing Jana Gana Mana is deshbhakti.” “The problem is that these feelings arise only sometimes. We want an environment that makes every child live with the feeling of deshbhakti every day. The child should grow in such a manner that everything he does should be for the country,” added Kejriwal. Singer Palash Sen, who performed at the event, insisted that both Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia sing and recite a poem. While Kejriwal recited Dushyant Kumar’s poetry, Sisodia quoted a poem written by Sen himself. Kejriwal said, “Deshbhakti is inborn in all of us, so we are just trying to ignite it through this curriculum. In our schools and colleges, we will now not just produce good engineers, doctors and professionals, but also deshbhakts. Such doctors will take care of people and not run after money.” Sisodia said the launch was delayed due to Covid-19. “It gives me immense happiness that the curriculum is being launched when India will be celebrating 75 years of Independence. This curriculum will not just talk about deshbhakti, but also ignite its spirit. We will not preach morals, but every child will reflect and discuss deshbhakti,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/patriotism-on-sleeves-and-in-curriculum/articleshow/86591619.cms||Shradha Chettri

A student of intermediate, Shahan took pole position after he lost first race due to overheating of the clutch but won the next two races by beating 11 drivers.

There are three races in each round and the driver with highest points after reaching podium position will be declared champion at the end of round four. In the first race on Sunday, the clutch of Shahan’s car got overheated due to which he finished seventh, however this helped him to start at second place in race two where the top eight from race one were set up in reverse order. It was a clean start this time and Shahan got into lead in lap one itself. It was then a straightforward race for Shahan as he secured his maiden victory in single-seater competition by over four seconds. He made the double in race three, where he started on the front row again and went into lead in lap one itself and finished over seven seconds ahead of the runner-up. “Having been away from racing for so long due to Covid-19 pandemic, it felt like first-time when the weekend kicked-off. It was a good run and I felt comfortable from the start itself. Except for race one where my clutch got overheated and I lost places in the start, it was a fantastic race for me as I secured my first single-seater pole and also took two wins from three races in the field of 12 racers,” said Shahan, the four-time Indian National Karting champion and winner of Asian championship 2016 held in Malaysia.

---||Mangaluru||Restart water adalats soon, Cong tells mayor||Mangaluru: With many residents getting extortionate bills, citizens have demanded that water adalats be held every month. Then mayor Divakar had decided in September last year that monthly water adalats will be held at Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) to solve bill-related grievances of consumers. However, water adalats were not held for nearly a year, said congress corporator Abdul Ravoof. However, mayor Premanand Shetty said water adalats will be held if required as officials have been solving excessive billing issues at their level. Ravoof told TOI that many domestic consumers have been receiving exorbitant bills to the tune of Rs 5,000 and above per month due to faulty meters and irregular readings. “Earlier, the monthly minimum tariff for 24,000 litres of water was Rs 65. Now, it is Rs 56 per month for 8,000 litres. Accordingly, people are forced to pay Rs 168 per month for 24,000 litres of water. An MCC council meeting, held in August, had resolved that a penalty should not be levied from consumers if the water meter is defective. It was also decided to increase the quantity of water to be supplied for a minimum slab from 8,000 litres to 10,000 litres. However, those decisions have not been implemented yet. People are forced to visit MCC with complaints of irregularities in water bills. Holding water adalats will help people find a solution to various issues,” Ravoof said. An MCC council meeting held in August 2020 had resolved to revise water tariff based on complaints from consumers. As per the proposed revision, the minimum charge should be Rs 60 for 10,000 litres per month. However, the resolution has not been approved by the government for implementation, he added. When contacted, mayor Premanand Shetty said MCC officials have been solving discrepancies and complaints related to water billing routinely without waiting for adalats. “We have been implementing the resolutions taken in the previous adalat and more adalats will be held if required. Though we have not held adalats of late, complaints are being addressed routinely through officials. I have been pursuing the matter personally with civic officials,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/restart-water-adalats-soon-cong-tells-mayor/articleshow/86566400.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid positive report, snag delay Pune-bound flight||PUNE: A last-minute “Covid positive” alert raised by an AirAsia passenger from Bengaluru to Pune, only to test negative later, and a subsequent technical snag led to a five-hour delay in the flight’s take-off on Monday morning . Airline sources said the flyer received her RT-PCR report while on board. The flight with 79 passengers, was scheduled to take off at 7.20am and reach Pune around 8.10am. An AirAsia spokesperson confirmed the development. “A guest onboard I5-1472 from Bengaluru to Pune received a message that her RT-PCR test was positive. The guest brought it to the notice of the crew. All guests were offloaded and the aircraft was cleaned as per laid down protocols,” the spokesperson said. An airline source said as per the travel regulations, those who are not fully vaccinated have to carry a negative RTP-CR report not older than 72 hours.  “Also, to travel back to Bengaluru, one needs the report even if they are fully vaccinated. She had gotten the test done as she was set to fly back to Bengaluru on Tuesday,” said the airline source. The flyer, when later tested at the Bengaluru airport, turned out to be negative, said a source. When the flight finally took off, the aircraft experienced a minor technical issue. The AirAsia spokesperson said the crew, after completing all actions, elected to return to Bengaluru. “The aircraft was then changed to facilitate travel. AirAsia India are addressing the failure before returning the aircraft for further service,” said the spokesperson. The flight finally landed at Pune at 1pm. The same aircraft was set to fly from Pune to Ranchi, but was consequently delayed by around five hours. The representative of a popular pathology lab in Pune said a variation in the RT-PCR report was not uncommon. “It depends mainly on the laboratory and their testing kits and sensitivity. It is not uncommon for someone to have a positive report and then a negative report or vice versa after a gap of one of two days,” the representative said. The representative further said that a research paper was published in Singapore highlighting the variation. “As part of research, 15 positive patients underwent RT-PCR tests for the next 25 days and researchers found that results varied after one or two days,” said the lab representative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-ve-report-snag-delay-pune-bound-flight/articleshow/86566349.cms||Joy Sengupta

As Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, Chandigarh Business Council and different traders’ and industrialists’ bodies did not give the call to support the Bharat Bandh, most shops in various markets were open. However, supply of milk, vegetables and fruits was affected as protesters did not allow trucks and other commercial vehicles to enter Chandigarh from Chandigarh-Zirakpur, Chandigarh-Mohali and Chandigarh-Mullanpur border. Even the presence of government and private staff in offices was low as those coming from Patiala, Zirakpur, Derabassi, Ambala and Ludhiana were not able to go to their respective offices. Suresh Singh, who works in an electric appliance shop in Sector 35 said it was business as usual. Mukesh Verma, an employee in a private firm, said many of his co-workers did not come to office as protesters did not allow them to to enter Chandigarh. Bus services were also affected as protesters did not allow Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) buses to enter Mohali and Zirakpur.

There have been several queries for bookings and other travel-related information, hoteliers said. In the last two decades, Munsyari has become a popular destination, especially for Bengali tourists. These tourists usually visit the hill station during the festive season in October, but had stopped coming due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic. “Munsyari has 52 lodges and hotels with a total capacity of 1,000 rooms and currently, more than 50 percent rooms are booked till the end of September,” a local hotelier Devendra Singh told TOI. He said that tourist inflow to the town had all but stopped due to the restriction on travel and hotels in the past few months.  “Finally, after 18 months, hoteliers of Munsyari are relieved as tourists have started visiting,” said president of Munsyari hotel association Puran Pande. “From October 3 to 15, we are 50 percent booked, and from October 16 onwards we have 75 percent bookings,” said Kumoun Mandal Vikas Nigam Tourist Rest House manager SD Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-a-18-month-lull-tourists-head-to-snow-laden-hills-of-munsyari/articleshow/86564170.cms||Prem Punetha

There were 3,942 registrations during physical OPDs while the remaining were through tele-consultation. There were 5,288 registrations in total, which was almost the same as those during tele-consultations. “Due to the farmers’ Bharat Bandh call, there were not many patients from Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. But over a few days, we expect the number to cross 6,000,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. As the registration counters opened, patients who had queued up an hour before were mostly masked. Waiting halls and holding areas were crowded but as patients’ names were called, there was social distancing inside doctors’ rooms. “The physical OPDs have been resumed after more than one and a half years and as doctors we are satisfied to see patients. Hopefully, if Covid appropriate behaviour is followed, we might return to normalcy,” said the director. The situation will be reviewed after two weeks and a final call will be taken on physical OPDs. On any day, PGI had been seeing more than 10,000 patients in OPDs daily during pre-Covid times. For resumption of physical OPDs, routine registration time was reduced from three hours to one hour and 45 minutes. “We had been trying to register online for a month. But now I have come here and it took me an hour to get registration. At least, I could consult the doctor the same day,” said Arzoo Chhabra, a city resident. Most people had been waiting for the OPDs to reopen as they were unable to afford private care. “I had been going to private clinics for my gall bladder stone problem but I was not confident about getting myself operated there. Today, I got my card made to consult the PGI surgeon. It took me more than an hour to see the doctor,” said Navdeep Sethi, a patient from Mohali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/day-1-of-pgi-opd-hit-by-bharat-bandh/articleshow/86566420.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Rajabai tower, Bombay HC building to be opened to public||MUMBAI: Two iconic structures in south Mumbai Rajabai Tower on Mumbai University’s campus and Bombay High Court building will be thrown open to tourists from next week. On World Tourism Day, the state government announced and signed MoUs to open these structures for guided heritage walks. Another Gothic structure on the university’s campus, Cowasji Jehangir Convocation Hall, will be part of the heritage walk. Since January, heritage walks have been organised inside the BMC building too. These walks will be organised on public holidays and on the second and fourth Saturdays every month. Tourists can book it on Book My Show for a nominal fee of Rs100, while foreigners can book it for Rs300. “The heritage walk on the campus will include the library, massive reading hall housed in Rajabai Tower and convocation hall. We plan to do it carefully, by taking precautions, with not more than 15 people in a group,” said university registrar Baliram Gaikwad. The proposal was floated by the state’s ministry of tourism in December and was a long-pending demand from Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena. The university will also explore internship opportunities for history and tourism students from their campus and affiliated colleges in these guided tours. The MoU was signed between Directorate of Tourism, the university, and Tourist Guide Association (TOGA). A large chunk of the fees collected will go to the association, which will be conducting these heritage walks, an official said. Both Gothic structures on the university’s campus were built in the 19th century and were designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The 85-metre tall Rajabai Tower was modeled on Big Ben, the clock tower in London. Arvind Ganacharya, historian, and a former HoD of university’s history department, said the architectural marvel depicted British imperialism and a lot of similar designs can be seen in structures in England too. A decade ago, the library was open for diplomats, said Ganacharya. The tower is part of the Victorian and Art Deco Ensemble of Mumbai, which was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in 2018. It was built in a fusion of Venetian and Gothic style. A multilingual website and a mobile app were launched by MTDC for bookings. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said Maharashtra has a huge tourism potential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rajabai-tower-bombay-hc-bldg-to-be-opened-to-public/articleshow/86568807.cms||Yogita Rao

Jain has pleaded that he may be arrested by the investigating officer without proper evidence, so he is seeking anticipatory bail. Like his earlier letter to the home department and senior police officials, in his bail application too, Jain has reiterated that he was innocent and was being framed. He alleged that it was a conspiracy hatched by bootlegger Alpesh Wadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi. Sources said that Jain’s bail application also mentions that because he did not succumb to Sindhi’s threats, the law student was made to lodge the FIR with legal assistance provided by Sindhi. It has also been pointed out that the investigation of the case is not being conducted fairly and Jain’s version should also be considered by police. According to sources, details of the alleged rape-survivor’s messages to Jain and her presence at Jain’s office on September 14 has also been stated. The bail plea will be taken up by the court for hearing on Wednesday. Jain, a prominent chartered accountant in the city, was booked along with Raju Bhatt, a trustee of Pavagadh temple, for raping a second-year law student after spiking her drink. The offence against the duo was lodged on September 19, but even after more than a week, police are yet to arrest the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ca-pleads-innocence-seeks-pre-arrest-bail/articleshow/86564266.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Monday, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “In view of the possibility of the PM's visit in the coming months of October and November, we are closely monitoring the ongoing projects. Though many agencies and departments have been engaged to execute the projects, the pace of work of flyovers, ROBs and road construction by UPBC and PWD has emerged as a cause of concern for us.” These two agencies are handling the ambitious Lehartara-Phulwaria-Central Jail road via Shivpur Chungi four-lane road project apart from other bridges, flyovers, ROBs and roads to ease congestion on roads. The DM said that the initial deadline for completing these projects was set by June and July end. “However, due to reasons like Covid-19 lockdown and beginning of monsoon, the deadlines for completing these projects were extended and the two agencies were asked to complete remaining work by the revised deadline,” he said, adding, “but these agencies did not increase resources including manpower to accelerate the pace of work.” “Thus, I will be inspecting all these projects on Tuesday to know the ground reality and the reasons why UPBC and PWD officials are avoiding to enhance resources,” he said, adding, “the officials concerned would also be asked to tell about their strategy for completing the remaining works of these projects by setting deadlines.” Following PM,s Varanasi visit on July 15, when he had gifted projects of Rs 1,593 crores, 117 projects of Rs 8,871.27 crores were in progress in Varanasi. Except a few projects, which are slated to be completed in 2022, the deadlines for completion of majority of projects had been set in from August till December end in view of the possibility of issuance of notification for the 2022 assembly polls any time after December. The DM said, “Work on bridge construction on river Varuna as a part of Lehartara-Phulwaria-Central Jail road via Shivpur chungi four-lane road project of Rs 34.65 crores is 82% complete. A ROB on 5C railway crossing gate of Rs 62.32 crores and a 4-special ROB of Rs 88.46 crores as a part of the same project were over 76% and 49% ready, respectively, when chief minister Yogi Adityanath had reviewed the progress on September 5. Four-lane road construction by PWD with an investment of Rs 166.14 crores as a part of this project is also 75% complete. “The bridge on river Varuna on Babatpur-Kapsethi-Bhadohi road of Rs 19.14 crores is over 76% complete. A ROB of Rs 38.10 crore on this road is also almost 79% complete,” said officials adding, “the bridge on river Varuna on Konia-Salarpur road of Rs 26.21 crores is over 90% complete.” The DM said that the work of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project being executed by PWD is in progress with the desired pace. But, its officials have been asked to ensure timely completion of road construction between Padao and Cantt railway station of Rs 18.66 crores and construction of ITI building at Mahgao (Sindhora).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/as-poll-code-looms-slow-pace-of-megaprojects-a-cause-of-worry-for-officials/articleshow/86568832.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Demand growth from overseas countries further aided the surge in exports. Being the largest producer of the spice, Gujarat accounts for 60-70% of its exports from India, said market players. The cumin exports from the country are estimated to be 2.99 lakh tonnes in 2020-21, which shows an increase of 40% over 2.14 lakh tonnes shipped in 2019-20, shows data compiled by the Spices Board India, union ministry of commerce and industry. In value terms, cumin exports rose 28% to Rs 4,253 crore in fiscal 2021 from Rs 3,328 crore in the previous financial year, the Spice Board data further shows. “Syria and Turkey are the closest rivals of India in cumin exports, and they together used to export some 40,000-50,000 tonnes of cumin annually. However, their exports have dwindled to the negligible level due to several reasons in past two years. Hence, India is virtually become the only supplier of cumin,” said Ashwin Nayak, founding chairman, Federation of Indian Spice Stakeholders (FISS). Apart from this, there was also a good demand from American, European and Latin American countries as well as China, which pushed up exports, said market players. “The demand in export is more than the local markets now,” added Nayak. According to the Spice Board, the estimated cumin production in Gujarat stood at 4.29 lakh tonnes in 2020-21, which showed a drop of 11% from 4.81 lakh tonnes produced in 2019-20. The crop in Rajasthan, other major producer of the spice in India, also declined to 4.25 lakh tonnes from 4.28 lakh tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cumin-exports-jump-40-in-fy21-on-good-demand/articleshow/86566472.cms||---

Interestingly, the bungalow is just 2km away from Ellisbridge police station. “He had come in contact with a local bootlegger who convinced him to keep liquor bottles at the bungalow as the owner used to come around only one a month. So, it was a safe place to stock liquor,” said a police officer. Later, Chauhan began buying liquor from the bootlegger and selling it in Ellisbridge and Navrangpura areas for a profit. Police seized 37 IMFL bottles worth Rs 18,610 from his possession and also confiscated his cellphone worth Rs 5,000 for further investigation.

---||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray writes to PM to rejig Mumbai-Hyderabad bullet train route||MUMBAI: In a marked change from its stilted attitude towards the country’s first bullet train line between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, the MVA government has proactively offered to cooperate on the Mumbai-Nagpur high-speed rail corridor (HSRC), requested the Centre to re-align the Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad high-speed corridor via Jalna-Nanded and proposed another one between Pune and Aurangabad. “MSRDC is of the view that the proposed Nagpur-Nasik-Mumbai high-speed rail corridor may be accommodated within RoW (right of way) of the Samruddhi Mahamarg for approximately 80% of its length,” CM Uddhav Thackeray has written to PM Narendra Modi. “It is felt that if Government of India (GOI) and Government of Maharashtra (GOM) collaborate along the Samruddhi Mahamarg, the execution of the Mumbai-Nashik-Nagpur HSR can be started at the earliest,” the letter said. The rail corridor was planned alongside the Mahamarg from inception, but the MVA government’s eagerness to go ahead with the plan is what stands out. The CM went on to suggest that since the Mumbai-Nagpur HSR will be within the Samruddhi Mahamarg ROW up to Jalna, it can be extended to Hyderabad. “If the same logic of accommodating the HSR within the RoW of an expressway, as is proposed between Nagpur and Mumbai, is applied, the Mumbai-Hyderabad HSR can be planned along the Mumbai-Nanded expressway via Jalna and further within the RoW of the proposed expressway between Nanded and Hyderabad,” Thackeray said in his two-page letter early this month. Thackeray also suggested an HSR route between Pune and Aurangabad. “It should be noted that Mumbai-Nagpur connects Mumbai-Nashik-Aurangabad. The Mumbai-Hyderabad alignment connects Mumbai to Pune on HSR route. Maharashtra has planned a semi-HSR between Pune and Nashik. HSR connectivity between Pune and Aurangabad will complete a quadrilateral in the most important industrial corridor. The Pune-Nashik-Aurangabad triangle is already an anchor of auto industry in the state,” he said further in his two-page letter. However, on Monday, officials of the National High-Speed Rail Corporation told villagers in Thane district that feasibility for a proposed Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad project is being studied. A total of 1,200 hectares will be required in Thane district. The 649.76km route, if given the nod, will have 11 stations and cut travel time to Hyderabad from 14 hours to three hours, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-writes-to-pm-to-rejig-mum-hyd-bullet-train-route/articleshow/86570645.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

It is the first time an IIT-B professor has bagged the SSB prize 2021 for medical sciences. It was awarded to 11 Indian scientists. Srivastava, also HoD, is known for translational research in bioelectronics and affordable point-of-care diagnostic technologies for rural and maternal healthcare. He and his team commercialised four devices, including a bluetooth-integrated glucometer for diabetes management and a routine urine analysis system. Healthcare technologies transferred by his lab include a low-cost portable device to diagnose kidney disorders. His lab has filed 125 US and Indian patents, and many have been approved. “For most devices we developed, we brought down pricing to at least one-third or one-fifth of the price of similar products in the market. There is a lot of scope in medical sciences where engineers can make a difference,” said Srivastava. His association with Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and other panels has allowed him to see the entire ecosystem from a bird’s eyeview. He is now working on technologies for rapid detection tests for thyroid, cardiac biomarkers. Ghosh, from TIFR’s School of Mathematics, specialises in ergodic theory, which is a mathematical study of complex, chaotic systems (such as behaviour of molecules in a gas). “Ergodic theory has deep connections with the study of numbers. These connections arise via groups of symmetries, called Lie groups, named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie,” he explained. Recently, he used ergodic theory and Lie groups to study properties of quadratic forms. Though his work is in pure mathematics, possible applications will be evident in the long term. “The prize came as a great encouragement,” said Ghosh. During college (St Xavier’s), he took advanced classes and a summer programme at TIFR, which got him hooked onto mathematics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-tifr-profs-among-11-to-win-bhatnagar-prize/articleshow/86568899.cms||Yogita Rao

The state also informed that the people are no longer in possession of the shops.Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice M Duraiswamy directed the authorities to file an affidavit in this regard and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.The court was hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by V P Ammavasai, an elected representative of the Usilampatti panchayat union challenging the resolution passed by Ranjani Sudanthiram, chairperson of the union who had transferred the licence of few shops illegally, without conducting any auction.During the previous hearing, the court took a serious view and observed that it is not clear on what basis such name transfer is done especially when the local bodies in various litigations have taken a consistent stand that licence or lease is not transferable to third parties. However, curiously enough the chairperson has abused her position and transferred the shops in favour of third parties by resolution.The court held that the name transfer of the shops was illegal and without proper jurisdiction. In order to ensure the transparency is maintained and the assets of the panchayat union are preserved, the court stayed all further proceedings on resolution passed by the chairperson until further orders. The court also directed the authorities to lock and seal the shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shops-given-to-people-without-auction-sealed-state-tells-hc/articleshow/86566492.cms||---

The state added 2,432 cases, the lowest in 231 days since February 8 (2,216), and 32 deaths. Mumbai also reported 376 cases, below the 400 cases being reported for five days. With this, the total cases rose to 65.4 lakh and the deaths stood at 1,38,902. Mumbai’s cases touched 7.4 lakh and deaths recorded were 16,091. “We conducted 30,692 tests in the city and the daily test positivity is 1.2%,” said Suresh Kakani, BMC additional municipal commissioner. Kakani said more tests would be conducted on weekdays as the BMC has begun testing 20 high-risk contacts of every positive patient. The number of people in quarantine has hence ballooned to 70,739—up from 31,521 on August 22. The city’s other Covid parameters continued to dip though, with 323 critical patients and merely 23% of the 2,206 Covid ICU beds in the city occupied. The total occupancy of Covid beds has dropped below 10%. “We have adequate infrastructure in terms of beds, oxygen and medicines. Even the jumbo centre at Kanjurmarg is almost ready, but we don’t want to commission it until there is a need for beds,” he added. Meanwhile, due to reconciliation and deletion of duplicate entries, the cumulative cases dropped by 4,995 and the discharges dipped by 4,674. Active cases dipped to 37,043, of which 5,053 were in Mumbai. State government officials said cases in the state have plateaued and are on the decline. With the state government opening up more sectors, it will be important to conduct more tests and continue to vaccinate more and more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-2-4k-state-adds-fewest-cases-since-feb-city-less-than-400-after-five-days/articleshow/86564368.cms||---

The bench of Justice Ramesh Chandra Khulbe said that it will now hear the case on Wednesday. As reported by TOI earlier, the owners of the Max Corporate Services had approached the court in August challenging the addition of section 467 of the IPC (forgery of valuable security, will) to the original FIR. The owners have argued in HC that the section 467 was added by the police only with an intention to secure their arrest as none of the earlier charges involved punishment of more than seven years and therefore shielded them from arrest. “It was only because of this section that a warrant was issued. We told the court that the section is not warranted since no offence has been committed that invites the provisions of section 467. We filed an amendment application seeking removal of this section from the FIR and the court agreed to hear the application. The case will now be heard on Wednesday,” said Suhail Ahmed Siddiqui, counsel appearing for Mallika and Sharat Pant. As reported by TOI earlier, after the section was added to the FIR, the police moved to a lower court in Haridwar seeking arrest of Sharat and Mallika Pant as well as Navtej Nalwa of Nalwa laboratories who was also named in the report. The court issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused on August 29 but all of them have been absconding since then. The HC had earlier given relief to the Pants when they had challenged the original FIR directing the investigating officer to only proceed with the arrest of the couple if the conditions of the CrPC are satisfied and not on ipse dixit (unproven statement).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-testing-scam-hc-accepts-plea-challenging-addition-of-another-section-in-fir/articleshow/86564306.cms||Prashant Jha

The SHRC also said that the government can recover the money from the SI, and to initiate disciplinary action against him, in accordance with law.SHRC made the recommendations on a petition filed by V Suresh, S Ganesan and M Mariselvam, residents of Sivakalai Parambu village who complained about the abuse and assault by Rennis, the SI of the Eral police station.According to the complainants, nearly 500 families belonging to devendrakula vellalar community are residing in the village. On September 11, 2019, at around 10.30pm a group of youngsters gathered at a building in the village and were speaking to themselves. A team of police officials including SI Rennis who was in an inebriated condition came to the spot and abused the youngsters by using their caste name and also slapped and kicked the complainants. When the villagers questioned his act, Rennis allegedly threatened to foist a false case.In his counter affidavit, Rennis denied all the allegations against him. He stated that he along with a team had gone to the village to arrest a man in connection with a criminal case. Some youngsters were sitting in the middle of the road in a drunken mood in order to prevent the arrest of the man. He stated that he attempted to pacify the people and never assaulted or abused anyone.Taking into account the submissions, SHRC member D Jayachandran said that the Tuticorin superintendent of police (SP) submitted a report stating that the allegations against the SI were found to be true based on the inquiry conducted by the Srivaikuntam deputy superintendent of police (DSP). The DSP in his report to the SP had categorically stated that the SI behaved in an indecent manner and abused the youngsters and also failed to maintain the dignity of the police.Holding that the SI had acted in an indecent manner and violated the human rights of the complainants, the commission recommended the compensation within a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pay-relief-to-three-men-abused-by-si-shrc/articleshow/86566557.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Two Patels: A picture in contrast||GANDHINAGAR: With the recent change in guard ushering in many first-time MLAs to the government, including CM Bhupendra Patel, the old timers led by ex-deputy chief minister Nitin Patel took on the task of countering the opposition onslaught on the first day of the monsoon session of the Gujarat assembly on Monday. Apart from speaking briefly during a condolence motion, chief minister Bhupendra Patel preferred to remain silent throughout the proceedings. Congress MLAs took part in the entire question hour and condolence motion, and looked to corner the government over its handling of the pandemic and compensation to those who suffered losses during the recent cyclone.  However, the Congress MLAs staged a walkout from the house in the afternoon session, over their demand for more financial assistance to families who lost members to Covid-19. The opposition MLAs returned to the house after a brief period. Government spokespersons Rajendra Trivedi and Jitu Vaghani took up the task of responding to most questions during question hour, even as new CM Bhupendra Pratel refused to be drawn into heated arguments with the opposition. Expectedly, ex-chief minister Vijay Rupani and other ministers who were dropped, preferred to remain silent and did not get involved in discussions, especially during question hour. Rupani was accorded a seat in the front row and was seen engrossed in his mobile phone during the discussions. Speaker Nima Acharya thought Rupani wanted to speak and invited him to speak, but he responded saying he did not have any question. Most of the dropped ministers of the Rupani cabinet also were seen engrossed in their mobile phones during discussions. Not so with former deputy CM Nitin Patel, who was seen defending the government on multiple occasions. He even raised a point of order to counter the Congress’ allegations. Patel’s supporters called it a sporting gesture while his detractors claimed he wanted to stay in the public gaze. Nima Acharaya first woman to be elected speaker: Senior BJP MLA from Kutch district, Nima Acharaya, was formally elected as the first woman speaker of the Gujarat assembly. The BJP proposed her name and the Congress supported her nomination. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel proposed her name for the speaker’s post and leader of oppositionParesh Dhanani gave his consent on behalf of the Congress, which has 65 MLAs in the182-member House. “For the first time after the formation of Gujarat in 1960, the state assembly has a woman speaker. I congratulate her on behalf of the entire house,” the CM said. State awaiting cyclone relief funds from Centre: In reply to a question in the monsoon session of the state assembly, the government informed that it is awating a sum of over Rs 11,500 crore as cyclone relief from the central government. Siddhpur MLA Chandanj Thakor asked a question, seeking details of funds sought from the central government as relief for natural disasters in the past two years. The government, in a written reply, said that after cyclone Tauktae, the state government sought a sum of Rs 2,448.83 crore under SRDF norms and another Rs 9,102.83 crore as special assistance. The government, in a written reply, said it is awaiting a response from the Union government. In reply to another question by Chotila MLA Ritvik Makwana the state government informed that the central government had announced an immediate assistance of Rs 1,000 crore after the Tauktae cyclone, which was received on May 20, 2021. Hansalpur’s lithium battery plat at trial production stage: The Gujarat government informed in the ongoing monsoon session of the assembly that at present, trial production is being undertaken at the lithium battery manufacturing plant at Hansalpur – a joint venture between Suzuki Motors Corporation, Denso and Toshiba Corporation. Siddhpur MLA Chandanji Thakor sought to know at what stage is production at the Hansalpur factory and what sops have been offered to the companies. In a written reply, the government stated that as of August 31, 2021, trial production has begun at the factory. In 2017, Suzuki Motors formed a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso to invest Rs 1,250 crore to build a factory in Hansalpur, Gujarat, to assemble Lithium-ion battery packs. Subsequently, the three companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Gujarat government to invest a sum of over Rs 4,900 crore to manufacture 30 million lithium cells a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-patels-a-picture-in-contrast/articleshow/86566884.cms||---

A resident of Ulhasnagar, the 27-year-old woman said that she was a cash courier working for an Ulhasnagar-based smuggling cartel. DRI had received a tip-off about her arrival at Varanasi airport. “Clad in jeans and top, the woman reached for a security check with her heavy luggage and was detained by DRI sleuths. Her trolley bag had foreign currency worth Rs 25 lakh — 246 notes of 500 denomination Riyals and 600 Dirham,” said a DRI source. The accused was presented before a magistrate after she was arrested. “Prima facie, the woman was smuggling the cash for the first time as she wanted to earn quick money. She comes from a middle-class family. Further interrogation will be done to find out the persons behind this money laundering,” said a DRI sleuth on Monday. In August 2019, air intelligence unit had intercepted an Indian couple, flying to Bangkok, with undeclared foreign currency worth Rs 1 crore at Mumbai airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-woman-held-for-smuggling-foreign-notes/articleshow/86568935.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Expert talks about immune response of plants||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: On Monday, the foundation day of IISER Mohali, a keynote lecture on “How do plants ward off pathogens?” was delivered by Prof Ramesh Sonti at IISER Tirupati. The professor and his group have been studying how plants mount immune responses and how microbial pathogens modulate host innate immunity using the interaction between rice and the bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzaepv, oryzae (Xoo), which causes a serious rice disease. By understanding the population structure of Xoo, they have identified rice resistance genes that are effective against Xoo strains in India. Three of these resistance genes have been pyramided into a commercially important rice cultivar, which is now resistant to Xoo and is in commercial cultivation in farmers’ fields in our country. The team of researchers had developed an improved rice variety which was resistant to the bacterial blight which is commonly found in Punjab. “We developed resistance genes which are a fine layer of the plant immune system. This work was in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Rice Research. With that institute, we set out to understand genetic divide diversity of pathogens in India. We collected bacteria from different parts of India. Three resistance genes were found to be effective against Indian strains of Xoo which were introduced into Samba mahsuri--a rice variety-- and we came up with these high-yielding blight resistance varieties,” said Prof Ramesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/expert-talks-about-immune-response-of-plants/articleshow/86566605.cms||Shimona Kanwar

About 10-15 % of the waste dumped into the ocean near Kodi sea walk is medical waste. The volunteers have completed 104 weeks of beach clean-up and there seems to be no signs of reduction in the quantity of waste. Every Sunday, about 30 volunteers collect 20 bags of trash from a 100 meter stretch near the estuary. The plastic waste collected is about 10kg and glass waste is about 20kg in each bag. Bharath Bangera, volunteer, Clean Kundapura Project told TOI, “We have been collecting all kinds of medical waste — used syringes, medicine bottles, IV infusion bottles, medical tubing and so on. This constitutes 10-15% of what that we collect every week. We have been observing a rise in the quantity of medical waste collected in recent days,” he said. The volunteers suspect that a hospital may be dumping its waste into a river that is getting accumulated at Panchagangavali river, flowing through Kundapur and Gangolli. “Tracing the source of the waste is a challenge because waste gets accumulated at Panchagangavali river, a confluence of five rivers. The Sowparnika, Varahi, Kedaka, Chakra and Kubja rivers join and merge with the Arabian sea. If it was just a single river, we could have taken up a campaign to trace the source. One of the main reasons for waste landing in the oceans is that many local bodies including panchayats have not yet put in place a robust solid and liquid resource management (SLRM). Many of them have issues with land, vehicles and labour. Until 100% of the houses and business establishments are brought under the waste management system of the local bodies, the problem will continue to exist,” explained Bharath. Trash bins necessary In recent years, the garbage bins on the road have disappeared and hence on most roads leading to the city, trash is visible. “We must understand that waste from the roadside goes into a stream, joins a river and then gets accumulated in the ocean. We must note that the sea starts at home. We need permanent solutions so that the waste is not disposed of into the river and as a first step the roadside bins must be restored especially on highways with regular waste collection,” said Bharath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kundapur-beach-weekly-clean-up-drive-throws-up-10-15-biomedical-waste/articleshow/86566699.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Madurai||Madurai to be developed as hub to tap tourism in region: Collector||Madurai: Efforts would be taken to tap Madurai’s tourism potential and make it the hub for neighbouring districts too, as the district has 10 times more potential as a tourist destination than what has been showcased so far, district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar has said.Speaking at the World Tourism Day event organised by the Travel Club of Madurai in association with department of tourism, Tamil Nadu and ministry of tourism, India, South India Hotels and Restaurants Association and Archaeological Survey of India, here on Monday, the collector said that he expects Madurai to open up once 70 to 75% of its population is fully vaccinated. As of now only 55% of the population had received the first dose.Expressing confidence that the tourism industry would bounce back in the next few years, Sekhar said, “Tourism has to be seen as the entire region, including the neighbouring districts of Ramanthapuram which could provide the seafront and Kodaikanal among others which could be reached in a hour or two from Madurai.”Hence, Madurai could be considered the anchor in a hub and spoke model for developing tourism in the entire region through proper measures, he said. People who visit a place like to experience the entire region at leisure so providing this facility should be explored, he said.“Heritage and spiritual tourism should be clubbed together. Even the potential of architectural marvel of the temples has not been tapped fully,” he said. There were many unknown treasures like the Kudaladampatti falls in the region that needed to be showcased.The collector said that the tourism advisory committee would be revived as requested by the club. Possibilities of a district-level tourism promotion council, which could be a body with an institutional mechanism with proper management to promote tourism in the region would also be explored, he said. People’s participation was a must for maintaining the sites and promoting them through proper roadshows, he added. This is where a district-level council which would be a more flexible body would help.He said that though the smart city programme in Madurai was being criticised a lot, he was sure that on completion it would help decongest the traffic around the main Madurai city area. It would also help showcase heritage sites like the Rayar Gopuram and Pudhumandapam which were now concealed under commercial activities.Superintending archaeologist, ASI, Trichy circle, Dr T Arun Raj, said that a brochure on heritage tourism circuit in Madurai would go a long way in showcasing the ancient Jain caves which belonged to the Sangam-era like the Keeladi site.There are 39 Jain caves in state of which 29 are in the Madurai region and 21 in city area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-to-be-developed-as-hub-to-tap-tourism-in-region-collector/articleshow/86566607.cms||---

The accused has been identified as Suraj (28), a resident of Uttam Nagar who had graduated from Delhi University. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said he was nabbed during area patrolling in Moti Nagar. “During patrolling, a team saw a suspicious person on a Scooty. He was intercepted and it was found that the two-wheeler was stolen from Kirti Nagar,” the official said. Suraj was arrested and a countrymade pistol with a live cartridge was seized from him. According to the DCP, he was involved in snatching cases and also committed a robbery of 2.5kg gold in north Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi area. “Suraj confessed that he was involved in over 100 snatching cases in different parts of the city, mostly in the west, outer, central and the north,” an official added. Police have recovered 55 mobile phones and four two-wheelers following his information. Another official said the accused was known as a bad character at Ranhola police station. “He graduated from Aurobindo College, University of Delhi. He is also a good singer and a former contestant of a TV reality show. He was among the top 50 contestants in its fourth season,” the official said. But ever since participating in it, Suraj needed money to maintain his lifestyle, police said. It is not the first time that Delhi Police has arrested him. In 2014, Suraj was arrested in west Delhi after breaking into a mobile phone store and decamping with 32 high-end devices. In 2017, he led a gang and got involved in vehicle thefts. The gang members used to attack at least three-four people every day to fund their lifestyle. Suraj would spray pepper solution on the faces of the victims and hold them at gunpoint during the snatchings/robberies. In one such incident, Suraj and his friends had held a man, Deepak, at gunpoint near Ranhola and snatched his wallet, gold chain and mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/national-level-taekwondo-champ-a-singer-and-a-serial-snatcher/articleshow/86568955.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Classes 1 to 5 reopen in Rajasthan, parents divided over sending kids to school||JAIPUR: Classes I to 5 reopened on Monday but most parents have refused to send their children to school. Many schools haven’t reopened elementary classes because of the ongoing half-yearly examination. Few parents, however, have taken the risk of sending their kids to school after looking at the declining academic graph through online classes. Parents cite their reasons for sending to school or keeping them at home: ‘Education standard suffering, classroom teaching better’ Parents of Honey Sharma, a student of class V, sent him to school on Monday when it reopened after 18 months for the first time. Kedar Sharma, Honey’s father said that the lockdown has severely impacted the education standard of his child. “I have decided to send my child to school as it is necessary for overall development of children. We were waiting for schools to reopen because young students have difficulty understanding lessons properly through online classes. We have to be careful about what website they have opened or if they are actually studying in online classes. Classroom teaching is better this way,” said Sharma. Most of the videos sent by the school didn’t help the children because small children have lower attention span. Most parents are worried that without vaccination, it will be difficult to send their children to school. But Sharma said that children are anyway going to parks, neighbourhood and social gatherings, then why not school? If the third wave strikes, he will discontinue sending him to school, but feels that at present there is no harm. ‘Cannot risk it with third wave of Covid lurking’Parents of Garima Arora, a class III student, have refused to send her to school for another three months, looking at the possibility of the third Covid wave. Pragya Arora, Garima’s mother, said that it is not possible to even think about sending such young children to school when the threat of Covid is still looming. “I cannot send my child to school when kids are not even vaccinated. All the consent forms from school have mentioned that the responsibility of the child will be ours. Without our supervision in school and them being with other children, we cannot prevent what they are touching or whether they are wearing their mask properly. It is better not to send them,” said Arora. She accepted the fact that education of students is suffering through online classes, but feels that the risk is high and so it is not possible to send them to school. She further said that they will send their daughter for extra classes or home-school them after online classes, but it is not possible to send her to school in the present scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/classes-1-to-5-reopen-parents-divided-over-sending-kids-to-school/articleshow/86568938.cms||---

Vishal Thanki, a businessman from Porbandar, was referred to Rajkot hospital on May 7 when his oxygen saturation plummeted to 60%. The CT scan revealed 100% involvement of lungs, making it a tough case for the doctors to treat. Of the 144 days, Thanki remained on life-support for nearly 90 days. Dr. Tejas Motivaras, one of the doctors who treated Thanki said, “The patient had developed other complications like pneumothorax in both his lungs which is a grievous sign. He had multiple infections in the intestine. His body started responding to the ventilator after 60 days, which is quite a long period. This is one of the rare cases where a patient came out of the ventilator after 90 days.” The doctors suggested transferring the patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) , a machine that provides artificial heart and lung and allows the patient’s heart and lungs to rest. This is widely considered to be the last resort when ventilators also don’t help improve a patient's condition. According to doctors, Thanki was the ideal candidate for shifting on ECMO but his relatives did not give consent and asked the hospital to treat him on ventilator support only. After 90 days, doctors initiated a rehabilitation program that included exercises and other therapies. In the first 60 days, they gave him every medicine and treatment prescribed in books to treat a Covid-19 patient. Thanki was weaned off medication once only a rehabilitation program was required. The patient’s latest CT scan suggests that his lung is still 60% infected. Currently, he can walk with the support of a stick only. He is on one litre oxygen because of weak lungs. Doctors expect that within three to four months, his lungs will heal up to 75% but remaining part of the lungs have been permanently damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/porbandar-man-slays-covid-19-after-144-days/articleshow/86564413.cms||---

History professor D Muneeswaran of Saraswathy Narayanan College in Madurai, said that a local villager Murugesan had informed them about several potsherds being found in a private land in the village. The artefacts had surfaced when they had cleared the land of its thorn bushes. On inspecting the site, Muneeswaran said that they saw remains of burial urns, iron ore, bones, stone tools and a stone circle. They identified about 13 burial urns. The top portion of some of the urns were visible on the surface and others were found broken. One of the urns was about 74cm in diameter and it was visible two inches above the ground. Black, red potsherds were also found. A smaller one, which is 60cm in diameter is visible an inch above the ground. Graffiti was also found on the surface of some of the potsherds. He said that this could have been the burial site spread over an area of about two acres of a habitation that had existed nearby. Iron ore is found scattered in clumps in the region. This showed that people who had lived here had handled iron, he added. A stone tool was also found by him in good condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/burial-urns-surface-in-a-private-land-near-thirumangalam/articleshow/86566597.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘DGP’s proposal to suspend ex-CP returned, not rejected’||MUMBAI: A week ago, the state home department had quietly returned a proposal submitted by DGP Sanjay Pandey seeking suspension of 25 senior police officials, including former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh, over insufficient information. NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil confirmed to TOI that the proposal had been returned to the DGP. “The proposal has not been rejected. The home department has only sought more information,” Patil said. According to a senior IPS officer, after the Mumbai and Thane police initiated criminal proceedings against Parambir Singh and 24 senior police officials, the DGP had submitted a proposal for suspension of these 25 officials. While only the CM has powers to suspend Class I officers, including Parambir Singh and few DCPs, the remaining officers can be suspended by the home secretary in consultation with the home minister, said the officer. However, the home department took the view that a separate case will have to prepared before passing the suspension order, otherwise it will not stand the scrutiny of law. “We have asked the DGP’s office to build up a foolproof case against the erring officers before issuing the suspension orders, else it will be an embarrassing situation for the home department if a judicial tribunal stays the DGP’s order,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dgps-proposal-to-suspend-ex-cp-returned-not-rejected/articleshow/86570705.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Genetic disease: Chance diagnosis and timely surgery save 23-yr-old||New Delhi: Doctors at a private city hospital recently performed a heart surgery on a 23-year-old patient, suffering from a rare genetic disease, to replace a ball-sized blood vessel. Surgery involved replacing the valve and a part of the aorta using an artificial graft. Dr Abhay Kumar, director, department of cardiac surgery at Aakash Healthcare where the surgery was carried out, said the patient was rushed to hospital last week with chest pain. Tests confirmed she was suffering from Marfan syndrome, a rare inherited disorder that affects connective tissue and organs such as the heart, eyes, blood vessels, and bones. According to Dr Kumar, the disease caused her ascending aorta — the main artery that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body — to become 6.5 cm-wide, double the normal width and could have ruptured anytime, causing her sudden death. “Considering her age and the proper functioning of all other organs, it was decided to operate on her using the Bentall procedure,” he said. The procedure requires stopping the blood supply to the body completely and controlling blood supply to the brain to prevent paralysis for some time. “We were very careful as we were aware how former New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns recently suffered a stroke in the spine during surgery to correct his aortic dissection. An extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used to pump oxygenated blood outside her body during the period of surgery and we completed the surgery successfully after seven hours. Bentall was the only procedure that could have saved her life. She is doing fine and can lead a healthy, normal life,” the doctor said. The woman’s mother also had a similar heart problem and successfully underwent a Bentall surgery 15 years ago, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/genetic-disease-chance-diagnosis-and-timely-surgery-save-23-yr-old/articleshow/86569010.cms||---
---||Kolkata||120 tonnes of hot mix used to fill 100 potholes on 3.5km of Bypass||Kolkata: Twenty-five construction workers and technicians, armed with 120 tonnes of hot mix asphalt on four tipper trucks, laboured all night till Monday morning to fill more than 100 potholes across a 3.5km stretch of EM Bypass. The move came after TOI highlighted the pathetic condition of the road, which had turned worse after last week’s torrential rain. Such was the state that a 58-year-old man, riding a scooter on Bypass, fell in a ditch-like pothole on Saturday and had fractured his left leg, collar bone and ribs. He is currently in hospital. The night-long work improved the traffic flow on Bypass immediately as vehicles no longer had tos slowly negotiate past craters and battered stretches. Jams disappeared as vehicles sped past the repaired areas between VIP Bazaar and Metro Cash and Carry. “More than the traffic snarls, accidents involving two-wheelers on the cratered stretches had been a matter of worry for us over the past few days. Had the authorities repaired the stretch earlier, the man riding the scooter wouldn’t have met with the accident. But now that the repairs have been carried out, no further accident will hopefully take place,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Traffic Police, who had raised multiple complaints with the KMDA — the custodians of the road — prior to the accident. Motorists driving along the road were pleasantly surprised by the revamped road in the morning. “I had been leaving home at least 40 minutes before my usual over the past few weeks, as I would invariably be caught in traffic snarls on the battered road. But driving was such a pleasure on Monday,” said Debarshi Basu, a Jadavpur resident who drives to and from his Sector V office every day. A KMDA official told TOI they could not start the repair work owing to waterlogging at the hot mix asphalt plant in Baruipur after last week’s incessant rain. But following the accident, the authorities operated additional pumps to flush accumulated water out of the plant and began to manufacture hot mix from Sunday itself. Later at night, they conducted the repair work. “The rain and waterlogging had halted the repair project. Our men worked all night and finished the repairs by next morning. We will carry out more such repairs as and when needed,” said a senior official of KMDA. About the frequent surfacing of potholes on E M Bypass, the official blamed the ongoing Metro construction work. “The stretch of EM Bypass that has suffered the most is the area that falls under the overhead Metro construction site. Continuous seepage of water in these areas weaken the top layer of the road, leading to frequent disintegration. A total overhaul of the EM Bypass surface is also due. We have planned to undertake a routine overlaying of road surface on EM Bypass after monsoon,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/120-tonnes-of-hot-mix-used-to-fill-100-potholes-on-3-5km-of-bypass/articleshow/86566744.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Though Joshi managed to hire a cab, she reached the station around 45 minutes after the scheduled pickup time. “Most of the autorickshaw drivers said they have stopped their trips to the station following the crackdown on them by the authorities.” The city police and the Regional Transport Office (RTO) have stepped up their drive against illegal autorickshaw drivers in the wake of the abduction and gang-rape of a 14-year-old girl earlier this month. Nineteen men, including 14 autorickshaw drivers, have so far been arrested in connection with the crime. The police and RTO officials are now checking the autorickshaw drivers’ documents, including permits, driving licence, badge and uniform. Autorickshaw driver Dilip Mahapare said, “I am ready to transport passengers to any part of the city, but not Pune station. The police, on the pretext of checking documents, are penalizing us.” Another autorickshaw driver, Mohsin Shaikh, said, “The crackdown has disciplined the autorickshaw drivers and streamlined the parking arrangement in the station.” Inspector Ajit Dalvi in-charge of Bund Garden traffic police said, “Sufficient policemen have been deployed at all railway stations and bus terminuses. There are complaints that some autorickshaw drivers are refusing trips to the Pune and Khadki railway stations and MSRTC bus terminals. We are, on an average, penalizing 100 autorickshaw operators at the Pune station and on Tadiwala Road. Complaints relating to misbehaviour and refusals to ply by the autorickshaw drivers have stopped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-drivers-refuse-trips-to-rly-station-commuters-rue/articleshow/86566655.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Kainth also alleged that he was not allowed to raise core issues related to the public and MC finances. “The mayor lied about the UT administration approving Rs 200 crore grant-in-aid for the current financial year. He is trying to fool city residents by making such a false statement but people know the real face of the BJP and will give a befitting reply to them in the upcoming municipal elections. Moreover, the F&CC also approved a huge amount for preparation of a documentary without going through any tender process or competition. One news channel was allowed to do this work at a cost of over Rs 9 lakh”, Kainth alleged. He also alleged that he was not given a chance to raise the issue of parking in the city. “When I tried to raise the issue, the mayor said he would get time after discussion over the agendas, but soon after the agendas, the meeting was called off and I was not given even a single minute to speak,” he said. He added that a media team had been hired for over Rs 38 lakh despite the present financial crisis. Later, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra called Kainth in her office and listened to him. The Finance and Contract Committee (F&CC) of the MC on Monday approved the agenda to provide a rainwater harvesting system in two community centres at sectors 8 and 18.

---||Delhi||Eat, pray, love: All-in-one mobile app to be tourists’ guide to Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Tourism’s mobile application, Dekho Meri Dilli, which puts the capital on the list of a select few cities of developed countries that have a unique app to provide an all-round enriching experience for tourists, was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday at Delhi Secretariat. Terming the app Delhi government’s best foot forward to promote tourism, Kejriwal said it would prove to be a game-changer. The app would provide information about sightseeing, food joints, monuments, entertainment and recreation sites and public conveniences within a 5km radius of a person’s location. It is designed to be a one-stop-solution for not just tourists, but also those who want to explore the capital. “Delhi is a historical, but a very modern city. To understand the history of India, people have to come to Delhi. If someone wants to see the most technologically advanced innovations of this country, they’ll have to come to Delhi. All tourism information will be available on this app in an organised, user-friendly and effective manner,” said Kejriwal. The CM further stated that tourism would get an enormous boost from this app. “Delhi government is working towards developing the potential of the industry exponentially. When tourism increases, all sectors will automatically get a boost. The food and beverages, entertainment and hospitality sectors will grow immensely. We’ll also see a rise in the economy and jobs,” he said. Appealing to everyone to download the app, Kejriwal said, “We expect all foreigners coming to Delhi to use the app. Even people of Delhi will find something that even they aren’t aware of. It has something for everyone to learn and enjoy. Our target is to make tourism in Delhi an experience that will make people want to stay longer and spend more on businesses. I request everyone to regularly give us feedback for improving the app.” The average time spent by a tourist in Delhi is 1.5 days. “We hope to make this 1.5 days into 28 days. We wish to give people more options and make their experience of travelling and enjoying Delhi better,” said deputy CM Manish Sisodia. The app is available on Google Playstore and App Store. People would be able to book entry tickets to various heritage monuments with a single click. They would also be able to take special tours to top culinary hubs and get complete information on all shopping destinations and markets at one place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eat-pray-love-all-in-one-mobile-app-to-be-tourists-guide-to-delhi/articleshow/86566741.cms||AlokKNMishra

As many as 15,869 deliveries were performed at the hospital in 2020, which was almost 15% higher than the figures in 2019.According to data accessed by TOI, a total of 13,767 deliveries were performed in 2019 against the 15,869 deliveries in 2020. Of the 15,869 deliveries, 10,116 were normal, while 5,753 were C-sections. “Due to Covid-19 fear, more pregnant women than normal came to the GRH or they were referred to the hospital for deliveries rather than private hospitals. We had managed a peak of 71 deliveries in a single day. Most of all high risk mothers from urban areas were cared for at the GRH,” said Dr N Sumathi, head, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, GRH. The hospital was equipped to handle deliveries of Covid-19 positive pregnant women as well.GRH also handled around 15% more high-risk cases of pregnant women and mothers in 2020 compared to 2019. A total of 22,504 high-risk cases were admitted to the department of obstetrics and gynaecology in 2020. “We get quite a number of referrals for high-risk deliveries from private hospitals and even other medical college hospitals. For some cases such as pregnant women with heart disease who require institutional delivery, we get referrals as we are better equipped and have an expert team,” said Sumathi.Doctors, meanwhile, said that normalcy is returning slowly in 2021 and the number of cases handled is reverting to the usual average of pre-Covid-19 times. In 2021, till August, 9,729 deliveries were performed. “We can definitely see a shift towards normalcy as now deliveries are being done at other hospitals as usual so the caseload is split. From around 60-70 deliveries a day in 2020, we are seeing 40-45 deliveries on an average per day now, which is close to the usual average we had in 2019,” said Sumathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/covid-19-spikes-baby-boom-in-grh-as-over-15k-deliveries-performed-in-2020/articleshow/86566637.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Kolkata||Clashes and blockade hit traffic in S Kolkata||Kolkata: Office-bound commuters from south and south suburban Kolkata had a bad experience on the first working day of the week, despite a clear sky throughout the day. As the reports of clashes between the BJP and the TMC at Jadubabu’s Bazar on the final day of campaigning for Bhowanipore bypoll elections hogged the limelight, it hit the traffic on Asutosh Mukherjee Road severely in the morning. Traffic had to be diverted via Hazra and towards Gopalnagar-Alipore as the movement of vehicles on the stretch between Exide and Hazra Crossing came to a halt for some time. Cops also diverted vehicles via Elgin Road. However, with D L Khan Road and the AJC Bose Road near the PTS Crossing being forced to accommodate the extra traffic, it took a much longer time for traffic to normalize on this stretch. Cops said they had to plan traffic movement keeping in mind a sit-in at Jadavpur, a march from Moulali to Esplanade and a blockade at the Dorina Crossing due to the strike called by the farmers’ organizations. “Though the protests from farmers’ organizations left little impact on overall traffic flow, with protesters cooperating with cops (except Jadavpur where the Left organized the blockade), there was a feeling among commuters that south Kolkata was slower on Monday than normal days,” said a traffic cop. Besides the diversions on Asutosh Mukherjee Road, cops also enforced diversions for a few minutes at Jadavpur police station crossing and Sukanta Setu crossing. “Asutosh Mukherjee Road serves as the backbone for movement in south Kolkata. A 45-minute blockade puts pressure on all adjoining roads. With Diamond Harbour Road being filled with potholes at specific stretches between Remount Road and Alipore Bodyguard lines, local Bhowanipore guard also had to contend with additional pressure on Belvedere Road and Alipore Road, claimed sources. All automatic signals on the stretch were switched to manual mode and the vehicles from Kidderpore and Howrah had to be held up more frequently in order to clear the traffic snarls on D L Khan Road,” said a traffic sergeant manning the PTS Crossing. “In Kolkata, farmers’ organisations, under the banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, held mass meetings at several places and took out a procession from Moulali to Dharmatala and thereafter blocked Dorina Crossing where the leaders of farmers, trade unions, bank employees organisation and women’s organisations participated,” said a member of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (West Bengal chapter).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clashes-and-blockade-hit-traffic-in-s-kolkata/articleshow/86566671.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Centre has proposed three laws related to the agriculture sector, which are being opposed by different farmers’ outfits and organisations. The Bharat Bandh call received mixed response in Kolhapur city and good response in the rural parts of the district. The farmers and labour outfits under Samyukt Kisan Kamgar Sabha had given the call. The workers of outfits prominently leftist organisations, farmers outfits such as Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana and political parties such as Congress and Nationalist Congress Party participated in large numbers. In rural areas, the agriculture operations were kept on hold. The supply of produce to the city mandi’s was stopped. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee of Kolhapur city too was shut, which led to shortage of vegetables in the city. Many mandis were shut completely and some operated with local farmers bringing the produce to sell. The representatives of all organisations, except Bharatiya Janata Party, held demonstrations at Bindu Chowk of Kolhapur city. Addressing the crowd, veteran leader Sampat Pawar said, “The Bharat Bandh call has got good response from the citizens of all walks of life. Our demands are to repeal the anti-farmer laws, repeal the plans which will make labour cheap and privatised. The response of most parties and organisations in support of farmers and workers is unprecedented and the unity will remain intact till the demands are not met.” Upon the request of the several trader associations, the shutting down of shops was not mandatory to show support for Bharat Bandh. The convenors claimed that since the traders have faced difficulties during the lockdown, it was not appropriate to make them mandatory shut shops. Still, shops from rural areas were shut for a couple of hours as token support to the demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mandis-remain-shut-rural-kolhapur-supports-bandh/articleshow/86562582.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Early marriages affect health of Rajasthan adolescents, finds study||JAIPUR: The findings of a study ‘Returns on Investment in Adolescents’ Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) in Rajasthan’, which was released by Dr Arvind Mayaram, economic advisor to the chief minister of Rajasthan, in a webinar organised by the Population Foundation of India reveals that the returns to investment in SRH services or the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for Rajasthan is 2.97, which implies that for every Rs 100 invested to meet the unmet needs of adolescents, there could be a return of approximately Rs 300 in terms of healthcare costs saved. Based on data from adolescents in Rajasthan, the study outlines the challenges they face and makes recommendations for scaling up integrated adolescent health services in the state. Adolescents constitute approximately 23% of the total population in Rajasthan. Many of them face numerous challenges to their health development due to structural poverty, social discrimination, regressive social norms, inadequate education, early marriage and child bearing,especially in the marginalised and under-served sections of the population. “If we can harness the demographic dividend in India, we can be at the forefront of global economic growth for the next 20-25 years,” said Mayaram. The study is commissioned by the Population Foundation of India. The study says, “A per capita investment of Re1 in the weekly iron and folic acid supplement scheme (WIFS) would save almost Rs 2 to Rs 20 in terms of productivity loss averted. Hence, an annual investment of Rs 66 to Rs 80 million (Rs 6 crore to Rs 8 crore)—would bring at least Rs 132 million (Rs 13.2 crore) in returns. Investing one rupee in the menstrual health of adolescents would return Rs 4 in terms of averted loss in educational achievement and consequent gain in productivity. Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India said, “Rajasthan has an adolescent population of 15.7 million which is 23% of the state’s population. In order to maximise this demographic dividend, we need to invest in ensuring that our working-age population is healthy, literate, and has access to resources.” Rashmi Gupta, commissioner, women empowerment said, “This year the state government will be distributing free sanitary napkins to all women and girls and work on prioritizing awareness generation for maximum involvement.” Dr Amita Kashyap, professor, preventive and social medicine, SMS Medical College said, “Overall, we don’t need to create new programmes but try to better the ones which are already available”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/early-marriages-affect-health-of-raj-adolescents-finds-study/articleshow/86569012.cms||---

---||Bareilly||Sugarcane SAP hike too little for debt-ridden sugarcane farmers, says Varun Gandhi||BAREILLY: BJP’s third-term MP from UP’s Pilibhit, Varun Gandhi, has shot off a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath saying that the Rs 25/quintal hike announced on sugarcane SAP -- the minimum purchase price-- by the government will not provide any succor to the “debt-ridden” farmers of the state. When contacted, Gandhi told TOI, “The farmers in the state are in a dire state. I am grateful to the CM for an increase of Rs 25 in the SAP of sugarcane. But I would appeal for greater fiscal generosity as the farmers under the debts need an extra cushion from the government. The recent price hike is a step in the right direction but not enough to improve the conditions of the cane growers.” The Adityanath-led government announced the hike in sugarcane’s State Advised Price (SAP) on Sunday, in an attempt to woo the farmers ahead of upcoming elections. With the announcement, the new per quintal SAP of sugarcane is Rs 350 now. The BJP MP, who recently held a series of meetings with sugarcane farmers in the region, has in his letter reasserted that the sugarcane SAP should be raised to Rs 400. “Nearly 50 lakh families depend on sugarcane farming in the state, and it also provides livelihood to lakhs of labourers. Because of the significant hike in diesel, electricity, fertilizers, transportation, most farmers are trapped in the cycle of debts,” Gandhi said. “I had earlier requested, in my previous letter, to increase the SAP to Rs 400. Now through this letter, I again appeal to you to reconsider my request to increase the SAP because it is a matter of the livelihood of lakhs of farmers and labourers of the state. I am hopeful that you will take this step for them,” the MP wrote in the letter. He added, “In case, if it is not possible to increase the SAP then the state government may consider to provide Rs 50 per quintal over the SAP to the farmers.” Meanwhile, UP’s cane minister Suresh Rana on Monday said that the SAP increase will translate into a total additional income of Rs 4,000 crore for the nearly 45 lakh cane growers of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sugarcane-sap-hike-too-little-for-debt-ridden-sugarcane-farmers-says-varun-gandhi/articleshow/86564484.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The victim, in his late 70s, who had earlier worked as additional chief secretary (home) in Maharashtra, lodged an FIR with the Marine Drive police on September 20 for cheating and hacking. He told the police that he had booked a round-trip air tickets for himself and a family member for Kolkata, but later cancelled the booking. While he was searching the internet for the online travel company through which he had booked the tickets, he came across a fake website page with contact details, said an investigating officer. When the victim dialled the number and sought the refund, the person on the other side asked for his credit card details. He refused to share the details, and the fraudster asked him to download a screen-sharing app. This is how the cyber cheats got access to his screen, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sr-citizen-loses-rs-4-5l-to-cyber-fraudsters/articleshow/86569040.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Kanpur||Bail plea of accused incheating case rejected||Kanpur: Special judge POCSO Act and additional session judge (court no. 22) Vikas Gupta on Monday rejected the bail application of one Alisa Kharmuti, who has been charged with making fake ID of the customs department and extorting money from the complainant. The presiding judge in his order observed that on perusal of the case diary and documents on record , the accused had been charged for making a fake ID of customs department along with the main accused Moses, and they had blackmailed and extorted money from complainant Pooja Nishad to the tune of Rs 4 lakhs. The charges levelled were of serious nature hence the bail application was liable to be rejected , the judge observed. The complainant, Pooja Nishad, a resident of Pahalwan Purwa near Kanpur Zoo in her report to Nawabganj police had stated that she had developed friendship with accused Kevin Harison through Instagram. The friend’s request was from Harison, which she had accepted. Later she connected with him through WhatsApp. Harison identified himself as a resident of the United Kingdom ( U.K.) and said that he wanted to give her some gifts. After initial refusal, she accepted the gift. On June 3, 2021 she got a call from mobile no. 7065617452 and the caller apprised her that the call was from the customs department. The voice was of a female and she said that a parcel sent by one Kevin Harison was with the department. The parcel contains some costly item and she had to pay the tax values to get the parcel. The complainant contacted the accused, who informed her that the parcel had some costly gift. She had to pay a sum of Rs 23,500 while the remaining amount had already been paid. After that she made the payment through Paytm. After some time again a call came on her mobile and the caller lady informed her that the parcel contained quite a large amount of money and she had to produce a money lending certificate otherwise she would be trapped in a big problem, could be arrested and lose her job. Thus, the mobile caller extorted a sum of Rs 4,04,787 from her. The amount was deposited in the account of one Aman. The complainant claimed that she had given all details to accused Kevin, who stated that all funds deposited by her were with the customs department in updated form. To clear the data, she had to spend a sum of Rs 45,000 more after that she could get back her money. When the complainant stated that she would lodge a complaint, the accused blocked her Facebook and WhatsApp account. The police had arrested Alisa Kharmurti and recovered five mobiles, one Aadhaar card and voter ID card besides Rs 500. The defence counsel pleaded that she had not committed any crime and was falsely implicated in this case. As per the statement of the prosecution, the incident had taken place on June 4, 2021 and the FIR was lodged on July 24, 2021. The accused had no relation with the mobile numbers given by the complainant. She was a simple and honest lady and earned her bread-butter from a job in the private sector. It was sheer coincidence that she was a neighbour of the main accused. Special prosecutor Ganga Prasad Yadav strongly opposed the bail and said the accused and co-accused were cheating the public by presenting themselves as custom officer. They had an international gang that extorted money from their preys by one or another pretext. If bail would be granted to her, she would again join the criminal world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bail-plea-of-accused-incheating-case-rejected/articleshow/86569006.cms||---

The number of persons vaccinated on Sunday and Monday together is around the figure of persons vaccinated on a single day. On Sunday, VMC health officials vaccinated 4,441 persons in the city. On Monday, the number stood at 10,595 persons. Sources said that on both days, there was a problem in the availability of Covishield. VMC officials, however, said that on Sunday the staff involved in vaccination was taking an exam. On Monday, the vaccination was better largely due to stocks that were available with the civic body. Sources said that the supply of Coveshield was either insufficient or not there on some days. This led to low vaccination as only a few persons have taken Covaxin in the first dose and come for the second dose. Also, not many are keen to take Covaxin. The erratic supply is expected to continue for a day or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/erratic-supply-affects-vaccinations/articleshow/86564557.cms||---

Somaiya has planned to visit Kolhapur district on Tuesday. Now, as the earlier order stands cancelled, the BJP leader will not be prohibited from entering the district. Somaiya has levelled serious corruption allegations against rural development minister Hasan Mushrif that had irked the latter’s supporters. On September 19, citing law and order issues and non-availability of police force for protection due to Ganesh idol immersion, Rekhawar had banned Somaiya from entering the district. He was stopped in Karad and was asked to go back. During his tour, Somaiya is going to visit Kagal police station and register a formal complaint against Mushrif. Rekhawar, in the freshly issued order, stated: “Since there is no likelihood of any law and order issue as per the police reports and assurance given by the political workers to not create any issue, I terminate earlier order banning entry of BJP leader in the district.” Meanwhile, district police superintendent Shailesh Balkawade took stock of the situation and even visited Murgud police station and asked policemen to ensure no ruckus is created by political workers during Somaiya’s visit to the Murgud-based factory that according to the BJP leader, belongs to Mushrif and his relatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/somaiya-to-visit-kolhapur-after-dist-collector-revokes-entry-ban/articleshow/86562663.cms||---

Classes for students from 1st to 5th had restarted after a year and five months on Monday. But when children reached the school, they found that jawans of RAC were staying in the classrooms. Parents staged a protest in front of the principal and some of them took their children back home. Principal Ramaram Rathore said that he had informed the education department and the local administration that there won't be a place for children to sit.  Principal Ramaram Rathore said that he had informed the education department and the local administration that the school was going to reopen and there won't be a place for children to sit, but nobody paid any attention. Although SDM Hari Singh visited the school three days ago, he didn't give any solution. Rathore said that this was the only English medium government school in the city. The school has two buildings with 14 rooms. Around nine rooms at the school were given to RAC jawans four years ago. Prior to 2016, two separate schools used to function. But in 2016, the then Vasundhara Raje government merged these into one. The school only had classes till 8th standard then and hence, one of the buildings had remained empty. Later, the RAC jawans were given accommodation there. Parents have now demanded authorities to shift the RAC jawans and hand over the building to the school. At present, the school has classes up to 10th standard and 13 subjects are being taught there. But the building in which the school is housed has just five rooms. Parents who were present on Monday at the school said that if the problem is not solved they would go to the collector’s office with the children. The government that makes tall claims in the name of education should make efforts to provide a roof for children while they study, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rac-jawans-keep-children-out-in-the-open-in-jaisalmer-govt-school/articleshow/86569057.cms||---

Shrama said this while addressing party workers at Marhala intersection of Shuklaganj in Unnao. Taking a dig at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, deputy CM said, “His (Akhilesh Yadav) father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) himself got the Covid vaccine, but kept misleading people by saying that it’s BJP’s vaccine.” Targeting other political parties, he said they were playing ‘Twitter-Twitter’. “During the Corona, they did not even go to help their neighbors and hid themselves in their homes,” said Sharma. While hailing PM Modi and CM Yogi, Sharma said, “To serve mankind, these saints (PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath) have not taken a day’s leave till now.” He further said ‘Mafia raj’ has ended in the state and now the mafias are saying... ‘Yogi Baba, maaf karo’ (Yogi Baba forgive us).

---||Delhi||If students can pick courses, they’ll do better, says Delhi Technological University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh||Professor Yogesh Singh, currently vice-chancellor of Delhi Technological University, is likely to assume charge of Delhi University as VC mid-October after a tumultuous period under the previous head. In an exclusive interview with Manash Pratim Gohain, the first after his appointment on September 22, Singh discussed various issues that have been in the news. Q. FYUP has met with resistance and students and teachers have a lot of doubts and anxieties. Do you foresee trouble implementing FYUP?A. Why should there be a controversy when there are exit possibilities after every year? One can finish after three years with a bachelor’s degree. The postgraduate studies have been reduced to a year, so there is hardly a difference for students even as they get the advantage of an open and flexible curriculum. However, FYUP should be student centric. Last year, we introduced major and minor courses at DTU and some teachers were apprehensive about the workload. But students would like to study different things. Since then, DTU students have taken minors in economics, mathematics, artificial intelligence, even biotechnology. If students are allowed to take courses of their interest, their performance will be better than for courses thrust upon them. Q. But will FYUP not result in students dropping out?A. Everyone wants a good life and a university should be instrumental in giving students a good life. In engineering, we haven’t seen many dropouts. But then in humanities and commerce, there could be though I don't see that the curriculum being the reason. We have to study the reasons for dropouts and see how to help the students. Q. What are the four aspects of the new National Education Policy that you like?A. NEP is good and has many directions and philosophies. But its implementation is more important than its formulation. First, I like it for its open and flexible curriculum. Second, it promotes a multidisciplinary approach. Third, every institution has the autonomy to grant degrees even if this seems difficult given our history since 1857 when three universities were established. Since then, a teacher would evaluate, allot marks and have total control on the system. But now, someone is teaching, others are making the question papers and a third person is evaluating answer scripts. And fourthly, NEP’s focus is on large universities. I was VC of MS University in Baroda, which is the largest unitary university with 42,000 students on a single campus. Worldwide, also the best universities are large-sized unitary universities. These can implement an open and flexible curriculum and offer many options to students. Q. Is the autonomy being given to institutions an attempt to take education out of the reach of the economically lower classes?A. A university's job is to excel. If an institution wants to be autonomous, there is nothing wrong in it. With NEP, I think the government will be proactive in empowering institutions with autonomy. When DTU was an affiliated institution, we had 3,000 students. When it became a university, the number rose to 6,000. Now we have 15,000 students, of which 7,500 students are from underprivileged sections. Autonomy isn’t always bad. Q. The numerous faculty vacancies in DU?A. Universities should recruit teachers regularly. I did it in DTU and in Baroda. This is a prime responsibility of a vice chancellor — to recruit the right teachers and staff and prevent a backlog. Q. Is a common entrance exam for undergraduate programmes the right way to remove the stress of multiple exams for students?A. The engineering and medical entrance exams have proved their worth. So if they want to replicate the success of JEE in other disciplines, I don’t see a problem. However, India fundamentally needs to work on examination patterns. Right now, what happens is not selection but filtration. The present system doesn’t identify the aptitude or areas of interest of a student. Q. Education has taken a digital leap, but the pandemic proved there is a digital gap that students from economically and socially weaker sections cannot bridge.A. I hope that the pandemic ends soon. But if it continues, it will be very dangerous for both teaching and learning. Then, we would have to find ways to assist those who cannot afford digital devices. The university and society must assist them. In DTU, we have an internship programme for underprivileged students and pay them Rs 2,500 rupees per month apart from a fee waiver. Without such steps, we cannot become a developed nation. Universities aren’t so poor that they can't do so much for students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/if-students-can-pick-courses-theyll-do-better/articleshow/86591760.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain
---||Allahabad||Bharat Bandh has no major impact as life goes on as normal in Sangam city||Prayagraj: On the call given by the United Kisan Morcha for Bharat Bandh, the Prayagraj district witnessed sporadic and short protests at various places including in the urban and rural areas. The workers of the Bharatiya Kisan Union blocked the road at many places including Dhoomanganj because of which the morning commuters faced problems for several hours due to jams. Likewise, protests were reported from Jaari and Ghoopur areas of trans-Yamuna. Business in the city remained unaffected as most of the markets remained open. Workers of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and All Indian Kisan Majdoor Sabha (AIKMS) along with members of Samajwadi Party (SP) and farmers held separate demonstrations in various parts of Prayagraj during the day in response to the call for the “Bharat Bandh”. The protestors, including many women, also staged roads blocks at various sites including Sulem Sarai Bazaar in Dhumanganj disrupting traffic on the Prayagraj-Kanpur highway for hours. Protests were also reported from the Jari, Bara and Ghoorpur areas of the trans-Yamuna belt and also from Phulpur in the trans-Ganga area of the district. However, routine life and business in the city remained unaffected as most of the markets remained open and so did the commercial activities. Schools and offices of various government, semi-government and private sectors remained opened and functioned normally. The police force, backed by PAC personnel responded to the sites and tried to convince the protestors to call off the road blockages but in vain. Only after they stopped the protest could the flow of traffic resume on the roads. IG Prayagraj Range KP Singh said that no untoward incident has been reported in the region during the “Bharat Bandh”. “Memorandum of the protestors were taken by officials present on the scene and the road blockages were cleared as soon as possible.” BKU (Arajnaitik) district president Anuj Singh accused the central and the state governments of ignoring the demands of the farmers and turning a blind eye to their suffering. Dubbing the government as anti-farmer, Singh said that despite the farmers’ protest now continuing for months, the government had failed to resolve their issues. Right from the eve of the pre-announced protest, police and PAC teams were deployed at various intersections and intensive patrolling was underway to ensure peace. Even at railway stations of Prayagraj including the Junction station, Rambagh, Prayagraj Sangam and Prayagraj Cheoki, RPF and GRP personnel remained extra vigilant. Hundreds of workers of Bharatiya Kisan Union took out a motorcycle rally near Dhumanganj Sulemsarai and protested. After this, the farmers loaded on the tractors parked the tractor on the middle road and blocked the road. Soon, the police reached the spot and made futile efforts to convince the agitating farmers to remove the blockage, but the farmer leaders were adamant about their demands. Because of road blockage, the Kanpur-Prayagraj witnessed a road jam that lasted for several hours. Attempts to block the road were made at Shankargarh, Koraon, Bahria, Sarai Mamrej located on GT Road. However, in the presence of a heavy police force, traffic movement remained smooth. Shops and markets remained by and large open throughout the day, barring for one hour when many of the shopkeepers pulled down the shutters of their shops when a procession of protestors passed on the main MG road of Civil Lines. However, shops at different localities and that of Chowk and Katra remained unaffected during the call for the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bharat-bandh-has-no-major-impact-as-life-goes-on-as-normal-in-sangam-city/articleshow/86569064.cms||---

While police have launched a probe into the incident, no arrest has been made so far. The incident took place around 10 pm. “The complainant, a resident of Noida, had come to Anand Vihar for some work and was returning to Noida. She boarded the auto from the Kaushambi side,” police said. The woman told cops that an auto with two other “passengers” stopped near her and the driver asked her where she wanted to go. The unsuspecting woman boarded the sharing auto. “When I asked the driver about them, he replied that they would get off the auto at the next stop itself. After a few metres, the auto stopped and one of the men, who was sitting in the middle, got down and told me to sit in his place on the pretext that he would alight from the auto at the next stop,” the complainant said. After a few metres, the driver took the wrong route. The woman complained about it, but he did not pay any heed. “The other two men, who were posing as passengers, allegedly took out knives and asked her to keep quiet. They then snatched her bag which had some cash, jewellery and a mobile phone in it. They even threatened to kill her,” said an officer. The robbers abandoned her on Mayur Vihar flyover. She made a PCR call from the phone of a passerby. She later went to a police station where she reported the whole incident. A case under sections 397 (robbery or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) was registered. Police said they were probing the case from all angles and the whole sequence of events. Deputy commissioner of police (East) Priyanka Kashyap did not respond to TOI’s queries in this regard. This was the second such incident reported from the East district of late wherein a person was held hostage and robbed. Earlier, a businessman and his friend were thrashed and robbed in Mayur Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-in-auto-waylaid-robbed-at-knifepoint-by-three-men-in-east-delhi/articleshow/86569103.cms||---

Police said the body of an unidentified girl was found in a village in Deoraniya area on September 20. Later, the girl’s father identified the body as his missing daughter. An autopsy conducted by a panel of three doctors revealed that she was four months pregnant and strangled to death. Based on the autopsy report, police lodged an FIR against an unidentified person under section 302 (murder). From the beginning, police suspected that the victim knew the accused and he possibly belonged to the same village. After carrying out an investigation for a week, police learnt that a local, Bhagwat Sharan, had gone missing since the day the girl’s body was discovered. On Monday morning, police came to know that Bhagwat was trying to leave Bareilly and immediately, a raid was conducted and he was arrested. During questioning, he confessed to have killed the girl because she was threatening to reveal his name. Bareilly’s SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “ The accused told us that he and the minor girl were in a relationship for six months. When she became pregnant, he gave her medicines to abort but the pregnancy could not be terminated. By then, the girl had started threatening to tell the truth to her father so he took her along to an abandoned place and strangled her to death with a piece of rope. Since the girl was a minor, we have slapped sections of rape against him. We have also recovered the rope which was used as a murder weapon. The accused has been sent to jail.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-held-for-rape-murder-of-16-year-old-in-bareilly/articleshow/86564560.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A detailed project report (DPR) of the new sewerage master plan (SMP), which was drafted a decade ago, is yet to see the light of day beyond the SCB CEO’s desk. “Initially, the DPR cost was around Rs 195 crore. Now, the cost has escalated to anywhere between Rs 390 and Rs 500 crore. Without financial support from the ministry of defence (MoD) or special grant we are in no position to implement it,” an SCB engineer told TOI. “The SCB may be the second largest cantonment (population and geographically) among other 62 cantonments in the country, but in ‘Swachh Survekshan’ ranking it is still trailing,” said D S Shashidhar, a resident of Picket. There are about 350 residential colonies in cantonment limits and the strain is showing on the old sewerage network over the years. Every monsoon, fear of another sinkhole keeps cantonment residents on tenterhooks after two such incidents a couple of years ago. K Shekar Reddy, a 65-yearold a resident of Bowenpally opined, “Fund-starved SCB has to approach the Telangana government and urge it to let HMWS&SB take over the entire sewerage network as it has modern machinery which SCB doesn’t.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-residents-drained-as-cantt-chokes-on-old-sewer-networks/articleshow/86566788.cms||Sunil Mungara

The incentive-based scheme was introduced to ensure patients’ adherence to medications that will ultimately help eliminate tuberculosis (TB) by 2025. TB patients are being given financial assistance of Rs Rs 500 per month under the scheme. In tribal areas, they are given Rs Rs 750 per month. Sharma directed the health department officials under the Nikshay Poshan Yojana scheme to ensure that the prescribed amount was deposited in the bank accounts of all patients on time. The health department will now ensure availability of sputum test facilities up to primary health centres and sample collection facilities at sub-centres. Around 12,000 to 17,000 sputum samples are being tested in the state every year. However, the sample collection has been affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government is emphasising on detecting new patients early and providing treatment on time. According to experts, 85% of the patients can be free of TB in about six months of treatment. According to the figures of Active Case Finding (ACF) campaign, which was launched in 2017 to identify TB patients in the state, more than 96,000 TB cases in the state were notified on Nikshay portal so far this year, while 1.37 lakh cases were notified in 2020. According to the health department, presently around 72,000 TB patients are undergoing treatment in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-84cr-transferred-to-tb-patients-in-raj-says-health-minister/articleshow/86569063.cms||---

During a division-level review meeting held on Monday, the minister also asked the district collectors to hold meetings with insurance firms in order to expedite the process of disbursing claims of damage to kharif crops. “All possible rain-related damages, including losses to crops and livestock must be assessed in a meticulous manner. The official account of losses to human lives and properties must be taken into account while carrying out panchanamas,” he said, adding that none of the affected individuals should be left out. In regard to loss of livestock due to rain-related incidents Wadettiwar said the affidavit submitted by cattle owners should be considered while doling out official help. As per revised official estimates, Kharif crops spread over 15.3 lakh hectare have been damaged due to incessant showers, especially in September, in different parts of Marathwada among other rain-induced damage. Referring to expenses incurred by district administrations towards undertaking battle against Covid-19 during the current pandemic, Wadettiwar said the state government would release necessary funds shortly. Meanwhile, the regional centre of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Research and Training Institute (MAHAJYOTI) was inaugurated here by Wadettiwar on Monday. Headquartered in Pune, MAHAJYOTI offers a range of programmes and schemes for the benefit of OBC, Special Backward Class and VJNT, among other communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/conduct-proper-panchanamas-of-damages-caused-by-rain-wadettiwar/articleshow/86562696.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Colleges in Kolkata start process to free up reserved seats||KOLKATA: Many colleges in the city have initiated the process of dereserving seats, set aside for students belonging to scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and other backward classes, as berths in the category have remained vacant despite multiple rounds of admissions and notices inviting candidates. While some colleges have already applied to the backward classes welfare department seeking dereservation of seats, others have issued notices, with details of the number of vacancies in quota seats, a mandatory requirement before application for opening up of berths. Some colleges have also switched the seats among the reserved categories in some subjects, depending on the applications received. At colleges and universities, 45% seats are reserved for SC, ST, OBC A and OBC B students, the qualifying cut-offs for which are slightly lower than that for the general section. The West Bengal State Higher Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2013, has a clause that allows dereservation of seats with the consent of the backward classes welfare department. Before seeking to opening up those seats for all, the institutes are supposed to issue multiple notices, informing candidates about the availability of berths. Maulana Azad College is among the institutes to have issued notices to its reserved-category applicants to mail the authorities their wish to take admission in some of the few vacant seats still remaining. “We have some vacancies in the reserved category in subjects, like Arabic, Bengali, mathematics, history, economics, sociology, philosophy and political science. It is mandatory for a college to publish multiple notices about vacancies in reserved category before applying for de-reservation,”said an official at Maulana Azad. In Umesh Chandra College, the authorities published several notices, informing about the reserved category vacancies before applying for de-reservation.“We strictly follow the reservation rules. We have started de-the reservation process for vacant seats. If we get the permission within the last date of admission, we will be able to admit more students by publishing a list on September 29. But if the permission doesn’t come within last date of admission and the government doesn’t extend the deadline, those seats will remain vacant,” said Mohammad Tofazzal Haque, principal at Umesh Chandra. The authorities at Seth Anandram Jaipuria College have done intra-category switching of seats in subjects, like chemistry, Hindi and food & nutrition as well as in commerce. “This has been done after checking the applications for reserved seats in many departments. Wherever there was more demand in OBC A, we took seats from the other sections. The total number of reserved category seats has not been disturbed,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-start-process-to-free-up-reserved-seats/articleshow/86566875.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Rising Covid-19 cases and stock pile-up in the last one year reported to have prompted China to impose temporary ban on granite imports. The decision has badly hit the industry in Prakasam district which is heavily dependent on exports to China. According to industry sources, granite factories in Chimakurthy region of Prakasam district used to export nearly 40,000 to 45,000 cubic meters of stone per month. Local traders were shipping the stocks from Krishnapatnam and Chennai ports. Cancellation of import orders by Chinese clients has left the local industry shocked. In fact, granite industry has been struggling since the outbreak of Covid-19 last year as units became unable to generate stocks in sufficient quantities after a large number of migrant workers left for their native places. Though the workers returned after 4-5 months, the state government’s taxation policy complicated the matters for the traders. The government imposed Consideration Amount Levy (CAL) resulting in nearly Rs 100 crore burden on the industry. Besides new taxes, the government also introduced weightage based seigniorage leaving little scope for the industry to recover. “The state government is making nearly Rs 40-Rs 50 crore revenue per month and nearly Rs 500 crore per annum from the granite industry. Imposing additional burden in the form of new taxes is making it very difficult to manage the situation particularly when the exports orders touched rock bottom,” said K Sekhar Reddy, district granite units association president. He said chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy should bail out the industry by easing the tax burden. The industry is also suffering due to the heavy increase in the container charges. “Container charges have been increased by 50 per cent. This fixed the last nail on the coffin of the struggling granite industry,” said C Badari Narayana, a noted exporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/granite-units-hit-as-china-stops-imports/articleshow/86566774.cms||Samdani MN
---||Allahabad||Court grants CBI 7 days custody of 3 accused in Narendra Giri’s death||Prayagraj: Acting on an application moved by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing the death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Mahant Narendra Giri, the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court here on Monday granted the agency seven days police custody remand of the three accused, including yoga guru Anand Giri, priest of Lord Hanuman temple Adya Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari, currently lodged at the Naini central jail. The accused will be in police custody from September 28 to October 4. The entire court proceedings took place through video-conferencing. The CBI, which took over the case from the special investigation team (SIT) three days back, moved an application before the CJM to seek police remand of the three accused for interrogation in connection with the death of Narendra Giri. In its application, the CBI has said that police custody of these three accused was required for quizzing and getting necessary information in connection with the investigation of the death of the Mahant. While opposing the application of CBI seeking police custody, the counsel appearing for the accused argued that the CBI has not yet recorded the statements of the accused. Further, it should move the application before the designated CBI court and not before the CJM court. A 20-member team from CBI’s New Delhi headquarters reached Prayagraj on Saturday and started investigation into the death of Narendra Giri, whose body was found in a room of the campus of Shri Mutt Baghambari gaddi on September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/court-grants-cbi-7-days-custody-of-3-accused-in-narendra-giris-death/articleshow/86569087.cms||---

The master plan was proposed a decade ago and nothing has moved forward. The long delay is only adding to the woes of the residents in several colonies. They are hit by overflowing sewage. On the other hand, to ensure 100% sewage treatment in Greater Hyderabad, the state government recently accorded permission to build 31 STPs with a capacity of 1,259.5 million litres per day (MLD). The government had also issued a GO by sanctioning Rs 3,866.21 crore for the purpose. The HMWS&SB has prepared the CSMP for Hyderabad up to ORR. “As per CSMP, the sewage generation for the year 2021 is 1,950 MLD, for 2036 the estimated sewage generation is 2,814 MLD and for 2051, it is 3,715 MLD. For the treatment of sewage, a total of 31 STPs were proposed in GHMC area and another 31 STPs are proposed outside the GHMC and within the ORR, totalling 62 STPs. With the newly-built STPs, Hyderabad city will stand in the first position among all metro cities in terms of sewage treatment,” said a HMWS&SB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/draft-plan-to-rid-cantt-of-sewage-overflow-stuck-in-stinking-problem/articleshow/86566808.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Telugu film body steers clear of Pawan Kalyan’s remarks||HYDERABAD: Caught in a piquant situation over actor and Jana Sena Party (JSP) leader Pawan Kalyan criticising the YSRCP government alleging neglect of the film industry, the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce (TFCC) dissociated itself with his comments. Without taking the actor’s name, president of TFCC Narayandas Kishandas Narang said chief ministers of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana “have been proactive and always extended their encouragement and support to us.” Pawan Kalyan alleged that the film industry was being snubbed, ignored and put down, only with the sole motive of what he perceived to be an attempt at getting back at him by AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Pawan Kalyan opposed the proposed online ticketing system for theatres. At a pre-release function of actor Sai Dharam Tej’s movie on September 25, Pawan Kalyan said that theatres were not being opened in AP though film producers were investing crores of rupees in making a movie. “It is obvious that the government does not want my films to run and in the process is targeting the film industry,” he alleged. In July, the theatres were allowed to open with stipulations like allowing only 50% occupancy and screening of films between 6 am and 9 pm. Actor Nani also reacted. “Keeping aside the political differences between Pawan Kalyan sir and AP Government, the film industry’s issues are genuine and need to be addressed immediately,” he tweeted. “As a member of film fraternity I humbly request chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy gaaru and concerned Ministers to look in to it before it gets too late for the cinema to revive (sic),” he said in his tweet. Nani’s last film was released on OTT platform because of the stipulations. This angered exhibitors who said the producers should have released the film in theatres and also spoke of a ban on Nani’s film. AP’s information minister Perni Nani retorted strongly on Pawan Kalyan’s remarks. “Why should Pawan Kalyan have a problem with online ticket booking system? This is what the film industry itself had demanded in 2016. For Pawan Kalyan... or others, it is the same rule,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telugu-film-body-steers-clear-of-pawans-remarks/articleshow/86566820.cms||---

His panel, backed by the family of actor Chiranjeevi, 21 in all, filed their nominations for the posts of office-bearers and executive committee even as Prakash Raj gently evaded questions on actor and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan’s utterances against the AP government alleging neglect of the Telugu film industry. “He is a political leader in his own right and he has opinions of his own and he is free to express himself. In so far as we are concerned, he is a member of MAA like all of us,” Prakash Raj said weighing his words, obviously being careful so as not to allow any of his statements or replies be interpreted as being critical of Pawan Kalyan. “However, I do agree with Manchu Vishnu that there should be no involvement of political parties in MAA elections,”he said. Vishnu is also a contender for the president’s post and has his own panel. The actor called for a ‘conscience vote’ as more than 900 movie artistes will vote in the elections to be held on October 10. Prakash Raj said he would announce the panel’s manifesto on October 3. Prakash Raj also got actress Jeevitha to be part of his panel.

However, in this case, the station house officer (Sangipur) Tushar Dutt Tyagi had lodged the FIR under sections 147, 148, 149, 159, 336, 352, 353 and 504 of IPC and 7 CLA against 14 named and 50 other Congress supporters on the charges of posing hindrance in government work and disturbing peace of the area. With this, a total of six FIRs have been lodged with Lalganj police stations in connection with the Pratapgarh clash incident. Incidentally, senior Congress leader and ex-Rajya Sabha MP and his daughter Aradhana Mishra 'Mona', who is MLA from Rampur Khas assembly seat were named in five out of six FIRs. Meanwhile, a delegation of the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) on Monday handed over a memorandum to Inspector general of police (Prayagraj range) KP Singh and demanded an impartial probe. UPCC general secretary Mukund Tiwari told TOI that Congress party workers have demanded police higher-ups to conduct an impartial probe into the incident. He also added that police have done single-sided action and FIRs were lodged against congress workers. Congress leaders alleged that the FIR lodged by the BJP MP Sangam Lal Gupta was baseless and registered due to political rivalry. Tiwari added that videos that went viral on social media showed that a peaceful event was underway at the block and the local MP was given proper welcome. However, some unwanted elements had created an uproar which resulted from chaos and confusion. The video was also showing that all the three leaders including ex-Rajya Sabha MP Pramod Tiwari, MLA Aradhana Mishra and BJP MP Sangam Lal Gupta were standing on the dais and two Congress leaders were making their efforts to pacify agitators. Video also claimed that there was no scuffle with the local MP. Senior Congress leader Kishore Varshney told TOI that we have demanded senior police officials that there should not be exploitation of Congress workers and their arrest should not be made till an impartial probe was conducted. He added that local police was taking single-sided action due to the pressure of the local MP. Congress leaders demanded that FIRs lodged against senior Congress leaders and workers should be cancelled without delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/one-more-fir-lodged-against-congress-supporters-in-pratapgarh-clash-incident/articleshow/86569094.cms||---

The scheme is to promote entrepreneurial skills among tribal women in the state. The target given to the state was to form 479 clusters which are called Van Dhan Vikas Kendra (VDVK) and are eligible to receive a low-interest loan of Rs 15 lakh to start their own enterprise or start-up. Five districts—Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Pratapgarh and Chittorgarh are covered under the scheme providing livelihood opportunities, skill training, marketplace based on forest and its produce. It has helped over 57,000 tribals in the five districts by providing them with sustainable livelihood opportunities. A resident of Kotra in Udaipur, Veena Bai, leading one of the VDVK has developed a network of 300 women who extract honey. The women in the nearby villages have been raising honeybees for honey but the scheme has given them access to the market, training and funds to add technology for better produce. Suresh Kumar, deputy commissioner, Tribal Area Development (TAD) based in Udaipur told TOI that the scheme has received an overwhelming response in Udaipur which sees the formation of 137 VDVK. “The central idea of the scheme is to empower the women along with preserving nature and creating opportunities which are in sync with the forest,” said Kumar. He expressed disbelief over some of the business plans being shared by the women that have the potential to attract funding from corporates. The livelihood opportunities are being created in produce from the forest like gulal, spices, bamboo, pulp of apple custard etc. “The scheme also provides ready market for the goods, providing them bigger platform and bigger profit,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-forms-392-clusters-to-promote-tribal-trade-skills/articleshow/86569080.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: High demand, low supply spur rise in veggie prices||PUNE: Prices of vegetables have gone up noticeably amid a shortage of supply of agricultural produce to the main markets in the district. On Monday, the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), the wholesale facility at Gultekdi, remained closed on account of a nationwide bandh call given by farmers agitating for withdrawal of farm bills and other issues. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator, APMC, said that the bandh/ strike had no impact on the vegetable supply in the city as traders and vendors had purchased adequate stock in the last two days. Meanwhile, the prices of almost all vegetables shot up by 30 - 40% as compared to the past three weeks, said the APMC officials. The rates of leafy vegetables have skyrocketed, said officials. A bunch of coriander is being sold in the range of Rs 10 to Rs16. Similarly, a bunch of fenugreek (Methi), dill (Shepu) and spinach (palak) is being sold at Rs 15, Rs 12 and Rs 14, respectively in the market. “This was not the case last week. Many farmers had to dump their produce due to low rates. As a result, overall arrival in the market is less. Hence, the prices have gone up now,” said Datta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section of the market yard. The rates of other vegetables like onion, tomato, potato, cauliflower, cabbage, too, have increased, said the officials. “Many restaurants, eateries, and food giants are now operating at full capacity. There is a good demand for all vegetables. However, the supply has been hampered as many farmers had abandoned their plantations due to low prices. The price of tomato will remain high for the next few weeks as maximum plantations of the vegetable have got over,” said the official. Vilas Bhujbal, president, the commission agents’ association, said, “The rates are going to remain high due to upcoming ‘Navratri’ season. People will have to pay more for fruits also as demand for them would be high during the festival time.” On Monday, the farmers’ strike did not have an impact on commercial establishments in the city. Local transport operated normally. A protest meeting was held in Mandai area. The meeting was attended by workers of various parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-demand-low-supply-spur-rise-in-veggie-prices/articleshow/86566831.cms||---

Rupee Bank administrator Sudhir Pandit said it is “premature” to say what will happen in case of depositors holding amounts exceeding Rs5 lakh. “The DICGC told us to maintain expenses to run the bank for the next six months, within which hopefully there will be a resolution plan for the bank; be it merger with a larger bank, or its revival. We even met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman,” said Pandit. “A resolution plan or revival will ensure that larger depositors do not lose most of their money, because if the bank is liquidated, large depositors may collectively lose Rs 375 crore,” added Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rupee-bank-notifies-refund-scheme-relief-for-depositors-of-up-to-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/86566859.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The body of Sudhir Saini (23) had at least 16 stab wounds, his intestine was ruptured and face was burnt with acid. Several pieces of broken glasses were also found in his stomach. On the outskirts of the Moradabad village, where Saini’s body was found on Saturday, there were empty beer bottles, sachets of snacks and several telltale signs of struggle. The eatables suggested that the killers had all the time as they tortured, killed and then poured acid on the face of Saini, who went missing on Thursday on way to his college in Bareilly. His body was found in a field in Moradabad’s Mundha Pandey area by some farmers who alerted police. Among the objects found strewn near Saini’s body was his library card, which gave police clues about his identity. Police have booked five men, including father and brothers of the woman, based on the complaint of Saini’s family. Superintendent of police of Moradabad, Amit Kumar Anand, said, “The engineering student’s post mortem report suggests that he was brutally murdered. It appears that the accused had abducted him on Thursday, when he had left for Bareilly. “He was killed and his body was dumped in a field. The family has raised suspicion against five persons from the woman’s family. An FIR has been filed against them. Three people have been arrested.” The SP added, “The family said that their son had gone to meet the woman in the Majhola area, Moradabad a few days ago.

While officials could not give an exact number, ground workers claimed that financially poor households sold their daughters to much older men. This revelation comes at a time when the state government was already under fire for allegedly legitimising child marriage through the proposed amendment in Rajasthan Compulsory Marriage Registration Act. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “Initially I was there to understand cases of child labour and assault when we came to know that child marriages were increasing. According to information, parents marry off their minor daughters to older men in return for money. After a while, these young girls run away and even it was surprising for us to get this feedback from Karauli as previously this was not the case. We will look into the reason behind and work towards prevention.” RSCPCR had been successful in stopping a total of 48 child marriages in 33 districts between April and December 2020 at the time when the lockdown was strictly in place. Out of this, a total of 18 child marriages were prevented in Bhilwara, which was the highest in Rajasthan, followed by Sikar, Karauli, Tonk and others which had half-a-dozen cases each. Meanwhile, the state government passed the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 which opened a Pandora’s box as experts believe that it would only encourage child marriages. It allows parents of girls below the age of 18 and boys below the age of 21 to register their children’s marriages within 30 days. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had also written to the Rajasthan government about the amendment stating that it goes against Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/child-marriage-on-the-rise-in-karauli-district-poor-parents-sell-kids/articleshow/86569116.cms||---

Upalekar said the project will be environment-friendly and citizens’ suggestions will be sought. In a statement, Upalekar said he will suggest that the civic administration hold a meeting with citizens to provide more details and give clarifications. Upalekar said that all the aspects to protect and conserve environment have been considered in the draft of the project. Natural soil will be used to protect the environment and no permanent cement concrete structure has been proposed. Over 10,000 native trees will be planted on the 107-acre land to attract butterflies and birds, he said. Claims about cutting of trees and use of earth-moving machines in the area do not pertain to Taljai development plan, said the project architect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/architect-says-taljai-hill-project-will-be-eco-friendly-civic-body-yet-to-give-nod/articleshow/86566870.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP alleges corruption in toll collection||New Delhi: AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday said that one of the major reasons behind municipal corporations’ crippling financial condition was the shortage of revenue from toll taxes. “This revenue gets stolen and it not only goes to the councillors in the BJP-led municipal corporations but also to the higher ranks of the BJP,” Bharadwaj claimed in a press conference. He asked Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta how much toll tax should the municipal corporations get per year and how much are they getting for the last 15 years. “In Delhi, Covid lockdown was extended from April 19 to June 7. During this lockdown, all commercial vehicles would run to carry goods. Taxis and cabs were still plying. However, the corporations announced they are forgiving toll tax from April 10 to August 1. Over 92.9 crore rupees is being forgiven for the company and the reasoning is that since advertising and parking money has been forgiven, we must forgive toll tax as well,” Bharadwaj claimed. “On Tuesday, the south corporation’s standing committee will deliberate upon this and we will oppose this,” he said. Delhi BJP did not react to the allegations. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-alleges-corruption-in-toll-collection/articleshow/86569161.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Allahabad||CORE closure likely, Rlyworkers threaten ‘mass stir’||Prayagraj: The office of the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE), located in the Sangam city, could be closed down in the coming days following the recommendation of the principal economic advisor, ministry of finance, Sanjeev Sanyal. According to the recommendation, in place of CORE, all the zonal railways of the Indian Railways (IR) can invite tenders for further work pertaining to electrification of the tracks under their respective zones and execute the same. The railway workers’ union here has termed the move a conspiracy and threatened a ‘mass movement’ against it. While recommending winding up of the all-important office of CORE, which is the headquarter for looking after the electrification work of railway tracks pan-India, the principal economic advisor mentions that “CORE was established with the prime objective of electrification of railway tracks. Once the annual estimate of electrification of track is provided by respective zones, CORE tenders out the electrification projects through approved engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.” Further, “The monitoring of physical progress of electrification is also being done by respective zones. This alleviates the need for a separate organisation such as CORE. We recommend that CORE should be wounded up. All future tendering may be handled by zonal railway through approved EPC contracts also the existing contracts managed by core can be handed over to zonal railways. IR has already electrified over 71% of broad gauge railway tracks as on March 31, 2021 and it plans to fully electrify its track by December 2023,” The recommendation has been sent to the Railway Board for compliance. Railway Electrification, as an organisation, was set up in 1961, with the mandate to electrify Indian Railway tracks. The unit initially based at Kolkata was called PORE (Project Office for Railway Electrification). However, owing to growing emphasis on electrification, a separate unit called Central Organization for Railway Electrification (CORE) was set up in 1971, with headquarters at Allahabad. Since then, it has electrified 45,881 route kilometers (RKM) of the total broad-gauge network of IR (64,689 RKM, including Konkan Railway) by March 31, 2021. Presently, nine project units, i.e., Ahmedabad, Ambala, Banglore, Chennai, Danapur, Jaipur, Lucknow, New Jalpaigudi and Secunderabad having 2,100 employees are operational in the process of electrifying important Railway routes of the country. Commenting on the recommendation, chief public relation officer of CORE, Amitabh Sharma, said, “Although we have not received any such letter, in due course of time, CORE would abide by the instructions given by the Railway Board.” A meeting of railway employees was held in Prayagraj on Sunday. While presiding over the meeting, general secretary of North Central Railway Workers Union, Manoj Pandey expressed anger over what he termed as privatisation of railways. It was decided in the meeting of the union that there is a conspiracy to shut down Railway Electrification Organization (CORE) and Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and in such situation, a mass movement would be initiated with the active support of students, unemployed youth, farmers, labourers, intellectuals, advocates, people of civil society, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/core-closure-likely-rlyworkers-threaten-mass-stir/articleshow/86569145.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa ready for Bengaluru FC challenge in Durand Cup semis||No matter how hard the playing conditions can get, FC Goa have shown there is no stopping them in the Durand Cup. On Wednesday, Goa face Bengaluru FC in the second semifinals at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan (VYBK) in Kolkata, 6pm. Goa have scored 10 goals in their last two games including a 5-1 victory over Delhi FC in the quarterfinals at the Kalyani Stadium where the playing conditions due to incessant rains and 2pm kick off were not ideal. However, Goa are positive even without the services of star internationals Brandon Fernandes, Seriton Fernandes and Glan Martins. The trio are already in Maldives where India play their first match of the SAFF Championship against Bangladesh on Monday. But Goa head coach Juan Ferrando is well prepared. “Our target here is to work like a pre-season. The games that we have played are very important because we check the development of players, to prepare systems,” Ferrando told TOI in an online interaction on Tuesday. Goa has highly relied on attackers Devendra Murgaonkar and Muhammed Nemil who have scored four goals each. Spaniard Alberto Noguera and captain Edu Bedia started the last game and it gave Goa the edge. “Our plan and target was totally to work like in pre-season and not thinking about anything else,” said Ferrando. The Spanish coach believes the players will be in a better position to deliver good football with the 6pm start. The organisers have allowed 50 percent attendance for the last-four stage and it will further boost the players’ confidence. “Last game players had a lot of problems because the weather is very hot and the condition of the pitch is difficult and it is not possible to play good football,” said Ferrando. Unlike Goa, Bengaluru have fielded a reserve side in Asia’s oldest tournament but Naushad Moosa’s team are no pushovers. They have topped their group and rallied for victories in their last two games. “A team like Goa, it won’t be easy to get back once you concede a goal,” said Moosa. The winner will face I-League side Mohammedan Sporting Club in the final on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-ready-for-bengaluru-fc-challenge-in-durand-cup-semis/articleshow/86591828.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

In a statement, Delhi government said Hussain examined the quality and stock of ration at FPSs, which is being distributed under the National Food Security Act, 2013, and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojna. He directed the officials to take strict action against erring ration dealers who do not open shop regularly, collect cost of foodgrains illegally, distribute less than stipulated quantity of ration or indulged in any malpractices, such as diversion of foodgrains, hoarding, black marketing, short dispensing of ration and misbehaving with beneficiaries. The minister inquired about the e-PoS device and stressed on the need for an improved technical system to make the process people-friendly. “Delhi is among the top states in ration distribution to migrants under ‘One Nation One Ration Card.’ This facility is being allowed to all migrants under national portability, who have been identified under NFSA in their parent state,” he said. Hussain also directed the officials to ensure timely delivery of foodgrains from FCI godowns to FPSs. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hussain-checks-distribution-of-ration-in-kondli/articleshow/86591931.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Activists: Review post-2016 nods to bldgs near river banks||Pune: Environmentalists and civic activists on Monday said the flood lines shown in the development plan (DP) were wrong and permissions provided to all buildings near the river should be reviewed. “All building permissions issued along the river banks after November 4, 2016, should be reviewed. Permissions by the irrigation department to all buildings falling inside the ‘blue line’ to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in 2011 should be revoked. An inquiry should be initiated against all authorities responsible for issuing the wrong permissions,” environmentalist Sarang Yadwadkar said. The PMC, however, refuted the claims saying that the flood lines had been finalized after a legal review. The activists said the urban development department had published the DP maps on February 17, 2018, with the floodlines as forwarded by the executive engineer to the PMC on November 4, 2016. Yadwadkar said a letter from the irrigation department on March 18, 2020, to the PMC commissioner stated, “The flood line maps were presented to PMC in 2011 and then in 2016. But the maps presented in 2011 should be considered as final.” The activists, however, claimed that the recent permissions were provided on the basis of the 2016 maps. “This is causing a threat to the lives of people living in these apartments. Floods may cause financial loss, and also loss of lives in these buildings,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch. Prashant Waghmare, head of the PMC’s building permission department, said, “The issue was raised at the National Green Tribunal, which issued necessary directives. We are following the directives and issuing the permissions. There is no violation from our side.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-review-post-2016-nods-to-bldgs-near-river-banks/articleshow/86566851.cms||---

Hearing a contempt petition filed by one Brijbhan Yadav, Justice Prakash Padia observed, “It is seen that a large number of contempt petitions are being filed against the officials of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) for non-compliance of the order passed by this court from time to time. This fact shows that the authorities of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd are not taking seriously the orders passed by this court, which is resulting in a large number of filing of contempt petitions.” The court directed the registrar (compliance) of this court to communicate this order to the respondent-corporation through chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Varanasi. The court also directed the CJM, Varanasi to communicate this order to the opposite party (IOCL) by Tuesday. The court directed to put up this case as fresh on September 30 for the next hearing. In the present contempt petition, the petitioner has stated that he had filed a writ petition challenging the letter/notice dated February 1, 2020, rejecting the candidature of the petitioner for grant of petrol pump and its licence. The high court had on March 5, 2020, directed the petitioner to approach the competent authority of the oil company within a period of four weeks. The court had directed the Corporation to consider and decide the application of the petitioner by a reasoned and speaking order within a further period of six weeks before finalizing selection in respect of any third party. While hearing the present contempt petition, the court found, after perusing the record, that till date no final order has been passed by the authority concerned in the matter. Hence, while taking a serious note of it, the court issued the above directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-summons-iocl-official-with-records-in-contempt-case/articleshow/86569128.cms||---

The victim, Ali Hussain Khan, 67, a resident of Talima Amlapur in Tappachabutra, was allegedly bludgeoned to death by his eldest son, Amjad Ali Khan, a worker, during the early hours of Monday. Hussain insulted Amjad in front of other family members during a discussion about the marital discord between Amjad’s younger brother Asad and his wife, police said. “Amjad was upset about his father’s humiliating remarks. Around 5.30am, when his father was asleep, Amjad attacked him on the head and legs with an iron rod,” Tappachabutra inspector G Santosh Kumar said. Later, Amjad woke up Asad and told him that their father slipped in the toilet and suffered injuries. “Amjad along with Asad shifted Hussain to a hospital at Langar Houz at 7am. While undergoing treatment, Hussain succumbed to injuries around 9am,” the inspector said. Hussain’s son-in-law Maqbool, who was at their home on Sunday night, did not believe Amjad’s version and confronted him. “Amjad confessed that he attacked his father,” the inspector said.

---||Kolkata||Duare TMC: Party uses ‘fresh faces’ for Bhowanipore bypoll||KOLKATA: Beyond the glare of limelight, fresh faces, mostly women from various age groups, have been quietly campaigning for Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee in Bhowanipore, reaching out to all gated communities and homes for a personal outreach. Being spearheaded by Firhad Hakim’s daughters Priyadarshini and Shabba on one end and Mamata Banerjee’s sister-in-law Kajari Banerjee on the other, along with a team of party workers led by MP Mala Roy, these “emissaries” had been dropping in at high-rises on Alipore Road, Harish Mukherjee Road, Shakespeare Sarani, Sarat Bose Road and other parts of Bhowanipore in a unique door-to-door campaign. “We are proud supporters of Mamata Banerjee and we are thankful to the party that gave us the opportunity to lead this unique campaign. As a woman we feel proud that our state’s head is a woman, and she is the only woman chief minister of India. We visited apartments in and around Bhowanipore to showcase her developmental politics and had a very warm response from everyone,” said Priyadarshini, Hakim’s elder daughter. “My mother has been the proposer for Mamata Banerjee every time she has contested in elections from this part of the city. We share a family bonding but campaigning for her was an all-new experience and we loved every bit of it,” she added. Priyadarshini, her sister Shabba and mother Ismat Hakim focused on high-rises on Alipore Road and Chetla on the last day of the campaign where they visited mostly non-Bengali households and spoke little about politics but more about sharing warm courtesies before making the poll pitch and asking them to vote for Banerjee this Thursday. “Prominent leaders handled the door-to-door campaigns in neighbourhoods throughout the day. I also visited several old Bhowanipore neighbourhoods with workers roaming in autos and rickshaws asking people to come out and vote on Thursday. But for the high-rises, I left the job to my wife. She managed the high-rise campaign schedule, and we had a very successful campaigning,” said Kartik Banerjee, Mamata Banerjee’s brother and senior party leader. “People get tired seeing the same faces of political leaders every day. With rallies being banned, we decided to tweak our door-to-door campaigns by sending in fresh women faces who often have a deeper connect among a large section of residents mostly living in high-rises and posh complexes,” said a senior party leader in charge of managing the campaign in Bhowanipore. While usual campaign tactics like door-to-door visits and those using loudhailers fixed on autos and rickshaws were also followed in multiple neighbourhoods of the constituency, but for the high-rises, the campaign ploy was limited to personal interactions within individual flats without any slogan or party flags. At places where visiting individual homes was not possible, local councillors along with women leaders sat in the community centre, parking lot or somewhere within the premises seeking votes for the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/duare-tmc-party-uses-fresh-faces-for-bhowanipore-bypoll/articleshow/86566909.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Kamble has refuted the allegations and sought a police investigation. The agitators demanded that Kamble resign and a police complaint be filed against him. “We condemn the act of the MLA. Such use of abusive language is not acceptable. This is shameful. The BJP should act against the MLA,” Rupali Patil of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena said. Women leaders of the Congress, NCP and RPI ecohed the same sentiments. “Such acts will make it tough for the women to work in society. BJP, which in other cases takes the high moral ground about women’s safety and pride, has kept mum in this matter. It has exposed the double standards of BJP,” they said. Kamble said that the conversation was fake and it has been made public ahead of elections. “Political rivals have used this conversation to tarnish my image. This audio clip is fabricated. I have approached the police,” he said. Additional commissioner of PMC Ravindra Binwade said an inquiry will be carried out. “We will check if the complaint was filed and its status,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/protests-over-mlas-words-with-woman-civic-official/articleshow/86566888.cms||---

According to police, Bhadresh Solanki, who was working as an armed constable at Varnama police station for the last three years, was returning home on Dabhoi Road after completing his night shift when the accident happened. Police have booked the unidentified driver of the truck, who had ‘irresponsibly’ parked his truck on the highway, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving. Police officials said that the truck driver, instead of parking his vehicle in the lay-by lane, had parked it on the third lane of the highway. No reflectors were placed before the truck, nor had he switched on the parking lights due to which it was not possible to see the truck in the darkness. Instead, some branches of a tree had been placed as a barricade. “We suspect that the victim too must not have been able to see the truck until reaching a few metres away from it and rammed into it,” said a police official. Due to the collision, Solanki’s helmet broke and the cop suffered grievous injuries on his head resulting in his death at the accident spot. Police said that Solanki was married and has two sons aged nine and seven years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cop-dies-as-bike-rams-truck-on-highway/articleshow/86564734.cms||---

The bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, observing that “something is wrong with the petition”, asked officials why they did not issue any notices to the persons against whom allegations were made in the petition. P Srinivas Reddy and N Ramaiah had moved a PIL in the high court alleging that YSRC legislator Ambati Rambabu and his followers were engaged in illegal mining in Kotanemalipuri and Kubudapuram revenue villages under Rajupalem mandal. The high court had issued notices to the mining department, asking it to submit a report on the allegations.  Special government pleader Kasa Jagan Mohan Reddy said an inquiry was conducted by the mining department and demand notices were issued to the landowners as mining was done without obtaining permits. The counsel for the petitioners, N Raghu, argued that the officials issued notices to persons other than those who were involved in mining. The high court bench asked the government pleader as to why notices were not issued to persons facing allegations and why the affidavit filed by the government is silent on their involvement. Stating that the enquiry did not find any involvement of others in the illegal mining, he sought time to rectify the affidavit and submit the same to the court. Allowing his request, the bench posted the matter for further hearing to October 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-raises-doubts-on-illegal-mining-affidavit/articleshow/86566890.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Pune||Thieves target silencers of vans for rare metals||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad police have launched an investigation after silencers of five, five-seater minivans, were reported stolen in separate incidents in the past week. In July this year, more than six such cases were reported. Last December too, there were similar instances. Police said the silencers were being targetted for their catalytic converters, which contain rare metals like platinum, palladium and rhodium, which can fetch up to Rs5,000 for just a few grams in grey markets. The silencers — sans catalytic converters — are then made to look like brand-new parts, and sold to owners of small garages. Police have received four such complaints in one week from Wakad, Chakan, and Chikhali. “We suspect the involvement of an organised gang,” a crime branch officer said, adding that they were in touch with their counterparts in other cities where silencer thieves were arrested. “We have also alerted our informants and collected CCTV footage from few spots,” the officer said. A manager with a company-run dealership in Pune said silencers of the Eeco were comparitively easy to remove and so are targeted more often. “It barely takes a few minutes to remove the silencer,” he said. A silencer from a BS-VI vehicle is worth Rs70,000, he said. A senior official with a Pune-based vehicles testing agency, who did not wish to be named, told TOI that a catalytic converter is used to filter emissions by vehicle. “It is an important part of the exhaust system and helps meet the stringent emission norms under BS-VI,” the official said. The official said silencers in newer vehicles contain larger quantities of the metals than in older vehicles, as the materials degrade with use. He said the silencers contain sensors to detect oxygen levels. “The thieves sell these sensors too,” the official said. He predicted thieves would soon stop stealing these silencers due to the complexity of extracting the metals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/thieves-target-silencers-of-vans-for-rare-metals/articleshow/86566898.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: First-year engineering student raped by classmate||KOLKATA: A first-year engineering student was allegedly raped by her classmate at his New Town paying guest accommodation last Friday, when she went to visit him. The survivor’s parents lodged a complaint on Sunday, following which the 20-year-old accused was arrested. According to the complaint lodged by the girl’s father at the Eco Park police station, she had left her Kasba home on Friday morning and reached the New Town residential complex around noon. “According to the complaint, the girl was raped by the classmate in the flat. She fell unwell after the assault but somehow, she managed to return home. Her condition, however, deteriorated and she was hospitalized. On being questioned, she told her parents about the torment. The next day, her condition deteriorated further and she was shifted to another hospital for better treatment. She is under treatment but her condition is stable,” said an officer at Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Police said the accused, a resident of Simlipal in Bankura, met the girl during their admission to an engineering college in New Town and in their online classes.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Furore over 'terrorist’ picture with holy book in class 8 textbook, MLA demands action||HYDERABAD: The photograph of a woman armed with a gun in one hand and a religious book in the other, used to portray a terrorist in class 8 study material, has not gone done with members of a community. Raising the issue in the assembly, AIMIM MLA, Ahmed bin Abdullah Balala, urged the government to not only remove the objectionable content immediately, but also initiate action against the private publishers — VGS Publishers — for hurting the sentiments. “Whoever published the content, has done it to insult a religion. We have already brought this issue to the notice of the education minister,” Balala said while speaking during zero hour, on Monday. He said: “ I request the state to ensure that content published for students, by private publishers, is properly scrutinised hereafter....” The controversial photograph is found in the social studies question bank. It appears on page 291 of the chapter, ‘National Movement-The Last phase 1919-1947’. While TRS minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy, assured Balala that the state will take up the issue and ensure the content is removed, representatives of political parties wondered how such material propagating stereotype was allowed in textbooks. “It is discriminatory and hateful content like this that destroys harmony, unity and integrity of the society. Peace must be infused in the minds of students through peace education, peace curriculum,” said Talha Faiyazuddin, president, SIO Telangana. He reiterated that the education minister must not approve such content. Experts stressed on the need to protect children from such prejudice. “A religion doesn’t preach violence. If the question bank wants to show how a terrorist looks, a gun in hand would have been sufficient. There was no need to show any religious scriptures in the photograph,” said Shahab Mohd Altaf, chairperson, Board of Studies, Department of Islamic Studies, Osmania University. In a release issued later in the day, director of school education (DSE), A Sridevasena, confirmed that action will be initiated against the publisher. She, however, maintained that no such objectionable photograph is used in government prescribed textbooks. “It is clarified that no such objectionable photograph is included in the government prescribed textbooks for social studies in the lesson relating to 11 (B) National Movement—The last phase 1919-1947,” read the release from DSE. “The objectionable photograph has been used in the question bank prepared and published by VGS Brilliant Series Publication, a private publication...” VGS Publishers issues apology:In its apology, VGS Publishers said: It is learnt that few people got hurt by the picture in our class 8 book. We express our sincere regrets. It was not at all intentional. We do not intend to hurt anybody’s sentiments. However, we have decided to delete the picture and reprint the books. We are also in process of collecting back unsold copies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/furore-over-terrorist-pic-with-holy-bookin-class-8-textbook-mla-demands-action/articleshow/86566899.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The work will be done by the agency finalised by the Union government. The plan is to replace all the existing 2.40 lakh power meters with smart meters. According to a senior UT official, work will be done under the National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM). The agency will be finalised by the Centre as the Centre has to approve the large project cost. The UT administration has already made a control centre in Sector 18, which will work as a command centre for the project, he added. Recently, the union power secretary reviewed the pilot project of installation of smart metres in Chandigarh, under which 30,000 meters will be installed. The pilot project, which was launched in 2020, recently faced opposition in many villages. The UT administration even sought police security for electricity department staff installing smart electricity meters in villages in the face of opposition from some residents. Apprehending threat to lives of staff members, UT electricity department sought police protection through the administration. The UT electricity department has already started work on the smart metering project. In the first phase, the department has allotted work to a firm to convert 30,000 existing power meters into smart meters in sectors 29, 31, 47, 48, Industrial Area phases 1 and 2, and villages of Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallo Majra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) directed the UT administration to ensure that faulty metres were replaced on time. The JERC order reads, “The Commission has taken a serious view of the fact that the petitioner (UT electricity department) is yet to ensure full compliance. The petitioner is directed to ensure that faulty meters are replaced in a timely manner in accordance with the Supply Code Regulations, 2018.” Earlier, the UT electricity department, in its reply, had submitted, “Replacement of defective or non-functional meters is a continuous process. However, every effort is being made to ensure that faulty meters are replaced on priority. At present, very few electromechanical meters are existing and these shall be replaced shortly. The UT electricity department submits quarterly report on the status of meters to the Commission regularly.” The JERC order said, “The petitioner had standalone revenue surplus in each year from 2016-17 to 2019-20. The projected standalone surplus for 2021-22 and cumulative revenue surplus till 2021-22 at existing tariff is expected to be Rs 98.21 crore and Rs 345.61 crore even after discontinuing the regulatory surcharge from May 2019 and FPPCA from June 2020. The commission approves a reduction in the retail tariff for existing categories, which works out to be 9.58%.” “Even after a reduction in average tariff, the projected standalone revenue surplus at the end of 2021-22 is expected to be Rs 8.12 crore.” the order added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-identifies-ut-for-plan-to-replace-power-meters-with-smart-meters/articleshow/86569192.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Pune||ICMR evaluates RT-PCR method in bid for faster Covid detection||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has evaluated a new and simplified RT-PCR testing method to detect SARS-Cov-2, which can potentially reduce testing time and cost. The new diagnostic method omits extraction of the virus’s genetic RNA before RT-PCR testing, simplifying sample purification and reducing test time, ICMR researchers said. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI that RNA extraction before RT-PCR testing was currently a major bottleneck, as it was time consuming, expensive and required trained human resources. He said, “RNA extraction is an additional step in the entire RT-PCR testing process. There were earlier suggestions that the test could be done by omitting RNA extraction from dry swab samples, by subjecting them to methods such as a buffer treatment for 30 minutes and heat inactivation at 98 degrees C for 6 minutes.” Researchers evaluated the performance of this alternative method by enrolling 1138 clinic attendees from two independent study sites in Pune and Kolkata — ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune and School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata. Dr Panda said with the increasing demand for a large number of tests during Covid-19, the new method studied was an alternative protocol with shortened turnaround time and potential to address the shortage of RNA extraction kits. He said, “This is an important research for India, as it suggests an alternative RT-PCR testing method in resource constrained settings, which may have limited technical human resources and cannot source RNA extraction kits and equipment. Care should, however, be taken to appropriately choose a primer-probe set and heat treatment approach while employing this method. Carefully chosen heating methods should be deployed. Thus, not all laboratories can opt for this method.”  The new method reduced the over-all test turnaround time by two hours. The overall sensitivity (ability of the test to correctly identify those with the disease) of the new method was 78.9%. This was, however, low in comparison to the existing gold standard RT-PCR method. But the researchers said the method could serve as an alternative protocol for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in settings lacking resources during high-demand periods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-evaluates-rt-pcr-method-in-bid-for-faster-covid-detection/articleshow/86566936.cms||Neha Madaan

The passengers of the derailed coaches have been shifted to other coaches and the train is on its way,” an official said. “Had the train been in speed, a serious accident would have occurred. Fortunately, as it was approaching the station, it was slow,” another official said. The railway officials said there were no diversions, short termination or cancellation of any trains due to the derailment. However, sources in the Pune division said, “One local train going to Lonavla from Pune has been short terminated at Talegaon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-train-coaches-derail-at-lonavla-stn/articleshow/86566934.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court relief for Mohammad Azharuddin as single judge stay on HCA disqualifications lifted||HYDERABAD: In a relief for Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president and former India skipper Mohammad Azharuddin, the Telangana high court on Monday set aside a single judge’s order staying HCA ombudsman Justice Deepak Verma’s decision to disqualify vice-president K John Manoj and four other members of the HCA executive committee. For now, Justice Verma stays as ombudsman while Manoj and four others continue to remain disqualified. “Let the matter be heard afresh by the single judge after answering the objections raised by Azhar over the maintainability of the petition filed by the disqualified members,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman while hearing Azharuddin’s appeal challenging the single judge stay on Justice Verma’s order to disqualify Manoj and others. “The post of an ombudsman is akin to an arbitrator. Though Azhar raised the issue of maintainability of disqualified members’ plea questioning the appointment, the single judge passed his order without addressing the issue of maintainability. Now, let him address that issue first before going into the merits of the case,” the bench said. “We have relied on Zee Telefilms and Konaseema Bank cases to arrive at certain conclusions,” the judges said while pronouncing Monday’s order, a copy of which is yet to be uploaded onto the HC website. The legal row erupted following a battle between Azharuddin and a few HCA office bearers. Azharuddin brought in Justice Deepak Verma, a former judge of the Supreme Court, as the HCA ombudsman which was objected to by Manoj and others. After Justice Verma disqualified Manoj and four others, a local cricket club, apparently at the instance of one of the aggrieved HCA members, challenged his appointment and a civil court stayed it. The civil court order was set aside by the high court which allowed Justice Verma to function as ombudsman. This HC order was challenged by the local club and is pending in Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-relief-for-azhar-as-single-judge-stay-on-hca-disqualifications-lifted/articleshow/86566933.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

In a press release, the MSEDCL said consumers with minimal power consumption have failed to pay their electricity dues. “Such connections are either at rented homes, which are vacant or where tenants are working from home. Even if the electricity usage is low or nil, the consumers should pay their bills on time,” said the MSEDCL. If they fail to pay the bills even six months after snapping of the electricity connection, they have to apply for the new connection, it said. The power company has warned consumers to clear their dues on time as unpaid power bills across the Western Maharashtra have risen to over Rs2,500 crores.  In Pune city, the power connection of 35,853 consumers has been snapped for failing to pay dues amounting to Rs31.57 crore, while in Pimpri Chinchwad around 13,308 consumers’ power has been snapped over pending dues of Rs14.42 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-to-investigate-low-use-connections/articleshow/86566915.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The Chaduni wing of the BKU is headed by Gurnam Singh Chaduni. Sekhon said that farmers have been agitating for ten months now and more than "700 farmers even lost their lives during the stir" but the Union government has turned deaf to their demands. "The farmers will have to follow the path of supreme sacrifice shown by revolutionary Bhagat Singh", he said. The statement comes on the day when the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer organisations, observed a “Bharat Bandh” to mark the first anniversary of the three contentious farm laws getting Presidential assent. In Uttarakhand's Terai region, all commercial establishments were shut during the bandh (strike) hours — from 6 am to 4 pm. As a precautionary measure, Udham Singh Nagar police made elaborate security arrangements. As part of the protest, farmers, traders, and the members of Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party assembled at Maharaja Ranjit Singh Chowk in Rudrapur and raised slogans against the farm bills. Similar protests were held in Bazpur, Gadarpur, Kichha and Nanakmatta towns as well. In Jaspur, Kashipur, Sitarganj and Khatima, farmers blocked highways and railway tracks during the 10-hour-long bandh. Only emergency and essential services were allowed to function during the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/will-self-immolate-if-farm-laws-are-not-repealed-bkus-us-nagar-prez/articleshow/86564744.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao informed the assembly during question hour on Monday that money borrowed and spent on infrastructure creation should be seen as investment for the future and not as a debt. “No one needs to worry about financial health of GHMC as the civic body’s debt is backed by government guarantee. This government is all for addition of roads and creation of infrastructure,” he said. Stating that Hyderabad was growing into a global city and already grid-locked, he said the government had taken up the SRDP to ease vehicular traffic congestion at a cost of Rs 5,693 crore. “Under the SRDP, link roads, new roads, underpasses and flyovers are being constructed. So far, 22 works have been completed at a cost of Rs 1,946 crore. Another 24 works (21 by GHMC and three other departments) are in various stages of completion. Some of the ongoing works will be completed by June 2022, December 2022 and beyond December 2022,” he said. Replying to AIMIM floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi’s comment that not a single project under the SRDP was completed in the Old City so far, the minister admitted to delay in completion of Bahadurpura flyover due to the contractor’s negligence.

---||Kolkata||BJP delegation meets Bengal CEO, wants 144 CrPC, central forces for election||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP stepped up pressure on the Election Commission hours after the incident involving BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh at 75 Pally near Jadubabur Bazar on Monday, saying that the law and order in Bhowanipore was not conducive of holding “free and fair” elections in the constituency on September 30. A BJP delegation led by Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta to chief electoral officer Aariz Aftab demanded holding of the bypoll under section 144 of the CrPC. “We want the elections under central security forces. We have also demanded CCTV footage links of all Bhowanipore booths,” Dasgupta said. Ghosh complained that the EC had failed to give a level-playing ground to political parties and candidates in the fray. “You all saw what happened today. This is not the first instance. My colleague Arjun Singh was prevented from reaching out to voters. Earlier, BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal was also stopped during campaigning near Harish Chatterjee Street. How can there be a free and fair poll if the candidate and political parties can’t reach out to voters? Who will give security to voters on the day of election?” asked Ghosh on Monday. The alleged manhandling of the former BJP state president at 75 Pally that comes under Ward 70, where the BJP had a lead in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls, made the party organizers apprehensive of the voter turnout on the day of election. Tension was building in the constituency right from the morning after the Bengal BJP deployed all party seniors for campaign in at least 10 places in each of the eight municipal wards in the constituency. Trinamool supporters raised “go-back” slogans at BJP Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh when he came for a door-to-door campaign from Sitala Mandir on Sambhunath Pandit Street in Ward 71. Singh was forced to retreat amid protests from Trinamool supporters, who raised “Jai Bangla” slogans. Police came in the way of BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar while he was campaigning in the Kalighat Potuapara area close to the CM’s residence. Police let him off after he told them that he had no plans to go to Harish Chatterjee Street. The situation took an ugly turn in the afternoon when Ghosh and party supporters entered a local vaccination centre. According to BJP supporters, Trinamool men “kicked and pushed” Dilip Ghosh and “dragged” him out of the centre. An injured Bhagya Narayan Singh, a BJP supporter who was bleeding from his head, was later brought to the dais at Bhowanipore. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari and BJP leader Dinesh Trivedi stepped into the locality after the alleged attack on Ghosh and continued with the campaign. “BJP’s massive outreach in Bhowanipore has unnerved the TMC. Attempts are being made to stop leaders from campaigning... ,” Bengal BJP co-in charge Amit Malviya wrote on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-delegation-meets-bengal-ceo-wants-144-crpc-central-forces-for-election/articleshow/86567026.cms||Rohit Khanna

The Renukamata temple at Mahur in Nanded district and Tuljabhavani temple at Tuljapur of Osmanabad district, along with the Mahalaxmi temple in Kolhapur and Saptashrungi temple at Wani in Nashik district are together worshipped as three-and-half Shakti Pithas in Maharashtra. These places of worship are opening after a long gap. Tuljapur tehsildar Saudagar Tandale, who is an ex-officio trustee at Tuljabhavani temple, on Monday said only around 30,000 to 50,000 devotees will be permitted inside the shrine during the nine-day festival. “We have increased the number of entry points of the temple from two to four. Entry of devotees into the sanctum sanctorum will be prohibited and every devotee will have to wear a face-mask while entering into the temple premises,” he said. Chandrakant Bhopi, trustee at Mahur temple, said the government’s standard operating procedure for reopening temples will be followed. “We have relatively lesser footfall of devotees as compared to Tuljapur and Kolhapur temples. Around 15,000 devotees visit during the festival and their movement will be regulated,” he said. The Saptashrungi temple will not have its yatra as was conducted during pre-Covid times. Kalwan tehsildar Bandu Kapse said that the entry of the vehicles will be restricted at the foothills of the mountain that houses the temple. “We will allow a restricted number of people to go up to the temple based on registration only. The pass system will be announced later,” he said. A meeting of the security agencies and the administration is slated on Wednesday, when more plans will be made. When the temples were opened for pilgrims in November 2020, at the most 340 people were allowed to be in the temple at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/temple-trusts-chalk-out-plans-to-manage-crowd/articleshow/86581276.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||‘Anonymous complaints will not be entertained’||Aurangabad: The state agriculture, dairy development, animal husbandry and fisheries department has passed a resolution that none of the complaints lodged by an individual or on behalf of any union will be entertained if the complaints are anonymous or do not have sufficient evidence attached with it. Taking cognisance of the large number of anonymous complaints against government employees, the general administration department earlier had issued a list of instructions that the complainants should follow while filing complaints. The government resolution (GR) that was passed last week stated: “It has been found that complaints are lodged without verifying facts, without annexing evidences or relevant documents and are filed due to personal vendetta, for harassing an employee or for other reasons.” It added: “While lodging a complaint, the complainant should mandatorily mention his name, address, contact number along with his signature, but it has been observed that these things are not followed.” The GR states some employee unions lodge complaint on their letter pads, but they too don’t attach any evidence along with the complaints due to which it becomes impossible for the authorities to ascertain authenticity of the complaint. “While trying to verify the authenticity of the complaint, eventually the administrations end up wasting their crucial office hours,” stated the GR issued with by department’s deputy secretary Shriniwas Shastri. While asking for all of the regional as well as district level offices to follow the latest set of directives, the GR also stated those filing anonymous complaints or the ones without any evidence will not be entertained, and such complaints will be closed. In case of receiving complaints that are filed along with evidence and has complainant’s identity disclosed will be forwarded to appropriate authorities for further action. The complaints alleging criminal act, including those committed against women, should be forwarded to state women’s commission, while the complaints alleging corruption should be forwarded to anti corruption bureau having respective jurisdiction. A report should also be sought from the ACB and forwarded to the state for appropriate action. The move has been welcomed by the officials and employees of the department, while a quarter of activists feel that in some cases complainants face serious threats for trying to expose a powerful official and so opts to lodge anonymous complaints. A senior officials said, “Lodging anonymous complaints with the help of rival camps in the government offices has become one of the most preferred tools to harass any official. Hope this GR should help us get some relief from harassment as well as wastage of precious office hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/anonymous-complaints-will-not-be-entertained/articleshow/86562868.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Modi government on disinvestment spree to raise Rs 6 lakh crore, says Telangana minister KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: Industries and information technology minister KT Rama Rao on Monday launched a counter-offensive against the BJP government at the Centre stating while the state government is trying to get investments, the Modi-government is on a disinvestment spree to raise Rs 6 lakh crore. While Telangana government’s policy is for start-ups, the central government seems to be on enforcing a packup policy. “We had repeatedly requested the central government for sanction of five industrial corridors, Rs 1,000 crore support for Pharma City project, revival of ITIR project, implementation of assurances made to Telangana in AP State Reorganisation Act like setting up of steel factory, rail coach factory, turmeric board. But not a single project has been approved or funds released by the Centre,” KTR said in the state Assembly on Monday. “There are 8.32 lakh vacancies in central government and the BJP is trying to make an issue over 50,000 vacancies in the state. All those who ask what KCR-government has done, the answer lies in RBI’s handbook of statistics on the Indian economy 2020-21 that Telangana state is fourth largest contributor to the Indian economy,” he said. KTR asked BJP member Raja Singh to inform where the Rs 20 lakh crore Atma Nirbhar funds have gone. “We are searching for it but we don’t know where the money has gone,” he said. Telangana government is working on setting up of a Biosciences Hub (B-Hub) with focus on life sciences, on the lines of the T-Hub. The state has fixed a target of creating 50,000 jobs in tier-two towns in the next five years by promoting IT and industrial growth. The state with the help of NALSAR will soon come out with a new Cyber crime legislation. If the private sector employs 70 per cent of Telangana youth in semi-skilled positions, the state will offer an additional five per cent of capital subsidy, an additional five percent of sales tax relief, 50 paise subsidy on electricity tariff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/modi-govt-on-disinvestment-spree-to-raise-rs-6-lakh-cr-ktr/articleshow/86566990.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Chennai||Sri Lanka needs to walk the talk to make peace with Tamils||By: Colonel R HariharanCHENNAI: President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his first-ever address at the 76th UN general assembly session on September 22 spoke about transitional justice and reconciliation. But his widely reported readiness to have a dialogue with Tamil expatriates to address post-war reconciliation did not find a place in the speech. This was not an oversight because in March 2021 his government had proscribed a number of Tamil groups such as Global Tamil Forum, British Tamil Forum and Canadian Tamil Congress. The government had also banned a number of individuals based in the UK, Germany, Italy, Malaysia under the UN terrorism designation law. The reason for banning them was their influence on Tamils in Sri Lanka and mould public policy abroad. This was perhaps the reason the ban followed a scathing indictment of the Rajapaksa government by the UN high commissioner for human rights in her report. It had warned against the deterioration of human rights in Sri Lanka and highlighted "intensified surveillance and harassment of civil society organisations, human rights defenders and victims". Sri Lanka needs to realise bringing the Tamil ethnic issues to a closure is important for India. Perhaps, India can use its good offices in this respect, provided both the Sri Lanka government and Tamil polity are ready to come to the table. This will remove one ponderable obstacle for Indian investments in Sri Lanka in the war ravaged North and East to provide employment and also trigger the tourism industry in the country. To achieve this, President Rajapaksa will have to walk the talk to achieve economic prosperity, which was the theme of his UN address. President Rajapaksa has not so far responded to the request of even the biggest domestic stakeholder in parliament – the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) - to discuss issues related ethnic reconciliation. So, if the President speaks of talking to domestic stakeholders, who does he refer to? Equally relevant is the question: Are the otherwise squabbling Tamil political parties ready for a common platform to participate in the talks? If the President is serious about a dialogue with domestic and expatriate Tamil organisations, it would have to involve lifting the ban on some of the individuals and diaspora organisations. But the Rajapaksa government has a strong aversion to the involvement of international institutions in domestic issues — a stand shared by many countries including India. President Rajapaksa was emphatic that "fostering greater accountability, restorative justice and meaningful reconciliation through domestic institutions was essential to achieve lasting peace. So too is ensuring more equitable participation in the fruits of economic development." These powerful words would have carried more meaning if the government had made sincere efforts to translate them into action during the past one-and-a-half years. However, to avert international intervention, the domestic institutions should be able to deliver. Even after 12 years since the Eelam war ended, issues of transitional justice, essential to trigger ethnic reconciliation process remain in the halfway house. The office of the missing persons (OMP) set up by President Sirisena in 2018 is a good example of hiccups in delivering results. Till December 2020, it had received more than 29,000 complaints of missing people. In January 2021, President Rajapaksa outlined his plans to address the issue at a meeting with UN resident coordinator Hanna Singer. He explained that these missing people were dead. Most of them had been taken by the LTTE or conscripted. Though the families of the missing attest it, they do not know what has become of them. After investigation the president added that a death certificate for the missing person would be issued. Support in the form of 6,000 Sri Lankan rupees was given to the families. This satisfies neither the families nor does justice to the perpetrators of forcible disappearance of the individual. However, the President sees the whole issue as a part of Tamil political agenda. The recent reports of misconduct by the minister of prisons Lohan Ratawatte, are symptomatic of all that is wrong with this government. On September 6, the drunken minister, brandishing a pistol, forcibly entered Welikada prison with a group well beyond visiting hours. Six days later, the inebriated minister flew in a helicopter to the Anuradhapura prison. Armed with a pistol, he summoned a group of Tamil political prisoners detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1979 and threatened them to accept their offences. The minister was forced to resign after hue and cry by the media and the opposition. This culture of impunity has grown to Himalayan proportions under the current dispensation. Despite claims that the government was preparing to reform the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act, it continues to be misused to detain people without trial. Sri Lanka analyst Asanga Abeyagoonasekara, writing in the Observer Research Foundation, gives an ominous warning: "With the present dysfunctionality, hopefully, Sri Lanka will not see another youth insurrection from its majoritarian Sinhalese Buddhists as seen in the past in 1971 and 1989, triggered by economic failure and political injustice where thousands of lives were lost." India and Sri Lanka by geographic connectivity share mutual concerns of national security. A destabilised Sri Lanka is a potential security challenge to India. According to the newly appointed Sri Lanka high commissioner Milinda Morogoda, Sri Lanka wants to elevate the present bilateral relationship to a strategic level, bolstering foreign investments and earnings from exports and expanding strategic cooperation in defence and Indian Ocean security. To realise this, Sri Lanka will have to tone down its majoritarian Sinhala Buddhist narrative, ease militarisation of the administration, provide equitable opportunities for Indian investors and ensure visible progress is made in delivering transitional justice to the affected and resume ethnic reconciliation process.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Temple trusts chalk out plans to manage crowd||AURANGABAD/NASHIK: The government decision to open places of worship from October 7, when the Navaratra festival begins, has prompted trustees of the three-and-half Shakti Pithas in Maharashtra to draw up elaborate plans to control the crowd and adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour. The Renukamata temple at Mahur in Nanded district and Tuljabhavani temple at Tuljapur of Osmanabad district, along with the Mahalaxmi temple in Kolhapur and Saptashrungi temple at Wani in Nashik district are together worshipped as three-and-half Shakti Pithas in Maharashtra. These places of worship are opening after a long gap. Tuljapur tehsildar Saudagar Tandale, who is an ex-officio trustee at Tuljabhavani temple, on Monday said only around 30,000 to 50,000 devotees will be permitted inside the shrine during the nine-day festival. “We have increased the number of entry points of the temple from two to four. Entry of devotees into the sanctum sanctorum will be prohibited and every devotee will have to wear a face-mask while entering into the temple premises,” he said. Chandrakant Bhopi, trustee at Mahur temple, said the government’s standard operating procedure for reopening temples will be followed. “We have relatively lesser footfall of devotees as compared to Tuljapur and Kolhapur temples. Around 15,000 devotees visit during the festival and their movement will be regulated,” he said. The Saptashrungi temple will not have its yatra as was conducted during pre-Covid times. Kalwan tehsildar Bandu Kapse said that the entry of the vehicles will be restricted at the foothills of the mountain that houses the temple. “We will allow a restricted number of people to go up to the temple based on registration only. The pass system will be announced later,” he said. A meeting of the security agencies and the administration is slated on Wednesday, when more plans will be made. When the temples were opened for pilgrims in November 2020, at the most 340 people were allowed to be in the temple at a time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/temple-trusts-chalk-out-plans-to-manage-crowd/articleshow/86562825.cms||---

Munnavar Shaikh, a railway employee in Valsad, too has seen many grieving at the graves of their dear ones. But Shaikh and his family are surprised with their pet’s behaviour. Leo, a Persian cat sits next to its sibling Coco’s grave for hours together since September 23, the day Coco was buried. Video of Leo mourning the death of its sibling by sitting quietly near the grave has gone viral. Some people have also visited Shaikh’s residence just out of curiosity while the parent family is taking Leo’s extra care so that it recovers from the shock. “We buried Coco in our compound. We were surprised to see how Leo would go to the grave and sit there for long hours,” said Munnavar’s son Faysal. The siblings belonged to the doll face Persian cat variety which Faysal received as a gift from his friend four years ago when they were kittens. Leo has white shiny fur while Coco was black. The family enjoyed the company of the siblings. But around two and half years back Coco went missing while playing outside the Shaikh residence. The family feared that it must have been stolen. Surprisingly, around six months back, they received information that Coco was in possession of another family in Valsad. Shaikhs had to take help from police to bring Coco back from the family which was refusing to let it go. By that time Coco had developed some serious health issues. “Even after a gap of two years, both the siblings identified each other immediately. They played a lot with each other. But Coco died due to health complications. We tried to get it treated at a veterinary hospital but could not save it,” said Faysal. Coco was quietly brought home, buried in the compound on Thursday last. “Leo was not aware about the death or the burial, but sensed that something was wrong. After a few hours it came and sat near the grave,” said Faysal.

The chief minister also met other Union ministers, including Piyush Goyal. KCR, who reached Delhi on Friday evening, was supposed to return to Hyderabad on Sunday after home ministry meetings to understand issues of Naxalite-affected states. But he extended his tour by another day and is now expected to come back to Hyderabad on Tuesday. The latest trip comes on the back of KCR spending nine days in the national capital in the first week of September. He had met PM Narendra Modi and Shah then. Interestingly, this was the first time the CM had an extended stay in Delhi since coming to power in 2014. As soon as the home ministry meeting with CMs got over on Sunday, KCR went to Shah’s residence on Sunday night and had a chat for about 90 minutes. There were reports of another meeting on Monday but TRS sources refused to confirm it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speculation-rife-as-k-chandrasekhar-rao-again-extends-his-delhi-stay/articleshow/86572026.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt gets notice over online admission||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday issued notices to the state government in the petition filed challenging the GO issued for degree admissions through online mode. The government had issued GO 34 on October 15 last year, introducing online admission in degree courses for the 2021-22 academic year, based on merit in Intermediate examinations. As Intermediate examinations were not conducted this year, and the GO was silent in case of such a scenario, the new system was challenged before the high court. One B Mary Keerthana from Pedavadlapudi in Guntur district moved the court, challenging the online admission system. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana said according to the GO, the basis for conducting online admissions was the merit of students in Inter exams. However, due to the pandemic, the examinations were not conducted this year and grades were given according to marks obtained in internal assessment. The GO does not mention the basis for admission in case no examination is held, the senior counsel argued, adding that following the procedure in the GO when examinations were not conducted is not valid and against the interests of the students. He said the online admission process should be stopped for the 2021-22 academic year and admissions should be conducted as per the earlier system. The government pleader for education sought time to file a counter in the matter. Allowing the request, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao posted the matter for further hearing to Wednesday.

---||Dehradun||Villagers claim forcible eviction & demolition of houses for hydel project||Dehradun: The Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydropower project, being built in Chamoli district of Garhwal Himalayas, has come under controversy after some villagers alleged their houses were taken over by the district administration against their will and demolished even as the matter regarding their rehabilitation is sub-judice and is pending in the high court. The villagers, who are from Haat village in Pipalkoti, claimed they had not taken any rehabilitation compensation from either THDC, the hydropower company involved in the project or the district administration, but still their homes were targeted. When contacted, Jitendra Bisht, deputy general manager of the hydropower plant, dismissed the allegations and told TOI, “Everything has happened legally and is in strict compliance with the law. The villagers were given notices regarding eviction and only after that, the process was carried out.” The villagers meanwhile said they are particularly upset because they were conducting the annual ritual of offering prayers to their ancestors when their ancestral houses were demolished. Since the past week, agitated villagers have been conducting candlelight protests against the administration and hydel plant authorities. Narvada Devi, 66, a villager whose husband served in the Indian Army and whose only son also serves in the army, told TOI that she was forcibly taken to the police station along with a few other villagers on September 22 and her house was demolished to acquire land for the hydropower project. Her son, Ashish Hatwal, an Army jawan currently posted in Bathinda in Punjab, said that when he came to hear of the matter, he took leave and rushed to his village to find his ancestral home razed to the ground. “I was almost in tears. I showed the video of my house’s devastation to my commanding officer and he agreed to give me a month’s leave to resolve the issue,” he told TOI. He added that he has submitted a grievance letter to the district magistrate of Chamoli on Monday. Haat village has around 185 families of which 112 have opted for rehabilitation while the rest have refused to do so and have taken the matter to court. Rajendra Hatwal, pradhan of Pipalkoti claimed that “in 2009, the then-pradhan in connivance with 10 other villagers sold our village land to the hydropower company without properly informing the villagers and later said it was a voluntary rehabilitation.” Narendra Pokhriyal, a villager who approached the high court regarding the issue in November last year, added, “The matter has to be resolved as per the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007 and not as per the whims of hydro power plant authorities.” When TOI queried joint magistrate of Chamoli, Abhinav Shah, who was present during the demolitition drive, about the matter, he said, “We had gone there after receiving information from the hydropower plant authorities who are aware about the land issue. We simply executed the orders given to us by senior officials.” Meanwhile, villagers are adamant to have their houses rebuilt by the administration at the same place where they existed before demolition. They are being supported in their fight by environmentalists. Hemant Dhyani, member of the Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee on the Char Dham Pariyojana, said that his sympathies were with the villagers. “Even the Taliban in Afghanistan has not done what these authorities have done to these innocent villagers, despite knowing that the hydropower plant's future is not even certain and cases against it are pending both in the Supreme Court as well as high court.” In a similar vein, activist Mallika Bhanot said, “It seems that no lessons have been learnt from the flash floods in Chamoli in February this year. The hydropower project is being pushed through despite warnings of the great environmental damage it can cause.” Vishnugad-Pipalkoti is a 444 MW capacity project started in 2006. It is being built on Alaknanda river, a tributary of river Ganga. It is one of the seven projects which the Union environment ministry had recommended in August this year which should be allowed to be completed. These projects were put on hold by the Supreme Court after the Kedarnath tragedy of 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/villagers-claim-forcible-eviction-demolition-of-houses-for-hydel-project/articleshow/86564806.cms||Shivani Azad

Apart from ambulances carrying patients and medical papers and those heading to the airport, all others were not allowed to cross the barricades.Airport Road has remained the epicentre of all the farmers’ protests. Approximately 13 crossings on the road were completely blocked. However, the main protest was witnessed at Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara crossing and the turn towards the airport, where hundreds of farmers and supporters had pitched tents. Apart from tractors and trolleys, this time farmers also used combine harvesters to block the road crossings. A protesting farmer said, “It is high time the government thinks about the livelihood of food providers. We have been pressing for our rights to protect our future. All the three farm laws are fatal for the farmers and must be revoked.” Jams at four pointsMajor traffic jams were witnessed at four strategic protest locations in Mohali. Apart from entry and exit points at Lalru and Kharar, jams were witnessed at Azizpur toll plaza and McDonald’s crossing at Zirakpur. A 3-km jam was witnessed at Azizpur toll plaza that was blocked by the protesters and police had a tough time in clearing it as no alternative route was open. People were either seen dragging their luggage to cross the Zirakpur border towards Chandigarh or resting in the corridors for the protest to be over so that they could continue with their journey.Air passengers had to walk This time farmers did allow passengers going to board flights after they produced their tickets, but those reaching Chandigarh had to walk a long distance to get a taxi or an autorickshaw. The exit roads from the Chandigarh international airport were blocked and the flyers had to walk through Jagatpura and on the airport road to cross over into the UT to get a taxi. Those going towards Mohali had to either walk for more than 15 kms or wait at the Airport Road to get a transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-crossings-on-airport-road-blocked/articleshow/86567016.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

TOI was first to report that Faleiro would resign as MLA and from Congress on Monday. “I have not left Congress. Congress philosophy, Congress ideology, Congress principles and Congress programmes will always be near and dear to me,” Faleiro, who always claimed to be a “loyal soldier” of the party, said. He also wrote a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, with whom he had close ties, informing her that he is “severing” ties with Congress as he sees “absolutely no hope” or the will to prevent the party’s collapse. In his letter, Faleiro described Congress in Goa as a “cruel parody”, which is led by a “coterie of leaders” who have failed to take on BJP and questioned the lack of accountability after 13 Congress MLAs left and joined BJP. Sources said Faleiro has been offered a Rajya Sabha seat by TMC, and the party wants to use his long stint in the north-eastern region as the AICC in-charge to help strengthen its base there. “I will decide whether I will contest or not. But I am going to lead a movement in the state of Goa and in the country,” Faleiro said. The former Navelim MLA claimed that his resignation would serve as a call for unification of various parties that share the Congress ideology. Faleiro said West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee can present a strong opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP. “Who is fighting Modi today? What is that Mamata formula that won against Modi? Modi had 200 meetings and home minister Amit Shah had more than 200 meetings in Bengal. It is women’s empowerment. It is a powerful force and Congress has to use powerful forces to fight. Our fight is not against Congress, our fight is against BJP,” he said. “I have decided to see that we work hard once again and give a strong opposition to the present dispensation in Goa and at the Centre,” Faleiro said. With Faleiro’s resignation, Congress’s strength has reduced to four in the 40-member Goa legislative assembly. In the 2017 assembly elections, under his leadership, Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 seats but could not form the government. Faleiro said he wanted to stake claim to form the government but then Goa desk in-charge Digvijay Singh did not allow him to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/luizinho-quits-cong-to-join-tmc-tomorrow/articleshow/86569239.cms||---

DPCC has said if any commercial establishment, housing society or banquet hall has failed to install the device, they should raise the issue on the Green Delhi app. “The air pollution caused by DG sets has been a concern. The order was issued in July and the time period of 120 days ends in October,” an official said. As Delhi’s air quality may start deteriorating from October 15, they will focus on DG sets in the winter, the official added. The new compensation rules for violation of noise pollution has come into force and anyone flouting the guidelines can attract action, said an official. The violation regarding generator sets can lead to a fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh, depending on the size of the DG set, as per the new rules. According to DPCC, the emission control device should have a minimum specified particulate matter capturing efficiency and must be tested at one of the five Central Pollution Control Board-recognised laboratories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dpcc-to-impose-fines-if-dg-sets-dont-meet-sound-and-noise-emission-norms/articleshow/86567156.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 76MW renewable energy projects cleared, says minister G Jagadish Reddy||HYDERABAD: Energy minister G Jagadish Reddy said the state government had received applications for generation of renewable energy for 90 MW and of them 76 MW projects had been cleared. He said that several industrialists were not coming forward to install units to generate power from waste due to stringent norms for disposal of waste. Responding to questions on renewable energy raised by MLCs — U Gangadhar Goud, K Naveen Kumar and Aluguballi Narsi Reddy — in the legislative council on Monday, the minister said the other reason for not many people keen on setting up power plants was due to power purchase cost being fixed by the Electricity Regulatory Commission. “In various municipalities, while the plants were permitted to generate 38 MW, only 19 MW is being generated,” Jagadish Reddy said. Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) MLC and former MP Kalvakuntla Kavitha said the state government should provide basic infrastructure in newly-created mandals and MPTCs and MPPs should be empowered to hoist flags in the respective mandal offices. Speaking for the first time in the legislative council after being elected as an MLC, Kavitha said though there was a deficit of Rs 500 crore from the Centre, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao sanctioned Rs 500 crore to the local bodies. Kavitha said still there were some problems at the mandal level as mandal praja parishad offices do not have furniture and proper buildings. “By making an amendment, MPTCs and ZPTCs should be given powers to hoist flags in government schools,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/76mw-renewable-energy-projects-cleared-min/articleshow/86567063.cms||---

He had been fraudulently dispossessed of 1,20,000sqm of orchard land. That was in June 2020. Perusal of the records in the Salcete mamlatdar’s office revealed that the land had passed into the hands of yet another owner earlier through a similar fraudulent manner. When Soares applied for records of the mutation cases under the Right to Information Act, he was nonchalantly informed that the file wasn’t traceable. He realised he had become a victim of a land scam when he, upon checking the mutation registers, found that the mutation request was processed and certified within six days of the receipt of request for mutation in the mamlatdar’s office. “This meant that there was no possibility of notice being served as required under the law,” Soares told TOI. “The fraudsters, having undertaken the mutation in the property, destroyed the relevant files and the record maintained by the land survey department, i.e. the Form III and the manual Form I & XIV maintained by the mamlatdar’s office, entrusted with the talathi.” Soares filed an appeal before the court of the deputy collector, Salcete. By a judgement dated March 24, 2021, the deputy collector concluded that the miscreants had used a false document to get the mutation done in the particular survey number and directed the mamlatdar to revert the entry made in it. However, Soares’s agony was far from over. Though the mamlatdar, according to the deputy collector’s judgement, restored his name in the record of right, the fraudsters, based on the mutation already carried out by them, had already approached the civil court and carried out inventory proceedings listing the fraudulently acquired property at Curtorim as an asset and subsequently even partitioning the property amongst their family members. “Even after the deputy collector’s order for reverting the mutation entry, the fraudsters produced the inventory proceeding as a ‘title’ before the Town and Country Planning (TCP) department for sub-dividing the property under section 49(6) of the TCP Act, 1974, and then carried out sale deeds registering them with the sub-registrar of Salcete,” Soares told TOI. Acting on a complaint filed by the Salcete mamlatdar Prataprao Gaunker, Fatorda police booked an offence against the accused last month, but the police investigations appear to be heading nowhere. TOI was the first to break the news of the fraud in its edition dated June 26. Soares’s case is among 13 cases listed by Gaunker and submitted to the Fatorda police in his complaint. Though the Fatorda police have so far summoned several people suspected to be the culprits, the cops have yet to establish their complicity in the crime. “There could be many such cases where people have been fraudulently dispossessed of their properties, and the landowners are blissfully ignorant of it,” a lawyer dealing with one such case said. “The fraudsters target properties, which have been lying unused for decades without proper demarcation, and legal heirs of which have either migrated overseas or haven’t bothered to keep a watch over their properties.” Soares, like 12 other landowners in Salcete, who have found themselves dispossessed of their land by fraud, are hoping that the police investigations will unearth the links to establish the crime and culpability of the accused so that they regain the land of their forefathers inherited by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curtorim-man-loses-1-2l-sqm-orchard-land/articleshow/86569262.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials informed the general body on Monday that its target is to repair potholes till December-end. The special meeting of the general body was also informed that the civic body spent only 20% of the allocated funds for repairing roads in last one-and-a-half years, which is one of the major reasons behind increase in number of craters on the roads. On the query of corporators Virendra Kukreja and Abha Pande, NMC superintending engineer Ajay Pohekar informed the house that Rs4.68 crore of the allocated Rs18 crore were spent on repairing roads in last financial year. He added Rs2.44 crore has been spent from the approved Rs18 crore in last six months in the current fiscal. Thus, the civic body has spent only Rs7.12 crore out of total provision of Rs36 crore on repairing roads. Corporators from all parties, including ruling BJP and opposition Congress and BSP highlighted majority of roads have many potholes and people were facing serious inconvenience. Corporators Vijay Zalke, Harshala Sable, Jitendra Godeshwar and others alleged road mishaps have become routine due to potholes across the city. On query of corporators about deadline to free city roads from potholes, Pohekar said target was to repair craters by end of December. “Potholes are 40% more this year compared to last year. The total estimated area of potholes is around 7,000 sq m. We could not execute all works in last fiscal due to Covid-19. This year too few months were affected due to the second wave. Quantum of rainfall is also high this year compared to last year. A timeline has been prepared and works will be completed by end of December,” he said. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the administration to repair potholes as soon as possible. “I knew repairing potholes amid rains is not possible. But we have two machines for repairing potholes amid rains. Therefore, the administration should repair potholes using these machines. The process of resurfacing entire roads will take time so it should be completed before end of December,” he said. Passing strictures on the administration, Tiwari said the officials should have planned and repaired roads before commencement of monsoon. “Tender should be done and rate contracts with private agencies should be finalized before commencement of financial year. Then, works can be done by private agencies whenever required in entire year. It will not delay works due to tender and other process in bad situation, which is prevailing now,” he said. Tiwari also ordered an inquiry into quantum and quality of works done through jetpatcher machines on the complaints of a couple of corporators. On demand of corporators to fix responsibility on officials for bad condition of the roads, Tiwari said, “Officials taking salaries from public money are responsible for the works. Commissioner should initiate action on engineers who fail to plan and execute works in given time period. Also, action should be taken against contractors who delay works.” Corporator’s mother fractures leg due to pothole, needs surgery BSP corporator Jitendra Godeshwar said one of the legs of his 72-year-old mother was fractured a couple of days ago due to potholes and required surgery. “I reside at Panchsheel Nagar where potholes are common on all roads. Similar condition of roads is seen in adjoining Mahendra Nagar, where my mother had gone to purchase vegetables. She stumbled due to a pothole and fell. We had to admit her at Pakwasa Hospital where doctors suggested surgery,” he told TOI. In the house, Godeshwar said, “People are daily cursing us for bad roads. Activists are naming potholes after the mayor, guardian minister and corporators. Condition of people is very bad due to craters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/potholes-to-remain-till-dec-end-nmc-officials-tell-general-body/articleshow/86567623.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

According to sources, Gopala Krishna, a dairy farmer in Yadavapuram village, took his pregnant buffalo to Pamarru veterinary clinic after it failed to deliver the calf even after completing the gestation period. The doctor, after conducting a thorough examination, concluded it was a case of an ectopic pregnancy wherein the calf is in a wrong place. Subsequently, a team of doctors conducted a C-section on the buffalo and extracted the baby which had two heads and six legs. The calf died minutes after delivery. The rare condition is termed polycephaly which occurs when an embryo begins to split into twins but stops before completing the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rare-2-headed-buffalo-calf-dies-minutes-after-delivery/articleshow/86567082.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Kolkata||4 from state bag Bhatnagar prize||Kolkata: Four of 11 recipients of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology this year are from Bengal. While one lives and works here, the rest are with institutes outside the state. Howrah resident Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, a faculty memner at IIT Kharagpur, decided to stay in Bengal despite having taught at universities in the US and Singapore. The other three are Kanak Saha, who watches the space in Pune, Anish Ghosh, who crunches numbers in Mumbai and Kanishka Biswas, who researches unconventional energy in Bangalore. Debdeep, a student at St Thomas’ Church in Howrah, was fascinated by the story of building first-generation computers, told by his father, a computer professional. When he cracked IITJEE, he chose computer science engineering at IIT-Kgp. He later returned to the department as a teacher. Debdeep won the Bhatnagar prize for his contribution to cryptographic engineering. “Despite all the efforts to protect computer systems, a side channel attack makes digital transactions and communications difficult. This is where my contribution comes in,” he said. Dinhata resident Kanak graduated from Scottish Church College but his marks did not get him admission to MSc in physics here. But he got through BHU and his world changed as he bagged the chance to do his PhD in the dynamics of galaxy at IISc. After that, he studied and taught in the US, Germany, Taiwan and Geneva before joining research on space at IUCAA. “I have been making observations about the young stars 950 light years away in the early galaxies, for which I got my award,” he said from Pune. Anish works with the unsolved problems of number theory at TIFR, Mumbai. JU chemistry department celebrated the award of alumnus Kanishka, who is researching unconventional energy systems at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research in Bangalore. “He makes us proud. So many alumni are bagging Bhatnagar prize every year. I feel emotional,” said JU V-C Suranjan Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-from-state-bag-bhatnagar-prize/articleshow/86567116.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Pune||Cyclone fizzles into depression but puts 7 Maharashtra districts on red alert||PUNE: Cyclone Gulab has fizzled into a depression but the system’s westward movement has resulted in a red alert for seven districts in Maharashtra, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting extremely heavy/heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated locations on Tuesday. Pune has been put on an orange warning, with heavy to very heavy rainfall expected at isolated spots in the ghat areas on Tuesday. For the city, moderate showers are expected on Tuesday, with some intense spells in between, followed by light rainfall on Wednesday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, told TOI that Gulab weakened into a depression over north Telangana, adjoining south Chhattisgarh and Vidarbha and moved westwards. It has moved nearly westwards and weakened into a depression, and then likely to move west-northwestwards, which may weaken further into a well-marked low pressure area during the subsequent 24 hours. “The system is likely to emerge into northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Gujarat coast around September 30 evening. There is a likelihood for the system to further intensify over northeast Arabian Sea during the subsequent 24 hours,” he said. Kashyapi said in association with above system, winds are likely to strengthen along the west coast of India during the next 2-3 days. “Strong westerlies from the Arabian Sea are expected to blow over Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra. Therefore, widespread rains are expected at various locations in Maharashtra. Konkan is likely to get widespread rainfall till September 30, after which it will reduce. During the next 48 hours, we also expect thunderstorm and moderately strong gusty winds across Maharashtra.” Kashyapi said the monsoon trough lying to the south of its normal position and an east-west trough running from north Konkan to the cyclonic circulation associated with the depression, will also aid the upcoming heavy rainfall. On September 28, IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall, with extremely heavy falls at isolated places over Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan; and heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Marathwada. On September 29, it has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated locations over Konkan only. Kashyapi said since the system is expected to pass over north of Marathwada region while moving west-northwestwards, heavy to very heavy rains have been forecast on September 28 for the region. Pune city could also expect moderate rains on September 28, with some intense spells in between. Light rains have been forecast for the city on September 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyclone-fizzles-into-depression-but-puts-7-maha-dists-on-red-alert/articleshow/86567143.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Chandigarh||Nod to hire 5 to strengthen Chandigarh MC’s social media presence||CHANDIGARH: Putting an annual financial burden of over Rs 38 lakh, the finance and contract committee (F&CC) of the municipal corporation on Monday approved an agenda item to hire five employees. The civic body reasoned that it was done to strengthen its social media, photography, video editing, and allied work. The plan looked hasty as it was not part of the main agenda item of the F&CC meeting and brought at the very last moment in the shape of the table agenda and subsequently approved. The agenda item has the designations for all the five posts, maximum monthly salary and works to be done by them, but educational qualification and work experience has not been mentioned. Since the monthly salaries of these employees is in the range of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 24,000, hiring them without mentioning education qualification and experience has raised questions over the selection process that will be followed. Since these posts—social media manager, graphic designer, photographer, videographer and video editor—are of technical nature, not mentioning the qualification has not been taken kindly by many. The maximum per month salary of social media manager is said to be Rs 1 lakh, of video editor Rs 60,000, graphic designer Rs 40,000, photographer and videographer Rs 24,000 each. The MC has a public relations wing with around six employees and is being headed by an assistant public relation officer, which is a permanent post. Those questioning the agenda said that the MC is passing through acute financial crunch, many developmental works have come to a halt and payment of many contractors have not given. Needed to publicise work doneThe civic body justified the exercise, saying it was required to showcase positive developments being done by the MC. “MC is doing a lot of developmental activities in the city, but it is being felt that all these are not coming in the media in the right perspective. Lot of flagship programmes / schemes of the government of India…are also being undertaken by the MC, but due importance and media coverage is not being given,” the agenda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nod-to-hire-five-to-strengthen-mcs-social-media-presence/articleshow/86567117.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Agra||Pre-Covid boom a distant dream for Agra tourism industry||AGRA: With no hope for an early revival, the pandemic-hit tourism industry of Agra has nothing much to cheer about on this World Tourism Day, on Monday. Stakeholders in the industry say it could take at least one year for the business to restart and another two years after that to reach the pre-COVID days boom. This is the second consecutive year when the tourism industry has suffered a huge setback due to Covid-19, as travel remained restricted, and lockdowns became an order of the day. Of the 500 small and big handicraft emporiums, which earlier did brisk business, 50% still remain shut. Similarly, out of the 400 budget hotels, 20% are still closed. At least 50% people engaged in the tourism and hospitality industry in Agra have lost their jobs and the remaining 50% are working with 30 to 50% salary cuts. Vice-president (operations) Jaypee Palace Hotel and Convention Centre, Agra, Hari Sukumar, said, “The hospitality sector has suffered massive job and revenue losses. We are in fact fighting for our survival and it is sad that there has been absolutely no support from the state and central governments.” He said Agra alone has seen a loss of over Rs 800 crore in revenue between the two lockdowns and over 5,500 people have lost their jobs in the hospitality sector alone. Agra Tourists Welfare Chamber president Prahlad Agarwal said 50% of emporiums which are near the monuments have opened but are struggling for survival as the tourists are still not visiting the city in numbers like they used to before Covid-19 pandemic. Though the Taj Mahal has seen an increase in footfall post-lockdown, the inflow of tourists at other World Heritage sites— Fatehpur Sikri and Agra Fort-- is still low in numbers. On Sunday,19,913 tourists visited Taj Mahal, while 4,232 visited Agra Fort. The number was lowest at Fatehpur Sikri, where only 566 visitors turned up. There are three World Heritage sites in Agra, but only the Taj Mahal has seen a footfall of 20,000 in a day. Vice-chairman of the Tourism Guild Agra Rajiv Saxena said besides the pandemic, lack of facilities and presence of touts at Fatehpur Sikri are also the reasons for low footfall at the monument. He said, “Golf carts should be provided for the tourists at Fatehpur Sikri like in Taj Mahal, instead of battery CNG buses to make the joy ride interesting. Also, the presence of countless touts are the biggest irritants at the monument.” Echoing the similar views, chairman, North region of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, Sunil Gupta said there is a need for controlling touts at the World Heritage sites as they create hooliganism. The administration should have taken strict action in the matter, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pre-covid-boom-a-distant-dream-for-agra-tourism-industry/articleshow/86564867.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The amount of water released from the Ukai dam was increased from 1.5 lakh cusecs following heavy inflow from the Tapi catchment area which witnessed incessant rain under the influence of cyclone Gluab in the Bay of Bengal. The water level in the Tapi river has been on the rise since Monday afternoon, said city authorities. Out of the total water being released from Ukai dam, 1.51 lakh cusecs was released through gates while 22,512 cusecs was being released from the four hydropower units. Water level in the dam that was 342.29ft on Monday morning was brought down to 341.91ft. Ukai dam authorities further plan to increase the water released to 1.95 lakh cusecs considering the inflow. Meanwhile, the Surat city civic officials are keeping close watch on the development but no emergency actions have been taken. “There will be no impact of the water release from Ukai up to 2 lakh cusecs on Surat city. The water is being released to bring down the water level in wake of heavy inflow from catchment areas,” said Banchha Nidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. “Though the dam rule level is 345ft at present, we are bringing it down below 342ft so that we have enough space to store and manage the rainwater,” Pani added. “If necessary we will release up to 1.95 lakh cusecs of water,” said an irrigation department official at Ukai dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1-75l-cusecs-water-released-from-ukai/articleshow/86564898.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Live wire kills man, wife gets Uttarakhand power corporation MD booked||DEHRADUN: More than a year after a man came in contact with a live wire in a prominent market in Dehradun and was electrocuted, the managing director of the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) was booked on Monday for causing death due to negligence following the orders of a local court. On July 15, 2020, Balam Makan, a daily wager from Haridwar, was electrocuted after he accidentally touched a low-hanging live wire in Parade Ground market in Dehradun. His wife, Reshma, approached police to book those responsible for her husband’s death but was turned away. In this day and age, Reshma felt, no one should die like this. She then sought help from a lawyer last year and approached the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Dehradun. In her statement to the court, Reshma further said that the incident had left her alone to fend for her seven children. “My husband’s death has pushed us into poverty. I’m struggling to feed my family and we are forced to spend nights at railway platforms,” she told the court. Reshma alleged that her husband died due to negligence of UPCL officials who had not taken care to address dangling live wires in the market. Earlier this week, the court ordered police to book the UPCL MD for negligence. Station house officer (SHO), Kotwali police station, Ritesh Sah, confirmed to TOI that a case has been registered against UPCL MD under section 304 A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC following orders from the CJM court. The FIR, however, does not name the official. At present, the MD of UPCL is Deepak Rawat, who took over in July following a bureaucratic reshuffle by the Pushkar Singh Dhami government. Rawat served earlier as Haridwar district magistrate and then as mela officer (Kumbh). The MD of the power corporation at the time of the incident last year was BCK Mishra who has since retired. The SHO said they are “ascertaining facts of the case before naming anyone in the FIR”. “We are trying to get in touch with the complainant first,” he said. Shopkeepers at Parade Ground, meanwhile, said little has changed since the incident. “No lessons have been learnt. There are live wires hanging in the market which become especially dangerous during the monsoon,” said Ram Naresh, a shopkeeper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wife-gets-md-of-power-corp-booked-after-naked-wire-kills-man/articleshow/86564883.cms||---
---||Chennai||New system in place to check fraudulent property registrations: Tamil Nadu minister P Moorthy||The Tamil Nadu registration department, under registration and commercial taxes minister P Moorthy, has taken some bold steps to set right many anomalies, some of which are fraudulent activities involving government officials. In an interview with Padmini Sivarajah, the minister talks about his priority is to clean up the system and make it more people-friendly.Q: What prompted you to bring about changes in the registration department?Chief minister (M K Stalin) felt that though the registration department handled many sensitive issues, there was a disconnect between the public and officials. Our first task was to bridge that gap and do away with middlemen and brokers. Q:You made sub-registrars move out of their elevated seating arrangement and forced them to sit on the same level as that of other staff. What is the objective?Seats of sub-registrars were placed on a pedestal for ages. The practice was in vogue since the British era. But in modern times, you don’t find such practices even in district collectorates. Collectors and other senior officials sit at the same level as that of other staff. They stand up and receive people. It was imperative to have such a people-friendly approach in the sub-registrar offices also. Q:What is your most important reform in the department?Amendment to the Registration Act, 1908, has been the most significant one. It now enables the inspector general of registration to cancel fake documents. Earlier, the sub-registrar could just refer it to the court for cancellation. It caused a lot of delay in setting right anomalies and fraudulent activities. A new system is in place to check fake registrations. We have made it mandatory for document writers and advocates preparing papers for registration to affix their photos on the documents and sign before registration. If it is found that they have registered fake documents, their licence and bar council registration can be cancelled. Moreover, the officials involved in the fraudulent act could face up to three years of imprisonment. This is a first in the country. Such measures will help check irregularities like impersonation and selling the same property to multiple people. Registering land based on the government prescribed guideline value is also important. If a person wants to obtain a loan based on the land in question, the price is hiked above the guideline value. All such practices will get checked now. Officials, both at higher and lower levels, will have to face action if they are involved in irregularities. We had reports that large-scale irregularities were taking place in the past. They will act with caution now. Q:What is your next big move?We are in the process of constituting a committee to investigate large-scale property registrations that have taken place across the state during the previous AIADMK regime. Q: Is there any link between such transactions and Kodanad burglary?Only investigations can confirm that. Q: Is the registration revenue hit hard by Covid-19?We are hopeful that the trend would change fast. Q: What are your plans for the commercial taxes department?Our target is 100% GST compliance. People evading taxes would be brought to book. Officials helping tax evaders will face action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-system-in-place-to-check-fraudulent-property-registrations/articleshow/86567106.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

---||Goa||No green nod, but construction of ayurveda college in Goa on||PANAJI: Construction work on the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) project at Dhargalim has been initiated in the state, without the project having been given any environment clearance. A request for approval for the project was received by the Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (Goa-SEIAA) only last month, following which an inspection of the site was scheduled. The violation in construction of the central government-funded project came to light during the inspection. The Goa-SEIAA has reserved its decision to grant any permissions until an environment impact assessment is carried out. “Project proponent to submit environment impact assessment report for causing destruction to environment as the construction has already started without obtaining prior environment clearance and hence it is a case of violation,” the Goa-SEIAA noted at its meeting. The foundation stone for the All India Institute of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy was laid by then Ayush minister Shripad Naik in November 2018. But environmental clearances are being sought now. The institute, under the ministry of Ayush, is coming up in an area of 2 lakh sqm. “The authority had conducted site inspection of the proposed site on August 17, wherein it was noted that the project proponent has not complied with additional entry and exit gates, considering the emergency and disaster, which cannot be ruled out,” the Goa-SEIAA stated at its meeting held last month. Earlier, the State Environment Impact Assessment Committee (SEIAC) had already asked for a detailed assessment of the environmental impact of the project. The committee has said that any trees being planted as part of the project should be of indigenous species. The project proponent has been asked to consult the Goa State Biodiversity Board on the choice of trees. Now the Goa-SEIAA has also said that plantation of trees at the site should be necessarily carried out in consultation with Goa State Biodiversity Board. “Project proponent to provide appropriate sewage treatment plant facility for labourers’ hutment engaged at the construction site,” the Goa-SEIAA has stated. The first phase of the national institute will be built at a cost of almost Rs 300 crore and at full capacity, it will have 500 seats on offer for students covering different programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-green-nod-but-construction-of-ayurveda-college-in-state-on/articleshow/86569282.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC notice to Centre, UT on plea challenging withdrawal of rules||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued a notice to the Union government and the UT administration on a petition challenging withdrawal of the Chandigarh Apartment Rules, 2001. Rakesh Kumar Sharma, a resident of Sector 8, and Amarjeet Singh, a resident of Sector 19, had filed the petition in the high court and demanded quashing of October 1, 2007, notification that withdraws Chandigarh Apartment Rules of 2001. The petitioners termed the 2007 notification as illegal, without jurisdiction and in violation of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners also demanded that instructions be issued to the Union government and the Chandigarh administration to allow the sale of a storey as an independent unit. Recently, the UT administration had submitted before the Punjab and Haryana high court that no NOC was issued mentioning property floor. On the high court directions, the UT administration had submitted an affidavit of the assistant estate officer (AEO) Harjeet Singh Sandhu.  “The estate office does not issue NOC mentioning a particular floor. No such NOC mentioning floor on the basis of share of owner/ co-owner was issued by the estate office as per records except ones which may have been issued on the basis of registered sale deeds executed while Chandigarh Apartment Rules, 2001, were in vogue,” affidavit read. Recently, the UT had submitted a survey report in connection with a petition challenging floor-wise registration. The report had revealed that many properties were sold to multiple owners and even to realtors and developers. The report stated that between August 28, 2016, and December 31, 2019, a total of 891 residential properties in sectors 4 to 46 were sold on 50%, 30% and 20% basis to those outside the family of the original owner or shareholder. Out of 891 properties, the team carried out physical verification of 281. The SC had, on September 6, directed the Punjab and Haryana high court to adjudicate the dispute related to floor-wise sale of properties in the city at the earliest, preferably within two weeks. The SC had also asked the UT administration to submit a survey report of properties within a week to the high court. Earlier, the apex court had stayed the directions of the high court related to the survey of estate office properties, where there had been transfer of shares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-centre-ut-on-plea-challenging-withdrawal-of-rules/articleshow/86567102.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Hyderabad||Disha probe: SIT chief Mahesh Bhagwat admits lapse in seizing arms register||HYDERABAD: Special Investigation Team (SIT) chief Mahesh Bhagwat has admitted before the SC-appointed commission, which is probing the alleged encounter killing of the Disha rape and murder accused, that not seizing the arms and ammunition register, containing entries of weapons reportedly snatched by the four from police, was in breach of the high court (HC) order. DCP Prakash Reddy and Wanaparthy SP K Apoorva Rao also appeared before the commission. On Monday, Bhagwat appeared before the commission to answer the question whether he or any SIT members had checked the fire arms and ammunition register at Amangal and Nandigama police stations. The SIT chief stated that investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy had checked the register at Armed Reserve Head Quarters in the Cyberabad commissionerate. As per the entries in the register, K Narasimha Reddy, CI of Amangal, and K Venkateshwarulu, SI of Nandigama PS, were issued 9 MM pistols along with live rounds on October 3, 2018. These two pistols were allegedly snatched from them by Md Arif and C Chennakeshavulu, two of the Disha rape and murder case accused, on December 6, 2019 at Chattanpally. In response to the subsequent questions from the commission, Bhagwat stated that the receipts pertaining to issuance of two pistols and ammunition were not seized by the IO as part of the investigation. The commission then asked Bhagwat, wouldn’t it amount to breach of the HC’s order, since the entries in the register have not been made part of the investigation papers and preserved for the commission? To which, Bhagwat responded stating, “Yes, it would amount to breach of the order.” Subsequently, in the evening, the arms and ammunition register, containing details of all the firearms used by the police party in relation to the alleged encounter killing case, was furnished before the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/disha-probe-sit-chief-admits-lapse-in-seizing-arms-register/articleshow/86567173.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Mumbai||Cannot treat LSD and its carrier material as separate, says court||MUMBAI: A special NDPS court on Monday rejected the bail plea of a 21-year-old Mumbai youth allegedly found in possession of 20 LSD blots weighing a commercial quantity in 2020.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), through its special public prosecutor Advait Sethna, said it had received information on November 22, 2020, that the accused was a drug peddler or trafficker and was going to deliver LSD and ganja to a client that evening. The NCB set up a team comprising zonal director Samir Wankhede, superintendent V V Singh and others to effect a raid. Rejecting his defence counsel Taraq Sayed’s submission regarding the need for separation of paper weight from the alleged weight of the drug, sessions judge M G Deshpande observed that LSD is a droplet on a small strip of paper, like blotting paper, which immediately absorbs it and once dried can be used for consumption “as a whole”. The judge said “Paper, gelatin are carrier materials. Paper contains fibre. Once the blot is dropped on paper, it occupies all fibres thereof. One who consumes LSD cannot separate the blot/droplet from the paper and requires to consume the whole mixture of blot/droplet and paper strip.” Sayed had also contended that the issue of calculation of exact weight of LSD with or without the blotting paper is pending before the Bombay HC. The trial court, however, cited the SC judgment in Hira Singh on weighing a mixture to decide its quantity, and also that age of the accused ought not to be taken into consideration for bail when the offence is of such grave nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cannot-treat-lsd-and-its-carrier-material-as-separate-says-court/articleshow/86570946.cms||Swati Deshpande

The NHRC team had made multiple maps of the crime scene, including one by a cop who drew it purely on memory a couple of days after visiting the encounter site. “Being a mature police officer, did you not consider it necessary to draw the map when you were at the spot? How can you prepare a sketch entirely depending on memory and that too on the second or third day after your visit in such a serious incident?” asked Sirpurkar to DSP Bimal Jit Uppal of NHRC team. The DSP claimed that he could not draw the map during the site visit on December 7, 2019, due a huge crowd and media. The DSP, who recorded the statement of seven witnesses including Shadnagar ACP V Surender and two other cops, K Ravi and R Balu, said that cops were told to mark their own position as well as that of other cops on the map. While another NHRC DSP Kulbir Singhm, who recorded the statements of three cops, admitted to state counsel that he failed to get initials of interpreters on statements. But he denied that cops were made to sign statements under threat when quizzed by advocate T Bala Mohan Reddy representing one of the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nhrc-team-under-fire-over-crime-scene-maps/articleshow/86567155.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Out of the 25 samples sent by the SN Medical College for serotyping analysis to KGMU in Lucknow, 13 have tested positive for the DENV-2 strain of dengue. These patients belonging to the age group 6 to 45 are undergoing treatment. According to the health department records, 149 dengue cases have surfaced in Agra in the last three weeks. Besides, 23 people suffering from viral fever and dengue symptoms have died in the district. Out of these, 19 were children. According to SNMC principal Dr Prashant Gupta, out of the four serotypes of the dengue virus that can cause infection, DENV-2 is the most potent and results in “hemorrhagic fever” among children. It can also lead to fatal internal bleeding and dengue shock syndrome in patients. “The symptoms caused by DENV-2 include continuous vomiting, abdominal pain, high-grade fever, weak pulse, restlessness, confusion, irritability, cold clammy skin, and bleeding gums and nose,” said Agra chief medical officer Arun Kumar Srivastav. “So far, one death due to dengue and 22 due to viral fever have been registered. A majority of these were children,” Srivastav added. The maximum number of deaths have been reported from Bah and Pinahat, Fatehpur Sikri in Agra rural, Tedi Bagia under Itmad-ud-daulah police station, Etmadpur and other areas of the district. Virendra Singh, a resident of Modipura village, said, “Every house in the village has a family member suffering from high fever and dengue symptoms. The community health centres are not admitting patients. The district hospital and SN Medical College are over 60 km away from the village. Patients are suffering at home.” Meanwhile, at least four more deaths of patients suffering from high fever were reported in the last 24 hours in Firozabad district. Besides, 2 died in Etah, one in Kasganj and 2 in Mainpuri. In the last one week, over two dozen deaths due to viral fever and dengue-like symptoms have also been reported in Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Meerut, Bareilly and districts of eastern UP. According to the health department officials, so far over 5,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra. Out of these, the majority are from Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus (a bacterial illness spread by larval mites) and leptospirosis (bacterial disease spread through the urine of infected animals) have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/13-test-positive-with-most-potent-denv-2-strain-of-dengue-23-dead-in-last-3-weeks/articleshow/86564965.cms||Deepak Lavania

The court also directed the authorities to regularise Singh’s admission. The July 8 communication came after Singh was already admitted and he had completed the first semester of his law degree course with A++ grade at the college, which took one more month to convey the CET cell’s decision on August 17. The CET cell had based its decision on the fact that Singh had been allotted the V N Patil college in the first round of admission in February. He secured his admission by paying the college fees but went on to participate in the second round of admission for a better preference without freezing his earlier allotted seat. Later, he returned to his first allotted college. It was the CET cell’s case that by participating in the second round his earlier allotment stood automatically cancelled as per the norms published in the admission brochure. Singh had moved the HC through his lawyer Vishnu Madan. “It would be too late now to cancel the admission of the petitioner,” the HC bench of Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice RN Ladha said in a ruling on September 22. “The mistake committed by the petitioner (Singh) appears to be that he did not freeze the seat and in the second round he was allotted a better preference college. He did not accept the same,” the bench said and observed the college as well as the (Aurangabad) university confirmed that Singh had appeared for the first semester examination and had cleared it securing A++ grade. “In case the admission of the petitioner with respondent no.4 (VN Patil law college) is cancelled, the same ought to have been communicated to the petitioner immediately,” the HC said. “It is not the case of the respondents (CET cell & others) that the petitioner is not eligible. It is also not the case that respondent no.4 college has admitted more students than the required strength allotted to it even if the admission of the petitioner is considered in respondent no.4 college,” the bench observed. “Considering the peculiar facts of the case and the fact that the petitioner is eligible, he was already admitted to respondent No.4 college, he had already paid the fees and submitted all the documents so as to completed the entire term of first semester and has also cleared 1st semester with A++ grade, we are inclined to protect his admission,” the bench ruled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cet-cells-move-to-cancel-law-students-admission-set-aside/articleshow/86562994.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nashik||Schools to be linked to health centres||Nashik: The Nashik Zilla Parishad has decided to link the schools in the rural areas with the local health centres to fulfil the criteria for starting physical classes for students of classes V to VII. The state government has announced starting of physical classes for students of classes V to VII in the rural areas and classes VIII to XII in urban areas. In the rural areas, physical classes for students of VIII to XII have already started to function. “The state government’s concern is that the health of the students attending the schools should be monitored. Hence, the school authorities has been asked to set up health centres. While this will not be possible, we will link the schools in the villages to the sub-primary health centres in the villages where the schools are located,” said a senior officer from the Nashik ZP. The officer said the detailed meeting to decide on the ways and means to monitor the health of the students will be held on Friday as offline classes are set to restart from October 4. The health monitoring is limited to any child feeling uneasy in the school. In such a case, the help of local Asha workers will also be taken. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for the schools will be announced once the decision on the same is taken, the officer said. In the case of starting the schools in the urban areas, the health authorities said the health staff of the primary health centres can be attached to some of the schools but not all. “We will ask the private schools to get the help of local doctors for their health centres as asked to be done by the state government,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/schools-to-be-linked-to-health-centres/articleshow/86563054.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The deceased has been identified as Sameer Bhandari, a native of Haldwani in district Nainital, currently deputed at the police lines. Police suspect that the cop took the extreme due to a feud going on in his family. “Bhandari was found hanging from a ceiling hook in his room by his wife. He was rushed to the hospital but pronounced dead by the doctors,” said Superintendent of Police (SP) City, Mamata Vohra. Bhandari’s wife told the cops that he was in an inebriated state and while she had gone to the terrace to pick the washed clothes at around 7:30 pm, he hanged himself. A probe has been launched in the incident, said SP Vohra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/us-nagar-cop-hangs-self/articleshow/86564997.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Delhi||Nod unlikely for Ramlila celebrations||New Delhi: Considering the prevailing Covid-19 scenario, clouds of uncertainty continue to hang over Ramlila programmes, which are scheduled to start from October 6 and end on October 16. It’s still not clear whether Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) will permit the Ramlila committees to organise the traditional performance of Ramayana. Ramlila is organised at around 700 places in the capital of which nearly 500 are done on a small scale, while the performance is grand at 60 places. DDMA is likely to take a final call this week. A Delhi government official said due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, experts have advised that festivals should be celebrated in a simple way and gatherings should be avoided. “During the celebrations, mass gatherings are witnessed, which can make it challenging to enforce social distancing and other norms. It’s unlikely that DDMA will grant permission because a little laxity can undo the gains made in Covid management,” added the official. As Covid-19 cases have gone down significantly over the past few months, the government has permitted almost all economic activities and even schools for senior classes have been reopened. Business-to-customer exhibitions, which were closed for over 18 months, have also been permitted. This has ignited hope among Ramlila committees that DDMA will give them permission to host the event. Arjun Kumar, secretary, Lav Kush Ramlila Committee, one of the oldest committees in Delhi that has been organising Ramlila at Red Fort for years, said DDMA might permit them to host the event owing to an improved Covid-19 situation and extensive vaccination coverage. Over 1.7 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far. “We have already been allotted the space to organise Ramlila. We have also put up a temporary tent at the site and artistes have been lined up. New songs have been made and dance troupes are ready. As soon as permission is granted by DDMA, we will make the final arrangements,” added Kumar. Last year, no Ramlila was organised because DDMA gave permission at the last moment. As the committees had made no arrangements in advance, it became very difficult for them to fulfill the conditions put forth for holding the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nod-unlikely-for-ramlila-celebrations/articleshow/86567301.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Meerut||ASI finds 2k-yr-old Mauryan brick platform, could hold clues to ‘lost’ Ashoka Pillar site||Meerut: For years, the remains lay unnoticed in the midst of the bustling city of Meerut. At first glance, there was nothing distinctive about it — so much so that a part of it was destroyed when a power house came up over it. Now, after the Meerut circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was created just last year, the remains have been identified as those of a Mauryan-period brick platform going back over 2,000 years. And it could hold the key to a “lost” Ashoka Pillar site from the 3rd century BCE. “A large part of the structure is in the form of a 30m by 35m platform at Vikas Puri near the power house. The ancient site is undoubtedly one from the Mauryan period because the bricks are typical of the era,” Meerut circle superintending archaeologist Brajsundar Gadnayak said. The dimensions of the bricks are unique to the Mauryan period — 42cm x 26cm x 8cm. “We have also found pottery and ceramics belonging to those times,” Gadnayak added. Mauryan pottery, known as Northern Black Polished Ware, often has a red hue, like the ones found at the Meerut site. An ancient canal route here that, most likely, connects to the Kali river has also been found. The finding has rekindled hopes that it could lead historians to a pillar installed in Meerut around 3rd century BCE by Ashoka, the third emperor of the Mauryan dynasty. Historian Dr KK Sharma, witness to the 2006 excavation of the Sinauli burial site, said, “The Gazetteer (of 1904) mentions the reinstallation of Meerut’s pillar at the Delhi Ridge but we have not been able to find the original site here.” The Meerut Gazetteer he referred to, compiled by ICS officer HR Nevill, said, “The earliest historical connection which can be made with the (Meerut) district is the erection of an Asoka pillar near Meerut … On the ridge at Dehli (Delhi) now stands a pillar which, according to Shams-i-Siraj, was removed from near the town of Meerut and set up in the Kushak Shikar or hunting palace. The site originally occupied by the pillar has not been identified.” Could this be that site? Gadnayak said more needs to be unearthed before answering that. “We cannot say anything with certainty unless we begin excavation here. The fact that it is a Mauryan site itself is quite an exciting development,” he added. “It’s possible that it is the original site of the pillar. But then, it’s premature to say that with authenticity."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/asi-finds-2k-yr-old-mauryan-brick-platform-could-hold-clues-to-lost-ashoka-pillar-site/articleshow/86565007.cms||Sandeep Rai

The HC bench of Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice RN Laddha said on September 21, “The state, in exceptional circumstances and for the reasons to be recorded in writing, can consider the proposals negatively recommended by the university. In the present cases, while issuing the LoI to respondent college, the state government has not recorded the reasons in writing and has not carved out any exceptional circumstance. The state government has considered the proposal negatively recommended by the university.” Sanjay Jadhav, secretary of Sanjanu Shikshan Prasarak Mandal at Rohilagad, had filed the writ petition through his lawyer Sandeep Rajebhosale pointing out that the state granted the LoI to the Tilokchand Kuche Shikshan Prasarak Mandal (TLKSPM) for starting new senior college. Jadhav pleaded that the TLKSPM does not possess the required area of land and a fixed deposit of Rs7 lakh, which is necessary, as per a Government Resolution, to be deposited at the time of issuance of proposal, was withdrawn within a fortnight of issuance of the LoI. Besides, BAMU had negatively recommended the proposal. Lawyer D P Palodkar, appearing for TLKSPM, submitted that the college had the required land and the fixed deposit was withdrawn inadvertently due to some confusion.” The HC while keeping the option open for future application for the college, observed, “In the present case, now the final permission to respondent college has been refused on the ground of the deficiencies not complied with. We find that, even LoI issued to respondent college was not in accordance with the procedure laid down under Section 108(1)(e) of the Maharashtra Universities Act.” “The LoI issued to respondent college is also set aside. The letter of intent issued to respondent college would be inoperative. The final permission is also refused,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-negates-states-loi-to-ambad-society/articleshow/86563115.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Highlighting the digital initiatives taken by the government in the past few years, Modi also praised the CoWin platform that played a “big role” in administration of over 86 crore doses of Covid vaccines. The strong vindication comes against the backdrop of reports that UK has raised doubts over reliability of India’s vaccine certification. “Today is a very important day. The drive to strengthen health facilities of the country, in the last seven years, is entering a new phase...” he said. The drive to strengthen health facilities of the country, in the last seven years, is entering a new phase. This is not an ordinary phase. This is an extraordinary phase,” Modi said. The PM said the digital mission will play a big role in eliminating problems in providing medical treatment to the poor and the middle class. The pilot project of the mission was announced by the PM from the Red Fort on August 15, 2020 and has been implemented in six Union territories. Underlining that the Mission will enable access and exchange of health records of citizens with their consent, the PM said the digital ecosystem will also ensure ease of doing business for doctors, hospitals and healthcare service providers. Under the mission, a unique digital health ID will be provided to people, which will contain health records of the person and enable interoperability within the digital health system. Any public hospital, community health centre or health and wellness centre across the country, or any healthcare provider included in the health infrastructure registry, will be able to support an individual in obtaining a health ID. Patients can also obtain a health ID by self-registration from a mobile or a web application. To create the ID, the individual will need to provide their basic individual, demographic and contact information to the consent manager at the concerned health facility. People will also have a choice to link their health ID with Aadhaar if they wish to. This ID will be applicable across states, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and pharmacies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/all-citizens-will-get-digital-health-id-pm-modi/articleshow/86572253.cms||Sushmi Dey

The decision on other details like the maximum number of passes that would be issued daily and the darshan timings will be taken in a few days before the temple reopens,”said Banayat. The online system of issuance of darshan passes to the devotees was extremely well implemented by the SSST management before the temple was closed during the Covid second wave. The trust has an online booking portal, where the visitors have to log in and book their passes. According to her, the trust management will have to take decisions keeping in mind that Ahmednagar district, which houses the temple, is continuing to register fresh cases daily. Banayat has directed the officials to ensure devotees adhere to all Covid safety protocols when they are allowed for darshan. “Our staff will be equipped with thermal scanners to check the temperature of the devotees once they enter the temple for darshan. Moreover, social distancing norm and wearing of masks will be mandatory,” she said. In case any devotee is found to have a temperature, he or she would be referred to the SSST doctor for medical examination.

According to the preliminary probe, Anupam Krishi, the firm owned by Gehlot, was engaged in alleged illegal export of potash in league with Saraf Impex Pvt Ltd. Anupam Krishi was the origin of the exports made by Saraf Impex. The total illegal exports of MOP (muriate of potash) was around 30,000 tonnes worth Rs 130 crore. Agrasain Gehlot is accused of receiving a huge commission, according to the showcause notice issued by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) that had earlier investigated the case and filed a chargesheet. The ED case is based on the chargesheet filed by the DRI. The agency has already questioned Anupam Gehlot, son of Agrasain, besides some other agents involved in the scam related to the illegal export. However, before the agency could question him for his role in the scam, Agrasain Gehlot had moved the Rajasthan High Court seeking to prevent coercive action by the agency. The court gave him some relief but asked him to cooperate with the investigation. Agrasain Gehlot didn’t respond to TOI's query. According to the chargesheet filed earlier, Agrasain was imposed a penalty of around Rs 60 crore for illegal receipts from the scam that took place around 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlots-brother-appears-beforeed-in-rs-130-crore-fertiliser-scam/articleshow/86569405.cms||---

Tribunal chairperson Justice Indira Jain and member S S Sandhu was hearing an appeal by a builder whose counsel submitted that he had complied with a February order. But advocate Abhijit Mangade, for the buyer, disputed saying only a principal amount was deposited. The tribunal, on perusing the compliance affidavit, said it was apparent that the builder “has not fully complied with the order.” The counsel then sought time, which the tribunal granted till September 30 subject to Rs 50,000 being deposited, “failing which the appeal” shall automatically be treated as dismissed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-50k-cost-imposed-on-builder-told-to-comply-with-maharera-order/articleshow/86570960.cms||---

A team of the Special Operations Group (SOG) nabbed the two persons while they were on way to Rajasthan from here in a private bus, he said. The bus was coming from Ahmedabad. Acting on a tip-off, the SOG team headed by inspector D R Gadhvi searched the bus and apprehended the two accused, Gorkharam Jat and Jogaram Jat, both hailing from Barmer in Rajasthan, and seized 260 gm of the contraband worth Rs 26 lakh from their possession, the official said.

The accused have been booked under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, the official said. Last week, in the single largest heroin haul in India, authorities seized around 3,000 kg of the drug, believed to be from Afghanistan and worth abour Rs 21,000 crore in the global market, from two containers at the Mundra port in Gujarat's Kutch district, officials earlier said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-held-with-drugs-worth-rs-26l-in-palanpur/articleshow/86565105.cms||---

The SAP is the rate sugar mills pay to farmers while procuring the highly perishable crop. Farmers in the poll-bound state, who have seen cultivation costs escalate, said it’s not nearly enough. “The cost of sugarcane cultivation has gone up by Rs 70 per quintal because of the increase in diesel price, power, labour costs and fertiliser prices. Increasing Rs 25 after four years doesn’t even recover the costs we have incurred in these years,” said Nemi Sharan, a farmer from Bijnor. The last time the state had increased sugar SAP was in 2017, soon after BJP came to power, by Rs 10. With another assembly election round the corner and against the backdrop of the ongoing farmers’ protest, the hike was seen as a political move. “Is it a poll strategy? Are we just a vote bank? Adding Rs 25 in four years is a joke,” said Kuldeep Tyagi, president of Bhartiya Kisan Andolan. The farmers want a bigger increase to Rs 425 per quintal. “Even a smaller state like Haryana pays sugarcane farmers Rs 362 a quintal. Both have the same party in power. Why the disparity?” asked Naveen Pradhan, a Meerut-based farmer. In the past — 2009 in Bijnor, 2018 in Muzaffarnagar, 2019 in Lucknow — farmers have set sugarcane crops on fire in UP to protest against what they say is a low SAP. Besides the money itself, sugarcane farmers also demand a time-bound payment structure. The rules say payment must be made within 14 days, but farmers say this is often not followed. “Because of delayed payment, farmers are forced to take loans and keep paying interest. Mills hold up dues for as long as six to seven months sometimes, but the farmer doesn’t get any compensation for the delay,” said Satbir Singh, a farmer from Amroha. “The government should look into this.” The opposition amplified the protest on social media. “That the BJP government in UP increased cane support prices in the election year is a selfish move. For four-and-a-half years this government kept ignoring the farmers,” BSP chief Mayawati tweeted. In 2011, the Mayawati-led government had announced a Rs 40 per quintal hike, TOI had reported at the time. The following year, the Akhilesh Yadav government had done the same after coming to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cultivation-cost-up-rs-70/quintal-in-4-yrs-sap-hike-of-rs-25/quintal-minuscule-up-cane-farmers/articleshow/86565115.cms||Sandeep Rai

Child rights activists have pointed out serious flaws in the functioning of the state-run facility in terms of security and admission process. Appasaheb Ugale, the project director of NGO Childline of Marathwada Gramin Vikas Sanstha, said the government observation home appears to have very poor security arrangements. “The two incidents of juveniles fleeing from the observation home has exposed the porous security apparatus of the crucial childcare facility. The incidents leave scope for suspicion about whether the children housed at government observation home are even properly counselled during their stay,” he said. Ugale also said that children in need of care and protection and juveniles in conflict with the law often struggle to get temporary shelter due to the alleged procedural delays involved in seeking refuge in the observation home. Located in the Hudco area of the city, the government observation home has the capacity to accommodate 50 children. As per the official record, it is sheltering around 28 juveniles at the moment. When contacted, government observation home superintendent Vijay Vighne said on Monday that the proposal to deploy four police personnel had been submitted to the city police. “At present, we have only one policeman, who is deployed on duty during the night hours. Increased manpower would ensure proper vigil,” he said. Vighne refuted the charges of procedural delays in admitting children to the observation home. “During the ongoing pandemic, we have been asked to admit children only after they have undergone Covid testing. This could have led to issues in a few cases. In general, we are operating round-the-clock to admit the children as per the laid down procedure,” he said. Manohar Banswal, the acting president of the Child Welfare Committee of Aurangabad, said serious cognizance has been taken of the two recent incidents of children fleeing the observation home. “We have asked the authorities at government observation home to have a fact-finding exercise and take measures to avoid such incidents in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/experts-find-flaws-in-govt-observation-homes-working/articleshow/86563151.cms||Prasad Joshi

Chief minister Channi and his two deputies Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and OP Soni were administered oath by Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit earlier on September 20 after which the Congress took six days to finalise the council of ministers during which Channi made back-to-back trips to Delhi for discussion with the party high command. Finally, with a last-minute replacement, 15 cabinet ministers, including eight who were part of the earlier Amarinder Singh-led cabinet, took oath on Sunday. As if it was not enough, the delay in announcing the portfolios of the council of ministers is reflecting on the decisiveness of the chief minister and the pressure on him from different quarters. This is at such a crucial time when the Congress government hardly has three months to fulfil its promises before the election code of conduct will come into force for the next state assembly polls scheduled in February. The chief minister even chaired a 3-hour meeting of his cabinet on Monday morning and thereafter hosted a lunch for his cabinet colleagues. It is learnt that the chief minister was sitting in the office till late evening on Monday and also held a meeting with deputy chief minister Randhawa to finalise the portfolios because of the issues over allocation of some of the key departments. Sources in the Congress claim that PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu is unhappy as Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra has not been accommodated in the cabinet. Also, Sidhu was pushing the case of senior advocate Deepinder Singh Patwalia for the post of advocate general but finally the state government issued the notification of senior advocate Amar Preet Singh Deol for the post on Monday. But Mohammad Mustafa, former DGP rank officer and principal strategic advisor to Sidhu, said that the selection of the cabinet and allocation of portfolios is chief minister’s prerogative and chief minister can anytime seek advice from the AICC or the PPCC chief.  “The chief minister might take some time but the Congress leadership conventionally does not interfere with what is the prerogative of the chief minister,” he said. “Sidhu is a wise man and he knows he is boss of the party. He doesn’t interfere. Why would he be upset?” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cabinet-ministers-yet-to-get-portfolios/articleshow/86569442.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi curtails security of ministers||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday asked his cabinet ministers to keep their security personnel at the barest minimum as per the guidelines as he had already curtailed his own security to curb the VIP culture. While chairing the first reconstituted cabinet meeting, Channi said this initiative would not only be instrumental in deployment of extra security personnel judiciously but also save the general public from unnecessary inconvenience.  To provide easy access to the elected representatives like sarpanchs, municipal councillors and others, the council of ministers decided to issue an entry card from the office of deputy commissioner or SDM concerned and they (holders of such cards) would be allowed hassle free entry in state government offices and civil secretariats in Chandigarh. The chief minister also asked the administrative secretaries and heads of various departments to prepare an action plan to implement their development projects and welfare schemes in a time bound and holistic manner in a comprehensive roadmap. To assure a clean, transparent and fair administration to the people, the chief minister asked the ministers to perform to the best of their capabilities to repose trust in the state government. Now the ministers would have to work overtime so as to come up to the expectations of the people, given the fact that hardly four months are left for the next assembly polls, said Channi. The chief minister also placed on record deep appreciation to former chief minister Amarinder Singh and his cabinet colleagues for implementation of pro-people initiatives and overall development works in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-curtails-security-of-ministers/articleshow/86569473.cms||---
---||Kochi||Drive to curb ‘foreigner’ norms violation||Thiruvananthapuram: The office of the foreigners’ regional registration officer (FRRO) has started a massive drive against people who have registered their houses as “individual houses”, but are being misused for operating as commercial establishments that are providing services to foreign nationals, including their accommodation. As per the estimates of FRRO’s office based on the mandatory Form C required to be submitted to the bureau of immigration (BoI), there are over 3,000 such houses in the district alone, which have been identified as having possibly accommodated foreign nationals. As per law, any hotel, guest house, individual houses, resorts, service apartments, etc that provide accommodation to foreigners must submit details of foreigner residing in them in Form C at the FRRO’s office within 24 hours of the arrival of the foreigner on their premises. But there are also several such stays that have been evading the mandatory commercial registration procedures for such businesses (and instead use the provision for “individual house” that allows stays for a foreigner in a house if the person is a blood relative or having a relationship through marriage) so that the fee for registration, power tariff at commercial rate, taxes, etc can be saved. “The commercial establishments need to have their proper documentation as per the existing laws and rules pertaining to the local self-government bodies. We have the records of more than 3,000 houses that have housed foreigners, a majority of which have entertained foreigners on a commercial basis. We have sent a communication to all of them to submit their mandatory details within 14 days,” FRRO (Thiruvananthapuram) Aravind Menon said. All such houses found operating on commercial basis without adhering to the rules, had been given intimation and have been given time till Sept 30, 2021, to rectify the anomalies, failing which they will be penalized. “If there is any request by individuals to extend the deadline, the same will be considered on a case-to-case basis,” he said. As per Section 7 of the Foreigners Act 1946, it is the duty of the “keeper of the premises who accommodated the foreigners” to provide details in the prescribed format to the authorities. As per section 14, those who contravene the provisions can be punished with imprisonment which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine. FRRO’s office is planning to launch a similar drive on C-Form submission in Kollam and Pathanamthitta, which falls under the jurisdiction of FRRO, Thiruvananthapuram. In another drive, BoI has begun informing all foreigners residing in the country even after their visa has expired to either extend the stay in the country after remitting the mandatory fee or leave the country, as the term of free visa offered by the Centre will come to a close on September 30. The Centre had announced the extension of visas for all foreign nationals stranded in the country due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic till September 30. This visa, termed GRATIS visa, has been in force from March 2020. As per this, foreigners were not required to submit an application to the FRRO concerned for visa extension. The capital has a large number of foreignersstaying for various purposes, including medical requirements, business purposes and education. While those valid ones will get extension, those who cannot prove the genuineness of the overstay, will be slapped a fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/drive-to-curb-foreigner-norms-violation/articleshow/86565130.cms||KP Saikiran

Across the state, around 500 people were taken into preventive custody after protests. Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union comprising representatives of entire transport and delivery service industry staged protests in city in response to bandh call given by farmers demanding repealing of three farm laws of the Centre.

The core sectors of health and education should be prioritised so as to provide the best and affordable healthcare facilities to the people besides imparting quality education to students especially in rural areas, the chief minister said while chairing the first meeting of the administrative secretaries. “I am soft and gentle but please don’t mistake my gentleness for something that will let inaction go unnoticed. I will act against those who won’t act for the common people,” warned the chief minister. He emphasised that there must be zero tolerance against corruption at all costs and the works of common man should be done on priority. Justice should be delivered to every citizen irrespective of his caste, creed and community, he added. The chief minister also asked the administrative secretaries to inform him if anyone approaches them for any wrongdoing by using his name. The chief minister also made it clear to the administrative secretaries to give due respect to ministers, MLAs and elected representatives while ensuring that rule of law should be the only criterion for decision-making. He asked them to ensure timely completion of ongoing projects besides implementing welfare measures so the last man standing in the line could avail the benefits.  Channi also asked the administrative secretaries to follow employee friendly approach to resolve their issues amicably so that they should not resort to agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-tells-admin-secretaries-to-prepare-100-day-roadmap/articleshow/86569499.cms||---

What started as a drizzle during early morning hours turned into intense spell of rainfall by evening under the influence of cyclone Gulab. The rainfall led to massive water-logging in many parts of the city. Following the IMD forecast, the city was under a high alert on Monday and police as well as civic body authorities were seen addressing rain-related issues. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) figures up to 10 pm, Rajendranagar recorded highest rainfall of 111.5 mm followed by 97 mm at Sivarampalle, 80.8 mm at Sardarmahal, 78.8 mm at Gachibowli, 77.8 mm at Lingampally, 75.5 mm at Madhapur, 74.8 mm at Cherlapally and Kapra among others.

While the latest incident was reported on Saturday night, wherein a 35-year-old fell into an open drain in Manikonda, records show that at least seven such incidents occurred across Hyderabad, over the last two years, leading to seven deaths. Last year’s flash floods too resulted in overflowing of nalas, loss of lives, inundation of colonies and houses. Despite this, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation has not completed the construction of retaining walls or fencing along nalas and capping of open drains. Last year, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao had sanctioned Rs 298 crore to GHMC for taking up 472 drain work projects, which are less than two metres wide, across the twin cities. KTR had directed officials to start capping and start repair works on open nalas to avoid untoward incidents during monsoon. But a quick check on the ground reveals that there’s been barely any progress. “About 20% of works have been completed but we are yet to receive tenders for most of them,” said a GHMC official, on condition of anonymity. While the GHMC’s chief engineer (maintenance) was not available for a response, chief engineer of the Strategic Nala Development wing of GHMC, Dr C Vasantha, said, “All open nalas will be a part of SNDP works in case we take up the restoration of that particular nala. The rest of the works fall under the purview of the area zonal commissioner or the engineer.” She added: “As far as the SNDP is concerned, we have not taken up complete restoration of any nala so far. The agencies for Hussain Sagar nala are ready and once the rains recede, we will take up work and see that all safety measures are in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nala-work-dragging-despite-fund-injection/articleshow/86568215.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Mumbai||Funds-strapped Maharashtra faces Rs 700 crore payout for Covid||MUMBAI: With almost 1.4 lakh Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic began, the cash-strapped Maharashtra government is looking at a payout of over Rs 700 crore in terms of compensation from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). This, after the Centre fixed an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to families of Covid victims in the Supreme Court, to be paid by states from the fund. With the SDRF already stretched with payouts for Covid relief and natural calamities, the state is likely to ask the Centre to increase its contribution to the SDRF, said sources. The SDRF receives 75% of its funds from the Centre and 25% from the state. The state executive committee (SEC), which administers the relief expenditure of the SDRF, is expected to meet and look at this issue. Since Maharashtra recorded the highest number of Covid cases and fatalities in the country, it is the state which will face the highest payout through the SDRF. The SDRF is of around Rs 4,200 crore. Of this, the state has already spent roughly Rs 1,600 crore on Covid relief measures in various districts. Also, the state has faced multiple natural calamities, for which payouts are made from the SDRF. “After the heavy rains and cyclones this year, the SDRF has faced huge demands,” said a senior official. Maharashtra has a debt of over Rs 6 lakh crore and has borne the brunt of the pandemic. “Since it is a case before the SC, we will be bound to give the payout. But the SDRF will be exhausted with payments for various natural calamities and the burden will come on the state budget,” said a senior official. The Centre informed the Supreme Court about the ex-gratia amount fixed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The Supreme Court had been prodding the Centre to declare a compensation amount since Covid had been declared a national disaster under the National Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-funds-strapped-state-faces-rs-700cr-payout-for-covid/articleshow/86564255.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Amritanandamayi along with over 500 inmates of the Ashram joined the prayers. Speaking on the occasion, she said the pandemic that was gripping the world should be considered as an opportunity for empowering ourselves. Marking the beginning of the various rituals, ‘Gurupadapooja’ was performed on the day. She said we have to consider the pandemic as an outcome of what we have collectively done to Mother Nature over the years. In such a scenario, blaming a section of people or a particular country would be pointless. “Whether the outcome is good or bad, we have to shoulder the responsibility for the deeds we have committed in the past. If we could think like that, we can start efforts for a better tomorrow,” she added. “This opportunity calls for self-empowering. Strengthen the power or our own self. Strengthen our will and perseverance. Everyone should work for all and all should work for everyone,” she said in her birthday message. “There should be a mind to share what we have with others. Our life should become a ‘yagna’ to wipe out tears of sorrowing human kind. Such a yagna would purify our minds,” she said. Exhorting all her devotees and followers to grow from the feeling of ‘I’ to ‘we’, she asked them to construct a bridge of love and cooperation to make the world a seamless global family. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Mutt could not organize the birthday as a gala event as in the past.

Drains were found overflowing across areas such as Barkas, Chandrayangutta, Aliyabad, Bahadurpra, Malakpet, Kalapather, Nawab Sahab Kuntta, Hasan Nagar, Rajendar Nagar, Karwan etc, leaving locals stranded and the roads for hours. Motorists commuting through busy areas including Bahadurpura, Rajendernagar, Nampally, Mallepally, Mehdipatnam among others had a particularly tough time as the stretches were inundated, throwing traffic completely out of gear. People were also scared about old buildings and houses collapsing, especially after last year’s incident reported from Hussaini Alam area. In October 2020, following extremely heavy rainfall, a house in Moosa Bowli collapsed, leaving two members of a family dead and five others injured. Subsequently, authorities had identified all houses that are in a dilapidated state in the area and served eviction notices to the owners. The heavy downpour adversely impacted vendors in the area too as they were forced to stay indoors. “Our earnings have taken a serious beating because of the rain. But we have still decided to be indoors as there is more rain predicted over the next two days,” said Imran, one vendor that TOI spoke to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/several-parts-of-old-city-witness-waterlogging-motorists-stranded/articleshow/86568277.cms||---

---||Delhi||Stay close to Delhi Metro station, bus stop? Your parking slot will be crunched||NEW DELHI: With the policy for dynamic parking norms in Delhi notified by the central government last week, the municipal corporations, which are the implementing agencies, will have to ensure that a parking space permitted in floor plans is reduced by 30% for a property located 500 metres from a Delhi Metro station and by 15% if sited 800 metres from a metro station. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official added that if the property was located a kilometre from a multi-level car parking space, then the parking allowance in the floor area ratio would be reduced by 10%. The policy will be applicable for group housing societies, guesthouses, schools, community halls, studio apartments, properties on Asaf Ali Road and state bhawans. “Earlier, the estimated car space (ECS) was calculated on the basis of built-up area. The new modifications mean ECS will be a factor of the floor area ratio of a residential unit,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, remunerative and project cell, SDMC. “The policy was implemented after Delhi Development Authority and the civic bodies insisted on allowing only 40% as total parking demand in an area, especially commercial ones, located close to metro stations and other public transport systems.” TOI contacted DDA for details and comments, but received no reply. Till now, space to park two vehicles was allowed in residential units in group housing with a 100 sq metre built-up area. In case of service personnel housing or economically weaker sections flats, the allowance was 0.5 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area. The modified allowance for dwelling units of less than 40 sqm in EWS or service personnel housing plots is now 0.5 ECS. For dwelling units measuring between 40 sqm and 100 sqm, 1 ECS will be permitted, 2 for those measuring between 100 sqm and 200 sqm. For properties sized over 200 sqm, 2 ECS + 1 per every additional 100 sqm will be allowed. For hostels, guesthouses, lodged, etc, which currently have parking space of 2 ECS per 100 sqm of built-up area, the new spaces allowed will be 0.5 ECS per 100 sqm of FAR and deduction as per distance from metro station. These revised parking norms will become applicable for all properties whose construction hasn’t begun, even if the plans have been approved by the local body. The Centre’s notification says, “In all such cases where the plans have already been approved, the properties may be developed with these revised norms and the local body concerned may be informed of the same in writing. No separate permission for the same is needed to be taken.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said that the policy balances the concept of demand management for vehicles. “So far, we were working on the tradition of increasing parking capacity to meet rising demand, an infinite process and impossible to fully meet,” she said. “Already, 33% of Delhi’s geographical area is used for roads and parking. A survey a few years ago said that going by the rate of registration of new vehicles, the city would require 430 football grounds for parking every year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stay-close-to-metro-stn-bus-stop-your-parking-slot-will-be-crunched/articleshow/86567519.cms||Vibha Sharma

Gati, Tej, Murasu, Aag, Vyom, Jhar, Probaho, Neer, Prabhanjan, Ghurni, Ambud, Jaladhi, and Vega are the Indian names approved by a panel comprising 13 nations. There are six regional specialized meteorological centres (RSMCs) and five regional Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs) mandated for issuing advisories and naming of tropical cyclones across the globe. Indian Meteorological Department is one of the six RSMCs to provide tropical cyclones in the Indian ocean region and provides advisories to 13-member countries, including Bangladesh, India, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. In 2020, a new list of names was released that had 169 names of cyclones, having 13 suggested names each from 13 countries. In the past, many cyclones were given Indian names. Agni, Akash, Bijli, Jal, Lehar, Megh, Sagar, and Vayu are among the names. Some of the recent cyclones have been given Pakistani names like Laila and Nilam. The naming of cyclones is a difficult process that adheres to a strict set of rules. According to those norms, the suggested name should be politically and ideologically neutral in terms of religious beliefs, cultures, and gender. The name’s maximum length will be eight letters. The names are picked in such a way that it does not offend any group of people around the world. Gfx Other factors in naming cyclones The name should not be unpleasant or cruel in nature. It should be short and easy to say. If any of the aforementioned conditions are not met, the member countries have the right to reject any name. The finalised names may also be reviewed during the implementation process with the agreement of the panels if any member raises a justifiable objection. Tropical cyclone names across the north Indian Ocean will not be repeated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-pakistans-gulab-india-selects-13-names-for-upcoming-cyclones/articleshow/86568411.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Chandigarh||Channi cannot crackdown on sand mafia by sitting with Rana Gurjit: Cheema||Chandigarh: Taking a dig at Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for announcing that sand mafia should not try to meet him, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema termed the announcement as hollow as Rana Gurjit Singh has been inducted in the cabinet. Cheema said, “When the kingpin of the mining mafia is sitting in the cabinet, then such claims of chief minister Channi about the sand mafia are nothing but misleading the people.” He said the inclusion of corrupt and tainted leaders in the cabinet has proved that Congress cannot change its character even by changing faces. “The entry of senior ministers in the cabinet has also blown away Channi’s claim in which he had said that either he will remain or the corrupt will be there,” he added. Cheema argued that the tainted ministers are not only being opposed by the opposition party, but even the ruling Congress MLAs are speaking against them. Cheema said the letter written by the Congress MLAs to Sonia Gandhi has corroborated AAP’s allegations. The AAP leader said that had the chief minister stuck to his anti-corruption claim, he would not have allowed the entry of tainted ministers in the cabinet at any cost. But Channi has succumbed to the Congress high command and “self-styled super CM” Navjot Singh Sidhu for his chair, he said. Cheema added that the entry of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Rana Gurjit Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Gurkirat Singh Kotli in the cabinet has put Channi, Sidhu and the Gandhi family in the dock. The AAP leader further said that apart from controversies related to Ludhiana land mafia, Ashu also controls the mandi mafia worth Rs 10,000 crore. “The gang selling wheat/paddy from outside states and selling it in mandis of Punjab is causing huge loss to the exchequer and the farmers of Punjab, has the patronage of Ashu,” alleged Cheema.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-cannot-crackdown-on-sand-mafia-by-sitting-with-rana-gurjit-cheema/articleshow/86569515.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Eye on polls: Now NMC to issue tenders sans admn approval||NAGPUR: In a bid to woo voters in view of the upcoming municipal elections, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) general body on Monday decided to start tendering process of works even without administrative approval. The general body also decided to complete long-pending works of street lights and sewage lines. Acknowledging complaints of corporators about long-pendency of works and only three months left for the elections, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the administration to avoid the process of seeking approval from the standing committee before issuing a tender. “Several works were approved by the general body during the budget. Therefore, the administration should consider all these works as deemed to be approved. Send the list of works to the standing committee just for the information. Issue tender and go for short tenders in case of emergency works and start implementation,” he said. Code of conduct for municipal elections is likely to come into effect in the first week of January 2022. As per norms, the administration needs approval from the civic chief and then from the standing committee before going for tendering. Tenders of a majority of works proposed in the budget of the current fiscal are pending. Therefore, the decision has been taken to speed up the matter. Tiwari also directed the administration to complete the proposed work of the street lights within 60 days. This work was pending for over one year. The mayor also directed the administration to complete works of repairing and laying sewage lines by preparing a timeline. In the last 18 months, no work of sewage lines was carried out. Tiwari had convened the special meeting of the general body on Monday to discuss NMC’s financial position and to assess status of works that were proposed in the budget. BJP corporator Dr Ravindra Bhoyar alleged huge loss to the cash-strapped NMC in awarding work to lay sewage lines. “Laying of sewage lines is done as per requirement. As the work relates to public hygiene, these works need to be carried out immediately,” he said. For the first time, a large number of works were kept pending, which resulted in severe inconvenience to the citizens, he said. “Many works were clubbed together and tender of Rs27 crore was issued. It was done to favour a particular private agency. The tender was awarded to the agency despite it quoting 26% above the estimated price, causing loss to the NMC. Now, the same agency has appointed petty contractors at 36% below the estimated price of the NMC. The petty contractors are doing inferior quality works,” he alleged. Over this, the mayor directed the administration to hold a meeting with the contractor as soon as possible. On the revenue and expenditure side, the administration informed the House that the civic body has earned Rs1,073 crore in the current fiscal, apart from last fiscal’s surplus balance of Rs117 crore, while expenditure was Rs994 crore till date from April 1 onwards. Tiwari also suggested new sources to boost revenue. “The civic body has adopted duct policy a few years ago. It is mandatory for private agencies to pay and lay power/ optical cables in NMC’s ducts only. Therefore, the administration should stop giving permission for digging of roads. This will help civic body earn revenue, apart from preventing damage to roads,” he said. Tiwari also directed the administration to study how other municipal corporations are earning revenue from mobile towers. “NMC cannot remove mobile towers and also cannot regularize them. Some corporations have implemented a novel concept through which they are earning Rs150-200 crore per annum,” he said. The mayor also said that NMC should start recovering charges from shops for advertisement boards erected in the front as the policy is already in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eye-on-polls-now-nmc-to-issue-tenders-sans-admn-approval/articleshow/86565192.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Unlike BJP’s move to replace the entire cabinet in Gujarat along with the chief minister to shrug off anti-incumbency, Congress has retained almost two-third of the old cabinet in Punjab. With at least two inductions coming under criticism and CM Charanjit Singh Channi retaining most of the ministers from the previous cabinet, the anti-incumbency factor remains half-baked and part of previous CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s baggage has been passed on to the new CM.

With his removal, the cycle has been broken. But, sources in the Punjab Congress have revealed, his fear still remains in the party as he could exploit any bickering. Sources said this fear factor also played a crucial role in picking up ministers, apart from a desire to take fresh faces, striking a caste and regional balance. Khanna MLA Gurkirat Kotli’s elevation has attracted criticism and several netizens have referred to allegations of abduction and molestation against him, levelled by a French national in 1994, when his grandfather Beant Singh was chief minister. The case had caused a lot of embarrassment to his government.

Congress is yet to clarify what has changed between his resignation from the cabinet in January 2018 and now. He could not be re-inducted by Captain Amarinder Singh. Shiromani Akali Dal has also raised questions about elevation of Amarinder Singh ‘Raja’ Warring. Though the ministers who have been dropped faced specific allegations of irregularities or incompetence, working of a few other ministers was also under the scanner. It provided a reason to two former ministers – Balbir Singh Sidhu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar – to ask the reasons for dropping them. “In the last few days, CM Channi’s mannerisms, gestures, speeches to play common man’s CM have generated a lot of positive publicity, but soon people would be watching performance of the government,” said a Congress MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/unlike-bjp-in-gujarat-cong-fails-to-start-with-clean-slate-in-punjab/articleshow/86569536.cms||IP Singh

The deceased were identified as Kishundev Choudhary (50) and Haribol Yadav (60), a retired home guard jawan. The incident sparked tension in the village as both the groups were not in a mood to relent. Sensing the gravity of the situation, Khagaria SP Amitesh Kumar has deployed additional armed forces there. Sulekha Devi (45), the wife of Kishundev, told the police on Monday that her husband was trying to mobilise support in his favour for the post of panchayat samiti member in the upcoming election, to be held in the panchayat on October 24. “Around 12 on Sunday night, some people came to my residence and requested my husband to come for the meeting of the panchayat. My husband left for the venue to attend the meeting where he was shot dead,” she said. On the other hand, Haribol’s kin claimed that he was attacked by the rival group led by Kishundev to settle his political score ahead of the panchayaty polls. The SP said the reason behind the incident is yet to be ascertained. However, preliminary investigation suggested that old rivalry could be the reason behind the incident. The police have detained half a dozen suspects for interrogation. Beldaur police station SHO Santosh Kumar said Kishundev was killed on the spot while Haribol succumbed to the gunshot injuries on the way to the Sadar hospital. The bodies were sent to the SKMCH for postmortem. Meanwhile, patrolling in and around the village has been intensified in the wake of tension.

Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said Deol is the personal lawyer of former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal — both accused in Behbal Kalan police firing case of October 2015.  “Punjabis are saddened by this appointment as we all want a logical conclusion to the 2015 sacrilege incident in which two youths were killed. Congress had come to power by promising that the guilty would be punished. Unfortunately, the Congress party has always been manipulative and has no dharma ethics,” he said. Sharma claimed that by appointing Deol, the Congress government has shown that it was never serious or committed to address the sacrilege issue which has hurt the entire state. “The chief minister is merely a puppet of the central Congress leadership and the Congress leadership has always played havoc with Punjab,” he alleged. Sharma added that the BJP has strongly condemned this appointment where a lawyer representing the accused is appointed as advocate general of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-bjp-questions-deols-appointment-as-ag/articleshow/86569566.cms||---

One unidentified person was killed in Srikakulam, while a woman, D Bhavani (37), died at Pendurthi in Vizag when her house wall collapsed. In West Godavari, one person was washed away in flash flood. The deceased was identified as P Nageswara Rao, a sweeper at the road transport corporation office at Jangareddigudem. Road network to several villages in the coastal mandals of Srikakulam was cut off due to the downpour that accompanied the storm. Many areas of the two districts, including towns, plunged into darkness as the storm toppled hundreds of electric poles, with officials indicating that restoration of power would take some time.  Communication network in the coastal areas was also affected due to damage to mobile towers. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a video conference with collectors of the affected districts from his Tadepalli camp office. He announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of those killed and 1,000 each to families shifted to relief camps. Directing officials to restore power as soon as possible and monitor the situation every 30 minutes, the CM instructed them to ensure that quality food was provide in relief camps, along with proper medical care and safe drinking water. He also asked them to set up more relief camps wherever required and supply drinking water through tankers as water sources could be contaminated due to the rains. The CM further asked officials to prepare a report on crop damage and provide immediate relief to farmers. Officials were also told to move those residing along the banks of Vamsadhara and Nagavali to relief camps and monitor water levels in the reservoirs constantly. Chief secretary Adityanath Das, who is monitoring the situation from Visakhapatnam, said trees were uprooted at some places but were cleared immediately, and all highways were also cleared.

The ambulance left the Nutema Hospital, a private facility in Meerut, at about 4.43 am and managed to reach the Rohini-based lab in Delhi in 90 minutes, just a few minutes before the blood samples it was ferrying would be rendered useless for testing. It usually takes no less than 150 minutes to cover the 100km distance. Three police cars a km ahead of the ambulance ensured a traffic-free route as did 50 cops in coordination action from Meerut, Ghaziabad and Delhi. On Sunday, Meerut police had written to their counterparts in Ghaziabad, urging them to create the green channel on Monday. Kamlesh Pandey, Ghaziabad circle officer (CO), said they had put in a request that the ambulance should cross the district borders by 5.40 am as farmers would start gathering for the bandh at 6 am. Ramanand Kushwaha, SP (traffic) in Ghaziabad, added that small teams were deployed at all key junctions to ensure the vehicle got a free passage. The 70km distance between the Ghaziabad border at Meerut and Delhi was covered in 52 minutes. The patient, wife of a schoolteacher from Hapur, had damage in both kidneys due to prolong medical illness. She had been on dialysis for the past year and was in need of a kidney transplant. Her 22-year-old daughter offered her kidney, but it was not a match. Dr Sandeep Garg, a nephrologist at the Meerut hospital who was in the ambulance that transported the blood samples, said in case of an ‘ABO incompatible kidney transplant' — where donor’s blood type and patient’s aren't compatible — the patient is put on a 14-day medication to suppress antibody formation in her blood and reduce risk of body’s rejection of the transplant. “The nearest lab that had the expertise to determine if levels of antibody were low enough for us to carry out the procedure was in Delhi. We also had to do blood compatibility testing. A previous attempt to take the samples for testing last week had failed as it took over three hours for the samples to reach Delhi. The window from the time blood samples are extracted to the time they can be tested is narrow, just two hours at most,” Garg told TOI. Later, the test revealed that antibody level was low enough to conduct the transplant. “We are preparing for the procedure and will perform it on Tuesday morning,” said Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/green-corridor-beats-bandh-blood-samples-reach-delhi-from-meerut-in-90-mins/articleshow/86565248.cms||Ishita Mishra

Some markets were also shut in response to the countrywide closure announced by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). In Meerut city too, farmers sat in protest at several busy crossings. “We had diverted the routes for buses. But still many people were opting for Siwaye toll plaza and farmers didn’t let them cross the toll. They, however, allowed ambulance,” said Amit Bhartiye, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Sardhana. In neighbouring Baghpat, Shamli, Hapur and Bijnor, the farmers stopped the traffic movement for over six hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mixed-response-to-bharat-bandh-in-meerut-farmers-block-highway-at-toll-plaza/articleshow/86565300.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||India||Cops file cases at behest of netas, face music after regime changes, says SC||NEW DELHI: The very same Chhattisgarh police officer, who had triggered an angry outburst from the Supreme Court about officers cosying up to a regime and facing music when a new one takes charge, on Monday got another mouthful from the SC for seeking protection from arrest in another case even as he secured protection from arrest for three weeks in the latest case. On August 26, the SC had protected Gurjinder Pal Singh from arrest in a sedition case as well as a disproportionate assets case lodged against him because he allegedly did “not carry out midnight instructions” of Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel for registering a false case against former CM Raman Singh in the Nagrik Apurti Nigam (PDS) scam. On Monday, the police officer was back in SC and his counsel Vikas Singh sought protection from arrest in another case related to his alleged extortion activities. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said, “You (the police officer) are responsible for all these non-sense. We cannot grant protection to you in every case. It is alleged that you started extorting money because you were close to the then government. When you are close to the government and do these things, then you will always end up paying back with interest.” The CJI said, “This is a new trend in the country and the police officers are to be blamed for finding themselves in such situations.” However, the SC granted protection from arrest to the police officer in the second case till October 1 and said on that day it will hear both his petitions together. On August 26, senior advocate Fali S Nariman, appearing for the police officer, had told the SC that “the police officer was being victimised as he did not carry out the midnight instructions of the CM to register cases against the former CM”. The charges were strongly refuted by senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Rakesh Dwivedi, who had appeared for Chhattisgarh government. But the SC had made scathing comments on certain police officers who blindly act at the behest of politicians to enjoy the favour of the regime. The CJI had said, “It is a disturbing feature across the country. To be in the good books of politicians in power, they commit harakiri. First, they actively register cases against political opponents at the beck and call of those at the helm of power. They face the music at the hands of other police officers when the previously targeted politicians come to power.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-file-cases-at-behest-of-netas-face-music-after-regime-changes-says-sc/articleshow/86572305.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

They were allegedly hired by her father-in-law to kill her. Countrymade firearms and live bullets were seized from their possession. Tapeshwar Singh, SHO of Meerut’s Kankerkhera police station, said they laid a trap after getting a tip-off that some hired guns were out to eliminate Jyoti Tyagi who stays in a rented accommodation. A police team hailed a white car to stop. This unsettled the four occupants in it and they allegedly opened fire at the team. All four were arrested in a swift action. The arrested accused included Tyagi's father in-law,” said Singh. Tyagi said, “My husband died a few months ago and out of the 200 bigha of family farmland located in Meerut's Kharkhoda region, 80 bighas were in the name of my children. But my father-in-law did not want to part with the land. We used to live at Morta village in Ghaziabad with my husband. After the land dispute arose, I came to Meerut's Kankerkhera area but used to get threats all the time. I had even informed the police regarding that. Last week, I had requested SSP Meerut to look into the matter after which he had directed the local SHO to form a team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/police-foil-plan-to-kill-woman-father-in-law-3-shooters-held/articleshow/86565341.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Hyderabad||Only 2% of Telangana youth can get government jobs, says minister KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: At a time when the opposition parties are cornering the TRS government over lack of jobs for the youth, IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao on Monday said it was not possible for any government to provide large-scale government employment and that only 2% of the youth (7-8 lakh) could be given government jobs in Telangana. Making a statement on the floor of the assembly, the minister said the private sector was the only way forward and that it would hire 95% of the eligible people. He said that 19 lakh youth have been given jobs in various industries and IT sector, thanks to huge investments in the state in the last seven years. During a short discussion on the growth of the IT and industry sectors in the state, KTR said: “I want to inform the opposition that it is not possible for any government in the world to provide more than 5% government jobs. Given that Telangana has a population of about four crore people, only 2% of them can be given government jobs.” Recalling that even PM Narendra Modi, during his recent visit to the US, met with investors first before meeting President Joe Biden, KTR said TSiPASS was introduced with a larger vision. More than 17,000 industrial units were given clearance and the government had introduced 1,264 reform initiatives in the last seven years to attract investments. He said nearly 13,000 units have become operational since then. KTR also said that states must now compete globally to attract investment and not simply with other states within the country. Citing the Kitex investment, KTR said that Telangana had to compete with countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal for big investments. Objecting to the opposition parties’ criticism, he said: “Telangana is an aerospace industry hub and a pharma hub. We have set a target of increasing biopharma exports to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in the next one decade and creating employment opportunities for 4-5 lakh youth.” He said industrial parks by Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation came up on 23,000 acres in 35 years, whereas the industrial parks under Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation were built in 19,961 acres in just six years. Meanwhile, the government said it will facilitate jute cultivation in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-2-of-t-youth-can-get-govt-jobs-says-ktr/articleshow/86570980.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case: Errant cop will have to pay Rs 5,000 from salary||NEW DELHI: A court has imposed a cost of Rs 5,000 on Delhi Police for failing to appear before it and seeking adjournment in a northeast Delhi riot case despite repeated orders. The fine will be deducted from the salary of the alleged erring officer and deposited in Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund. “This court is not oblivious of the fact that the burden of this cost shall fall on the public exchequer and, hence, I deem it appropriate to direct the commissioner of Delhi Police to conduct an inquiry and order deduction of the aforesaid cost from the salary of the responsible officer,” chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said, asking the CP to inform the court within four weeks. TimesViewThe court’s insistence on pinpointing individual responsibility for non-appearance in court is a welcome move. The fine imposed on the errant will send across a terse message that police cannot hide behind the faceless anonymity of a department. The step will ensure that court proceedings are taken more seriously.Police failed to comply with an order dated April 12, 2021 in which the court had directed the investigating officer (IO) to supply a copy of an e-challan to one of the accused. The officer submitted that it had not been supplied till date as he was not aware of the order and sought adjournment to supply it. The judge was also irked over the fact that the special public prosecutors representing police and investigating officers (IOs) do not appear in the riot cases on the scheduled dates and, when they appear after “prodding of senior officers” by the court, they do so without checking the files. They seek adjournment in a “very casual manner” for complying with the court’s directions on the dates they miss, he added. Their conduct “has already been brought to the notice of senior police officers, including SHOs, ACPs, the DCP (northeast) and the commissioner of police, Delhi; however, they have failed to ensure that such incidents do not take place any more”, the court noted. In the current case, it said, the request for adjournment is allowed “subject to the cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by Delhi Police in Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund”. It also directed the IO to supply the e-challan copy to the accused within two days against proper acknowledgement. The court had earlier pulled up police for their “lackadaisical approach” in handling the riot cases, saying it would pass adverse orders against officers, including adjournment costs with directions to deduct it from their salaries, if they failed to ensure proper prosecution. It had directed the Delhi Police commissioner to personally look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-case-errant-cop-will-have-to-pay-rs-5000-from-salary/articleshow/86567643.cms||Usha Das
---||Nagpur||No admission: Herdsmen bring wards to ZP in protest||NAGPUR: Members of the Bharvad community, an ethnic group from Gujarat, staged protests in front of the zilla parishad (ZP) office on Monday with 60 children. They alleged that their wards were not given admissions in ZP schools despite directions by the state’s minister for school education Bachchu Kadu. The matter was first raised last month after the government school in two villages of the district refused admissions to the children. This was because the locals had objected to the Bharvad children studying with theirs. The Bharavads and locals are often at loggerheads over grazing of cattle. When the matter was taken up before Kadu, he had given directions to resolve the issue within eight days. Ramabhai Jograna, the leader of Bharvads, complained that it has been more than a week but the formalities have not been completed. Even as some of the children have been admitted, none of the formalities has been initiated. “They haven’t even taken the papers like birth certificates and age proof. No proper documentation of the admission has been done. Unless the children’s names are officially registered, how can we be assured that the admissions have been granted?” said Jograna. The district’s education officer Chintaman Wanzari said all the 213 children whose cases were taken up have been given admissions. However, schools need to be started first. None of the schools have begun yet due to Covid restrictions. Bharvads, who are originally herdsmen from Gujarat, have been living in Vidarbha for at least four decades. Their earlier generations had migrated from Gujarat due to droughts. Rabaris, another ethnic group of sheep herders from Gujarat, too have been living in Vidarbha since generations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-admission-herdsmen-bring-wards-to-zp-in-protest/articleshow/86567693.cms||Shishir Arya

Justice Rohit Deo asked Madhukar Gomkale, Babarao Runjhe and other petitioners to add the main accused of the Rs150 crore scam — dairy development minister Sunil Kedar and others — as respondents by next date of hearing. The petitioners, through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar, had challenged rejection of their four applications to assist prosecution by the special court hearing scam cases on August 28. They pointed out that poor and destitute depositors, a majority of whom are farmers, were cheated, looted, and defrauded by masterminds like the minister and other accused. The petitioner had made the Maharashtra government through Sadar police station as the only respondent in the case. Contending that they are victims of the criminal and illegal acts of the accused, the petitioners through Bhandarkar stressed on allowing them to join the prosecution in the trial to secure justice. Highlighting the inordinate delay in the trial, they contended that it showcases how the respondents utilized their political connections and power to guarantee their escape from the clutches of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-calls-for-adding-ndccb-scam-accused-as-respondents-in-new-plea/articleshow/86565381.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: NGT rejects plea for closure of PIL on pollution in Chandrapur||CHANDRAPUR: The Pune bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), in its interim order, has rejected the prayer of Mahagenco and Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) for closure of the public interest litigation (PIL) over high pollution. The bench also maintained the need for continuous monitoring of pollution levels to ensure that emission norms are fully complied with. The order came after recent hearing on the PIL, filed by industrialist Madhusudan Roongta against state of Maharashtra and others, over high pollution caused by CSTPS and Western Coalfields Ltd (WCL) mines in Chandrapur. The bench comprising judicial member Justice M Satyanarayanan and expert-member Arun Kumar Verma took into account the petitioner’s submission regarding joint committee report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB) which had observed nearly two times more SO2 emission than prescribed limits and the particular units of CSTPS continuing to violate the environmental norms. The counsel for Mahagenco and CSTPS submitted that except the problem of fly ash management, all other infirmities and deficiencies pointed out have been set right. The counsel also submitted supporting documents to that effect. The counsel appearing for the MPCB prayed for permission to file additional affidavit with required particulars. The bench accepted the plea and directed the board to file it in the next hearing scheduled on November 24. The bench has also highlighted the fact that in an affidavit filed by MPCB on March 12, 2018, it has mentioned WCL as a major contributor to the air pollution and the level of air pollution to be very significant probably on account of bad weather conditions and uncovered vehicles being used for transportation of coal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngt-rejects-plea-for-closure-of-pil-on-pollution-in-chanda/articleshow/86565402.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: State, PCCF office drag feet on filing contempt plea against ex-HoFF||NAGPUR: Even nine months after the state government asked the forest department to file a contempt petition against former PCCF (HoFF) Umesh Agrawal over the issuance of 50 additional horizontal bands saw (AHBS) licenses against Supreme Court (SC) orders, no steps have been taken. Information received under RTI Act revealed that on October 30, 2020, MoEFCC has already scrapped these 50 licenses and ordered inquiry and contempt proceedings against ex-PCCF Agrawal, who as the head of the state-level committee (SLC) took the decision on July 23, 2018, to issue licenses in contravention of SC orders. However, subsequent PCCFs remained silent on the issue until the regional office of MoEFCC here, on an appeal filed by city-based wildlife and environment lawyer Manish Jeswani, cancelled the licenses. Correct and complete information sought under RTI Act on action taken by the forest department on MoEFCC orders and state directives has not been made available to the applicant, even after the first appeal. On December 8, 2020, the state had directed ex-PCCF N Rambabu to send a draft of contempt petition in 15 days to be filed against Agrawal in the Supreme Court for flouting its orders. However, the orders have not been followed yet. PCCF G Saiprakash did not respond to TOI query. Forest ministry officials said they were yet to receive any proposal in this regard from the PCCF office. RTI reveals that instead of obeying MoEFCC orders, Rambabu on November 4, 2020, wrote to the Centre seeking clarification on the MoEFCC order. The letter is silent on the proposed contempt petition against Agrawal as well as the departmental inquiry against him. However, in reply to Rambabu’s letter, the MoEFCC, Delhi, on February 26, 2021 made it clear that guidelines have been issued in 2016 and 2017 as per the SC ruling on October 5, 2015. One of the conditions of these guidelines is that before any decision on issuing additional saw licenses, timber availability report should be acquired, which was not done by the SLC headed by Agrawal. State, PCCF office drag feet on filing plea against ex-HoFFThe MoEFCC rejected the licenses knowing well that it violated SC orders and also clarified its stand. Rambabu retired seven months ago and his successor Saiprakash has already completed 7 months. Yet, MoEFCC and state government orders are not being followed. In subsequent meetings since December 2020, the SLC failed to discuss the issue of departmental inquiry and contempt proceedings against Agrawal. The MoEFCC order of October 30, 2020, said, “When discretionary power is conferred on administrative authority, it is required to be exercised according to law, which has been abused by Agrawal by exceeding his jurisdiction.” The MoEFCC also criticized the state for simply giving directions to Agrawal without initiating any action due to which ex-PCCF habitually violated the rule of law. The direction to modify SLC has also not been done till now. The MoEFCC has said that SLC should have satisfied that timber is legally available in the entire state by way of undertaking an appropriate study before granting fresh licenses for AHBS. Senior forest officials said, “The MoEFCC should take a strong stand for violating apex court orders on such an important issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-pccf-office-drag-feet-on-filing-contempt-plea-against-ex-hoff/articleshow/86565366.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

AAP youth wing state president Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer demanded that the newly-appointed chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government order a judicial inquiry into the cheating during the written test held for sub-inspector posts last month; in which six persons were arrested for their suspected involvement. The MLA also demanded that the government should carry out a time-bound probe in the matter under the supervision of a sitting high court judge. “The chief minister should ensure recruitment of meritorious youth. Several touts are active without any fear. They try to lure, trick and cheat gullible individuals and are involved in various malpractices hindering the selection process. Such culprits should be zeroed and dealt with sternly,” he said. The AAP functionary said the government must intensify the crackdown on leakage of exam papers and cheating with furthering security measures in view of reported attempts by fraudsters to sabotage the process. On the arrest of six people, Hayer said the state government should probe the matter in-depth as the gang of cheaters and fraudsters could have links with some officials and politicians, which may provide further leads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/conduct-judicial-inquiry-into-hi-tech-cheating-case-in-si-selection-test-aap/articleshow/86569636.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Crime branch seeks Monson Mavunkal’s custody, opposes bail||KOCHI: Crime branch has launched a thorough investigation into the dealings of ‘antique collector’ Monson Mavunkal, who was arrested for financial fraud. On Monday, crime branch (CB) sought Mavunkal, who was arrested for financial fraud, in five-day custody. Monson was sent to judicial custody on Sunday. CB on Monday also opposed his bail plea. Orders on both pleas are slated for Tuesday. Mavunkal’s remand report shows that he had three iphones and an Apple smart watch with him when he was arrested from Alappuzha. A complaint filed by those allegedly duped by Mavunkal to the chief minister said that the accused was planning a new scam by attracting gullible persons to invest money with him by making them believe that the Qatar royal family had agreed to pay Rs 15,000 crore for 93 antique products in his possession. The complaint alleges that he was spreading documents relating to this via social media too. To gain their trust, the accused even sent the petitioners to Dubai and Qatar. When the petitioners asked him for the documents of his antique collection, he showed them documents purportedly issued by the state police chief for providing security for his possessions, the complaint said. Meanwhile, Kochi city police on Monday removed a beat box at Mavunkal’s Kaloor house which had a register that policemen used to sign everyday as a security measure. A senior officer with the city police said that the box was installed as Mavunkal had requested security from police headquarters claiming that he had valuables, and it was being removed as he was arrested for financial fraud. As per the remand report, Mavunkal had cases against him at Pandalam police station and Ernakulam Town south police stations too. The copy of the complaint which surfaced on Monday, shows that the complainants alleged that Mavunkal showed them photos of over a hundred famous personalities, including film stars, to dupe them of around Rs 10 crore. The complainants alleged that money was handed over in the presence of high-profile personalities. However, police are yet to confirm this. According to the victims, Mavunkal scammed them of Rs 10 crore between 2017 and 2020. As per the complaint, Mavunkal even showed them documents that he claimed to be from DRDO which showed that he had chemicals used for launching rockets and were worth crores of rupees. The complainants got in touch with Mavunkal’s former partner who revealed to them that a relative of Monson staying in the US was forging documents for him. He also told them that Mavunkal managed to get publicity by bribing mediapersons, the complaint alleged. They alleged that three vehicles, which were given to them, were actually among 12 cars bought from a Bengaluru native. Mavunkal was yet to pay money even to the car owner. They also alleged that other persons were duped by the accused in a similar manner but he managed to prevent them from complaining. As per the complaints, the accused’s house at Kaloor was taken on rent. When the complainants demanded repayment, the accused showed them guns and told them that he had committed crimes. He also claimed connections with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-seeks-monsons-custody-opposes-bail/articleshow/86567787.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: With 30k vacancies, yet another round of CAP announced||NAGPUR: As a staggering 30,000 seats remain vacant in Std XI at junior colleges within city limits, the education department has announced yet another round under Common Admission Procedure (CAP). Being called the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) round, it will be held from September 28 to October 14. While FCFS is a regular feature every year, for this pandemic-affected academic session it was put on hold. But on Monday, deputy director of education Vaishali Jamdar issued a circular confirming the state government’s decision for conducting the FCFS round. This means that CAP, which started in August, will now continue till at least October to see if the huge vacancy deficit can be covered up. TOI has been reporting consistently on CAP figures and what academics have been saying about its “futility”. Ravindra Fadnavis, executive member of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM), has in the past approached the high court over the issue, though taking up a different aspect of it. MRSSM questioned why CAP is mandatory only for urban centres whereas just a few kilometers away, and outside city limits, students can approach colleges directly and get admissions. “There is clear oversupply of seats,” said Fadnavis. “The state education department is giving permission for increasing number of sections to every junior college. From what I know, nobody is refused. So you have colleges with multiple sections and unfortunately the supply has now overstripped demand,” said Fadnavis. An education official who did not wish to be identified told TOI that there was not much they could do. “If the college has the infrastructure to accommodate more students, it will be granted permission. Such colleges do not seek land or funds from the state government, so there is no issue in granting permission so that more students can take admission there,” said the official. The same official told TOI that colleges having four or five sections are common, but in Nagpur there is a college which has over 15 sections. “As I said, it is not illegal. As long as there is space and lab infrastructure, such permissions will be granted,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-30k-vacancies-yet-another-round-of-cap-announced/articleshow/86565450.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Selu police registered an offence of murder against four people on Sunday. It is learnt that Vasant Pohane and Naththu Telrandhe from Ghorad village, close to Selu town, were involved in a dispute over agriculture for a long time. According to information, there was a quarrel between the two on Saturday at 2pm but after a police complaint that was settled, when cops detained both and released them with the agreement that this should not happen again. At 9pm, Vasant went to Naththu Telradhe's house with five or six people, where they had a heated argument. Vijay (26), son of Naththu, abruptly attacked Vasant with a sharp knife. The accused stabbed the victim’s son and two others before fleeing. Vasant was rushed to a rural hospital in Selu, where doctors declared him dead. Three others were injured and admitted in Selu rural hospital. One of them was critically injured and shifted to Kasturba Hospital, Sewagram. As soon as the cops learnt about the incident, they rushed to the spot. Police said the situation was under control in the village after the tension due to the incident. Police superintendent Prashant Holkar took stock of the situation. Police have arrested three people and the main accused Vijay has absconded. After the autopsy, the deceased Vasant Pohane was cremated at Ghorad village. Selu police sub-inspector Surendra Kohle is investigating the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/40-year-old-killed-three-injured-over-agricultural-dispute/articleshow/86537686.cms||Balwant Dhage

The incident led to the death of the newborn, who was delivered by Rani Wasnik in the hospital’s waiting area on September 5 midnight. However, no action has been taken in the case so far. Deputy director of health services Dr Sanjay Jaiswal didn’t divulge details of the report. “The report will be examined by our expert committee,” he said. The top health officer didn’t give any time limit regarding action or examination by the expert committee. Around 10pm on September 5, the Wasnik family had taken their daughter-in-law Rani in labour pain to Kanhan primary health centre (PHC). The on-duty staff had referred her to Kamptee Sub-district hospital (SDH) which is equipped to deliver babies. Though she writhed in pain, the SDH referred the case to Daga Hospital, where she delivered on the floor even before a doctor or nurse could attend to her. Rani’s husband Sandesh told TOI that they haven’t been contacted by the inquiry panel. He was also surprised to know that the panel has already submitted its report without recording their statement. Wasim Khan, district vice president of Youth Congress, who held protests after the incident, asked if the action was deliberately delayed under political pressure. Daga Hospital had instituted the panel to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of the Wasnik family that the newborn died due to fall. The hospital has refuted the allegations and said it was a precipitated delivery, which can take place anywhere – in a bus, train or plane.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Lukewarm response to Bharat bandh in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: Farmers in Vidarbha largely remained indifferent to the Bharat bandh call against the three controversial agriculture laws. Farm produce markets, including Kalamna agriculture produce market committee (APMC) yard, remained open on Monday with similar reports coming in from other parts of the region. In Nagpur, workers of political parties forced shopkeepers to down the shutters in market areas even though business resumed in the presence of police after some time. Leaders of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) that gave the bandh call also admitted that response in Maharashtra was only lukewarm. They blamed the state’s farm leaders who wield influence over farmers for not having come forward with full enthusiasm. There was no support from opposition parties too, said a leader. Sandip Gitte-Patil, SKM coordinator, said there are stalwart farm leaders like Bacchu Kadu, who is a minister in MVA government, or Raju Shetti, a former MP from Swabhimani Paksha and others, but none of them actively participated in the strike. This is one of the reasons the strike could not get major response in the state, he said. Shetti told TOI that it is also time to introspect whether an alternative strategy to strikes can be explored for pressing the farmers’ demands. “The response wasn’t much because the farmers were already weary because of the prolonged lockdown. The state’s farmers had already held protests against the three laws earlier, due to which they were not too keen this time,” said Shetti. Kishore Tiwari, a farm activist and chairman of Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission (VNSSM), said the organisers had not roped in other outfits. Gitte-Patil, however, said calls were given to other farm leaders too. Atul Senad of the Brokers’ Association at Kalamna said business was usual on Monday with no reduction in arrivals. Sudhir Kothari, a director in APMC at Hinganghat in Wardha district, said the market there remained open, but it was closed in Samudrapur. Gajanan Singewar, a farmer in Patanbori, a village near Telangana border in Yavatmal district, said the response was lukewarm in Maharashtra side, but it was almost total at Adilabad in Telangana. A little bit impact was seen in the district headquarters and not in villages, said sources. Arun Wankar of the SKM claimed to have stopped traffic on Nagpur-Jabalpur highway for around half an hour. Similar protests were held elsewhere too, he said. In Nagpur, workers of political parties headed to Sitabuldi market after protests near Gandhi statue at Variety Square. NCP youth wing leader Shailendra Tiwari said there was some symbolic protest with couple of shopkeepers supporting the cause. Some of the banners were damaged by political workers, but no untoward incident had taken place, he said. The political activists had closed shops in Gokulpeth Market, Gandhibagh, Cotton Market, Kamal Chowk, Itwari and such places for brief period before police presence had helped the shopkeepers resume business. NCP city president Duneshwar Pethe said party workers from different outfits had assembled to support the farmers, who had been agitating for over a year on the outskirts of Delhi, but central government seems to be in no mood to pay heed to them. “The dictatorial attitude of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is abhorring. His indifference to the struggle of the farmers prompted us to unite against him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lukewarm-response-to-bharat-bandh-in-vid/articleshow/86565531.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: ‘Rocket launcher shell sold as scrap caused Upleta blast’||RAJKOT: The blast in a scrapyard in Upleta town of Rajkot that killed a father-son duo was caused due to an unused or misfired shell of a rocket launcher used by the armed forces. Police on Monday booked two persons Tofiq Dosani and Mohan Koli, who had sold the shell to the scrap dealer Rajak Kana (54). The forensic and postmortem report of the deceased Rajak and his son Raees Kana (22) revealed that the blast was caused by a shell of a rocket launcher, said Jetpur assistant superintendent of police Sagar Bagmar. He said that the shell was sold by Koli, a resident of Devbhumi Dwarka, to Dosani of Upleta. Dosani had sold the shell as scrap to Rajak. On Friday last a powerful explosion inside a scrap recycling yard had killed the father-son duo. Such was the blast intensity, that it not only shook the entire market but also caused much damage to nearby shops. Initially, the police had said that the blast was caused when one of the deceased tried to cut open the compressor of an old refrigerator using a gas cutter. Eyewitnesses had also stated that the blast was so powerful that the body parts of the victims were strewn across the area. “The shell that exploded is used during firing practice by the armed forces. Even a misfired shell contains some ammunition. How it was sold as scrap is a matter of investigation. As per report, the victims had hit the shell with a hammer which caused the explosion,” said Bagmar. He added that during postmortem of the victims, the doctors found projectiles in their bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rocket-launcher-shell-sold-as-scrap-caused-upleta-blast/articleshow/86565519.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Ghar wapsi? Congress neta Ashish Deshmukh meets BJP contestant||NAGPUR: Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Ashish Deshmukh, who had quit the BJP to join Indian National Congress, reportedly meeting the saffron party’s zilla parishad bypoll contestant from Sawargaon has fuelled speculation about his ghar wapsi. Deshmukh did not respond to TOI’s repeated calls and messages for his comments. Seizing the opportunity, supporters of Maharashtra minister Sunil Kedar, a known Deshmukh bete noire in the party, have reported the matter to the party high command in Delhi and demanded his ouster. Terming Deshmukh\’s act as anti-party, Kedar supporters have also approached Congress rural president Rajendra Mulak to take action against the MPCC office-bearer. Deshmukh, a former MLA from Katol, had recently written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding sacking of animal husbandry minister Kedar, also from the Congress, over his alleged involvement in Rs150 crore Nagpur District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) scam. Claiming that trial in cases involving Kedar was delayed for nearly two decades, Deshmukh had objected to the appointment of lawyer Asif Qureshi, chairman of MPCC’s legal, human rights and RTI departments, as special public prosecutor (SPP) to plead the case. TOI had reported the alleged conflict of interest regarding Congress minority cell head Qureshi’s appointment as SPP in the NDCCB scam case involving a sitting cabinet minister. Labelled as the biggest cooperative scandal of that time, the embezzlement came to fore when Kedar, who was NCP MLA from Saoner then, was heading the NDCCB as chairman in 2002. Demanding Qureshi’s removal from the case, Deshmukh, son of former MPCC chief Ranjit Deshmukh, had stressed on roping in lawyer like Ujjwal Nikam as SPP to plead the case for securing justice. Kedar too had launched a counter-attack purportedly against Deshmukh in one of his public addresses, albeit indirectly, by exhorting the party men to teach a befitting lesson to traitors. Factional feuds are not new to the grand old party as the Nagpur district Congress unit had witnessed them earlier too. Differences also persisted in the Nagpur city Congress unit headed by MLA Vikas Thakre, after he roped in a young team of office-bearers. It did not go down well with party seniors, including guardian minister Nitin Raut’s group and other factions headed by former minister Satish Chaturvedi and Anees Ahmed, say party sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ghar-wapsi-cong-neta-meets-bjp-contestant/articleshow/86565487.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

It directed all persons, including the media, to ensure strict compliance and any failure would amount to contempt of court. Witnesses too must sign a statement of non-disclosure and confidentiality. “Both sides and all parties and advocates, as also witnesses, are forbidden from disclosing the contents of any order, judgment or filing to the media or publishing any such material in any mode or fashion by any means, including social media, without specific leave of the court,” said the HC. “In the order sheets, the names of the parties will not be mentioned,” it said, adding that the endeavour will be to anonymize the identities of the parties, such as email ID, mobile or telephone number and address. The names and addresses of the witnesses will also not be noted. The order was passed in a suit filed under the POSH Act by ‘P’ versus ‘A and others’ after hearing Abha Singh as counsel for P and Birendra Saraf, senior counsel for A, with Lancy D’Souza as counsel for another defendant. The HC said the guidelines be kept to the minimum required. The HC said no document of personal identification wi-ll be retained on file by the registry after verification and the parties will use anonymized titles for all further affidavits. It added: “The registry will not permit anyone other than the advocate-on-record with a current and valid vakalatnama to take inspection or copies of any filing or order.” The entire record is to be kept sealed and given to none without a court order. Also the record is not to be digitised by any third-party solution provider without a court order. Witness depositions will not be uploaded either. The hearings will be via physical attendance with only advocates and litigants present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-witnesses-must-sign-non-disclosure-statement-in-mumbai/articleshow/86571005.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Kozhikode||‘No ties, met him for treatment’||Kozhikode: KPCC chief K Sudhakaran said that he wasn’t involved in the financial dealings between Monson Mavunkal (the accused in fake antique racket case) and the complainants who accused him of swindling crores of rupees. Addressing the media in Kannur, he said that he had visited Mavunkal five-six times at his Kochi residence for treatment. “I met him at his residence after I was told that he was a skin specialist and I consulted him on a small medical issue. Other than that, I have no connection in his dealings as alleged by the complainants. All my visits at his home were for my treatment. At his home I had seen a collection of antiques which he (Mavunkal) told were worth crores of rupees,” he said. Sudhakaran termed as baseless the allegations that one of the complainants had handed over Rs 25 lakh to Mavunkal in his presence on Nov 22, 2018 after he assured that the issues in Delhi will be resolved soon. “I don’t know the complainants or their business. They mentioned in the complaint that I was an MP and a member of the public finance standing committee which is flimsy as I was not even an MP in 2018. They alleged that they spoke to me at 2pm on Nov 22; on that day I attended the funeral of Congress leader MI Shanavas till 3pm and I had attended the condolences meet after that,” said Sudhakaran. The KPCC chief alleged that the chief minister and CMO were trying to target him with false allegations. “One of the complainants has said that CM’s secretary had contacted him thrice. If so, I think there is a conspiracy. Government and CMO, which hadn’t shown an interest in the probe in real cases like gold smuggling and dollar smuggling cases, are keenly following these allegations. This gives rise to suspicions that CM and his office are the dark forces behind this matter,” he said. Responding to a question, Sudhakaran said Mavunkal had given him an ointment as part of his treatment and added that he didn’t know if Mavunkal was a fake doctor. He refuted allegations that he had stayed at Mavunkal’s home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-ties-met-him-for-treatment/articleshow/86567940.cms||---

Officially called “One Nation, One Day, One Million Blood Sugar Testing” will be a first-of-its-kind event. In Nagpur, free blood sugar testing will be available at more than 50 sites, including at leading medical shops. Many hospitals have joined hands for this event and are eyeing more than 20,000 sugar tests in 24 hours in the city. “The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that uncontrolled diabetes can be a serious comorbidity, leading to poor clinical outcomes in patients. India currently has 77 million people with diabetes with an equal number suffering from pre-diabetes and at least half the number of people still undiagnosed,” said Dr Sunil Gupta, a diabetologist in Nagpur leading this programme. Dr Gupta said that around 25% of people living with diabetes are well-controlled today. “This initiative will help in creating more awareness about diabetes and testing around it,” he said. According to him, all leading private and government hospitals will be the sites where blood sugar will be checked for free throughout Wednesday. Teams of doctors will visit gardens, public places, corporate offices and test blood sugar of those willing to. “We will arrange gluco meters, strips and all related material as well as trained staff. The only participation expected from people is in terms of willingness to get tested,” said Dr Gupta. The only criterion is that people above 18 years of age will get tested. The organizers have avoided big testing camps or large sites to avoid rush and crowd. They have appealed to people to join in and make this unique initiative a big success. Testing on Wednesday From 5.30 am, doctors will visit parks and walking tracks to test morning walkers Nearly 30 leading medical shops in city will be the centres where visitors will be tested Many big private hospitals, GMCs and small clinics will test visitors Community associations, corporate offices, clubs can participate with bulk testing All above 18 years of age can get tested, will get results within minutes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/get-blood-sugar-tested-for-free-be-part-of-world-record/articleshow/86567834.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The SCTL has invited tenders for the project and will be executed on engineering, procurement, construction mode (EPC). The pre-bid meeting of the project will be held on Tuesday. The proposal envisages an automated multi-grid parking system to accommodate a minimum 80 cars. The SCTL also plans to construct a cafeteria close to the parking facility which will be meant for the public. The time period for the completion of the work is 12 months. As per the project design, the basement portion will be devoted to two wheeler parking and the upper multi-level structures will be used for automated car parking. Public toilets will be constructed on the ground floor. Entry and exit will be via separate roads to avoid traffic congestion in the approach road. The electro-mechanical car parking system will be designed to take the load of 2,000 kg per car. Average parking and retrieval time will not be more than 180 seconds. The contractor will operate the system for five years from the date of completion and maintain the system for four years after a warranty period of 12 months from the date of successful commissioning of the system. The power consumption charges will be borne by the SCTL while the revenue from the operation of the system shall be paid in full to it. A smart parking app and dashboard will also be developed and the number of vehicles being parked, duration of parking and revenue generated will be monitored on a real-time basis. The application programming interface will be merged with the command and control centre. The project is the fourth such scheme to be implemented under the Smart city project. It was earlier delayed with national highways and infrastructure development corporation backing out from the electro-mechanical parking project following which the SCTL invited expression of interests for the project. The proposed site is at the front yard of the Superintendent Engineer’s Office (Roads & Bridges), PWD, adjoining Bakery Junction road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/automated-parking-facility-at-public-office-for-rs-10cr/articleshow/86537703.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Vadodara||‘Jobs in Gujarat MSME sector to double’||VADODARA: Union micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) minister Narayan Rane said on Monday that the employment opportunities in the MSME sector is set to increase in Gujarat. He said that the MSME ministry is making efforts to double the employment opportunities in the sector within the next few years. “At present, about 58 lakh are employed in the MSME sector in Gujarat. We plan to take the number to 1.20 crore within next two years,” Rane, who was in the state to inaugurate the Coir Board at Kevadia in Narmada, told TOI. The minister said that the coir industry sustains more than seven lakh workers, most of whom are women. “Despite having a longer coastline than Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra, the coir making industry is less in Gujarat. We will set up special clusters for promoting coir making in the state. Also, the Coir Board will help set up manufacturing units in states that don’t have coastline,” Rane said. In Gujarat, the ministry of MSME has sanctioned two SFURTI clusters with a project outlay of Rs 4.72 crores – Samavedana Coir Cluster and Tarapur Coir Cluster. When asked if his ministry is mulling to help the MSME sector hit hard by Covid pandemic, Rane said, “A committee has been formed to look into the issues faced by the MSME, help them financially and how to bring the labourers, who migrated to their villages, back to the units.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jobs-in-state-msme-sector-to-double/articleshow/86565609.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Widow has right over hubby’s assets even after remarriage: HC||NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has ruled that a widow, who later remarried, still has a right over the deceased husband’s assets if process of succession (the devolution of property in case a person dies without a will) has started before her second marriage. “The status of a woman as a widow must be there on the date when succession opens, even if she remarried at a later date. The wordings “if on the date the succession opens” does not find place in Section 2 of the Hindu Widow’s Re-marriage Act, 1856. So, we have to respect intention of the legislators while incorporating these provisions in Section 24 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956,” justice Shriram Modak said. While partly allowing a petition by labourer Jaiwantabai Wankhede against her daughter-in-law Sunanda, the judge said if she was not remarried when succession opened, the disqualification as per Section 24 would not be applicable to the latter. The 59-year-old petitioner from Akola had approached the HC to get back Rs65,000 received by Sunanda after the death of her son Anil, way back in 1991. Contending that Sunanda had remarried after her son’s death, she demanded that her daughter-in-law should be disqualified from her son’s property as per the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, as she lost this right. “If the widow has not re-married when succession opens, the disqualification under Section 24 will not be applicable. Sunanda re-married in May 1991, which was after opening of succession on April 19, 1991. Therefore, the petitioner’s contention to disqualify the respondent cannot be accepted,” the judge clarified. Partly upholding the trial court verdict, justice Modak said both mother and wife of the deceased man, being first class heirs, are entitled to get equal share in his property. “As contemplated under Section 10 of the Act of 1956, the widow (Rule 1) and the mother (Rule 2) deserve one share each. Hence, both are entitled to get 50% from the property of the deceased. It is very well true that if we have to deal with rights of a particular party, we have to consider the provisions of relevant law in its entirety.” Anil, who was working with Indian Railways, died in an accident in 1991. He had nominated wife Sunanda as his legal heir with his employer. However, there were differences between them and they resided separately, as contended by his mother. After his death, the railways handed over Rs65,000 to his wife, which was challenged by his mother in the trial court in Akola. The trial court ordered railways to pay dues to Jaiwantabai, which it challenged in the first appellate court. This court however recognised Sunanda’s share and asked the railways to equally distribute the amount. The mother challenged this decision in the HC. “The wife is not entitled to get the whole amount. She is bound to return 50% to the petitioner. The doctrine of unjust enrichment applies. She should pay the amount within three months with 6% interest,” the court said. WHAT HC SAID * Woman’s status as widow must be there on date when succession opens, even if she remarried at a later date * Wordings “if on date the succession opens” does not find place in Hindu Widow’s Re-marriage Act, 1856 * If widow has not re-married when succession opens, disqualification under Section 24 will not be applicable * The widow re-married in May 1991, which is after opening of succession on April 19, 1991 * Therefore, petitioner’s contention to disqualify respondent cannot be accepted||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/widow-has-right-over-hubbys-assets-even-after-remarriage-hc/articleshow/86567873.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Collecting agency warns of contract termination||Thiruvananthapuram: More than a month has passed since the operations of the new toll plaza at Thiruvallam have been affected; now the national highway authority of India (NHAI) is facing a new problem. The agency which has won the contract to operate the toll plaza on the Kazhakootam - Karode NH Bypass road has reportedly threatened NHAI officials to terminate the contract if the protests are not solved soon. Sources close to the NHAI office here said the contract to operate the toll plaza is awarded for a period of six months. More than a month has passed and they have not been able to start the toll due to opposition from local residents and various political parties. Further delay in starting operations would result in the agency suffering huge losses as they would not get sufficient time to make up for the amount of losses suffered during the past 40 days. As per the contract, the agency is required to remit a sum of Rs 1.40 lakh from each day's total collection to the NHAI. Though the new toll plaza was opened on August 18, the NHAI could not collect a single penny so far owing to strong protests from the local political parties. The agitators alleged that the rates of tolls for various categories of vehicles here were unrealistically high. Besides, local residents living in the close proximity to the toll plaza too were required to pay toll, although they have the option to avail a discounted rate. The main contention of the agitators is that local motorists living within 20 km radius of the toll plaza must be granted free permits across the toll plaza. Though the NHAI put forward a suggestion to allow free permits to residents of villages within five km of the toll plaza, this suggestion was rejected by the agitators. A meeting chaired by the district collector to solve the issue a month ago concluded without any solution. Besides the seemingly hefty toll the local residents may have to pay for their regular commute, the protesters, including various political fronts have also questioned the decision of NHAI to start collecting toll before the works of the new national highway stretch is completed. The construction of the new stretch of national highway is divided into two phases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/collecting-agency-warns-of-contract-termination/articleshow/86537710.cms||---

Only 20% of these places have lights, CCTV surveillance is present only at 3% places, and around 7% locations have security guards. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who is heading the multi-agency committee for women safety and security in city, has shared the list of these places through DCP (crime) Gajanan Rajmane with NMC, MSEDCL and PWD. The list was also shared with senior officials of Nagar Parishads at Wadi, Hingna and Kamptee. NIT and Mihan too have been sent the list of vulnerable places located on their premises. Kumar said the vulnerable places must have adequate illuminations, CCTV surveillance and deployment of guards as far as possible. “We have alerted the departments concerned regarding the security infrastructure and provisions required at the desolate and vulnerable places where women and girls can be targeted. Police have their own strategies in place for securing these places, but multi-agency support is necessary for foolproof security,” said Kumar under whom the zonal DCPs have started vigorous security enhancing exercises too. City police have urged different civic and government departments for lighting the grounds, gardens, parks and other open places and also deploy security guards. Kumar said the government resolution of 2015 has led to the formation of a security committee for woman’s safety under his chairmanship, which necessitates the creation of infrastructure like streetlights, installation of CCTVs and deployment of guards. In the list of 173 vulnerable locations, a copy of which is with TOI, several well-known places such as Seminary Hills, Ambazari garden, Walkers’ Street, Telangkhedi Road, Telangkhedi garden, Balodyan, Japanese Garden, Mangalwari market, back side of CP Club, Gorewada Lake’s adjoining places, Gorewada Ring Road, Maharajbagh and North Ambazari Road have been included. On the outskirts, some desolate zones in Mihan, several stretches of outer ring roads and adjoining localities, especially the sparsely populated upcoming layouts, have been earmarked as unsafe. Many premises of old factories like Empress Mall and Sutgirni too have been categorized as vulnerable. Several stretches and locations in MIDC, Kalamna, Koradi, Wadi, Beltarodi, Kamptee and New Kamptee too are in the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-outskirts-have-173-vulnerable-spots-for-women/articleshow/86567928.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||BMC to order Rs 60 crore oxygen supply to jumbos, no shortage likely||MUMBAI: The BMC will order supply of around 31 lakh cubic metres of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) for its jumbo centres as the next step in its plan to be oxygen-sufficient before a possible third wave of Covid. The year-long supply will cost around Rs 60 crore. The order is one of the last phases of the BMC’s oxygen management plan. Initially, there was an emphasis on building pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants as each can generate over 1 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen. However, the focus had to be tweaked as PSA plants can sustain wards, but they can’t replace high-pressure oxygen — the mainstay of ICUs. “The tanks for LMO have been installed. With both the PSAs and LMO, we will be able to generate over 600MT of oxygen per day in Mumbai. So we won’t have any oxygen crisis. In the last six month, we have more than doubled our oxygen generation capacity,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). The suppliers of the 31 lakh cubic metres or roughly 400MT LMO will have to keep oxygen available for 48 hours at all centres at all times and provide more oxygen within 24 hours of the BMC’s request as required, said officials. The BMC faced a short but critical oxygen crisis during the second wave. With only a fraction of patients, the city currently needs around 200MT oxygen per day. At the peak in April 2020, there was a demand for over 260-270MT, triggering a frantic search for close to a week. The BMC gave a Rs 205-crore contract to instal oxygen generation plants at 11 jumbo centres and field hospitals this August. It had initially planned a Rs 320-crore contract, but trimmed it after allegations of irregularities. Earlier, the BMC had given a contract of Rs 84 crore to instal 16 PSA plants at civic hospitals. All the PSA plants together will generate almost 48MT of oxygen which will help wards become self-sufficient. Officials said all 200MT of LMO at the moment comes from private suppliers, who deliver to hospitals that store it in 10-13 kilo litre (KL) tanks. While 21 LMOs were installed after the first wave, BMC is adding four 13KL tanks in jumbo facilities at NSCI, Nesco, Richardson & Cruddas in Byculla and Somaiya in Sion. Two 40KL tanks are being imported from China to be installed at jumbos in Kanjurmarg and Somaiya. A refilling station has been set up at Mahalaxmi, where up to 100 dura cylinders can be filled daily. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the BMC had spent close to Rs 600 crore on oxygen since the first wave. “The BMC’s oxygen procurement has been mired in controversies and allegations of corruption. The BMC must ensure there is no oxygen shortage but at the same time, there should be no irregularities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-order-rs-60cr-o2-supply-to-jumbos-no-shortage-likely/articleshow/86568013.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

This training session has been a regular feature since 2007 which was organized usually in November. However, this time it was decided to organize the training session on September 27 in the wake of the government decision to reopen the schools after the pandemic. In the post-pandemic situation the children are being faced with a severe threat of diabetic situation. There is a threat of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes among the children who have been cured of Covid. Hence there is a need for the teachers to be educated on this, said Dr Jyotidev Kesavadev. During the post Covid period, the studies have proved that the diabetes level among children has increased considerably. Hence such children will need immediate medical attention. They might even require four injections a day or testing of blood at least six to eight times a day. Hence these children need proper attention throughout the day. When the schools reopen these children are going to spend more time in the schools, he said. There is a need for at least two teachers from each school to be trained on how to attend such children who are suffering with diabetes. The teachers should be made aware of the changes the children will show in schools when the sugar level goes high. These children will have to be tested using glucometer, providing them with light food on frequent intervals, urinating, behavioural changes, etc will have to be taken care of by the teachers, said Dr Jyotidev. The teachers and parents can take part in this training session which will be organised virtually at 7 pm on Monday. The Zoom ID for the diabetes care training session is 899 4746 2975, Password is Health.

During the hearing, counsel for Amitesh Harmukh advocate N Sundaravadivelu filed a petition before additional mahila court judge (in charge) Thilageswari and argued that the local police didn’t have any territorial jurisdiction to investigate the case as the incident took place on the premises of Air Force Administrative College at Red Fields in the city. Officials from the Indian Air Force also filed a petition before the court arguing that they wanted to conduct a probe and a court martial. The city central all-woman police objected to it and contented that the IAF had failed to take appropriate action even after receiving a complaint from the rape survivor before she approached police. IAF officials countered saying that the incident took place on their premises and both the rape survivor and Amitesh are in service. The flight lieutenant should be handed over to the IAF, they said. Amitesh would be tried under the Air Force Act and he could not be arrested under the civilian law, they argued. After hearing both sides, the court extended the judicial custody till September 30, when it would decide whether to hand over the flight lieutenant to the IAF or the city police would continue the investigation. Police filed a petition seeking custody of Amitesh for seven days, which is yet to come up for hearing. The rape survivor, a flight lieutenant cadre officer, also appeared before the court.

CMC teams vaccinated 40 beneficiaries on the first day of the drive. Mayor Rakhi Kancharlawar and a team of CMC office bearers flagged off the vaccination vans in the morning. CMC has started a helpline (9823004247) and provided a link for Google forms for the drive. Eligible persons need to call the helpline or submit the duly filled form. The door-to-door vaccination facility will be available between 10am and 5pm daily. Both Covaxin and Covishield doses will be available. Kancharlawar said that considering the threat of projected third wave, people need to get themselves vaccinated with both the doses as soon as possible. “Considering that differently-abled people, senior citizens and bedridden patients can’t reach the vaccination centres, we have launched this drive,” she said. CMC has also started awareness regarding vaccination certificate verification which will start from October 4. Those found unvaccinated during the inspection have to present negative report of RT-PCR test conducted during last 15 days, otherwise they will have to undergo immediate RT-PCR test and face penalty. There is a provision of levying a fine of Rs2,000 on various service providers who are found unvaccinated and fail to present negative report of RT-PCR test conducted during the last 15 days. “We will not only impose penalty but also ensure that the person gets vaccinated immediately,” said additional commissioner, CMC, Vipin Paliwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/40-jabbed-on-day-1-of-home-vaccination-drive-in-chanda/articleshow/86567974.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Based on intel reports, police seek ED probe in Monson Mavunkal case||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Based on an intelligence report, the state police have asked the enforcement directorate (ED) to conduct a probe into the artifacts, antique collections and the source of income of Monson Mavunkal, who has been arrested for swindling money. In a letter from the then state police chief Loknath Behera addressed to ED director Sanjay Kumar Mishra in February last year, based on an inquiry conducted by ADGP (headquarters) Manoj Abraham and the state special branch, it was said that his sources of income and his assets are mysterious. The letter, accessed by TOI, also says that he maintains a strong relation with the wealthy, celebrities in the film fraternity and senior police officers. It further listed out some of his assets that include 15 luxury cars including Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, BMW and Bentley, and expensive pet dogs including German Shepherd and Korean Mastiff that would cost in the range of Rs 65 lakh to Rs 2 crore. Some antiques owned by him include panchaloha statues, a throne owned by the Travancore royal family, ornaments, crowns, swords, coins and manuscripts. A private security group named “Thunder Force” has been engaged for the security of his house and premises. “There is information that he is involved in the business of antique articles, but it is not known whether he has the required license for it. In view of the above, an inquiry may be conducted on Monson Mavunkal and his activities, as deemed fit,” said the letter to ED director. Earlier, a probe through the state intelligence, ordered by the state police chief on May 22, 2019, had stated that he is a fraudster. The intelligence had reported to the police chief that he reportedly owned a fleet of imported luxury cars, artifacts, antiques, paintings, etc, that are of Indian and foreign origin. The report said that he claimed to have purchased from across the world and valued over Rs 1lakh crore. “He is an international fraud and most of the artifacts, etc, are not genuine. Some of them are stolen properties. The sources of his money are unknown and also whether the concerned government authorities are aware of these priceless articles. It is learnt that he has not paid wealth tax which will come to crores of rupees,” read the intelligence report. Last year, the police top brass had sought an explanation from IG (traffic) G Laxman, who intervened to cancel a crime branch probe against Mavunkal. “The note (by IG traffic) stands cancelled. Seek the remarks of the IGP Traffic on how he has given directions in a crime case, which does not come under his jurisdiction or the line of work. Direct SP Alappuzha to conduct proper investigation in the case and to take the case to its logical conclusion for there are many other allegations against the said person for cheating and there is another file in T section on the said individual,” ADGP Manoj Abraham wrote in the file on October14, last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/based-on-intel-reports-police-seek-ed-probe/articleshow/86568060.cms||KP Saikiran

Two buildings nearing completion on VCV Street in ward 25 were sealed as the owner constructed additional floors. Two buildings were sealed in Rathinapuri after owners constructed additional buildings and residential units.A senior corporation official said that the buildings were sealed to send a message to the violators. “Inspections will be carried out to ensure that the new buildings adhere to the norms. Appropriate actions would be taken against violators,” he said. “There were not enough officials to work in the zone-level. The officials are busy with works including checking building plans, approving them, serving notices to buildings constructed in violation, checking the status of open space reserve lands and removing encroachments. Now, zone-level engineers have been asked to work with the town planning officials, which would help town planning officials to carry out pending works.”“There is no point in sealing buildings that have been completed. From now on, we will check if the buildings are constructed in the space for which permission was obtained. If a violation is found, the building owner would be either allowed to continue construction only in the permitted area or apply for approval for the additional area,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corporation-cracks-whip-on-illegal-constructions/articleshow/86567963.cms||---

The CM also directed ministers to visit homes of deceased farmers to deliver appointment letters to their family members. The meeting was held in view of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). Channi said nearly 155 appointment letters were ready and would be delivered to the victim farmers’ family members within a week. He also asked chief secretary Anirudh Tewari to ensure verification of other remaining cases expeditiously to complete the process of giving government jobs to the eligible next-of-kin. As only farmers’ issues were discussed on Monday, the next cabinet meeting is scheduled for October 1. Taking note of the resentment amongst farmers for fetching inadequate compensation in view of their land acquired by government agencies for construction of roads, the CM directed the chief secretary to explore ways and means to rationalise the quantum of compensation to be awarded to farmers. The CM said the three laws threatened the livelihood of farmers and their future generations. He said that the earlier resolutions passed by the Punjab legislative assembly in support of the farmers’ demand to repeal these laws should be conceded by the central government without any delay. The state government had earlier also reiterated its commitment to the resolutions passed by its assembly on August 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cabinet-resolution-shows-solidarity/articleshow/86568024.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Bharat bandh: Punjab shuts down, rail & road traffic hit||CHANDIGARH: Accusing the central government of not listening to them, farm groups were able to enforce a near complete Bharat Bandh in Punjab on Monday, with the move paralysing road and rail traffic. Business establishments were shut in almost all towns and cities. Attendance at government and private offices too was poor. Farm activists protested at several places, including on highways and railway tracks. Bharat Bandh was organised to mark a year of the ongoing farmers agitation in Punjab and 10 months on the borders of Delhi.  The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the ongoing farm agitation, said there were more than 500 locations in Punjab alone where people gathered to support the bandh. Non-farmer bodies too supported the bandh. “It is clear that people are tired of (PM Narendra) Modi government’s adamant, unreasonable and egoistic stand on protesting farmers’ legitimate demands, and anti-people policies in numerous sectors,” said SKM, reacting to the response to the bandh. Nearly all opposition parties, trade unions, trader, merchant and transporter associations, student and youth organisations, women’s organisations, taxi and auto unions, teachers’ and lawyers’ unions, journalists’ unions, and groups of writers and artists backed the bandh. There was support from Indian diaspora abroad too. In Punjab’s Majha region districts of Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur, and Pathankot, farmers took to streets around 5.30am and laid barricades, parked tractor-trailers and other vehicles to block roads. There was no untoward incident. Farmers allowed Amritsar passport office to work partially to clear pending documentation of passport applicants who had come from far-off places. Farm leaders also appealed to people to reach the Singhu border of Delhi on September 29 to show solidarity with farmers agitating at various borders of Delhi for the past nearly ten months. Farmer leaders addressed rallies at Jandiala, Majitha, Kathunangar, Attari and Ajnala. In Pathankot, farmers staged a protest on the Madhopur-Pathankot highway, blocking traffic to Jammu and Kashmir. Activists of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) protested at 30 places. Addressing farmers, KMSC state general secretary claimed that they received wholehearted support of people. Many people, however, accused farmers of harassing the common man. “I am being stopped from going to my shop, which means no earnings for today; how will I run my family’s daily expenses?” said Balkar Singh, who runs a small cycle repair shop. “Farmers should find some other ways to attract the attention of government and shouldn’t harass common man,” he said. A complete bandh was observed in Doaba region. While commercial establishments remained closed, there was sparse traffic on national highways, with only emergency vehicles, like ambulances, passing through. Nearly all urban centres, be it cities or towns, were shut. Farmers protested at several places in and around Jalandhar and in other towns of the region. In Malwa and Puadh regions of Punjab too, the bandh was successful. The shutdown was complete in Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Sangrur and Ropar districts, but farmers had to appeal to public sector banks and owners of factories and a school in some places to observe the strike. Farmers claimed to have got shut a government school in Passiana, Patiala district. At Dharedi Jatta toll plaza, the Patiala Vyopar Mandal president addressed farmers. 4th Bharat bandh in yearSince the protests against farm laws have started, this was the fourth call for a Bharat Bandh by protesting farmers. It is being considered the most successful Bharat Bandh over the past year. The first Bharat Bandh call was given on September 25, 2020, five days after the laws were passed by the Rajya Sabha and presidential assent was awaited.  The second call was given for December 8, 2020. After talks had broken down completely on January 22, the third call for Bharat Bandh was given on March 26, 2021. So, the latest call was the 4th one. Rs 1.5 crore PRTC lossPunjab Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) said it faced a loss of around Rs 1.5 crore due to Bharat Bandh on Monday. “We faced a loss of daily receipt amounting to Rs 1.5 crore. Buses did not ply during the protest by farmers,” said an official.

He was speaking after visiting the road that has been lying in a deplorable and unusable condition for the past several months after it was destroyed by rough seas. Surendran said the condition of this road that leads to the domestic terminal of the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport from Shangumugham is a testimony of the incompetency of the current LDF-led state government. “All the on-going development projects such as the smart city, Vizhinjam International Seaport and development of the airport, which are expected to change the face of the capital city, are being carried out with the assistance of the central government. Meanwhile, the state government is not even capable of properly repairing a road”, he said. Surendran said that all the maintenance works carried out on the road so far are unscientific. This will only cause more inconveniences to the public in the near future. The condition of the road has affected the airport users and local residents alike. The users are forced to carry their luggage and walk to the airport from Shangumugham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/surendran-slams-govt-for-pathetic-state-of-airport-road/articleshow/86537858.cms||---

In 2020, 121 elderly people from the city ended their lives, up 31% over the previous year, reveals data from the Mumbai police. Information accessed by RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge of The Young Whistleblowers’ Foundation shows 1,282 citizens committed suicide in Mumbai in 2020,an average of three individuals per day compared to 1,229 in 2019. Data shows the lockdown had greater impact on men, barring people over 60 where women were more vulnerable than men. “Senior citizens faced the worst impact in the lockdown,” said Ghadge. Among the elderly, women felt the brunt as suicides rose 60% from 23 in 2019 to 37 in 2020. In case of elderly men, there was a 21% increase in suicide from 69 in 2019 to 84 in 2020. “These figures indicate that senior citizens were deeply impacted by the lockdown. They are dependent on others for daily needs and basic living. They came under severe stress which affected their mental health,” said Ghadge. The tragic upward graph of suicides among senior citizens does not surprise octogenarian Manohar Rangnekar, director of Samaritans Mumbai, which runs a three-hour-a-day suicide prevention helpline. He said 25% of their callers in 2020 were senior citizens as opposed to 2019's 10-15%. "As it is, senior citizens were facing problems arising from loneliness and isolation. During the pandemic, these issues went from bad to worse," says Rangnekar, attributing this to the growing emotional disconnect with the youth. Steeped in the grind of making ends meet, "the younger generation was unable to take care of the elderly," says Rangnekar. In a recent survey titled 'The Silent Tormentor -- Covid-19 and the elderly' by the NGO HelpAge India, fractured communication with loved ones and an increasing sense of despondency were the overarching feelings conveyed by senior citizens. The survey included the voices of 3,000 elders living in households and old-age homes. While over 40% of elderly felt their future was bleak, nearly 60% confessed that lockdown affected their communication with family members working or studying from home. Over half of them said their income was affected. In terms of ranking of abuse, emotional abuse emerged as the most prevalent form of abuse over the last one year.  Prakash Borgaonkar of HelpAge India said the NGO's helpline got many calls from silvers feeling depressed, Borgaonkar has yet to get over one call from an 80-year-old. "He was lonely and needed someone to just talk to. I rushed to his place with a friend, spoke to him and in two hours, he perked up. He was cracking jokes," he said, stressing on the need to bridge inter-generational communication gaps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-of-elderly-ending-lives-soars-31-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/86568106.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

About 76% of the firms were confident of doubling the current business in three to five years with the new capital expenditure cycle. “This shows a positive change in the business environment of Tamil Nadu’s textile and apparel sector,” said ITF convenor Prabhu Dhamodharan.Roughly 40 or 16% of the companies surveyed, showed keen interest to explore the IPO option. While the market capitalization of Indian equity markets crossed Rs 240 lakh crore, the combined market cap of listed companies in the textile and apparel sector is only 2.2 lakh crore. The capital market is growing at a rapid pace and the textile sector is also getting a lot of interest and attention from investors with valuations rallying upwards.“ITF will guide the interested companies in making value-added products, create platforms to enable the next generation to engage, and guide companies to step into equity markets in a structural way,” said Prabhu.Renewed opportunity for Indian players in the export market, structural reforms from the centre and the new thrust from the Tamil Nadu government to support the manufacturing sector are some of the major reasons for such growth aspirations, the survey added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/textile-apparel-sector-confident-of-doubling-biz/articleshow/86568020.cms||---
---||Nagpur||48% of people bitten by dogs had either hit animal or thrown stones, says study||NAGPUR: A latest research has revealed that 48% of people who have been bitten by dogs in the country have either hit or thrown stones at the animal. On World Rabies Day which will be observed on Tuesday, India’s apex animal rights body FIAPO (Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations) highlights how past negative interactions with dogs are correlated with human-on-dog conflict. The country accounts for 36% of the total global rabies cases. Amid rising cases of dog cruelty and man-animal conflict across the country, the organization has called for urgent intervention of central and state governments. “The need of the hour is to implement a robust multi-pronged programme that includes animal birth control (ABC), vaccination, counselling and medical aid. India being a high burden country for rabies, it is necessary that the authorities adopt measures to eradicate this zoonotic disease while the country’s healthcare system is still reeling from the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” experts stated. Chilling incidents of mass killings of dogs have recently occurred across the country. In Karnataka’s Shivamogga district, 150 stray dogs were allegedly buried alive in September 2021. Around 300 dogs were allegedly culled in Lingapalem village of West Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh. In Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, five dogs died after having acid poured on them. Stating that the concerns of people affected by rising human-dog conflicts are understandable, FIAPO cited a latest research which shows that such incidents arise from a fear of dog bites, misinformation and overpopulation. “An important aspect that often goes ignored is the sense of hostility and anger that can develop in communities and individuals towards stray dogs following these altercations. Not only should there be post-bite counselling to counter this, but through a coordinated governmental effort,” the organization stated. According to the organization, this calls for a massive coordinated push — at the national and state-levels — for a countrywide anti-rabies vaccination programme for stray and pet dogs at regular intervals. “This needs to go hand in hand with the ABC programme to stop overpopulation,” the organization stated. The organization also wants provision of immediate post-bite treatment and administration of the rabies shot to bitten individuals. “People should be educated on regular vaccination and sterilization of their companion animals, and medical aid in case of dog bite,” the experts in the organization stated. To effectively implement such a nationwide programme, it’s important for rabies to be declared a notifiable disease. “Changing the disease’s official status is the key to eradicating rabies. When there is a case of rabies, all people and animals who are at risk need to be immediately identified, treated and vaccinated. Such a speedy protocol can only be implemented if rabies is made a notifiable disease,” says Bharati Ramachandran, CEO - FIAPO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/48-of-people-bitten-by-dogs-had-either-hit-animal-or-thrown-stones-says-study/articleshow/86568032.cms||Manka Behl

As many as 150 people, including 100 students, took part in the drive, conducted to create awareness on responsible waste disposal. The Coimbatore corporation is carrying out works to turn waterbodies in the city to attractive public spots. Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, who was the special guest at the cleaning drive, also pitched in to clean the lake bund. More than 200kg waste was collected from the place, Skal sources said.The organisation also conducted a blood donation camp, a sight-seeing trip for destitute and orphaned people, inter-college competitions and a photo exhibition on the occasion.A travel magazine to mark the day was launched by Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran. Addressing stakeholders of travel industry, Sameeran said more content need to be created on Coimbatore tourism on the internet to attract more people to the district. “I wanted to find some details, but could not find them even after Googling! Short videos showing the places of interest should be created and uploaded,” he suggested. “Experiential tourism is picking up everywhere and it is high time for the tourism industry people to focus on it. People want to stay in a place and become accustomed to local customs and tradition instead of travelling a lot for sightseeing. Covid-19 has affected the tourism industry and Coimbatore is no exception. However, the resilience of the people of Coimbatore is exceptional. They can find an opportunity even in this difficult situation,” the collector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mass-cleaning-drive-marks-world-tourism-day/articleshow/86568034.cms||---

Police have identified the deceased as Tara Singh, 60, of Rohle village in Samrala. Avtar Singh of Gehewal village who regularly goes to Ghulal Toll Plaza said a CCTV footage showed Tara Singh at the protest site around 12.20 am, before he allegedly hung himself from a pole adjacent to a plaza cabin. He said Tara Singh’s wife has been sitting at Tikri border in protest against farm laws since the very beginning of protests against the three central farm laws. Samrala DSP Harwinder Singh Khera said the cause of the suicide could not be known immediately and they are waiting for the arrival of the deceased’s wife, who was delayed because of the bandh. He said they will initiate inquest proceedings under Section 174 of CRPC into the matter on Tuesday. Police officials said the deceased has two sons and two daughters, all of whom are married.

These ‘achievements’ that Monson claims are over and above the endless list of ‘antiques’ that he possesses which gave him celebrity status on social media.  Also, it was these materials that he used to get featured in some mainstream newspapers and television channels as a collector of rare antique materials. Some of his claims about his antique collection are outright bizarre and investigations have prima facie found that most of them were in fact not old and many were bought or manufactured locally. It is the variety in the list of ‘antique materials’ that made Monson popular. As per the complaint against him, he showed the victims the sword of Tipu sultan, Holy Scriptures inscribed in gold, Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Bhagavad Gita, the ring of Aurangazeb, Staff of Moses, Staff of Sree Narayana Guru….the list is endless as it even claims to have the original title deed of the Mysore Palace. As per the remand report filed against Monson, police told the court that they are in the process of verifying the genuineness of the documents certifying the age of the materials in his possession. Police will collect his specimen signature, voice sample and sample handwriting for forensic examination, the report said. CB will investigate the bank transactions as per statements by witnesses and how he spent the money that he allegedly received. Police are investigating how he managed to forge an account statement of a bank including the seal. The investigation officer informed the court that they were collecting scientific evidence regarding the emails Monson sent. The court was informed that an investigation has to be done to verify his claims of a diamond business abroad. Police said that the accused is claiming to have received an honorary doctorate and the veracity of the same was also being probed. Police also requested his remand citing his connections with high profile persons in political, social and bureaucratic sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cosmetologist-philanthropist-actor-the-list-goes-on/articleshow/86568190.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The bar is engraved with an image of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. The Lakshmi bar — which contains 20g of 999.9 fine gold with Lakshmi engraved into the precious metal — has been designed by Royal Mint product designer Emma Noble, through close collaboration with the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Cardiff to ensure cultural accuracy. The bar retails at £1,080 ( 1 lakh) and will go on sale at 9 am UK time on Tuesday on the Royal Mint website. The bar, the Royal Mint’s first ever bar featuring a Hindu deity or Indian design, follows the success of henna-inspired packaging launched for 1g and 5g regular gold bars last year. Th bar will be blessed at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple’s Diwali ceremony as part of their Lakshmi Puja on November 4, with Royal Mint officials in attendance. Andrew Dickey, divisional director for precious metals at the Royal Mint, said: “With gold being a traditional and auspicious gift during the Diwali festival, we wanted to develop a product that incorporates both beauty and tradition, but with a modern twist.” The design features the godess standing on a lotus with a lotus in each hand. The symbol Om is inscribed on the packaging.

---||Mumbai||Suicides by teens in Mumbai dip 35% as they stay close to family||MUMBAI: While the suicide rate in Mumbai across all age groups went up between 2019 and 2020, the silver lining was that suicides among children and teenagers fell in the last one year. The decline was precipitous at the higher end of the sub-adult category. Experts linked the trend to parents being at home during the pandemic and the young staying socially connected with family. Among teenagers in the 14-18 age group, the drop was up to 35% from 88 in 2019 to 57 in 2020. “Suicides of children dropped mainly as they were under the watchful eyes of their parents during the lockdown,” said RTI activist Jeetendra Ghadge who sourced data from Mumbai police.  “When we surveyed youngsters, we found there were three main causes for suicide: parental pressure, educational achievement and bullying. But all those were low during Covid as parents shifted focus to their child’s health, safety and well-being. Exam pressure was not there and children were surrounded by family members and got the required connection,” said president of the Early Childhood Association and the Association of Primary Education and Research. "Suicide is most of the times an act of impulse that arises from an extreme feeling of helplessness and hopelessness mixed with fear," says cyber psychologist and psychotherapist Nirali Bhatia. "In these last two years of pandemic, when schools and colleges were shut and exam pressures reduced, students were not on their own. They are with their families. The support system is there. So, feelings of loneliness are not as pronounced," said Bhatia. Sharper cognitive abilities and growing awareness about mental health among Gen Z-ers mean the young tend to recover from grief faster than the elderly, said clinical psychologist Seema Hingorrany. Among elderly women who walked into her office last year, were three spouses of Covid deceased who said "they did not want to live after their husband's passing."

---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze will abscond if he’s allowed house arrest: NIA||MUMBAI: There is every possibility that dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze “will abscond” if his plea seking house arrest or house custody is permitted by the court, said the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday seeking its dismissal. Waze, through advocate Rounak Naik, sought house arrest for three months on the grounds that he underwent an eight-hour long open heart surgery on September 13, at a private hospital and will be discharged on September 28. He said, “TB and skin infection rates” are significantly higher in jail and chances of him contracting post-op infection in jail cannot be ruled out as he is a “high-risk patient” given that he is also diabetic. In its reply submitted by special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, the NIA said that since a chargesheet has already been filed against Waze on September 3, and the probe is completed, permitting his house arrest at this stage “is totally against the settled position of law and justice.” The agency said hospitals attached to the Taloja prison are competent “to take care” of Waze’s health. The court will hear Waze’s arguments on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-waze-will-abscond-if-hes-allowed-house-arrest-in-mumbai/articleshow/86571056.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Chandigarh||Life stops for 10 hours in Haryana, peace prevails||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana Police as well as government on Monday heaved a sigh of relief as the 10-hour long bandh call given by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) passed peacefully. The SKM leaders declared bandh as successful in the state, saying it had put normal life, road and rail transport on standstill in 17 districts of the state. A senior government official claimed that there was no impact of bandh in seven districts while in the rest of 17, it had a partial impact only. Karnal and Ambala districts, which are represented by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and home minister Anil Vij, respectively, were among the districts to observe complete bandh in terms of market closures and road and rail movements. A deserted street in Karnal market place on MondayIn Karnal, farmers carried out a protest march appealing to shopkeepers and traders to keep their shutters down in support of farm agitation. Protesters also blocked the opening ceremony of an office of a BJP candidate contesting the byelection for the post of councillor of Ward 7. Hundreds of farmers blocked roads at several points in Karnal, including NH 709 A (Karnal-Jind) at Assandh, Karnal-Kaithal road in Nissing, Assandh-Safidon road and Assandh-Panipat road for 10 hours. Karnal district president of BKU (Charuni) Jagdeep Singh Aulakh said, “Bharat Bandh call got a good response. I thank all people who supported the farming community.” According to the statement issued by the Haryana government, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Nuh, Narnaul and Rewari remained open. However, there was bandh in pockets of Nuh and Faridabad districts. Efforts to reach out to additional chief secretary, home, Rajiv Arora, DGP Prashnanta Kumar Agrawal and ADGP, law and order, Navdeep Singh Virk for details of blockades of state and national highways remained futile as they did not answer the phone calls. However, railway authorities said trains were cancelled and temporarily terminated in Haryana, especially on Chandigarh-New Delhi route which has a set of Shatabdi Express trains running in morning and afternoon. According to divisional railway office of Ambala, eight trains were cancelled and five terminated on their way to destinations due to blockade of railway tracks by farmers. Reports from across the state suggested that traders and shopkeepers had volunteered to keep the shops closed and only health services — hospitals and medical shops — remained open. In Jind, the most impact of bandh was seen in Uchana Kalan, represented by deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, where shops were closed till 4pm. Farmers pitched tent in the middle of Jind-Patiala-Delhi national highway at Uchana Kalan till 4pm. They also blocked roads at 34 points in Jind and 27 points in Kaithal. Farmers claimed that they also ensured free passage to emergency vehicles on highways. To ensure that train passengers are not put to too much trouble in case a train is stopped — like they halted the Firojpur-bound train, Chhindwara-Firojour express at 6.30am – farmers said they provided them meals. Many passengers told TOI that although they were afraid of getting stuck on the way, they appreciated the service provided to them by farmers. “Whenever we pass these villages in future, we will surely remember this day fondly,” said commuters Shivam, Poonam and Rajkumar. Ghaso Kalan village former sarpanch Ramdhan Singh said, “When Gandhi Express had halted here in 1971, carrying injured soldiers who were fighting against Pakistan, they were offered the same services of foods and medical aid by farmers. When there was waterlogging in 1995, due to flood, we had set up langar for commuters for 15 days. We have a history of serving people. We would continue our agitation against three farm laws till the end. One day Modi government will have to step down.” In Hisar, although some shops were found open in markets, there was silence on the highways and railway tracks. According to Shashi Kiran, chief public relations officer of north western railway, rail traffic on Rewari-Bhiwani, Bhiwani-Rohtak, Bhiwani-Hisar and Hanumangarh-Sadulpur-Sriganganagar rail sections was affected due to the farmers agitation. Apart from the four toll plazas of Hisar, the farmers also blocked the Ramayana railway line and Rajgarh railway line in Hisar, due to which traffic was affected. Farmers put up tents at Surewala Chowk, where the ragni competition went on throughout the day. Due to this jam, Hisar-Chandigarh, Chandigarh-Sirsa, Hisar-Tohana highways remained closed. Similarly, farmers blocked the Balsamand-Bhadra road in Balsamand village, Bhiwani Rohilla village, Sorkhi village on Hisar-Delhi highway, Shyamsukh village on Agroha-Barwala road, Ludas Shahpur road and Dhanana village in Narnaund till 4pm. The district administration had put on duty 24 duty magistrates, 24 police officers along with 10 reserve police in view of the proposed Bharat Bandh. SKM district president Shamsher Singh Numberdar said all sections of the people gave full support to the bandh. Press secretary Sube Singh Boora said bandh was observed in 360 villages of the district. Under the leadership of the district head, an appeal was made to visit the markets of Hisar to keep them completely closed. All shopkeepers gave full cooperation, he said. “Trains were not allowed to run. The railway department tried... but the train was not allowed to run beyond Adampur, Devan Muklan and Ramayana and Barwala. In today’s bandh, the bar association, trade boards, women’s committees and employees’ organisations. gave full cooperation,” he said. Janwadi Mahila Samiti took out a procession in the city and staged a dharna at Parijat Chowk. Bajrang Garg, president of Haryana Pradesh Vyapar Mandal, said grain markets across the state remained closed in support of farmers. President of Nyaya Paksha and member of SKM national executive Randeep Lohchab said the bandh in Hisar was peaceful. Trade unions and employees’ organisations gathered at Parijat Chowk and demonstrated at Bishnoi market, Arya Bazaar, Sabzi Mandi Chowk, Bhagat Singh Chowk, Gandhi Chowk, Talaki Gate to Nagori Gate. Sarva Karmachari Sangh celebrated anti-privatisation day on September 27 and supported the farmers’ movement, by protesting against the policies of the government. In Fatehabad district, farmers tore government posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the national highway. They also blocked the Dabwali national highway in many villages, including Chautala village. In Rohtak, bandh remained peaceful with national highways, state highways, link roads remaining closed in at least 25 spots. But shops in the main market remained partially open but saw few customers. Inderjit Singh of Kisan Morcha said bandh remained successful and its success was a befitting reply to the Modi regime who tried to underplay the farmers movement. Farm unions blocked NH-44 at Panipat toll plaza, Panipat-Rohtak highway near Shahpur and Mudlana villages but there was not much impact on the markets. In Ambala, railway tracks were blocked by farmers including Ambala-Saharanpur under a flyover near Phoosgarh village and Delhi-Chandigarh at Shahabad railway station. Four trains had to stop mid-way near Phoosgarh village in Yamunanagar and at Kurukshetra railway station. Passengers who were stuck at the Kurukshetra railway station were served langar by the local gurdwaras. BKU Charuni spokesman Rakesh Kumar Bains said, “The government should accept the demands of farmers.” In Ambala, the major markets remained closed, and even those in rural areas. The farmers blocked roads at Devi Nagar toll plaza on Shambhu border on NH-44, Saini Majra toll plaza on NH-152, Saha Chowk on NH-44, Hema Majra road in Mullana, Mohra, Naraingarh, Panjokhra Sahib, Football Chowk in Ambala Cantt. In Kurukshetra, they blocked NH-44 at Shahabad, NH-152 at Thana toll plaza in Pehowa, at Teokar village on Patiala road in Pehowa, at Dhurala, Mirzapur, and Birla Mandir in Thanesar city. In Yamunanagar, the farmers blocked NH-344 at Sudhail village turn, Triveni Chowk in Radaur, Dosarka Chowk in Sadhaura, Milk Majra toll plaza, Triveni Chowk in Chhachhrauli and at Kheri Lakha Singh village. Yamunanagar superintendent of police Kamaldeep Goyal said, “The blockade by farmers were reported from 17 places and about 500 policemen have been deputed at all points. The farmers are not stopping the vehicles deputed in emergency services like ambulance or Army.” Yamunanagar deputy commissioner Parth Gupta said, “About 8 to 10 duty magistrates were deputed for the day in all the sub-divisions of the district. The bandh has affected both personal and government vehicles’ movement but no emergency vehicles were stopped, as such a consensus was reached with the farm leaders.” Politicising bandhHaryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister Jai Prakash Dalal termed the bandh as opposition-sponsored call to cause grave inconvenience to public. “This bandh has caused a lot of inconvenience to general public. The opposition parties, especially the Congress, should apologise to entire state for this,” said Dalal, the first BJP minister to “react” over the bandh call by SKM. Meanwhile, opposition parties announced their support to the bandh call — Indian National Lok Dal had announced it from stage on Saturday during Jind rally, while Congress legislative Party leader Bhupinder Hooda and HPCC president Selja had asked the workers to support the call. Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda has urged the Union government to fix meeting with farmer leaders to resume talks. Govt blames oppnHaryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister Jai Prakash Dalal termed the bandh as opposition-sponsored call to cause grave inconvenience to public. “This bandh has caused a lot of inconvenience to general public.

She was also under treatment for a fall she sustained in her bathroom, police said. The deceased, identified as Kumari Kanjaka, 23, a native of Odisha, was residing at a rented house in Thanthai Periyar Nagar in Korattur with her husband Pratap Ulaka and niece Geetha Kanjaka. Police said Kumari and Geetha traveled to their hometown in Odisha where one of her relatives died during labour on September 14. After returning to Chennai on September 20, Kumari slipped in her bathroom and suffered injuries. Her husband Pratap admitted her to a private hospital. She was treated for the injuries and sent home. On September 25, when she complained of severe stomach pain she was referred to the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital. A senior doctor said, “She was critical when she came here. Tests showed perforations and infections in her womb,” adding, “We told the family that the uterus has to be removed.” “We attempted a hysterectomy but she did not recover from the surgery. We lost her within six hours of admission,” the doctor added. Her body has been sent for an autopsy. Doctors said Kumari’s family members told them she that had taken medication to abort her fetus. “Taking medications to abort the fetus that too in the seventh month can be extremely risky. The uterus may have been fragile after the fall. Irrational medications could have punctured it. We will have to wait for a detailed autopsy to ascertain the cause of death,” a doctor said. Geetha Kanjaka, in her complaint to the Korattur police, said that her aunt took some medication to abort the child fearing complications during pregnancy. The police have registered a case of unnatural death under Section 174 (III) (suspicious death) of CrPC. The investigation officer said that they are probing to ascertain the cause of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/woman-pops-pills-to-abort-fetus-dies-in-city/articleshow/86568114.cms||A Selvaraj

---||Delhi||Order enforcing Delhi government's ‘promise’ to pay rent of poor tenants stayed||NEW DELHI: Providing the AAP government a temporary relief, the Delhi high court on Monday stayed its earlier order directing formulation of a policy to implement chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s “promise” to pay rent of poor tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic last year. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, however, repeatedly queried if the government has any intention to pay those seeking its help.“Do you have any intention to make any payment at all? Are you willing to pay even 5% or 1%? You have no intention to pay but you made this statement,” the bench remarked. The court also issued notice on the government’s appeal against the order passed by a single judge on July 22. Justice Prathiba M Singh had then ruled that a chief minister’s promise to citizens was enforceable. Even while the state government remained non-committal, the court agreed “there is a prima case in its favour” and hence, granted the government relief. It added that “balance of convenience is in favour of the appellant and irreparable loss shall be caused. We stay the operation, implementation and execution of the order of the single judge till the next date of hearing.” The matter has been posted for further hearing on November 29. Senior counsel Manish Vashisht, appearing for Delhi government, submitted that in the backdrop of the outbreak of the pandemic, “a fervent appeal was made by the chief minister to the public at large not to coerce the tenants into paying rent, however, the same was found to be a sort of a promise by the single judge.” “There was no promise at all. We only said please follow the statement of the Prime Minister. We said to the landlords (that) do not coerce tenants to pay rent..and even if, to some extent, the poor do not find the means to pay, the government will look into it,” he stated. Lawyer Gaurav Jain, representing the petitioners—daily wagers and workers who sought to enforce the promise before the single judge— opposed the grant of any order of stay and highlighted that his clients have no means to pay the rent amount. The court said it would examine the issue on the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/order-enforcing-govt-promise-to-pay-rent-of-poor-tenants-stayed/articleshow/86568212.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||EDMC suspends 12 councillors for a fortnight over ruckus||New Delhi: The mayor of the BJP-run East Delhi Municipal Corporation, Shyam Sundar Agarwal, on Monday suspended 12 councillors of Aam Aadmi Party and eight nominated members for 15 days over alleged indecent behaviour and obstruction of the proceedings of the House. The mayor claimed, “Today the AAP members showed indecency in the House and obstructed the proceedings, so this action was taken. They were not letting others talk. They gathered in the well when asked to maintain discipline. Some of them even came to my seat to create ruckus and shouted slogans.” Aggarwal said a letter had also been sent to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to suspend the membership of eight nominated councillors of AAP. “The 10 nominated aldermen are expected to contribute to the proceedings of the House by giving genuine suggestions, but here they are just busy creating ruckus,” he alleged, adding that on Monday, they gathered in the well, used unparliamentary language, pushed other councillors, and damaged government properties. The leader of opposition in the House, AAP’s Manoj Tyagi, alleged that his party’s councillors were suspended for raising their voice against corruption. “EDMC is involved in corruption in collaboration with builders. EDMC cleared the building plan for a temple without any field visit, so we asked for action,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-suspends-12-councillors-for-a-fortnight-over-ruckus/articleshow/86568345.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: VM Sudheeran refuses to relent, gives up AICC membership||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former KPCC president VM Sudheeran made it clear that he will not take back his resignation until the high command responded positively to the suggestions he had submitted. After PAC, Sudheeran had also given up AICC membership as a mark of protest. However, he lashed out at the present leadership when AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar called on him at his residence. After the meeting he said, “I was upset with the new leadership over their style of functioning. There were huge expectations when a leadership change happened. They started on the wrong foot and many of the decisions they took are not in the best interest of the party.” Sudheeran said he had written a letter to the high command, detailing all these but there was no positive response. “This was the reason why I decided to react. I quit PAC as there was no constructive discussion in the party. Though a list was submitted to the high command on new officebearers, there was no discussion on this in the party,” he said. Sudheeran reiterated that he had never recommended names for positions in the party; but that doesn’t mean that he should not be consulted while making changes. “The party is going through its worst phase and the present state of affairs, from the new leadership, aren’t going to benefit the party. The party is going to lose considerably and I had to react,” he added. “I’m thankful that AICC leaders gave me a patient hearing, heard my suggestions and grievances. I’m waiting for the response from the party high command. I expect a positive response,” said Sudheeran, when asked if he will withdraw his resignation. After discussions, Anwar said, “His suggestions are important for the party and his advice will be considered. We had a fruitful discussion and all his suggestions will be conveyed to the high command.” It was a rude shock for the party when Sudheeran’s resignation came out on Monday. It is learnt that he had sent his resignation a few days ago to the high command as AICC didn’t consider his demands. Tariq Anwar meets Mullappallly:Meanwhile, former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran denied the allegations of K Sudhakaran that he never picked up the call from the KPCC president. “No leader has made such a complaint till date. I will be the last leader to wait for an appointment to meet the KPCC president,” he said. Anwar also met Ramachandran at his residence as part of pacifying senior leaders who are upset with the ongoing restructuring in the party. After the meeting, Ramachandran said, “The leadership should take all senior leaders into confidence in all decision-making processes in the party.” He told Anwar that he was totally sidelined during discussions on the party’s restructuring and was not consulted even once.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sudheeran-refuses-to-relent-gives-up-aicc-membership/articleshow/86568246.cms||---

Minister for animal husbandry J Chinchurani said the state government is aiming to produce more disease-resistant cattle without compromising in the milk production in its efforts towards attaining self-sufficiency or even surplus milk production in the state. For this, such collaborations will be useful because the cattle are now to be made more adaptable to resource poor situations and also to the predicted climate change issues. While speaking on the occasion J N Moorthy, director of IISER, said the organisation is happy to enter into such scientific collaborative ventures for improving the productivity and disease resistant abilities of cattle in the state by modifying the genetic structure in a favourable way best suited to the situations and the requirements of the farming community. Jose James, managing director of KLDB, said cutting edge technologies will be put to use in the research project, utilizing the world class infrastructure available with the IISER. Collection of samples, processing, isolation of DNA, etc shall be done by the KLDB. The IISER will arrange for the genome sequencing and associated works and also provide expertise in processing the data and analysis. The minister also visited the sophisticated instrumentation facilities of IISER, including the specific pathogen-free animal house at IISER.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/livestock-board-to-collaborate-with-iiser/articleshow/86538068.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Residents count losses as water finally recedes||KOLKATA: A week after the deluge left city’s neighbourhoods along the eastern periphery severely inundated, many are just beginning to count the losses with the water finally receding in parts of New Town, Rajarhat, Nayabad and pockets of Narendrapur on Monday. Cars have been the biggest casualty with several dozens living along the belt reporting snags. In Nayabad, Swapan Mondal’s brand new car had to be abandoned in water after it stopped midway. “The car lay in the water for hours till a breakdown truck came and towed it away,” the executive of a private sector company said. Dipak Roy, an octogenarian who lives with his wife at Elita Garden Vista in New Town, is staring at a repair bill of Rs 10,000 from the workshop after his car was stuck in a foot-and-a-half deep water for three days. “The brakes are jammed. The brake oil, engine oil and filters need to be changed. The car needs to be serviced. This is a needless expense,” said Roy. At Shukhobrishti that was waterlogged till Monday, elevators in several apartments cannot be used as water has filled the ducts. “Water needs to be pumped out and the place dried before services can be restored,” said a resident. Manicured gardens that were the pride of many housing complexes are in a mess as are internal roads. “Repairs have to be carried out. It will be expensive and every apartment owner in the complex will have to contribute towards it,” an apartment owner at Shukhobrishti pointed out. In many complexes in Rajarhat as well as along EM Bypass, water had inundated facilities on the ground floor, including community centres. After being under water for four-five days, furniture and electrical appliances need to be changed. In pockets of Narendrapur, families have had to move out of ground floor apartments inundated in a foot-deep water. Residents are now returning to assess the damage. Those who reside in single-storey homes in Parnasree Subhas Marg and Nivedita Pally near Behala Flying Club and Behala’s Porui Daspara and neighbourhoods near Garia station are also faced with damages to refrigerators and furniture. Jhuma Chowdhury, who lives in Tentulberia, said: “I have been living here for 20 years. Except for once in 2012, our house has never been inundated. I don’t know how much loss I have incurred,” she said. While most are dealing with financial loss, at Moonbeam housing complex, 65-year-old resident Fulmati Singh suffered a fracture in the arm after she slipped and fell in the parking lot that had become slippery due to water stagnation. “We had to admit her to a hospital. She will undergo a surgery on Tuesday,” said her husband Biwanath Pratap Singh. Among the worst sufferers are guards. When the water level increased last Monday, their shelters got inundated first. “I had raised my cot by placing bricks under it. But it still suffered damage. Living in a damp room, I am also feeling feverish,” said Radheshyam Pandey, a guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-count-losses-as-water-finally-recedes/articleshow/86565824.cms||Suman Chakraborti

While the city is set to receive long spells, including an intense one, east and west Midnapore and south and north 24 Parganas, too, could receive downpour. The rain could continue till Wednesday but may turn light to moderate as the circulation loses strength and moves towards Bankura, Birbhum and Purulia. Formed over northeast and east central Bay of Bengal, the circulation may strike south Bengal early on Tuesday, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Once it reaches south Bengal, light to moderate rain could begin immediately. “There is a possibility of the system reaching Gangetic Bengal after Monday midnight or very early on Tuesday, triggering an incessant spell that may turn heavy later in the day,” said RMC director GK Das. The circulation, however, may not intensify into a depression, though the possibility is still not being ruled out. While Kolkata, Howrah, Hoogly, North 24 Parganas and Jhargram could receive heavy rain (70mm-110 mm) on Tuesday, one or two places in east and west Midnapore and South 24 Parganas could receive very heavy showers (70mm-200mm). Even though the chances of heavy rain were higher on Tuesday, the intense spell could be deferred to Wednesday if the system moves slowly, said weathermen. Meanwhile, cyclone Gulab lost intensity and weakened into a deep depression on Monday. It had no impact on Kolkata, though. The city remained dry and sunny for the better part of Monday morning. Gulab had a landfall between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur around Sunday midnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-eyes-rain-from-cyclonic-circulation-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/86565827.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Pune||Private schools in Pune want post-Diwali reopening for seamless education||PUNE: Private schools in the city are questioning the timing of the state’s decision to reopen offline schools with Diwali vacations starting within three weeks. The school managements said the announcement of reopening and shutting down of schools was disturbing the schedule. The teachers also said that October was time for mid-term exams and it would not be possible to conduct exams offline especially in urban areas as not all parents would be confident enough to send their children to school immediately. The Podar International School is planning to reopen and conduct the mid-term exams in online and offline manner. The school’s representatives said initially they intend to start with 50% attendance with parent’s consent. Smita Patterson, principal of the school, said, “Our mid–term exams are getting over on September 29 in the online mode. But yes, the CICSE Board is going to conduct semester I for Stds 10 and 12 through online mode from November 15. If things go well, the pandemic remains under control and the parents give consent for their wards to appear for the Semester I from school, we will be ready to conduct it. It will not be mandatory for the students; instead a blended system of attempting online exam from school/ home will be in place. The choice would be of the parents and students.” Principal of M S Golwalkar school, Leena Talathi, said, “We are trying to reopen on October following all safety norms and guidelines given by the government. We may also think of conducting offline exams by maintaining social distancing, temperature checks, screening, wearing mask.” Principal of Sanskriti School, Bhukum, Damini Joshi, said the school was working out the modalities for reopening school for students from 8-12 after seeking consent from the parent community. “We have prepared detailed SOPs going beyond what is laid down by the government. Our priority will be to bring the children back to school and offer them a safe and healthy environment. As for mid-term exams for Std 10 and XII, they will be conducted offline. This exercise will help prepare the students for the board examinations,” she said. Principal of Sindhu Vidya Bhavan, Pradnya Suryawanshi, said they are planning to reopen as they received the notification. Mid-term exams are planned both online and offline. We will conduct as per the situation. We may start with 50% attendance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-schools-want-post-diwali-reopening-for-seamless-edu/articleshow/86565831.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Amritsar||Pest infestations: Punjab farmers question BT seed claims||Bathinda: The pink bollworm attack on cotton crop in Punjab has made farmers a worried lot, as memories of whitefly attack in September 2015 are still fresh in their minds. The continued pest attack on cotton crop despite claims of BT technology to be pest resistant, has made them question the quality of seeds and the role of pest controlling authorities as well as why the state agriculture department had failed to act timely to save the crop from being getting damaged or at least minimising of the impact of the attack. To prevent such attacks in future, the demands to check the quality of seeds and pesticides has started gaining ground. The Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) authorities said it is studying the resistance of BT technology to pink bollworm and the steps to be taken to avoid the attack. The 2015 whitefly attack had caused over 60% damage to cotton crop. Now, the pink bollworm attack, though mainly witnessed in Bathinda and Mansa districts, is expected to cause loss to the crop on the similar lines as just these two states alone account for 56% of the total crop sown in Punjab (1.70 lak hectares of 3.04 lakh). Like 2015, the fault lies with spurious cotton seed and insecticides. It is said the spurious seeds are transported from Gujarat. Going by the gravity of the situation, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi assured full government support and directed the officials to set up laboratories to check the quality of seeds and insecticides. TOI looked into the aspects of pink bollworm, witnessed for the first time in Punjab at this scale, though the pink bollworm attack has been witnessed in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The genetically modified BT (baccilus thuringiensis) is said to be pest resistant cotton variety. Presently, Bollgard II variety is sown in India. It has been found the BT is resistant to American bollworm and spotted bollworm, but not pink bollworm. Head of CICR regional station in Sirsa Surendra Kumar Verma said, “The seeds coming from Gujarat, from mainly oil extraction mills, had slowly started monophagous stage from larve — eggs turning into pupa, which finally turn into adults. These develop inside the flower so is not easily spotted in the initial stage. What started in Gujarat in 2018 is now taking shape in 2021. This and first was spotted at Palwan village in Jind (Haryana), but we contained it. We had held a meeting with agriculture department officials from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan on September 7 at Sirsa where we had sounded the alert of the suspected attack of pink bollworm. CICR is very serious and issuing advisories and we are now concerned about the carry over to the next crop and will study the impact in detail.” Punjab agriculture department director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said the seeds and pesticides of same nature were used but Muktsar and Fazilka is spared from the attack. “It varies from field to field in Bathinda and Mansa,” he added. Symptoms of pink bollworm Pink bollworm (pectinophora gossypiella) is a term used for moth larva. Discoloured lint, burrowed seed, rosetted flowers and the holes at the entry plugged by excreta of larvae, which are feeding inside the seed kernels are its typical symptoms. Larvae cut window holes in the two adjoining seeds thereby forming double seeds. The attacked buds and immature bolls drop off. Saving next crop According to Sidhu, the pest attack chances remain high from three factors — from ginning factories, cottonseed oil mills and the stacks of cotton sticks. “We need proper cleaning processes at the mills to ensure there are no unopened or not properly open bolls and need to destroy the cotton sticks by all means by January-February to stop the carry over of the attack. The sticks either need to be cut into pieces and ploughed back in soil as like paddy stubble or have to burn these to stop larva production,” he added. Labs There are three insecticides testing laboratories in Punjab — in Bathinda, Ludhiana and Amritsar — where 4,500 samples could be tested. Pesticides The agriculture department has demanded 1.11 lakh litre PAU recommended cypermethrin pesticide to have two sprays on the entire cotton crop. The sprays have to be made by the first week of October. Markfed has to supply it to the agriculture department which will provide it to farmers without any charge. Compensation According to state government policy, Rs 12,000 per acre compensation is provided if the damage to crop is from 76 to 100% and out of it Rs 5,600 is provided by the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pest-infestations-punjab-farmers-question-bt-seed-claims/articleshow/86568301.cms||Neel Kamal

As per statistics of the revenue department, Kannur (2,255.52 acre), Kozhikode (1,580.28 acre), Kasaragod (1,362.83 acre), Wayanad (933.56 acre) and Idukki (716.65 acre) are the top five districts where surplus land is yet to be taken over, while Kottayam (17.39 acre) and Kollam (41.58 acre) have the least extents. There are 1,295 land ceiling cases pending for disposal that have been booked against those holding land more than the permissible limits, in the 77 taluk land boards across the state. Malappuram (223) and Wayanad (206) are on top of the list of districts with cases pending for disposal. The pendency of cases in the various land tribunals in the state are even higher. There are 1,27,253 cases pending in 17 mother land tribunals, 16 devaswom land tribunals and 16 offices which have been given the charge of land tribunals. The cases pertain to complaints from tenants, who have been occupying the land for years but have no ownership of it. As per the land holding limits of the Land Reforms Act, an individual can hold a maximum of 7.5 acre, a family of two to five members can own a maximum of 15 acre and a family with more than five members can hold a maximum of 20 acre. Also, companies and organisations can hold up to a maximum of 15 acre and for holding more than this limit, it should get exemption under section 81(3) of KLR Act. As per section 81 of the Land Reforms Act, plantations, land owned by religious, charitable or educational institutions, sites of temples, churches, mosques and cemeteries and burning and burial ground, land occupied by educational institutions, land comprised in mills, factories or workshops which are necessary for their operation, private forests, etc, are eligible for exemption from the land ceiling limits. It is under this section that the plantations exist in private hands in the state and the exemption has been provided to coffee, cardamom, rubber, cinnamon, cocoa, tea or cashew plantations that existed before April 1, 1964. The government is going ahead with the concept of unique thandaper number to every land holder in the state. As the permission to link this to the Aadhaar number has been received from the Centre, once it is done, it will give a comprehensive data of land holding of a person anywhere in the state. This would mean that once this is done, land beyond the ceiling limit cannot be held by a person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/surplus-land-over-8000-acres-yet-to-be-taken-over/articleshow/86568294.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Mumbai||Mumbai University to have more descriptive questions in tech courses in November exam||MUMBAI: In a move to make online exams more accountable, Mumbai University has decided to include more descriptive questions in technical courses like engineering, pharmacy and architecture in the November exams. The university will also give away question banks to colleges for undergraduate professional and self-financed courses, like it did for postgraduate exams in May. Most exams for final year students in traditional arts, science and commerce colleges will commence on November 17 in the online mode, a circular issued by the university stated on Monday. For engineering, pharmacy, architecture and MCA, instead of having a question paper with 50% MCQs (multiple choice questions) in the 80-mark question paper, the university has decided to give only 25% weightage. In the 80-mark paper for all technical courses, only 20 marks will be given to MCQs, while the rest will be descriptive questions, said university director (examinations & evaluations), Vinod Patil. The exam duration has been increased to two and a half hours. Question banks will be given to colleges for self-financed courses such as BMS, BAF, BBI, mentioned the instruction booklet for November-December exams for the first time. Colleges will have to set papers using question banks. In the May exam, question banks were given only for postgraduate exams. For three semester exams conducted online for undergraduate courses, question papers were prepared by lead colleges in clusters decided by the university. “So, whatever was done by the lead colleges, will now be done by the university,” said an official. A principal said the move to give away question banks may ensure to some extent that the quality of questions used in the paper are not below standard, but it cannot control malpractices students indulge in. Having more descriptive questions is welcome, he said, adding that these questions should be application-based. Question banks will also be sent for law and BEd courses, the university’s directive said. The university also announced exam dates for backlog exams and for professional courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-univ-to-have-more-descriptive-questions-in-tech-courses-in-nov-exam/articleshow/86570148.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Goa||Climate change behind rising dengue cases, says ICMR doc||Panaji: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director Regional Medical Research Centre, Gorakhpur, Dr Rajnikant Srivastava attributed the rise in dengue cases in many parts of India to climate change and excessive intermittent rains experienced this year. While malaria cases have shown a significant decline in the country, “the problem of dengue has been rising again and again because of climate change”, he said. “This year we have witnessed huge and excessive rainfall and we continue to experience it even towards the end of September,” Srivastava said. “The rainfall is not heavy, but intermittent and this is causing innumerable mosquito breeding sites in flowerpots, tyres, coolers and broken earthen pots. Wherever there is a small space for water to stagnate, the aedes aegypti mosquito starts breeding,” he said, adding that urbanisation is also a factor. When asked why the rise in states like Goa, Srivastava said it is not only western states that are witnessing a rise in cases. “Dengue is rising in many other parts of India, for example in UP the mysterious fever was found to be because of dengue,” he said. He advised people to be aware and avoid stagnation of water. “Take preventive measures. Wear full sleeve shirts, full trousers so that there’s no space for mosquitoes to bite or use a repellent. The dengue mosquito is a day biter,” he said. “The malaria mosquito bites one person and if its full will not bite another. But the dengue mosquito infects at least 5-10 persons as a result there is a sudden increase in cases,” he added, while speaking at a webinar organized by Godrej consumer products.

In Gangapur city of Sawai Madhopur, a constable and head-constable, who received the exam question paper at 8.30am, almost 90 minutes before the exam, were arrested. This incident was highlighted, but RBSE said investigation was going on. RBSE chairman Dharampal Jaroli said, “Both the constables were apprehended immediately after the paper leak. Police are investigating. We have no plans of conducting the examination right now. Once the investigation is done, we will decide as per the government’s directions.” More than 16 lakh candidates sat for REET on September 26 in which more than 35 people were arrested and two dozen detained for cheating. In Mandan centre of Alwar, the RBSE has decided to conduct re-examination for 600 candidates. According to candidates, they protested at the centre as there was delay in paper distribution and extra time wasn’t given. When the candidates protested, police resorted to lathicharge. After much agitation, a report was sought from the district examination steering committee by RBSE. Jaroli said this was a mistake on part of the administration as due to some technical problems, the paper were distributed late. Hence, re-examination will be done soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rbse-not-in-mood-to-conduct-re-exam/articleshow/86568313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Bharat bandh evokes mixed response in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: The Bharat bandh called by farmers against the three agriculture laws of the Centre evoked mixed response in Rajasthan on Monday. Major impact of the bandh was visible mainly in agriculture-dominated Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, where major mandis and markets remained closed. Farmer-labourer organisations took out a rally in Jaipur and forced traders to down shutters. Office bearers of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), including state president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Rajaram Meel, took out a tractor rally in the city. Shops pulled down shutters during the rally but those in the colonies and interior areas remained open. A shopkeeper closes his shopThe rally was taken out by farmers, workers, students, youth, women, social organisations from Martyrs Memorial at Government Hostel via MI Road, Sanganeri Gate, Badi Chaupar, Chhoti Chaupar, Chandpole Bazaar, Sanjay Circle, Sindhi Camp Bus Stand, Khasa Kothi Circle and reached district collectorate. Groups of students and youth were seen in the markets appealing to the traders to close the shops. The SKM, which is leading the agitation against the three farm laws, had given the call for ‘Bharat bandh’. The effect of the shutdown was visible in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur too. Mandis and markets were partially closed in cities and towns of these districts. Agitating farmers blocked the major roads and held meetings. The bandh affected train services in the border districts. The ruling Congress party supported the bandh. Congress Seva Dal and Youth Congress workers participated in the agitation. Seva Dal rally was inaugurated by PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra, alleged that PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah had agreement with industrialists before bringing three black laws. The industrialists who donated huge amount in the form of election donations, had built warehouses in advance. So government is not ready to withdraw this black law. Enacted in September last year, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the legislations would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the ‘mandi’ (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bharat-bandh-evokes-mixed-response/articleshow/86568355.cms||---
---||Delhi||Monkeys being shifted without tests, finds panel||New Delhi: A member of a Delhi High Court-appointed committee for translocation of monkeys has written to the chief wildlife warden of Delhi, stating that monkeys were being captured and trans-located to Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary without conducting any tests for tuberculosis or rabies, which may affect the existing simian population.The member, Sonya Ghosh, also claimed the animals were being transported in extremely small cages and being kept in inhumane conditions – violations the forest department needs to immediately address.A 2007 Delhi High Court order had directed monkeys to be caught and sent to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, located in south Delhi, where over 25,000 monkeys are said to be living, according to a 2018 submission made to the high court.In her letter, Ghosh, who has also been appointed by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) to identify feeding points for stray dogs across the city, stated that violations under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, needed to be looked into, with seven monkeys recently caught from Vasant Kunj by South Delhi Municipal Corporation using cages that the monkeys could not even stand in.“The monkeys were confined in four metal cages (3ft x 2ft x 2ft). Two cages had one large male each, the third one had three young monkeys and the fourth had a mother and baby. These four cages were kept inside a bigger cage. The male monkeys could hardly stand in the cramped cages,” Ghosh wrote in the letter, stating the simians were also kept outside in the sun and rain for hours.She alleged that monkeys were later released into the sanctuary without being medically examined. According to Delhi High Court judgment, each monkey being shifted needs to be examined first. “The monkeys, which are to be shifted to Bhatti Mines, shall be subjected to medical examination as far as possible so that they do not suffer from any communicable disease, which will prove injurious to the healthy monkeys,” the judgment states.However, a senior forest official said the allegations were incorrect, stating that a rescue centre existed at the sanctuary where monkeys are first examined before being released inside. “Earlier, they were even being quarantined before being released, owing to the pandemic. We will, however, examine the allegations made and take corrective action wherever required,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monkeys-being-shifted-without-tests-finds-panel/articleshow/86565962.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Infrastructure for aborted ‘Platina trial’ now helps treat dengue, leptospirosis||MUMBAI: The Platina trial of convalescent plasma therapy that was aborted in January due to safety and futility concerns has led to some unintended gains. The blood bank infrastructure that was created or strengthened for the trial is now coming to the aid of dengue and leptospirosis patients at several centres. Platina trial was carried out across 21 medical colleges of Maharashtra to study the efficacy of convalescent plasma in treating severe Covid-19 patients. In January, the trial was aborted after the researchers found additional potential risk by continuing it. A sum of Rs 16.9 crore was sanctioned to blood banks of the trial centres for procurement of apheresis machines that separate plasma from whole blood, plasma kits, chairs, refrigerators, cold storage, as well as for hiring manpower. At the Government Medical College in Latur, the apheresis machine continues to be used for regular plasma extraction. “It has helped us a great deal in the treatment of malaria, dengue and leptospirosis patients,” said Dr Maroti Karale from the pathology department. Before the trial, the blood bank used to be a rudimentary one under the civil surgeon. Now, besides the apheresis upgrade, the bank has also been brought under the medical college jurisdiction. In Chandrapur, where the incidence of dengue is high, they have been able to use the machine to generate single donor platelets. The blood bank had an apheresis machine already, but the trial helped them expedite multiple permissions such as license for segregation, said Dr Prakash Potdukhe of Government Medical College. Another centre said they already had an apheresis machine but used the trial funds to procure -80 and -40 degree cold storage facilities. Of the 21 centres, only six had apheresis machines prior to the trial. Dr Mohammed Faisal, who was nodal officer of the Platina trial, said that the medical education department could cut red tape and procure nearly a dozen apheresis machines within three weeks last June. “At one go, many blood banks in the state have equipped themselves with machines and upgraded their overall infrastructure that otherwise could have taken years,” he said. A senior medical education official added that the upgrade could also allow the colleges to apply for postgraduate seats in transfusion medicine, a branch that specialises in the study of proper use of blood and blood components. Currently, Maharashtra produces only a handful of transfusion medicine specialists. However, there are also a handful of centres where the machine and infrastructure are lying idle. In Gondia’s government medical college, doctors claimed they couldn’t use the apheresis machine due to unavailability of component separation license. “We are still not a full-fledged college and don’t have a transfusion medicine department. We don’t have the manpower to run component separation, etc,” said one of the doctors, adding that there’s a shortage of manpower too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-infra-for-aborted-platina-trial-now-helps-treat-dengue-lepto/articleshow/86568376.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Traffic was blocked only at few places as the HP-based Sanyukt Kisan Manch protested demanding help for apple farmers. Farmers and apple growers held protest demonstrations in support of their demands at state capital, beside Theog, Kotkhai, Jubbal, Rohru, Narkanda, Rampur area of the district, Nalagarh in Solan district and Paonta Sahib in Sirmaur district. In Shimla town, protesters, under the banner of Sanyukat Kisan Manch, blocked traffic near Victory Tunnel, while some members of Kisan Mazdoor Sandarsh Samiti blocked traffic at Nalagarh Chowk. Sanyukat Kisan Manch convenor Harish Chauhan claimed that their bandh call received massive support of public, beside various farmers organisations. Co-convenor Sanjay Chauhan said despite the memorandum being sent to the government regarding their 13 demands, including not getting the right prices for apple crop, arbitrariness of corporate companies, loot at APMC mandis and check posts, the government did not listen to them. Besides repeal the new farm laws, the protesters also sought implementation of MSP for all crops, implementation of market intervention scheme (MIS) on the lines of Kashmir for apple, compressed atmospheric (CA) stores of private companies, and apple growers should be allowed to store their 25% boxes. They are also demanding 90% subsidy on the construction of CA stores by the farmers’ cooperative societies, beside rolling back the hike in the transportation fare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/protests-in-shimla-solan-sirmaur-too/articleshow/86568360.cms||---
---||Delhi||Head constable’s death: HC denies bail to rioter||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday denied bail to an accused caught on CCTV footage carrying a sword during the northeast Delhi riots in February last year. Justice Subramonium Prasad rejected the bail plea of Mohd Ibrahim while taking note of the footage that showed Ibrahim with a sword in the area where head constable Rattan Lal was killed. The court observed that the riots “evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment, and the conduct of the protesters who are present in the video footage which has been placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrays that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the government as well as to disrupt the life of people in the city.” In a connected plea, however, the court granted bail to Mohd Salim Khan who was found present at the spot. The court said even though usage of a wiper to turn away the CCTV camera implies that Khan may have been in the know-how of the impending riots, “the extent to which the charge can be added against the petitioner cannot be deconstructed by this court at this point and is a matter of trial.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/head-constables-death-hc-denies-bail-to-rioter/articleshow/86568386.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Over 100 MLAs with CM Ashok Gehlot, says Rajasthan minister close to Rahul Gandhi||JAIPUR: Putting the rumour mills to rest over leadership change in Rajasthan, revenue minister Harish Chaudhary on Monday claimed that the political situations in Punjab and Rajasthan were different and could not be compared. “In Punjab, the MLAs deserted chief minister Captain Amrindar Singh, while in Rajasthan more than 100 MLAs are with Ashok Gehlot,” said the minister. Chaudhary was one of the AICC observers in Punjab after Capt Amarinder Singh resigned for the election of the new chief minister there. He was speaking on the sidelines of press conference held at his residence to speak on the Prashasan Gaom Ke Sangh campaign being organised from October 2 to December 17. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot will also conduct surprise inspection by landing in any of the villages to get first hand information of the campaign, it was informed. On the question of the removal of Captain Amarinder, Harish Chaudhary said, “the Congress gave a lot to the Captain. The MLAs of Punjab wanted a leadership change. Change took place in Punjab in a democratic way.” On the question of insulting Captain Amarinder, he said, “how did the insult happen. It was the demand of the legislators that there should be a change. In Congress, everyone is free to express his views.” He described the leadership change in Punjab as ‘historic’. A person who worked as a tent labourer has become the chief minister. This is possible only in Congress. Gehlot has also become the chief minister from a common worker. He claimed that the leadership issue in Rajasthan was settled when Gehlot was elected CM. On the question of recent Sachin Pilot meeting Rahul Gandhi, Chaudhary said, “I do not know how many times Pilot met Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi.” He is a member of the Congress family and is free to meet the Congress leadership,” he quipped. On the question he becoming another power centre in the state Congress after his role in Punjab, Chaudhary said, “It would be wrong to say power centre. The power centre terminology itself is wrong. I am the son of a farmer. Farmers have already suffered a lot,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-100-mlas-with-gehlot-says-raj-min-close-to-rahul/articleshow/86568379.cms||---

TimesViewConstruction workers are nameless spokes in the giant wheels of history. A digital archive dedicated to them will give them identity, underline a state’s respect for their contribution. In future, similar people-friendly steps should be taken for all major projects of the government.He interacted with the workers engaged at the site and also enquired about their well-being. He stressed that they are engaged in a pious and historic work. The surprise inspection by the Prime Minister was done with minimal security detail. He spent over an hour at the site.

---||Pune||ZP teachers flag order on CSR funds for Covid infra||Pune: Several teachers, especially from rural zilla parishad schools, have raised concerns over the September 24 government resolution (GR) telling educational institutes to procure pandemic-necessitated equipment without providing the requisite funding. Schools in the state are scheduled to reopen from October 4 with various protocols and guidelines in place. According to the GR, schools have to get the required money either from corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds or raise local funds. A zilla parishad schoolteacher from Jalna said the government should have taken the initiative to sanitise schools. “Many schools were Covid-19 quarantine centres and thorough cleaning is required. Money should be deposited in the headmaster’s account, specifically for reopening purposes,” said the teacher. further explained the limitations of government funding based on the number of classes and students. “If a school has classes I to IV, it gets around Rs 5,000-10,000 as non-salary grant from the government depending upon the number of students, and if there are classes from I to VIII, it gets around Rs 20,000. This amount is provided on a yearly basis and teachers are supposed to do everything, from painting to cleaning to paying for stationery, replacing furniture, repairing the building, paying electricity bill among others,” said the teacher.  “Just because some schools make a big deal about the CSR funding they get, it doesn’t mean every school can obtain it. In most rural schools, 90% of the funding for various things comes from teachers themselves,” said another schoolteacher, underlining that the mindset that it is a teacher’s responsibility to earn money for the school needs to change. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson for the Maharashtra State Headmasters Association, said while the government has not provided schools with non-salary grants for the past two years it now is telling them to come up with funds on their own. “CSR funding is for one-time projects, not recurring expenses. CSR funds can be obtained for projects such as setting up drinking water facility or installation of solar panels, not to employ staff for daily sanitisation,” explained Ganpule. “The government needs to pay the non-salary grant immediately and also give additional funds to rural schools for cleaning and other Covid-19 prevention measures,” said Ganpule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-teachers-flag-order-on-csr-funds-for-covid-infra/articleshow/86565903.cms||Ardhra Nair

However, it said that a plan of action in the form of appropriate SOPs would have to be drawn up by the government before deciding on the reopening. Schools, too, would have to be given time to prepare, committee member Shekhar Salkar said. “The expert committee felt that the task force can decide when schools should be opened. The schools will need to be given time to work out a seating arrangement,” Salkar said. The members felt that lower classes should not be opened. “However, parents can decide if they want their children to attend classes online. The option should be given to them. All SOPs will have to be developed by the government, the expert committee can’t do it as we don’t know the structure of the schools,” he said. He said after around 15 days or during Diwali, the committee would assess how the arrangement is working, and then a decision could be made about opening lower classes. The discussion during the meeting was limited to opening to schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-to-recommend-reopening-of-schools-for-classes-ix-xii/articleshow/86568422.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Filing PILs has become a career for many people, says SG in Rakesh Asthana case||NEW DELHI: Filing PILs has become an industry, even a career, for many citizens who wish to run this country, the Centre told Delhi high court on Monday as the court wrapped up hearings into a PIL challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as the police commissioner of Delhi. “PIL is an industry, even a career by itself, which was not envisaged by the Constitution. Some citizens have a desire to run the government, but can’t succeed in the democratic route; so they fulfil their unfulfilled desire by filing PILs saying why this appointment is wrong, that policy is wrong... They are busybodies,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, which reserved its verdict on lawyer Sadre Alam’s PIL. Mehta, representing the Centre, maintained the appointment was made following due procedures. The power to appoint vests with the government and there is limited scope for judicial review as long as the procedure is followed, he contended. “The very fact that the same procedure was followed eight times earlier... and never questioned is ground enough to accept my submission that there is something other than public interest,” he claimed. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Asthana, alleged that the petitioner was “a proxy for somebody who does not want to come in the front” and held “personal vendetta”. Both the Centre and Asthana objected to the intervention plea filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has already moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s July 27 order. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing CPIL, called the Centre’s stand that it found no eligible officer in the Union territory cadre “astounding” and claimed it had a “demoralising effect”. He also claimed Union Public Service Commission wasn’t consulted before the appointment, which was done in violation of the inter-cadre transfer rules and a Supreme Court ruling as per which a police chief at a UT is a commissioner, not director general of police. Lawyer B S Bagga, appearing for the petitioner, contended the appointment was against the settled service law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/filing-pils-has-become-a-career-for-many-people-sg-in-asthana-case/articleshow/86568444.cms||Abhinav Garg

The protest saw blockades at about 20 locations falling under Delhi, Ambala and Ferozepur divisions of Northern Railway. By the evening, around 50 trains had been cancelled, while others had to be diverted, short-terminated and short-originated, officials said. Meanwhile, passengers also found it difficult to reach the Delhi airport as traffic snarls near the Delhi-Gurgaon border stretched on for hours. Airlines urged people to reach at least three hours in advance to board their flights on time. Officials said among the major trains impacted on Monday included Delhi-Amritsar Shan-e-Punjab, New Delhi-Moga Express, Old Delhi-Pathankot Express, Vande Bharat Express from New Delhi to Katra and the Amritsar Shatabdi. Deepak Kumar, CPRO, Northern Railway, said around 50 trains had been cancelled by the evening and the blockade removed from most points by 4pm. “By the evening, operations had normalised, however, during the day, there were at least 20 blockades which fell under Delhi, Ambala and Ferozepur divisions. Train movements from Delhi to Ambala and Delhi to Bathinda were particularly impacted,” he added. Farmers were seen occupying railway tracks across Punjab and Haryana, which meant certain routes could not be used during the day. Railway officials said passengers were being informed in real-time of possible delays, short-terminations and cancellations. Delhi airport, too, asked passengers to check with airlines and reach the airport early on Monday. “Commute to Delhi airport may get impacted between 6 am and 4 pm due to the planned nationwide shutdown today. Passengers are advised to contact the local traffic police and the airlines concerned for more information,” it said on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/trains-hit-roads-leading-to-igi-jammed/articleshow/86565958.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||India||Three killed as Gulab batters Andhra; spares Odisha||VISAKHAPATNAM/ BHUBANESHWAR: Three people were reportedly killed in Andhra Pradesh as cyclone Gulab barrelled through the state after making landfall late on Sunday near Kalingapatnam, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction across the two worst-hit districts of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. Odisha was spared the worst of the cyclone, barring a tapering storm that caused subsidence in parts of the state along with power supply and telecom disruptions. In AP, the damage was widespread, with the fury of the cyclone throwing power supply and communication networks haywire and flattening crops spread across thousands of acres. A 37-year-old woman identified as D Bhavani was killed in Vizag when the wall of her house collapsed during the cyclone.

---||Delhi||Travelling from & to Ggn no less than a nightmare||New Delhi: Multi-layered barricades and heavy police scrutiny at the Rajokri border between Delhi and Haryana in view of the Bharat bandh called by protesting farmers hit traffic movement on Monday. Motors going to Gurgaon from Delhi and those coming to the capital from Haryana were caught in an interminable line of vehicles at the border point.The Rajokri border was a scene of utter chaos between 7am and 10am according to eyewitnesses. “There were several police pickets near the border areas and every vehicle wanting to cross the border was thoroughly checked, delaying movement and causing big snarls,” said one motorist.Barring two lanes of the highway, all other lanes were closed, causing a traffic gridlock stretching to over 400 metres, forcing commuters to idle for around half an hour before being able to traverse the stretch.The vehicles going towards Rewari were diverted from Panchagon (Manesar), Bilaspur and the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal on the Haryana side. “The protesting farmers had gathered at Jaisinghpur service lane between 9.30am and 10.30am,” said Ravinder Singh Tomar, DCP (traffic), Gurgaon. “We were forced then to divert vehicles from Taudu Road and Kundli-Manesar Palwal expressway to avoid inconvenience to the commuters.”With the congestion coinciding with the office travel hours, the commuters had a harrowing time. B Mohanty, a toll employee, said. “Commuters and travellers headed to the airport were struck and sought our help. We created a small passage for them, but that was the best we could do.” Toll employees also ensured a similar passage for two ambulances. Arun Rao, who was going from Gurgaon to Delhi, grumbled, “I got stuck near the Ambience mall, the traffic was moving very slow. It took me over 40 minutes to cross that stretch. The police were creating a lot of chaos by randomly checking vehicles,” said Arun Rao who was commuting from Gurgaon to Delhi.Haryana Police personnel claimed success in preventing farmers from reaching the Rajokri border. “Our teams were deployed from 7am to manage the snarls. Senior Delhi and Haryana government officials were also engaged in coordinating efforts,” a police officer said. The pickets were removed after three hours. “Once the barricades were taken away around 10am, traffic began to flow more smoothly,” said a commuter. A Delhi Police officer said the barricades were removed given the logjam on both sides of the border. Sources confirmed that senior officers of the police forces of the two states conferred before the barricades were removed.The heavy deployment of police at the border was in view of the Bharat bandh call given for Monday by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which has been protesting against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/travelling-from-to-ggn-no-less-than-a-nightmare/articleshow/86565965.cms||---

Taking note of the stand, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh directed the government to treat as representation a plea seeking to open the newly constructed night shelters along with repairs of two damaged ones for public use. The high court was hearing a petition filed by social activist Sunil Kumar Aledia, seeking directions to ensure that the night shelters at Kashmere Gate, which are ready for the past more than eight months, must be made functional. “It is a common sight in Kashmere gate (Jawahar Shramik Sthal) area to see people sleeping in the open beside the road and on the pavements... For the past eight months, a new night shelter structure is ready and locked and is not being opened while the homeless population is drenching itself in the rain. The gates of the same are being kept locked for a ribbon to be tied and for scissors to arrive,” the petition read. The plea urged the court to ensure that the two damaged night shelters in the area are also reconstructed.

---||Lucknow||Covid-19: Lucknow leaps forward with 1.9 lakh jabs feat||LUCKNOW: The fight against Covid-19 pandemic got a shot in the arm on Monday when nearly 1.9 lakh people in the state capital took the jab against the disease, setting a record of single-day highest inoculation since the start of the mass immunisation campaign in January this year. Another highlight of the mega drive was that over 1.3 lakh doses were administered in the rural areas, which so far was lagging in vaccinations. More than 60,000 people took the shot in the urban areas. Overall, 1.3 lakh people took the first dose and the remaining the second. This was the second occasion when the number of vaccinations crossed one lakh mark in Lucknow. On September 6, about 1.04 lakh people were inoculated in a single day. The milestone was achieved because vaccination camps were nearly doubled to 432, including 210 in the rural blocks. Nearly 50% of the total camps were made at workplaces, residential areas, schools, community centres, panchayat bhawans, chaupal and places of worship. Altogether, 991 vaccination booths, with two vaccinators each, were set up in these camps. Besides, 23 mobile vaccination vans were run to cater to the remote areas. Long queues were seen outside vaccination centres since morning. The exercise continued till late night as all the people who had reported at a centre by 5 pm were jabbed. Though no case of vaccine adverse impact was reported till the evening, TOI reality check found lack of Covid safety protocols at many places — overcrowding with no social distancing and people without masks. Post vaccination observation rooms were also absent at several places. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said “The number of vaccinations in Lucknow was highest in the state. About 48% of the beneficiaries were the people in the 18-44 age group followed by 34% in the 45-59 years category and 18% elderly.” He also added that Lucknow is ahead of other districts in overall vaccinations so far with 10.9 lakh people out of 36 lakh adult population being fully vaccinated with two doses and 15.3 lakh partially vaccinated with a shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-leaps-forward-with-1-9l-jabs-feat/articleshow/86570247.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Approximately 15,000 passengers were affected due to the agitation. Officials claimed that services would resume on Tuesday according to timetable. Rail traffic on Rewari-Bhiwani, Bhiwani-Rohtak, Bhiwani-Hisar and Hanumangarh-Sadulpur-Sriganganagar-Fatuhi rail sections was affected. According to Lieutenant Shashi Kiran, chief public relations officer of NWR, “As the agitation continued till 6pm, we had to cancel trains and approximately 2,000 passengers have already been refunded for their tickets.” No damage to public property on NWR routes was reported. Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding the repeal of the three farm laws that they fear would do away with the Minimum Support Price system. The government, however, has been projecting the three laws as major agricultural reforms. Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock. Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions spearheading the farmers’ agitation, had earlier appealed to the people to join the bandh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nwr-cancels-22-trains-due-to-agitation/articleshow/86568483.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Adverse weather affects turtle site at Galgibaga beach||POINGUINIM: Devastation of Galgibaga beach induced by the impact of climate change has partially affected the nesting site for Olive Ridley turtles there. Environmentalists are now hoping that the October beach rejuvenation may accrete sand for the flippered visitors’ nests. Cyclonic storms Vayu in 2019 and Tauktae in mid-May this year had flattened the beach — the turtle nesting site here is Canacona taluka’s second after Agonda — and opened a direct access to Galgibaga river. Several trees and vegetation that lined the nesting site’s southern tip were uprooted. Olive Ridley turtles usually visit the sandier stretches for laying eggs towards the northern side. “Trees in large numbers have been uprooted and the edges of the sand dune in which turtles nest have been badly damaged,” said F M Nadaf, senior geographer and environmentalist explaining the extent of erosion to the turtle nesting site. “We must have a plan in place to minimise the effect of climate change on the turtles.” The turtles are likely to have problems negotiating eroded beaches. Earlier, higher incidence of egg-laying activity was reported at Galgibaga, but in recent years, more nests are being recorded at Agonda to its north. Speaking to TOI, deputy conservator of forests (wildlife south) Prem Kumar said the sand that washed away after the cyclone damage will be retrieved gradually. “It will not have much effect on the nesting of turtles. We also started rehabilitation of the area by planting trees which will hold the sand firm,” he said. The sand dunes are likely to be rehabilitated in time for turtle egg preservation. Sarita Fernandes of Morjim Turtle Trust expressed doubts whether the restoration will be significant enough. The gradual shift of turtles to the other beach is very much possible, she said. Some have noticed the rearrangement of sand in the area – a change that holds hope. One local, Sameer Bhandari, said, “The sand is gradually filling up in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adverse-weather-affects-turtle-site-at-galgibaga/articleshow/86568495.cms||---

A committee of experts led by University of Mysore (UoM) vice-chancellor G Hemantha Kumar has recommended to the government that a varsity be set up in the border district, one that focusses extensively on tribal affairs.The state higher education department constituted the four-member expert committee, which was tasked with looking into the possibility of turning the Dr BR Ambedkar Postgraduate Centre in Chamarajanar, an institution affiliated to UoM, into a full-fledged university. The postgraduate centre was set up in 2010, when VG Talwar was the Mysuru university’s VC. The centre, initially named Satellite Postgraduate Centre, was renamed in 2015.The centre started with just three courses, and is now offering 10 programmes, with more than 800 students enrolled there. The convener of the expert committee was executive director of the State Higher Education Council Gopalakrishna Joshi.“Our report is ready, and we will submit it to the government on Tuesday,” Kumar told TOI. Members of the committee visited the postgraduate centre, and interacted with the officials of the district administration about starting the new varsity.Sources said that, while the experts’ committee had initially proposed the setting of a comprehensive institute of education, it later decided to recommend that the varsity, once set up, focus on tribal affairs, given the population of indigenous people in the border district. “The proposal is to set up the varsity, along the lines of the tribal university in Jharkhand,” said a source, adding that the district administration had assured them of allocating 100 acres for the varsity near Chamarajanagar city.The UoM VC said that they had intended to submit the report on Monday to the higher education minister, who was scheduled to be in Mysuru. “Since his visit was cancelled, we decided to submit the report on Tuesday,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/new-varsity-focussing-specially-on-tribal-affairs-proposed-in-cnagar/articleshow/86563821.cms||---

The candidates also complained that a fee of Rs 700 was deducted from their account, but the admission portal kept on popping the option to pay fees and then proceed. “On Sunday the portal was totally unresponsive and on Monday it finally opened but soon after I filled in the name and bank details, I received a one-time password to pay the fees and after entering the OTP the amount of Rs 700 was deducted, but the portal hanged. When I logged in I was asked to pay the fees again,” said a BA candidate Astha Singh. “When in the first attempt my fee was not submitted at the portal I tried again and the amount of Rs 700 was deducted two times, but the status of my fee payment remained unpaid,” said another candidate Aditya.

---||Mangaluru||Bharat bandh evokes poor response in DK, Udupi||Mangaluru: Though many opposition parties and organisations had urged people to make the Bharat Bandh a success, normal life in Dakshina Kannada was unaffected with all shops, restaurants, offices, banks, educational institutions functioning normally on Monday. All buses as well as auto rickshaws and taxis operated across the district normally. However, protests were held at a few places and a highway was blocked at BC Road. Various organisations representing farmers, labourers and other like-minded forums blocked the national highway on Mangaluru – Bengaluru stretch at 10am. Former minister and Congress leader B Ramanath Rai, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha secretary Ravikiran Punacha and DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla took part in the protest. Shramika Sangha, a forum of coolie workers in the city, held a protest at Bunder extending support to the bandh. Karnataka Hamali Karmika Federation state president and CITU state secretary K Mahanthesh said the Central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not shown concern towards the problems of farmers, who are protesting for 10 months. “The BJP government has been trying to suppress the rights of farmers and trying to derail the protests. The new farm laws will help capitalists make agriculture sector their monopoly. This will lead to a food shortage crisis in the nation. People should support the protest of the farmers considering the nation’s interest,” he said. “By consolidating various labour laws under four categories of codes, the Central government has snatched the rights and social security of the working class in India. There is a need to raise the voice against the anti-people policies of the government,” he added. Meanwhile, another protest was held near Clock Tower in the city. The Social Democratic Party of India held protests in Puttur, BC Road and Mangaluru. Poor response in Udupi The bandh evoked a poor response in Udupi district too At a protest, Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers Association district secretary Susheela Nada said anganwadi workers decided to support the bandh since the Union government is planning to dilute the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS). “The Central government wants to opt for closure of anganwadis in a phased manner. This will lead to an increase in malnutrition among children,” she said.

These witnesses, who are inmates in the same prison, are being kept under CCTV surveillance, the DG Prisons submitted in a status report filed in court, adding that similar arrangements will be made for witnesses who are presently out on bail. Justice Mukta Gupta took note of the report and said no further orders were called for on the petition by five inmates seeking directions to ensure their safety and restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to prevent them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate.’” In its status report, the prison authorities informed the court that “two CCTV cameras are installed inside their (two inmates) cell, and 24x7 footage of the cell is being closely monitored by the officials; whenever inmates are locked out from their cell, they are escorted by two Tamil Nadu special police personnel. Two cameras are installed inside the barrack and one is outside the gallery (for the third inmate).” As regards those on bail, the jail said, “Whenever they surrender, they shall be lodged after due consideration towards their safety and security, while the staff will keep a close watch on their movements.” Earlier this month, the court had transferred the investigation into Gujjar’s death to CBI while noting that he “lost his life to custodial violence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensuring-safety-of-witnesses-in-gujjar-case-dg-prisons-tells-hc/articleshow/86568541.cms||Abhinav Garg

KSRTC buses, trains, autos and transport services weren’t affected by the protest. Most shops remained open. APMC was almost shut as farmers didn’t supply any produce. In Mysuru, activists gathered near Townhall at 6.30am and took out a procession to the suburban bus stand and later to the city bus stand to stop bus movement. Hundreds of activists participated in the procession demanding the withdrawal of contentious farm laws. Police had made elaborated security arrangements and restricted vehicular movement due to the protest. All major roads connecting the city bus stand were turned in to one-ways to avoid traffic jams. Except for the shops located on either side of the Dasara procession route, a majority of shops remained open. Only a few shops were shut at the iconic Devaraja market. Vehicle movement on the Madikeri-Mysuru-Mandya-Bengaluru route was unaffected except for a brief period in the morning after a few activists blocked the road at Srirangapatna and Maddur in Mandya district. In Chamarajanagar, the bandh received a mixed response. Except in Gundlupet and Kollegal, the bandh failed to evoke any response in other towns. Raitha Sangha members took out a procession in all taluks and the district headquarters. In Kollegal and Gundlupet, many hotels and shops were closed till afternoon. The bandh didn’t affect normal life in Shivamogga and Chikkamagaluru districts. However, APMCs were closed in support of the bandh. Raitha Sangha leaders from villages in Shivamogga carried out a bike rally in the morning and Kannada organizations joined hands for a protest near KSRTC and private bus stands. Shops and commercial complexes remained open. Raitha Sangha leaders gathered at Mahaveer Circle to extend thanks to the people who supported the bandh. In Chikkamagaluru, farmers’ leaders and left party leaders took out a rally on MG and IG Roads. In Hassan, the bandh failed to evoke any response. In the morning supporters of the bandh asked hotel owners to shut down the business. Later all business activities resumed. The Mangaluru-Hassan-Bengaluru Road was open for traffic. In Mandya district too, the bandh received a poor public response. Even though the Raitha Sangha and likeminded organizations held protests from hobli level to the district level, public life was normal. Business activities were unaffected. Agitators blocked the Mysuru-Bengaluru Road in Srirangapatna and Maddur for some time as part of the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/poor-response-to-farmers-bandh-call-in-old-mysuru/articleshow/86563860.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Controversy over Narendra Giri’s successor at Prayagraj’s Baghambari math||HARIDWAR: The death of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Narendra Giri, who died in Prayagraj last week, has now thrown open the question of who will succeed him as mahant of the Baghambari math in Prayagraj. In the alleged suicide note found after Giri’s death, he has named Balbir Giri, his disciple, as his successor to the post. This is being disputed by seers belonging to the math as well as Niranjani Akhara, to which Narendra Giri belonged. “Only a ‘true Giri’ can become the chief of the Baghambari math and Balbir is still registered as ‘Balbir Puri’ in the records of Niranjani Akhara. He is a ‘karobari mahant’ of Haridwar’s Bilkeshwar temple, according to the official records of the Niranjani Akhara. As such, he cannot be appointed as mahant of Baghambari math which is traditionally headed by Girinama seers who add ‘Giri’ to their name,” said a seer. He alleged that Narendra Giri himself also did not belong to the Girinama seer sect and had “got himself anointed as Baghambari math’s mahant by changing his surname from Puri to Giri.” However, the seers who are opposing the name of Balbir Giri concede that a successor in the akhara is decided only in keeping with the will made by the predecessor. When asked to comment on the issue, Swami Ravindra Puri, Haridwar’s Mansa Devi Mandir chief and Niranjani Akhara secretary, told TOI, “Yes, the successor is appointed in keeping with the will of the predecessor. However, a supervisory committee of senior seers from the akhara guides and monitors the activities of the math chief. The due procedure will be followed in the selection of Baghambari math’s new chief.” Meanwhile, Narendra Giri’s advocate Rishi Shankar Dwivedi is expected to hand over to the CBI three wills made by the seer in 2010, 2011 and 2020 regarding his succession, a source said. In his first will, registered on January 7, 2010, Narendra Giri had named Balbir Giri as his successor. However, the will was changed in less than a year. In the second will, registered on August 29, 2011, Narendra Giri named Anand Giri as his successor while adding that Balbir Giri is only interested in travelling and takes no interest in the math’s affairs or its management. The will was changed for the third time on June 4, 2020. In the third will, Narendra Giri again named Balbir Giri as his successor while accusing Anand Giri of acting “in violation of the Sanatan Dharma.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/controversy-over-narendra-giris-successor-at-prayagrajs-baghambari-math/articleshow/86563886.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh holds reverence among most faiths: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Calling Uttar Pradesh the centre for spiritual tourism, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the state was an important centre for possibly most major religions and faiths. Speaking at the Tourism Carnival to mark World Tourism Day, the CM said that this year was even more important for the state as UP Tourism was celebrating its 50th anniversary. Glimpses of colourful performances by various artists on the opening of the three-day Tourism Carnival“When tourism facilities were developed in the world, the first ever effort must have possibly been made in the field of spiritual tourism. In this sector, UP is the world’s most endowed state as it has all major centres associated with every kind of faith,” he said. Saying that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and state had made all efforts to develop UP’s potential in spiritual, heritage and eco-tourism and present it before the world, the CM listed out the major attractions in the state which his government was promoting as centres for tourism and centres which had so far not received any attention from previous governments. “We have Lord Ram’s birth place Ayodhya, Lord Krishna’s Mathura, the oldest city in the world Kashi or the longest and purest rivers Ganga and Yamuna, at the Sangam of which Prayagraj Kumbh is held. We also have Shaktipeeth or areas associated with Buddhism,” he said. The CM spoke about the 2019 Kumbh, saying that earlier, western media had dismissed the event as a chaotic, dirty festival, marked by stampedes and unruly behaviour. He said that like attempts were made to discredit Haridwar Kumbh this year, some tried to malign Prayagraj Kumbh too but it was an international success with 24 crore devotees visiting it over 45 days. Saying that tourism development led to job generation and improving the state’s economy, the CM added that it was important to develop sites and present all activities before the world as ‘events’, the CM also pointed out that UP was the centre of the independence struggle and efforts had to be made to highlight these sites related with the events, on an international platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-holds-reverence-among-most-faiths-cm/articleshow/86570345.cms||---

The drive was taken up in Salt Lake Sector III area on Sunday. TimesViewCyclone Gulab may not have had any impact on the city. But what has happened in several pockets of Kolkata over the last one week should be a wake-up call to both civic-maintenance agencies and citizens. Only round-the-year vigil on the canal and drainage-sewerage network can save us during the monsoon. And irresponsible dumping of plastic and other materials that choke the drainage-sewerage system aggravates the situation. Hopefully, we will learn from what so many thousands of us had to go through.Salt Lake alone has a drainage network of about 180 km across the three sectors. BMC authorities said that a survey would be conducted to demarcate places in the township that witnessed maximum waterlogging to evaluate the existing drainage system. “We would conduct a survey of the most affected areas and prepare a plan for revamping the drainage system. We are urging people not to throw out waste on the roadside which will lead to clogging of drains,” said BMC board of administrators (BOA) chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. The civic authorities had earlier prepared a Rs 200 crore scheme for revamping the drainage and sewer system of Rajarhat. The New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has been cleaning the drainage lines across New Town, which witnessed heavy waterlogging last week.

Additional sessions judge Shivaji Anand has put up the matter for further hearing on September 28. Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar is also an accused in the case. The plea, filed through advocate Pradeep Rana, said that Dahiya is pursuing bachelor of physical education and his fourth semester examinations are scheduled from September 28 to October 6. “The applicant/accused has to appear in five exams and he needs time to study and prepare for the same as his future is at stake…,” the plea said. It claimed that there is no apprehension of Dahiya tampering with the evidence in the matter if released on interim bail. The court had, on September 1, dismissed his interim bail plea, which Dahiya moved on the ground that he had to appear in his third semester exams. However, the court had allowed him to appear for his exams online.

The incident happened at around 11.30am, according to Sarkhej police. The victim was later identified as Shanti Parmar, a resident of Gayatrinagar in Sarkhej. Times ViewSecuring an under-construction site is a prerequisite in any civic project. Dewatering pumps, necessary barricading, and warning boards have been mandated by the high court at all civic construction sites since 2012. The authorities concerned should have ensured that the site was secured. To prevent such tragedies in the future, safety audits should be made compulsory at all construction sites within municipal corporation limits. Moreover, accountability must be fixed for any lapse.The underpass is being built by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL). The fire department rescue team that visited the site claimed that the site did not have a dewatering pump. “There was no barricading around the under-construction railway underpass. Such sites should have warning boards,” said a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official. Narrating the sequence of events, eyewitnesses said Parmar cried for help and locals immediately called for the fire department. Help arrived in 20 minutes, but by then Parmar had drowned. One eyewitnesses, Bhavesh Thakor, had seen Parmar wade through knee deep water trying to cross the underpass. A few locals had warned Parmar to be careful. “He continued into the flooded underpass thinking he would make it through,” says Thakor. Parmar was taken to Sola Civil Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Manoj Goyal, the Bhavnagar divisional railway manager, said that the construction is being carried out by the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-drowns-in-flooded-sarkhej-underpass/articleshow/86566226.cms||---
