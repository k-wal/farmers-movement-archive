Prime Minister Khan during recent interviews to the American media has complained that a "busy" President Biden has not bothered to speak to him though Washington was seeking Pakistan's support in stabilising Afghanistan. Replying to a question during the daily briefing on Monday on whether there could be a call from Biden to Khan at some point soon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, "I don't have anything to predict at this point in time. If they do a call, we will of course read it out to all of you." The media, during the briefing, highlighted that as President Biden was meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, Khan took to the stage at the UN and delivered some "scathing criticism of the US" actions in Afghanistan and he lamented the lack of direct engagement between himself and President Biden. Responding to this, Psaki said that the US has been in touch at very high levels with leaders in Pakistan from the state department, from the department of defence, and from other key components of the Biden administration. "The President has not spoken with every foreign leader at this point in time; that is absolutely true. But he, of course, has a team — an expert team deployed to do exactly that," she said. Psaki said that the US and Pakistan were continuing to "work together and work on initiatives where we can, make clear where we have concern, but I wouldn't overread into a leader-to-leader call in that particular regard. "We have high-level engagement from the state department, defence department, and others at this point." On Monday, the state department announced that deputy secretary of state Wendy R Sherman will travel to Pakistan next month after her trip to India. Prime Minister Khan, while delivering his UNGA address on Friday, said that Pakistan has been blamed for the turn of events in Afghanistan, by politicians in the United States and some politicians in Europe. "I want them all to know, the country that suffered the most, apart from Afghanistan, was Pakistan, when we joined the US War on Terror after 9/11," he said. "Unfortunately, in trying to force a military solution is where the US went wrong," he said during his address. Khan had in the past expressed his disappointment over the US President's reluctance to talk to him since he came to office in January this year. "He is a busy man", Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had said curtly about President Biden on September 15. Khan admitted that he had not spoken to Biden since the collapse of the Afghan government. When asked why Biden hadn't called him since coming into office in January, Khan curtly said: "He is a busy man" and later said Biden should be asked "why he is too busy to call". During an interaction with foreign journalists at his residence in August, he had said that he was not really "waiting" for a phone call from Biden. "I keep hearing that President Biden hasn't called me. It's his business. It's not like I am waiting for any phone call," he had said in response to a question. Khan, who had congratulated President Biden on his inauguration and expressed his desire to work with the new American administration to deepen bilateral ties, had said that Washington sees Pakistan as "useful" only for clearing the "mess" it has left behind in Afghanistan after 20 years of fighting and prefers India when it comes to forming a “strategic partnership”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cant-predict-when-president-biden-will-call-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-white-house/articleshow/86591568.cms||---

---||India||Seven infiltrators from Pak killed, one caught alive in last 10 days: Army||SRINAGAR: In the past 10 days, seven infiltrators from Pakistan were killed in separate anti-terror operations along the Line of Control (LoC) while one Lashkar-e-Taiba operative was caught alive in J&K’s Uri sector, GOC 19 Infantry Division Maj Gen Virendra Vats said on Tuesday, adding that Pakistan was itching to carry out a sensational terror strike in Kashmir. Kashmir Valley is returning to peace, much to the discomfort of Pakistan and its proxies, the GOC said while addressing a press conference. There is a lot of movement on the militant launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) close to the LoC. The infiltration bids indicate Pakistan’s desperate attempts to sustain cross-border terrorism and bring in weapons to orchestrate violent attacks in the Valley. “On the night of September 18, our patrolling party along the LoC detected an infiltration movement, which led to a firefight. We soon learnt that the infiltration group consisted of six members,” Maj Gen Vats said. When the encounter started, two of the infiltrators had already crossed over into Indian territory while their four accomplices were on the other side of the fence. “The four took advantage of the darkness and dense foliage, and retreated towards Pakistan,” he added. “Meanwhile, additional forces were mobilised to cordon the two terrorists who had already sneaked in. As this is a heavily populated area, the security personnel had to exercise extreme caution to avoid collateral damage,” GOC Vats said. Multiple patrols were launched in the suspected areas and the getaway routes were blocked. Once the cordon was stepped up, the terrorist duo tried to escape on numerous occasions which led to intermittent gunfights. “On the evening of September 25, our troops eventually zeroed in on the two terrorists, who were holed up in a nallah. After an intense fire exchange, one of them, identified as Atiq ur Rehman alias Qari Anas (33), was killed,” said Maj Gen Vats. “The surviving terrorist, identified as Ali Babar Patra (19) of LeT, pleaded for mercy and was taken into custody, in line with the ethos and value system of the Army, which doesn’t use force against an unarmed person,” the GOC said. In another anti-terror operation on September 18, three terrorists were killed in the neighbouring area along the LoC, a defence spokesperson said, adding that the recovery in both operations included “seven AK-series rifles, nine pistols and revolvers, and 80 grenades of various kinds along with Indian and Pakistan currencies.” “During interrogation, Patra, a native of Okara district in Pakistan’s Punjab province, revealed that he was from a poor family. After losing his father early, he was lured into militancy by LeT and trained for three weeks at the outfit’s Khyber camp in Muzaffarabad in 2019. After training, he was sent home and summoned again for an ‘important task’ this year for which he underwent refresher training,” the GOC said. “Patra’s family in Dipalpur consists of his widowed mother and an adopted sister. They are hardly able to make ends meet. Patra dropped out of school after class 7 due to poverty. He has given us his mother’s contact number and said he wants to see his family,” Maj Gen Vats added. Patra confessed that his handlers had tasked him with dropping a supply in Pattan area in J&K’s Baramulla district besides motivating Kashmiri youth to pick up arms. Pakistani authorities had also given him Rs 20,000 for his mother’s treatment and had promised another Rs 30,000 after his return. The handlers remained in touch with the group using a device through which they would send voice messages directly and assign them responsibilities. “Looking at the recovery and modus operandi, it seems this group of infiltrators came for a terror strike and not just for dropping supplies,” the GOC said. “The route of infiltration was from Sawai Nala terrorist camp to Hallan Shumali launch pad to Jabri, leading into Salamabad nallah, through which the perpetrators of the 2016 suicide attack on the Uri Garrison had sneaked in,” he added. “This infiltration group was supported from the Pakistani side by three porters who had come till the LoC along with supplies,” the defence spokesperson said, adding: “The Pakistan post opposite this area is the Jabbri post and the movement of such a large group of people cannot take place without active complicity of Pakistan army.” The fake narratives of ‘Islam being in danger’ and perceived killing — including the atrocities being committed against the Muslims in Kashmir — was the main theme of indoctrination during the training, the spokesperson said, adding that the teen terrorist’s appeal for surrender upon the death of his accomplice highlights that he was not convinced about the Jihad narrative. Pakistan army’s connivance in abetting infiltration continues, as it is difficult to attempt crossing the LoC without the active support of local Pakistani military commanders. As per the surrendered Pakistan national, the group of six terrorists crossed the LoC fence in the shadow of the Pakistani forward post Jabri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seven-infiltrators-from-pak-killed-one-caught-alive-in-last-10-days-army/articleshow/86591836.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Gulzar Inder Singh Chahal, who was made PCC treasurer soon after Sidhu took over, also put in his papers along with general secretary Yoginder Dhingra. “The collapse of man’s character stems from the compromise corner. I can never compromise on Punjab’s future and the agenda for the welfare of Punjab. Therefore, I hereby resign as president of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. Will continue to serve the Congress,” Sidhu said in his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, shortly after allocation of portfolios to new CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s cabinet. Minister Razia Sultana, who had been allocated the water supply and sanitation, social security, women and child development portfolios, said in her resignation that she would “continue to work for the party as a worker in the best interest of Punjab”. Her husband Mohammad Mustafa, a retired IPS officer, had been appointed principal strategic adviser by Sidhu soon after taking over as the PCC chief. Read Also'Can't compromise on welfare of Punjab': Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as state Congress chiefNavjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday announced his resignation as Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president. The cricketer-turned-politician made the announcement on Twitter. The leader said that he has quit from the post as he "can never compromise on Punjab's future" in his letter addressed to“Certain decisions were taken which were not liked by the PPCC president (Sidhu)… I did not know about his decision, but such a situation was emerging,” Mustafa said before meeting Sidhu later in the day. By evening, there was apprehension that more Sidhu loyalists, including hockey Olympian-turned-minister Pargat Singh and working president Kuljit Singh Nagra would put in their papers. Pargat visited Sidhu at his home in Patiala, but denied he had at any time indicated he would quit. Sources said Sidhu, who took over as state Congress chief in July, was miffed at not having a say in some key decisions taken over the last few days such as the inclusion of former minister Rana Gurjit Singh in the reconstituted cabinet, the appointment of APS Deol as the new advocate general, the choice of IPS Sahota as the acting DGP, and the allocation of the home portfolio to deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. CM Channi, who was scheduled to address the media on the farmers’ agitation, said he was unaware of Sidhu’s resignation. “Let me speak to him. I don’t know yet. He is a good leader, our president. He did not speak to me... But we will settle it.” Sources said the Congress central leadership was keen to put Sidhu in check after resentment within the party over the PCC chief getting the chairman of the Amritsar Improvement Trust replaced immediately after the change of guard in Punjab. The central leadership also wanted to be sure that Sidhu allowed CM Channi to work independently. It was for these reasons that many of Channi’s preferences prevailed, which ultimately seem to have provoked Sidhu, party insiders said. After Captain Amarinder Singh stepped down as CM on September 18, the party had struggled to pick his successor, then the ministers, and finally their portfolios. With Sidhu precipitating a new crisis ahead of assembly polls in early 2022, there is now a question mark on his role in the party. He had earlier preferred to lie low after quitting Amarinder’s cabinet in 2019, when his portfolio was changed. Sidhu returned to the centrestage last year with a group of MLAs rallying behind him to demand that the party must fulfil its pending promises on priority. It was their relentless campaign that led to Amarinder’s ouster earlier this month. However, the dissidents’ victory only served to highlight the differences between the leaders, who had rallied together to remove Amarinder. “Sidhu does not want to compromise on corruption. Who will defend these acts of the government done in the last five days? It is no less than corruption,” one of his confidants said. Sidhu and his loyalists have made it clear that they are staying with Congress for now, although there are a few possibilities beyond that. First, with Amarinder telling reporters that the leadership should accept Sidhu’s resignation, there were rumours that he could meet Sonia on Wednesday. This could not be confirmed independently. Congress, on the face of it, is giving the impression that it is letting the state unit resolve the issue at its end. However, AICC general secretary Harish Rawat and some senior leaders are said to be at work to persuade Sidhu. If Sidhu agrees to talk, Congress would be tested about the possible resolution. A compromise by changing the appointments may placate Sidhu but would compromise the position of Channi. If Sidhu decides to step out of Congress, the party risks losing ministers and MLAs who may go with him, which may shift the focus completely from the new chief minister. Congress had planned to use the change to win over voters. This might mean a prolonged crisis. Amid the anxiousness in the Channi government over Sidhu’s resignation, the council of ministers will hold a meeting on Wednesday morning. The agenda for the meeting will be circulated on the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/switch-hit-sidhu-quits-as-pcc-chief-minister-follows/articleshow/86592369.cms||---

BJP sources hinted at a “strong possibility” of the veteran leader, who fell out in a dramatic fashion with the Congress leadership, being inducted into the party. The possibility was seen by BJP leaders as a big boost to their prospects in the border state ahead of elections due in February. Read AlsoGandhi siblings left red-faced amid efforts to rejig CongressAfter the central leadership completely owned the Punjab restructuring and felt it had settled the chaotic unit, the surprise resignation by state president Navjot Singh Sidhu caught everyone by surprise and threatened to destabilise its stronghold and cast the Gandhi leadership in poor light.“Something is cooking... things will be clear soon,” said a senior BJP functionary making it clear that the party is in touch with the former CM. There have been previous occasions when Singh was reported to be in touch with BJP, particularly prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, but the moves did not fructify, in part due to BJP’s alliance with the Akalis which is now over. As soon as Singh left Chandigarh for Delhi, speculation about a meeting with home minister Amit shah and BJP president JP Nadda began to do the rounds. He had also told reporters in Chandigarh that he was going to meet Shah, which was later dubbed as a meeting on the Covid situation in Punjab. There was no confirmation of a meeting till late Tuesday; sources said it could take place on Wednesday.

He’s on a personal visit, during which he’ll meet some friends and also vacate Kapurthala house for the new CM. No need for any unnecessary speculation,” he said.Asked about his next course of action, Thukral said that will be per wishes of his supporters and followers and “all options are open”.

There will be the issue of his strong opposition to the new farm laws, but BJP functionaries felt a suitable formulation could be found. Singh, on his part, could get a party apparatus and resources for the election. In fact they said, if he had recommended dissolution of the Punjab assembly, the partnership would have happened sooner. Singh recently resigned with less than five months to go for the assembly election after a bitter squabble with his bete noir Navjot Singh Sidhu — who, ironically enough, quit as Punjab party chief on Tuesday — accused the Congress leadership of “humiliating” him and said the Gandhi siblings lacked political experience.

It will also come as a boost to BJP in Punjab where it is left with no ally after Akali Dal walked away over the three farm laws and its vote is essentially restricted to the urban Hindu population. Besides, it will help in a perception buildup in its favour nationally with a senior leader joining them from a state, which has become hub of the anti-farm law agitation.

---||Mumbai||Despite fewer venues, Mumbai witnesses an encouraging turnout for live comedy shows||Comics are glad to leave their live streaming days behind and talk about what it’s like performing to a masked audience in the new normalUnlike most other art forms that can be performed sans live spectators, the art of stand-up comedy is heavily dependent on constant audience feedback. Stand-up comedians constantly gauge audience reactions and use the physical setting of a stage to enhance their craft further. When the pandemic struck last year, most of them switched to online mediums, putting a stop to live shows for an indefinite period. Stand-up comedian Jeeveshu Ahluwalia says, “We had to switch to a medium, which was largely online. It made us realise how each comic has a different style of performing and how we had little choice, but to switch to a virtual format that is by and large a laptop screen. So, with considerable adjustments at our end and encouragement from the audience, we went online. It wasn’t that bad.” But after over a year of online shows, stand-up comics in Mumbai are finally heaving a sigh of relief. With things inching towards normalcy, live comedy shows are back in business although on a smaller scale. However, with theatres and auditoriums all set to re-open on October 22, the number of shows is expected to go up in the days ahead. Mumbaikars are keen to attend comedy showsWith cinemas and drama theatres all set to open next month, stand-up comedians, too, are eager be a part of more shows. Talking about the present scenario, Atul Khatri says, “Most comedians live in Mumbai and many places are yet to open up fully. There are just a few comedy clubs that have opened with 50 per cent capacity. So, there are hardly 20-30 people in one show. Also, Mumbai has multiple curbs imposed, such as the 10 pm deadline for restaurants.” Speaking about the importance of a live audience Jeeveshu opines, “The response for a live audience with real-time feedback is something that can’t be compared with any other medium. Stand-up comics feed off the audience’s energy and improvise accordingly.” Talking about his experience at a live show that he did recently, Jeeveshu adds, “The response in Mumbai was very encouraging — it was a sold-out show. The audience also seemed to be happy to watch a live stand-up comedy show after ages.” Stand-up comic Shashwat Maheshwari says that it is evident that Mumbaikars are open to attending comedy shows again. He says, “People were waiting for things to start again. Even the comedians were raring to go. The first few shows that took place in the city sold out very quickly.” SOPs are being adhered to strictlyStand-up comic Nitinn R Miranni had launched a new character called Uncle Manmaani online and he is continuing it for his live shows as well. He says, “In the last one month, I have done shows at venues in Mumbai and Delhi. Adequate social distancing is maintained and only at 50 per cent occupancy is allowed. Everyone is wearing masks at all times. At my shows, even meet-and-greet sessions after the shows are restricted, so you don’t see after-the-show selfies these days (smiles). I recently did a corporate show, too, in Delhi.” Apart from following all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), stand-up comics are also taking as many precautions as they can. Nitinn says, “I have purchased my own mic. I insist on always having two mics at the venue to be on the safe side. Everything is thoroughly sanitised as well.” ‘Government is being cautious in Mumbai, rightfully so’Only a handful of places in Mumbai are currently open to comic acts at the moment, so the number of performances are limited. “As long as COVID cases keep decreasing, people will gain more confidence, and with proper precautions in place, they will resume going to comedy clubs. The government is rightfully being cautious in Mumbai given the threat of the possible third wave,” says Atul. Virtual shows may be popular, but live shows are the real dealFor now, Shashwat is happy doing virtual comedy shows online. He says, “I took a long time to do my first virtual show. It wasn’t as bad as I expected and I actually ended up having fun. It’s also easier for the audience as they can catch any comic they want irrespective of what city they are in. But honestly, I’m doing this for myself. I have way more fun performing for a live audience at a venue. That’s the real deal.” Not everyone has been getting to do live shows yet, so, most comics have utilised this time creatively. Shashwat says, “I’ve been trying to write more. If you’ve got that discipline even when you’re not performing, it’s a great thing. I don’t have that discipline, but I’ll get there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/despite-fewer-venues-mumbai-witnesses-an-encouraging-turnout-for-live-comedy-shows/articleshow/86591350.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||India||Only 1 in 11 gets Covaxin as Bharat Biotech falls short of production targets||MUMBAI: Homegrown Covaxin was to play a major role in vaccination against Covid-19. But eight months after the vaccination drive began, only one in 11 Indians has managed to get the first indigenous vaccine. Bharat Biotech, which manufactures it, has failed to ramp up production at the pace it had envisaged. Stymied by shortages of drug substance and filling capacity, the Hyderabad-based company has repeatedly fallen short of the target it had set for itself. In between, it also saw a batch of its vaccine face quality issues. Its CMD Krishna Ella recently said the company would supply 5.5 crore doses from October, from the existing 3.5 crore doses-- substantially lower than the initially-expected 10 crore. Coronavirus live updatesIn May, in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, the Centre had projected that 55 crore doses of Covaxin -- or an average of 10 crore monthly doses, would be available during August-December. A month later, this was slashed by 20% to eight crore. However, the monthly capacity for August and September is far lower. This puts a question mark on the company's ability to boost production and supply the numbers as per its commitment. Interestingly, there has been a huge mismatch in the capacity projected both by the company and government, and what has been supplied so far. Read AlsoCovaxin kids trial over, Bharat Biotech to submit data to DCGI next weekHYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech, the developer of indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, has completed the Phase II/III trials on children in the 2-18 years age group and is all set to submit the data to the drug regulator, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), soon, the company’s chairman &amp;Queries sent by TOI to the company on September 24 seeking details of its capacity remained unanswered. Concerns around the supply of Covaxin have persisted over the last few months, with Serum Institute-manufactured Covishield accounting for over 90% of all vaccines administered. About one crore daily doses are required to vaccinate the entire 94 crore eligible population by December 31. Over the last few months, there has been no clarity on its output, with different figures being cited by the company and Centre on multiple occasions. For instance, in May the Centre’s affidavit in the Supreme Court said, “Bharat Biotech has increased production from 90 lakh a month to 2 crore doses a month and further increase is expected up to 5.5 crore doses a month by July 2021.” In May again, the Department of Biotechnology said the existing capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin will be doubled by May-June and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by August. It was to be increased from one crore doses in April to six to seven crore doses in July and reach nearly 10 crore a month by September this year. Then, in July, the government put out three different sets of numbers in the Rajya Sabha: one crore, 1.75 crore and 2.5 crore as the company’s monthly output. And, in August, the government said the monthly production capacity of Covaxin is projected to be increased to around 5.8 crore by December from 2.5 crore doses. With the onset of the deadly second wave in March, capacity issues by both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech led to massive stockouts across the country. The government-initiated efforts to boost Covaxin production-- much later --by roping in Indian Immunologicals, Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals, which will take time to ramp up. The vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, was approved by India’s drug regulator on January 3. Facing flak over the slow pace of scaling up earlier, the company said the timeline for manufacturing, testing and release for a batch is approximately 120 days. But even nine months later, Bharat Biotech is refusing to address questions over how it has repeatedly failed to fall short of target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/month-after-month-covaxin-missing-production-target/articleshow/86592549.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||World||Canada's Justin Trudeau says cabinet coming next month; finance minister to stay||OTTAWA: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday he will swear in his new cabinet next month, with Chrystia Freeland returning as his finance minister and deputy, after his Liberals were re-elected for the third time. Trudeau, speaking with reporters in Ottawa at his first full news conference since the September 20 election, also said lawmakers would be back in parliament this fall - without giving a date - and that putting previously announced vaccine mandates in place would be a priority. "I have asked Chrystia Freeland to continue serving as deputy Prime Minister and our minister of finance, and she has accepted," he said. "We will be swearing in the cabinet in the month of October and we will be bringing back the House of Commons before the end of fall," he added. Trudeau's Liberals were returned to power in a closely contested election, but fell short of winning a majority. That means they will continue to need the support of at least one opposition party to pass legislation. Despite that challenge, Trudeau said he hoped his new government would last the full four years, and that he was ready to work in partnership with other parties on the major issues. One of the first will be a promise the Liberals made to require vaccination for federal workers and for most domestic air and train travelers. Canada continues to battle a Delta-driven fourth wave of coronavirus infections. "Immediately we will deal with the mandate for federal employees who will have to get vaccinated, and there will be announcements about that in the coming days," Trudeau said, without saying whether workers who refuse will be fired. While Trudeau did not a give a date for swearing in his new cabinet, he said there would be gender parity. Three of his female cabinet ministers lost their seats in the election and one did not run. "I will be seeking, as I always do, to ensure that there is a proper regional distribution, that there is a range of skills and diversity around the table," Trudeau said. The only certain return to the cabinet at this point is Freeland, Trudeau's deputy and closest minister, seen by many as his mostly likely successor. Canada's first female finance minister, Freeland, 53, is an advocate for women's employment and childcare. The Liberals won 159 seats in the election, short of the 170 needed for a majority but two more than in 2019, though one lawmakers elected as a Liberal will sit as an independent.

The allocation, which Congress sources said was vetted by Rahul Gandhi, saw the seven new faces in the reconstituted cabinet being given charge of key departments. Amid persistent demands by party MLAs and AAP to cancel the allegedly one-sided power-purchase agreements signed by the erstwhile SAD-BJP government, Channi’s decision to oversee the power department himself is being seen as a decisive move. On the other hand, the mining and geology department is also riddled with allegations of the Congress government giving a free hand to the mining mafia in the last four-and-a-half years. Deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa got the home portfolio in the wake of his stringent criticism of former CM Amarinder Singh (who had managed the department before him) for his handling of the sacrilege cases and the October 2015 police firing at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan. Besides home, Randhawa retained charge of the cooperation and prisons departments. Om Parkash Soni, the other deputy CM, will oversee the health and family welfare department apart from welfare of defence services and freedom fighters. Among the new inductees, Randeep Singh Nabha, who was dramatically included in the shortlist hours before the swearing-in on Sunday, got agriculture, farmers’ welfare and food processing. Manpreet Singh Badal, who is considered close to Channi, retained finance, planning and programme implementation. Most of the eight ministers of the Amarinder cabinet, other than the CM and his deputies, will continue to manage their old departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-cm-charanjit-singh-channi-hands-out-portfolios-keeps-14-depts-with-himself/articleshow/86592729.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The General Intelligence Agency said in a statement the suspected militants opened fire on forces who raided their hideout in the Gabra neighborhood in southern Khartoum. It said five were killed and an officer was also wounded in the raid. The GIA said forces arrested 11 suspected militants and were chasing four others who managed to flee during the shootout. The statement said the suspects were foreigners but did not reveal their nationalities or further details. Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok mourned the deaths of the five officers. Tuesday's violence came a week after authorities said they foiled a coup attempt that has since increased tensions between the generals and civilians in the transitional government. The developments underscore the fragility of Sudan's path to democracy, more than two years after the military's overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir amid a public uprising against his three-decade rule. Militant attacks were rare in Sudan, a country that hosted Osama bin Laden in the early years of his jihadi movement that led to the creation of al-Qaida. The East African nation was on the US list of countries backing terrorism until December. In March last year, Hamdok said he survived a "terror attack" after an explosion and gunfire targeted his motorcade in Khartoum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/5-intelligence-officers-killed-in-shootout-with-militants-in-sudan/articleshow/86592762.cms||---

The case relates to Sebi rule violations by these entities between April and September 2017. Interestingly, Sebi order showed that despite sending several notices, Dhoot neither replied to the notices, nor appeared before the regulator’s adjudication officer for the case. Dhoot, the main promoter of the company, was also the chairman & MD of the company. The other two entities named in the order are Videocon Realty & Infrastructures and Electroparts (India), formerly Shree Dhoot Trading & Agencies. “Noticees being insiders had executed off market transactions while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI),” Sebi noted in the order. During the period of investigation by Sebi, Dena Bank, one of the lenders to Videocon, had classified its loans to the company as a non-performing asset (NPA), which in turn was expected to have a negative impact on Videocon’s stock price. Hence this was considered an UPSI. During this period, the two promoter entities had pledged their holdings in Videocon and also transferred some shares through off market deals. Dhoot, also an insider, had traded in Videocon shares, either directly or on behalf of the two companies. Each of the entities have been fined Rs 25 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-videocons-venugopal-dhoot-two-others-for-insider-trading/articleshow/86592814.cms||---

Such an alliance of farmers and scientists will strengthen the country in dealing with new challenges,” said Modi while appealing to farmers to adopt climate resilient technologies to increase their income, conserve water and save the natural ecosystem. Releasing the new crop varieties through a virtual function, attended by agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, the PM said, “More than 1,300 seed varieties have been developed over the years. In this series, the 35 new varieties are being dedicated to farmers. It’ll address the challenge of climate change and malnutrition.” The varieties, developed by various institutions of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), include eight new varieties of rice, six of wheat, three each of maize and soybean, two each of mustard, pigeon pea, pearl millet, sorghum and chickpea, among others. These special-trait crop varieties also include those that address the anti-nutritional factors found in some crops that adversely affect human and animal health. The PM in his speech also emphasised on the need to opt for both traditional farming and new agriculture practices based on use of technology. “It’s a time when we have to make a balance between ‘back to basics’ (traditional farming) and ‘march for future’ (use of new technology),” he said. He also underlined the need to go back to the practice of ‘multi-culture’ (cultivation of different crops) farming instead of simply banking on ‘monoculture’ (single crop farming). During the virtual function, Modi also inaugurated the newly-constructed campus of the National Institute of Biotic Stress Tolerance (NIBST), Raipur, distributed ‘Green Campus Award’ to four agricultural universities and interacted with five farmers who use innovative methods of farming. Referring to different biotic stress caused due to climate change, the PM said the Raipur-based NIBST would conduct research on ways to address this challenge. “We are aware of crop damage caused due to pest attacks. We had faced locust attacks last year in the midst of the pandemic. We took several steps to address the problem and saved farmers from incurring huge damage,” he said, adding that NIBST has a big responsibility in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-releases-35-new-crops-with-special-traits/articleshow/86592877.cms||---

KPCC chief K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan were supposed to reach New Delhi on Wednesday for discussions but have deferred their travel plans. The visit was postponed because Rahul Gandhi is to visit Kerala on Wednesday. Also, AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar will be away from New Delhi and will return only on October 2. Since the assembly session is beginning here on October 4, the leaders have decided to visit New Delhi only in the second week of October. The discussion was meant to finalise the new officers for the KPCC executive committee, including vice-presidents, general secretaries and secretaries. It is learnt that the group leaders have submitted a list of their nominees for several posts to the KPCC president. Sudhakaran and Satheesan have also met former CM Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala to learn their choices for these posts. There are also reports that the AICC will schedule talks with the state leadership on the present situation in Kerala. The high-command is likely to suggest remedial measures to pacify disgruntled leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-congress-leaders-defer-delhi-visit-rahul-in-state-today/articleshow/86592983.cms||---
---||World||Florida sues Biden administration over immigration policy||TALLAHASSEE: Florida filed suit against President Joe Biden's administration on Tuesday claiming his immigration policy is illegal, and Republican governor Ron DeSantis signed an order barring state agencies from assisting with the relocation of undocumented immigrants arriving in the state. DeSantis' order authorized the Florida department of law enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol "to detain any aircraft, bus, or other vehicle within the State of Florida reasonably believed to be transporting illegal aliens to Florida from the Southwest Border." He also ordered the agencies to gather information on the identities of any immigrants arriving illegally in Florida from the Mexico border and told state agencies not to spend money assisting those immigrants unless required by law. Attorney general Ashley Moody's lawsuit claims the federal immigration policy will cost the state millions of dollars and cause harm to Florida. "While some arriving migrants have legitimate asylum claims, many do not. Some are gang members and drug traffickers exploiting the crisis at the border, as evidenced by the skyrocketing amount of Fentanyl seized at the border this year", the suit says. Moody and DeSantis held a news conference in southwest Florida in which both strongly condemned Biden on immigration and praised former President Donald Trump's policies. "President Biden is aiding and abetting criminal cartels", Moody said. Asked about the lawsuit and DeSantis' order, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she hadn't seen the suit. "Any Republican or any member who wants to have a constructive conversation about solutions to addressing what we all agree is not a long-term sustainable operational or moral approach to immigration, we're happy to have that conversation", Psaki said. DeSantis, considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has been attacking Biden on immigration for months. He sent Florida law enforcement officers to Texas to help deter illegal border crossings and he and Moody later visited the border and held a news conference to talk about the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-sues-biden-administration-over-immigration-policy/articleshow/86592892.cms||---

Reason: The Congress high command in Delhi wants the old guard sidelined and rampant factionalism neutralised, and to that purpose it will be willing to put up with KPCC president K Sudhakaran’s rather brash and authoritarian style of functioning. From Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala to V M Sudheeran and Mullapally Ramachandran, a formidable lineup of disgruntled leaders have come out against Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan but the high command remains unmoved. This was the reason why even when two senior leaders like Chandy and Chennithala flayed the new leadership openly, the high command asked the state leadership to resolve their issues locally. To Chandy and Chennithala’s chagrin, no AICC emissary was despatched to patch up differences. The leaders were contacted only by AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar against whom Chandy and Ramesh have raised serious allegations that he is dancing to the tunes of Sudhakaran and Satheesan. “There is no question of change of guard in the party again. Sudhakaran is doing well by leading the party. The issues raised by senior leaders are being considered with due importance,” Anwar said. In fact, the disgruntled leaders’ main concern is their access to the high command has been severely restricted. The state leaders are unable to reach out to Rahul Gandhi who, these days, goes with whatever AICC general secretary K C Venugopal advises. Meanwhile, Sudhakaran and Satheesan, who were scheduled to reach Delhi for discussions with the high command on the appointment of new KPCC office-bearers, on Tuesday put off their trip. This was apparently Rahul Gandhi is to visit Kerala on Wednesday and Anwar will be away from Delhi and will return only on October 2. Since the assembly session is beginning here on October 4, the leaders have decided to visit New Delhi only in the second week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-to-retire-kerala-old-warhorses/articleshow/86593045.cms||Rajiv G

Amarinder, who arrived in Delhi on a personal visit, told newsmen at the airport that the Congress high command should immediately accept Sidhu’s resignation and appoint some competent man in his place. Terming Sidhu’s resignation as “sheer drama”, Amarinder said the move suggested that his former cabinet colleague was preparing the ground to quit the Congress and join hands with some other party in the run-up to the state Assembly polls. “I told you so ... he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab,” tweeted Amarinder Singh. Sidhu had also proved to be absolutely incompetent during his stint as a minister in his government, he added. “Punjab is a sensitive state, sharing over 600km border with Pakistan, and Sidhu’s close links with his cricketer friend Imran Khan and ISI chief Qamar Javed Bajwa is a serious threat to India’s national security,” the former CM said. He said that by resigning within two months of taking over as the PPCC chief, Sidhu had once again exhibited his “shifty” character. “I’ve know this boy since his childhood and he has been a loner and can never be a team player,” said Captain Amarinder, recalling how the cricketer had deserted the Indian team in 1996 in England. “That’s what his real character is”, said the former chief minister. Describing Sidhu as a “flamboyant” speaker, Captain Amarinder Singh said what he speaks in public meetings or rallies may make people laugh but it’s all froth, with no substance. “People don’t vote for buffoonery”, he said, adding that no one takes him (Sidhu) seriously. Replying to a question on reports of Sidhu being upset with the inclusion of certain ministers in the Charanjit Singh Channi cabinet, Amarinder Singh said that the PPCC chief wanted to run the government by remote control. “What nonsense is this? Cabinet formation is the prerogative of the chief minister and why should Sidhu interfere?,” he quipped. On Sidhu’s claim that he was quitting as the party chief on matters of principle, Amarinder said, “What are these principles that he is talking about? He’s only preparing ground to quit the Congress. Wait and watch, he will soon join hands with some other party.” When asked if he would back former PPCC chief, Sunil Jakhar, for the job, Amarinder said, “He (Jakhar) is competent and had performed exceedingly well as the party chief”. Scotching speculation that he was in Delhi to meet senior BJP leaders, Amarinder said he was in Delhi on a personal visit, with the main intent of vacating the Kapurthala House for the new chief minister of Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhu-not-a-stable-man-resignation-sheer-drama-amarinder-singh/articleshow/86593101.cms||---

The decision to appoint Doel as the top law officer of the state had drawn flak from different quarters as he was counsel of former DGP Sumedh Saini and IG Paramran Singh Umranangal and got the former blanket bail from Punjab and Haryana high court. Punjab BJP has already taken exception to Deol’s appointment and scores of Sikh netizens have also criticised the move and they even ran a hashtag against Channi’s decision with #ChanniSavingSumedhSaini. Channi explained: “An advocate works for somebody professionally. After he has been appointed by the government, he will work for the government now. He remained an advocate for Captain Amarinder Singh also for close to 20 years, when cases were registered against him during the Badal regime. Nothing more should be read into this appointment.” Asked about questions being raised about the induction of Gurkirat Kotli and Rana Gurjit Singh in his cabinet, the CM said Kotli came from late CM Beant Singh’s family who sacrificed his life for the state and national security. However, he remained silent on Rana Gurjit Singh’s elevation even as he flanked him. Punjab assembly speaker Rana KP Singh, who was with Channi, also jumped in to defend the appointment of Deol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/charanjit-singh-channi-defends-decision-to-appoint-deol-as-ag/articleshow/86593137.cms||---

No one in the central leadership saw it coming, as senior leaders were praising Sidhu as a “popular” person who would be the “joint” party face in the coming elections with CM Charanjit Singh Channi. That Sidhu posted his resignation on social media despite the supposed proximity with the Gandhi siblings, particularly Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, suggested that they were not intimated in advance. It was largely at the instance of Sidhu that the party moved along the path of rejigging the state unit and ousting satrap Amarinder Singh as chief minister — going to the extent of calling a legislature party meeting without informing him. This, after having made the cricketer-turned-politician the state unit chief despite opposition from within. Amid the drama, party MPs were livid that they were not heard over the changes made in the state unit earlier.

There was no dearth of taunts and chuckles as Congress stood red-faced. Amarinder tweeted: “I told you so... he is not a stable man and not fit for the border state of Punjab.” G-23 member and MP Manish Tewari tweeted a Punjabi song which is advice to not befriend fickle young girls “who become friends easily but are as quick to sulk”.

---||World||Maryland newspaper gunman gets more than 5 life prison terms||ANNAPOLIS: A man who killed five people at a newspaper in Maryland was sentenced on Tuesday to more than five life sentences without the possibility of parole - with 345 additional years added on to ensure he is never released from prison. Anne Arundel County judge Michael Wachs ordered the sentence for Jarrod Ramos, whom a jury previously found criminally responsible for killing Wendi Winters, John McNamara, Gerald Fischman, Rob Hiaasen and Rebecca Smith with a shotgun at the Capital Gazette's office in June 2018. The assault was one of the worst attacks on journalists in US history. Before announcing the sentence, the judge heard survivors and family members of the slain describe the pain and loss they have experienced. He emphasized the courage of family members who spoke. "The defendant did not get the final say", Wachs said. "The First Amendment and the community got the final say." Wachs also pointed out that Ramos showed no remorse for the crimes and had said he would kill more if he were ever released. He described Ramos' actions as a "cold-blooded, calculated attack on the innocent employees of a small-town newspaper." "The impact of this case is just simply immense", Wachs said. "To say that the defendant exhibited a callous and complete disregard for the sanctity of human life is simply a huge understatement." Survivors described the shooting as an attack on journalism. Selene San Felice, a former reporter at the paper, said that while Ramos killed five of her colleagues, he could not stop the newspaper. "Remember this: You cannot kill the truth", San Felice said. Ramos had pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible to all 23 counts against him in 2019, using Maryland's version of an insanity defence. The case was delayed several times before and during the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the five life sentences without possibility of parole, Wachs ordered another life sentence for the attempted murder of photographer Paul Gillespie, who had said that Ramos narrowly missed him with a shotgun blast as he ran out of the newsroom. The judge also sentenced Ramos to 345 years in prison on the other charges. "The judge was crystal clear that Jarrod Ramos should never be allowed to walk out of prison - ever," said Anne Arundel County State's attorney Anne Colt Leitess. Family members of the slain cried in court as they described the anguish they have endured and the impact the attack had on the community of Maryland's state capital. "We lost the storyteller of our family, and as a community we lost the storyteller for everyone that is an Annapolitan", said Montana Winters Geimer, Winters' daughter. San Felice, who survived by hiding under a desk during the attack, told journalists outside the courthouse that it felt good to see authorities "take him away forever." "It felt really good to be able to look the judge in the eye and also to be able to look the shooter in the eye", San Felice said. "It meant a lot to me to be able to tell him to his face that he failed." Ramos, who sat in court wearing a black mask, declined to make a statement in court when asked by his attorney, Katy O'Donnell. After a 12-day trial in July, a jury took less than two hours to reject arguments from Ramos' attorneys that he could not understand the criminality of his actions. Prosecutors contended Ramos, 41, acted out of revenge against the newspaper after it published a story about his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of harassing a former high school classmate in 2011. Prosecutors said his long, meticulous planning for the attack - which included preparations for his arrest and long incarceration - proved he understood the criminality of his actions. Prosecutors also emphasized how Ramos called 911 from the newsroom after the shooting, identified himself as the gunman and said he surrendered - evidence he clearly understood the criminality of his actions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/maryland-newspaper-gunman-gets-more-than-5-life-prison-terms/articleshow/86593258.cms||---
---||India||Builder has to compensate RWA for handing over unfinished project: SC||NEW DELHI: Builders cannot get away by handing over maintenance and administration of a housing society to the residents’ welfare association if the project remains unfinished without all infrastructure and facilities promised to the homebuyers and will need to compensate the RWAs, the Supreme Court said. Almost 18 years after a builder handed over a housing project in Noida to the residents' association, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian directed the company, Padmini Infrastructure, to pay Rs 60 lakh to the Royal Garden RWA for not building a water softening plant, a second health club and a swimming pool in addition to putting in place a firefighting system. The long legal battle reflects issues faced by residents in such societies across the country and will be a boost for homebuyers, even though more recent state RERA laws cover some of the aspects relating to defaults on promised facilities. Such disputes between RWAs and builders, some going back several years, continue to clog courts and consumer forums. The real estate company constructed the housing project with 282 apartments and possession was given from 1998-2001. The purchasers formed an RWA and got it registered in 2003 under the Societies Registration Act. The RWA entered into an agreement on November 2003 with the builder for taking over maintenance of the apartment complex. As the builder did not fulfil promises made in the agreement, the RWA approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which appointed a local commissioner to visit the site and file a report. On the basis of the report, NCDRC allowed the plea of the association. The company thereafter moved the apex court, which had in an interim order in 2010 stayed the order of the consumer commission but directed the company to deposit Rs 60 lakh in its registry. A decade after entertaining the petition, the court directed that the sum be handed over to the association and brought the 18-year-old legal fight to an end. The court turned down the plea of the company that the association was barred by limitation to raise grievances and passed the order by accepting the report of the local commissioner. Observing that the association was handed over maintenance of the housing society 18 years ago, the court said it might not not be possible to compel the builder to make those facilities or systems fully operational now and the interests of justice will be met if the order of the National Commission is modified in such a manner that the complainant association shall receive in full and final settlement. "The complainant shall be entitled to all told monetary compensation in a sum of Rs 60 lakh, now lying in deposit with the Registry of this court, together with the interest accrued thereon, in lieu of the reliefs sought in prayer of the complaint. The opposite party (builder) shall, within two weeks, remove all building material stored by them in the club house in the basement of Tower Eden and hand over possession of the club house to the complainant," the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/builder-has-to-compensate-rwa-for-handing-over-unfinished-project-sc/articleshow/86593366.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The far-right leader, one of the leading international allies of Donald Trump, has warned that Brazil could see scenes reminiscent of the January 6 mob violence in Washington by supporters of the former US president's false claims of election fraud. In a letter to secretary of state Antony Blinken, four Democratic senators said that disruption in Brazil's democracy "would jeopardize the very foundation" of relations between the Western hemisphere's two most populous nations. "We urge you to make clear that the United States supports Brazil's democratic institutions, and that any undemocratic break with the current constitutional order will have serious consequences," said the senators including Dick Durbin, the chamber's number two Democrat, and Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. The senators voiced alarm at Bolsonaro's claims without evidence that the voting system is mired in fraud and his suggestions that he would not concede defeat. "This type of reckless language is dangerous for any democracy, but it is especially unmerited in a democracy of Brazil's caliber, which for decades has shown itself capable of facilitating peaceful transfers of power." The Biden administration has been low-key in public statements on Bolsonaro, and Blinken met last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly with Brazilian foreign minister Carlos Franca. A state department official said the meeting was largely to encourage the climate-skeptic Bolsonaro to raise ambitions ahead of a high-stakes UN climate conference in Glasgow in November, with Brazil a crucial player for the planet due to the Amazon's role as a carbon sink. Bolsonaro, whose approval rating has tanked in part due to Brazil's severe Covid-19 outbreak, has said he will not stage a coup although some supporters have called on the military to intervene to keep him in power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-senators-warn-brazils-jair-bolsonaro-on-democracy/articleshow/86593338.cms||---

Andhra Pradesh (32.3%) and Punjab (32.1%) also are among the states with a larger representation of women in managerial positions, while Assam has the lowest ratio of 6.9%. At the all-India level, the ratio of female workers to total workers in managerial positions is at 18.7%. It is at 21.4% in rural areas and 16.4% in urban areas. Female participation in the workforce has emerged as an area of concern in recent years as the share has dipped. The PLFS numbers also revealed that north-eastern states fare well when it comes to the ratio of female workers working as legislators, senior officials and managers in states and Union territories. Manipur tops the list with 51.8%, followed by Meghalaya (51.7%), Sikkim (50.4%) and Andhra Pradesh (47.9%). Assam again has a lower ratio at 6.2% in this segment. At the all-India level, the ratio is 23.2%, highlighting the need to have policies to bridge the wide gap with male workers. Sikkim tops the list of states with the highest ratio of females to males among professional and technical workers with 120.2%, followed by Meghalaya (101.5%) and Kerala (91.6%). Assam fares better in this segment with 52.9% while Manipur has 85.2% of female workers working as professional and technical staff. "Women in India still have large ground to cover in order to break the glass ceiling as they occupy only 18.8% of the senior- and middle-management positions at all-India level. Manipur and Meghalaya ranked first among the states at 34.1% women occupying senior- and middle-management positions," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India. "India needs to do a lot more in terms of promoting female employment in terms of better policies, a work environment which takes into account the additional caregiving responsibilities which fall naturally on women and creating a safe environment where women don’t have to fear for their physical well-being. If we look at the literacy rate of women, the north-eastern states again outperform the rest of the country. Clearly, education plays a big role in making women empowered and the government should work on policies which help more and more girls to get educated," said Ghosh. Separate data also shows the wide gap between male and female workers. The quarterly employment survey (QES) released by the Union Labour ministry on Monday showed that male workers constituted 70.7% of the total workers in the nine key non-farm sectors while women workers accounted for 29.3%. In the self-employed male segment, the "accommodation & restaurants" sector and the trade sector had the highest percentage share of 3.6% and 2.9% of the total employment, respectively. The same two sectors were the mainstay of self-employment among women accounting for 0.4% each, followed by the financial services sector (0.3%). Under the employee category, more than three-fourths of workers were male in the transport (83.7%), manufacturing (76.9%), construction (76.4%) and trade (75.6%) sectors.

---||World||After 5 years, Obamas break ground on Presidential Center||CHICAGO: After five years of legal battles, gentrification concerns and a federal review, Barack and Michelle Obama dug shovels into the ground on Tuesday during a celebratory groundbreaking on their legacy project in a lakefront Chicago park. Construction on the Obama Presidential Center along Lake Michigan, near the Obama family home and where the former president started his political career on Chicago's South Side, officially began last month. Standing near an excavator and other heavy equipment, Obama described how the city's South Side shaped him, first as a community organizer, then as a husband, father and elected official. He said the center was one way of giving back and he hoped it would bring an economic boost to the area and inspire a future generation of leaders. "We want this center to be more than a static museum or a source of archival research. It won't just be a collection of campaign memorabilia or Michelle's ballgowns, although I know everybody will come see those," he joked. "It won't just be an exercise in nostalgia or looking backwards. We want to look forward." Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, Illinois governor JB Pritzker and several city aldermen were among the few people allowed at the event, which was streamed online to limit crowds amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The presidential center will sit on 19 acres (7.7 hectares) of the 540-acre (291-hectare) of Jackson Park, named for the nation's seventh president, Andrew Jackson. It will be unique among presidential libraries. Obama's presidential papers will be available in digital form. The sprawling campus will include a museum, public library branch, athletic center, test kitchen and children's play area. The initial cost was projected at $500 million, but documents released by the Obama Foundation last month showed it is now roughly $830 million. Funds are being raised through private donations. Organizers estimate about 750,000 visitors will come to the center each year. Work on the Obama Presidential Center is expected to take about five years. Currently, heavy machinery peppers the site that's fenced off with green tarps. Progress has been delayed by lawsuits and a federal review required because of the location in Jackson Park, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. At the same time, fears about displacing Black residents in the area developed into a year long battle resulting in city-approved neighborhood protections, including for affordable housing. Some neighborhood activists said on Tuesday that they were already seeing rising housing prices and would keep pushing for more protections in surrounding areas. Environmental advocates have also objected to the location and the loss of green space. During the event, a plane pulled an aerial banner reading, "STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES. MOVE OPC." Obama, who didn't take questions during the event, has said over the years that the center will benefit the surrounding area with new jobs and new trees would be planted on the campus. He chose Chicago over several cities, including Honolulu, where he was born and spent his early years. It's a part of Chicago that has special significance for the Obamas. The center is near the University of Chicago where Obama taught law and where the Obamas got married and raised their two daughters. Michelle Obama also grew up on the South Side. "This city, this neighborhood courses through my veins and defines me at my very core," she said at the event. "This substantial investment in the South Side will help make the neighborhood where we call home a destination for the entire world."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-5-years-obamas-break-ground-on-presidential-center/articleshow/86593567.cms||---

The ‘Senior Able Citizens for Re-Employment in Dignity (Sacred)’ portal, being steered by the ministry of social justice and empowerment (MoSJ&E), will enable “virtual matching” of employable elderly of 60 years and above with employers who come forward and register on the platform. Social justice and empowerment secretary, R Subrahmanyam said the exchange is going to be an interactive platform on which stakeholders will meet each other virtually and decide on the course of action. To bring in employers, the minstry has also written to the CII, Ficci and Assocham and others to help bolster employment opportunities for the elderly. Once the portal goes live, a senior citizen can register with inputs on education, experience, skills and areas of interest. The job providers will specify the task involved and the number of senior citizens required to complete it. It has been proposed that voluntary organisations be drawn-in to help senior citizens in applying for these jobs. The ministry has made it clear that the exchange does not guarantee any job. This portal is being seen as the way forward against the backdrop of a steady rise in the population of elderly. The number of senior citizens has gone up from nearly 2 crore in 1951 to 7.6 crore in 2001 and about 10.4 crore in 2011. As per the report of the technical group on population projections for India (2011-2036) submitted to National Commission on Population, the population estimates of senior citizens were 13.76 crore (10.1%) in 2021, which is predicted to rise to 16.28 crore (11.4%) by 2026 and go further up to 22.74 crore (14.9%) in 2036. Moreover, data shows that a very large number of senior citizens are active, with the Longitudinal Ageing Study in In India (LASI Wave-1) report 2020 pitching this category at 50%. “Many senior citizens having experience, time and energy can be used by the business enterprises looking for stable employees with experience. The human resources cells of many private enterprises seek experienced but stable persons in certain positions. The portal allows bringing these people together by virtual matching of preferences,” Subrahmanyam added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govts-online-job-exchange-for-elderly-to-start-on-oct-1/articleshow/86593531.cms||Ambika Pandit

Failure to pay will carry a 9% interest on the amount, he directed. The financial services company has filed a special leave petition against the HC order before the SC. The SC is scheduled to hear it on Friday. The HC was hearing an interim application by La Fin which sought orders against MCX on the ground that the Exchange exceeded a 120-day deadline for filing its written statement in response to a ‘commercial suit’ it had instituted under the ‘Commercial Courts Act’. It noted that the suit against MCX was initially filed as a ‘regular suit’, which has no deadline. The submissions by the company are “flawed” and “manifestly unjust,” said the high court, adding, “There was here an initial fault on the part of the plaintiff itself in wrongly instituting the suit as a regular suit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-hc-fines-co-rs-25-lakh-for-wasting-courts-time/articleshow/86593872.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||SC admits West Bengal's appeal against CBI probe into post-poll violence||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the West Bengal government has made out a case for entertaining its appeal challenging a Calcutta high court order directing CBI and SIT probe into post-poll violence in May after Trinamool Congress, led by Mamata Banerjee, romped home in the assembly elections with a massive mandate. A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose issued notices to a bunch of petitioners who had filed PILs in the HC seeking independent investigation into the violence. The HC had initially ordered an inquiry by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), which had set up a seven-member committee for the purpose. Based on the NHRC’s stinging report, the HC on August 19 had ordered CBI probe into cases involving murder and a probe by SIT headed by Justice Manjula Chellur into other incidents of violence and arson after TMC emerged clear winner on May 2. Banerjee took oath as chief minister on May 5. The bench posted further hearing on WB’s appeal to October 7 but did not accede to senior advocate Kapil Sibal’s request to mention in the order that the CBI investigation would be subject to the outcome of the appeal. Sibal also requested that the CBI must not register fresh cases and summon state police officials till October 7. But the bench said it would look into all these issues on the next date of hearing. The SC had earlier issued notice to WB on three petitions by post-poll violence survivors as well as rape survivors seeking CBI probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-admits-west-bengals-appeal-against-cbi-probe-into-post-poll-violence/articleshow/86593891.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A bench of Justices U U Lalit, S R Bhat and Hrishikesh Roy not only rejected Adani Gas’s appeal against the Gujarat HC order, but also slapped a cost of Rs 10 lakh on it for acting naive about rules and regulations despite taking advantage of the same norms to bag gas distribution network projects in Ahmedabad municipal area. Adani had challenged the validity of Regulation 18 of the PNGRB (Authorizing Entities to Lay, Build, Operate or Expand City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks) Regulations, 2008 as violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India, and ultra vires Section 16 of the PNGRB Act, 2006. Adani had also challenged the grant of authorization to Gujarat Gas for laying and maintaining a gas distribution network. Gujarat Gas had succeeded in securing the authorization in an auction held by the PNGRB. The Board had granted Adani provisional clearance to carry out certain capital works in the Ahmedabad area, including the disputed areas of Sanand, Bavla and Dholka and Adani had submitted an indemnity in favour of the Board. On February 4, 2013, the Board granted provisional authorization to Adani’s CGD network in Ahmedabad city and Daskroi area, excluding 18 CNG stations of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The disputed areas were excluded from this provisional authorization. Under protest, Adani accepted the grant of authorization on December 9, 2013, despite certain areas being excluded. Adani moved the Gujarat HC seeking quashing of the grant of authorization to Gujarat Gas, questioning the exclusion of the disputed areas, and challenging the vires of Regulation 18 framed by the Board under the PNGRB Act. Adani also contended that by virtue of Section 16 of the PNGRB Act, it was entitled to be treated as an entity with “deemed authorization”. The HC rejected the Adani petition saying it thought it fit not to challenge the validity of Regulation 18, under which it was granted authorisation in respect of Khurja area in Uttar Pradesh. Dismissing its appeal, the SC said that Adani was barred from challenging the validity and constitutionality of a provision of which it had taken advantage of in getting authorisation for Khurja area. Writing the judgment, Justice Bhat said, “It is a matter of record that PNGRB granted authorization to Adani on February 4, 2012 in respect of the Khurja area. Given these background circumstances, its argument about lack of knowledge with respect to its rights, is indefensible. Adani accepted and acted on the authorization, by furnishing the performance bond, after which it registered its protest (in respect of excluded areas) with the PNGRB. Even then, it proceeded to act upon the authorization.” “Clearly, this conduct amounts to approbating and reprobating. Adani’s arguments about its lack of knowledge about its true rights, in the opinion of this Court, cannot be countenanced, because it knew and conformed to the procedure under the PNGRB Act, specifically, the requirements of the regulations, and Regulation 18, when it applied and obtained authorization in other areas in the country,” the SC said. After dismissing Adani's appeal, the SC asked it to pay litigation cost of Rs 10 lakhs to the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adani-loses-out-to-gujarat-gas-on-city-gas-distribution-network/articleshow/86593920.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The department of public instructions, Udupi, sent circulars to the heads of all schools in the district, to participate in the campaign on Tuesday. School heads have been directed to meet parents and the public once in a week, to collect used books under the Akshara Jolige Scheme. N H Nagur, deputy director of public instructions, told TOI that such collections will be handed over to libraries of schools and gram panchayats. The scheme is being implemented based on the directions of Udupi zilla panchayat CEO Naveen Bhat Y, he said. “Parents of students and others may donate old books under the scheme. Schools in the district will take up initiatives to collect the books and hand them over either to their school libraries or to panchayats. In this regard, I have directed the block education officers to coordinate with schools. The managements of private schools have also been requested to participate in the scheme and collect books. Our aim is to make use of old books that are not in use. Those books, if donated, will help students, especially in villages,” he said. A campaign to launch the scheme was held at Handattu village in Kotathattu GP near Kundapur on Tuesday. The minister has set a trend of accepting only books, particularly Kannada ones, and not bouquets from his well-wishers. Recently, he had exhibited over 3,500 books worth over Rs 6 lakh.

The approach to regulation also needs to adapt to the type of entity being regulated,” said Sankar. The deputy governor’s comment comes at a time when new technology giants including WhatsApp and Apple are looking at being part of the payments system. Speaking online at the Global FinTech Fest, Sankar said that, at most, basic level fintech enhances speed and there was a need to understand the limitations of financial technology. “If any fintech provides liquidity services, it is effectively a bank and will need to be subject to the same supervision as a bank,” he said. According to Sankar, RBI’s approach to regulation has been to create an environment where digital innovation can thrive. “This involved, to begin with, taking the initiative to set up the basic infrastructural entities which provided the rails on which innovative products can run. Regulation sought actively to facilitate wider participation to include non-banks and increase interoperability among different payments systems,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-base-fintech-rules-on-entities/articleshow/86592535.cms||---

Due to the proximity of the depression over Telangana and adjoining areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha, Nanded recorded 150mm rainfall, followed by Aurangabad (130mm), Beed (110mm), Osmanabad and Latur (100mm each), Jalna and Beed (80mm each), Hingoli and Parbhani (70mm each). Chandrapur in Vidharba recorded 100mm rainfall during the 24-hour period, while Buldhana recorded 90mm. In Madhya Maharashtra, Jalgaon recorded 110mm rainfall during the period, while Kolhapur recorded 70mm. Warning for heavy to very heavy rainfall over north Madhya Maharashtra and north Konkan till Wednesday continues, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a warning on possibility of localized flooding of roads, inundation and waterlogging in low-lying areas and closure of underpasses mainly in the urban areas of the affected regions. Possibilities of damage to vulnerable structures and localized mudslides have also been indicated by IMD in these parts till Wednesday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, said, “Monsoon has been vigorous over Maharashtra. The depression over southwest Vidarbha and neighbourhood moved west-northwestwards and weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area on Tuesday over western parts of Vidarbha and neighbourhood. It may move northwestward and weaken gradually by Wednesday.” The system is likely to emerge into northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Gujarat coast around Thursday and there is a likelihood for the system to further intensity into a depression (due to moisture supply from westerlies) during the subsequent 24 hours, IMD said. At the same time, the east-west trough continues to run from north Konkan to north Coastal Andhra Pradesh across the embedded cyclonic circulation associated with the well-marked low-pressure area over western parts of Vidarbha and its neighbourhood. IMD has also forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over north Madhya Maharashtra and north Konkan. For Pune city, IMD has forecast generally cloudy sky, thundery activity, lightning , light to moderate rain (isolated heavy rain in ghat areas) on Wednesday.

Even the one new case registered on Tuesday was of a person from Assam, who has come to Bihar for medical treatment. State health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said, "One positive sample was of a person who had come for bone-related treatment and got his blood sample tested in a private lab. But none of the districts had any positive cases on Tuesday." He appreciated the efforts of the health department and credited chief minister Nitish Kumar’s instruction for testing a large number of samples daily. "Even with a very low positivity rate, we were testing as many samples as possible and this helped in identifying the infected people and controlling the spread of virus," he said. Sanjay, however, advised people to follow the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour to have a better result. As per the data shared by the health department on Tuesday, the one positive case was reported against 14,41,85 samples tested in the past 24 hours. In the same duration, five people had recovered and active cases came down to 52 in the state. Madhubani had the maximum 16 active cases, followed by six in Patna. As on Tuesday, 22 districts had zero active cases. The state Covid tally was 72,59,48. However, 71,62,35 people have recovered and 9660 died due to Covid-19 so far.

---||Patna||Kanhaiya Kumar will strengthen party: Bihar Congress||PATNA: Senior Congress leaders welcomed former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar to their party. They said the former CPI youth icon will work to expand the Congress’s base in Bihar as well as in the country. Kanhaiya on Tuesday joined the Congress in the presence of Rahul Gandhi and other senior party leaders. Bihar Congress president Madan Mohan Jha and the party’s Bihar in-charge Bhakta Charan Das were also present on the occasion. Lauding Kanhaiya’s move, Congress Legislative Party leader Ajit Sharma said, “He has been a former JNU Students Union president and enjoys the support of a big chunk of the youths who believe in the secular nature of our country, peace and harmony. I am sure he will help in strengthening the party across the country.” Sharma said Kanhaiya had been strongly opposing the wrong policies of the NDA government and exposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. When asked about the tag of a traitor (tukre-tukre gang) attached to Kanhaiya and whether it will make Congress suffer because of that, Sharma replied, “Had Kanhaiya joined BJP, he would have become a desh bhakt (patriot). Anyone who opposes BJP becomes a desh drohi (traitor). But now people have understood that BJP has been playing with their sentiments and using patriotism for their political gain.” State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre called Kanhaiya the most popular youth icon. When asked about the change in ideologies, as Kanhaiya till a day before was with the Left and whether it would be difficult for him to adjust in Congress, Rathorre replied, “Congress as well as Left believe in secularism. Our party has always been working for the poor, farmers and the suppressed sections of society.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/kanhaiya-will-strengthen-party-congress/articleshow/86590691.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Kanhaiya Kumar with Congress a loss of face for CPI in Bihar?||PATNA: The three major Left parties in the state have not taken charitably the former JNUSU president CPI’s national executive member Kanhaiya Kumar joining the Congress at Delhi on Tuesday. Their dominant view is that it is a “temporary jhatka” (shock and setback) for them, but more a “loss of face” for the CPI that had invested so much to create a youth icon from within the Left. Kanhaiya had lost the 2019 parliamentary election to BJP stalwart Giriraj Singh for Begusarai seat. He, in fact, stood third, with RJD nominee Tanveer Hassan faring second, as there was no alliance between the CPI and RJD in the Lok Sabha election. Since Begusarai was his home district and the town has been known as even Leningrad of Bihar, it proved to be a shock defeat for Kanhaiya and set the sense of disillusionment with the CPI in him. Noting that it was the “personal ambition and understanding of the situation” that had impelled Kanhaiya to join the Congress, the Left leaders also said, “In Communist parties, individuals are important, but the party is above the individual. Therefore, in the long run, the party will not be damaged. For, Kanhaiya is not the first from the Left to join the Congress, or any other party. The saving grace is that he did not join the BJP.” Ram Babu Kumar from the CPI felt somewhat relieved, as he said, “Now even while being in the Congress, he will be on the same ideological page as the Left parties in the matters of various national issues.” The opinion among the Left parties was also that the Congress should not poach on the Left or other parties, if it was eager to build a larger anti-BJP alliance. The opinion of a cross-section in the Left was also that the CPI had given Kanhaiya everything it had, as it projected him on the national stage. “The CPI had invested in him so much, because he was young, articulate and also established instant rapport with the youths. He had become a youth icon, which was a new thing for the Left,” said a Left leader. “But Kanhaiya has shown lack of commitment.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Metro stops work till Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Nagpur Improvement Trust pay Rs 555 crore||NAGPUR: In a major setback for the city, the work of Indora and Cotton Market metro stations has come to a grinding halt, since Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) have not paid the promised funds to MahaMetro. As per the tripartite agreement, NIT and NMC had promised 5% share each in the Rs8,680 crore phase-I of Nagpur metro project, which comes to Rs434 crore each. Out of the total Rs868 crore, the local urban bodies are yet to pay Rs555 crore to MahaMetro. As per the agreement, NMC has to pay Rs73 crore in cash while NIT has to shell out Rs83 crore. “Overall, NIT has to pay Rs189 crore to Maha Metro while NMC’s pending share is Rs366 crore,” said sources from MahaMetro. Both NMC and NIT have not paid the agency any significant amount in cash. “NMC and NIT have given us only land worth Rs68 crore and Rs245 crore respectively. Both the bodies have not paid their share for the Nagpur Metro Rail Project (NMRP) Phase-I as per the approved funding pattern of MahaMetro, due to which the agency is facing a financial crunch,” said officials. TOI had recently reported that work of Nagpur Metro phase-2 is expected to begin soon after getting Union cabinet’s nod. While work is going on in all phase-1 metro stations of Reach II (Sitabuldi Interchange to Automotive Square), and Reach IV (Sitabuldi Interchange to Prajapati Nagar), it has come to a halt at Indora (Reach II) and Cotton Market stations (Reach IV). Locals said no activity has been seen at the two stations since last few days. TOI learnt that Indora and Cotton Market stations are very crucial. “Indora station caters to a large area on Kamptee Road while Cotton Market station provides direct connectivity to Mahatma Phule vegetable and fruit market. “Unless, these two bodies pay their share immediately, it will not be possible to complete these two stations,” added Metro sources. Some experts said the problem would not have arisen if the local bodies had made systematic annual budgetary provision for the metro project. “When Devendra Fadnavis was the state chief minister, it was expected that a good amount of money will come from the state government. The future of Nagpur metro project is now in the hands of politicians who take credit for the city’s development. It is up to them to ensure that NMC and NIT give their promised amount,” they said. Maha Metro has set a target of completing Reach II and Reach IV by December-end. While this target will be met, the organization will probably not be able to start all the stations in the coming days due to the lack of funds. MONEY MATTERS- NIT and NMC promised to pay 5% share each in phase-I of Nagpur Metro project - Out of total Rs868 crore, both bodies yet to pay Rs555 crore - NMC and NIT have to pay Rs73 and Rs83 crore in cash respectively - Phase-1 work has come to a halt at Cotton Market and Indora stations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/metro-stops-work-till-nmc-nit-pay-rs555-crore/articleshow/86592553.cms||Manka Behl

---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Farmer from Belthangady adopts six methods of water conservation at his farm||MANGALURU: Though rainwater harvesting (RWH) is not a new concept, and the techniques are simple, yet, it has still not caught up on the expected lines. It is a technique to collect and store rainwater for irrigation and domestic purposes. A farmer from Belthangady, who has been working on spreading awareness on RWH, has adopted six simple methods of water conservation at his farm, during the last decade. David Jaimy Kokkada, who cultivates rubber and coconut as primary crops on 2.5 acres, has tried to conserve and harvest water through various methods. He told TOI: “The advantages of RWH are plenty, and it benefits the entire community in the long run. Ever since I started adopting various RWH techniques during the last 10 years, we have stopped facing a water crisis. Our open well that used to dry up during the peak summer every year, has stopped drying up. There is a feeling that the groundwater table in the surrounding area has also increased,” he said. David Jaimy said that his aim is to popularise simple methods of RWH . “Other than recharging the open well with rooftop harvesting, by using the water cup filter and collecting rainwater in a tank, I have attempted to recharge the groundwater through anthills. Wherever there is an old anthill, we create a silt pit next to it, and then allow the water to flow to the anthill. Further, the rainwater that flows from a small shed has been diverted to the percolation pits, and I have also tried out RWH through a tree. For this a narrow pipe is connected to a tree and percolation pit. There are about six percolation pits, and all the techniques that I have followed are explained on my YouTube channel,” he said. Until the pandemic struck, Jaimy used to conduct several awareness programmes in villages, schools and colleges on water conservation, and has even brought out a booklet. Two years ago, he had developed a low-cost filter called water cup, for RWH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/farmer-adopts-six-methods-of-water-conservation-at-his-farm/articleshow/86590278.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Probe singes hospital owners and govt||AHMEDABAD: More than a year after 13 Covid-19 patients were burnt to death in designated coronavirus hospitals in Ahmedabad and Rajkot, the hospitals have been held guilty of negligence. The report of the Justice (retd) D A Mehta inquiry commission was tabled in the Gujarat assembly on Tuesday. It said that the managements of the Covid-19 facilities — Shrey Hospital in Ahmedabad and Uday Shivanand Hospital in Rajkot — were negligent, which led to the deaths. The panel found the fires were triggered by defective medical equipment, flawed building design, and the lack of precautionary measures. At the Rajkot hospital, the fire broke out from a Dhaman device, the indigenously developed ventilator much promoted by the state government during the pandemic. Dhaman ventilators were later withdrawn. At Shrey Hospital, the fire has been attributed to a faulty monitor between Beds 8 and 9. “A monitor’s life is between two and five years. Using a 15-year-old monitor is inviting disaster,” the report noted. Eight Covid patients died at Shrey Hospital on August 6, 2020. Five deaths occurred in the Rajkot hospital fire on November 27, 2020. The probe panel has also come down heavily on the government authorities for lacunae in procedures and for laxity in enforcing fire safety norms. The government was blasted for shirking its responsibility by outsourcing the tasks in fire and emergency services. Such a decision cannot be taken “applying the touchstone of revenue”, the panel said. It said that the fire services fall within a priority sector, which requires adequate workforce ready around the clock. The services cannot be dependent on outsourcing, the panel said. The panel’s inquiry drew controversy with the victims’ families expressing dissatisfaction. The kin moved the high court to stay the panel from submitting its report in a hurried manner on the state government’s wish. They have also approached the Supreme Court, terming the probe insufficient. After the report was tabled, a few MLAs of the opposition Congress wrote to chief minister Bhupendra Patel asserting that the inquiry has not been impartial and that another probe was required. Since Shrey Hospital was permitted to function in a residential building with some alterations, the panel said, “Had the unauthorized construction in and on the premises of Shrey Hospital not been regularized, the fatalities could have been avoided.” The panel has recommended that the regularization of unauthorized construction not be permitted in a blanket manner, especially at medical establishments, by charging money. The panel held Shrey Hospital’s trustee Bharat Mahant guilty of negligence for the complete lack of fire safety measures at the hospital. Of the owner of the Rajkot hospital, the panel said that if the owner is a doctor and earns a profit, he too is liable for the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/probe-singes-hospital-owners-and-govt/articleshow/86591438.cms||---
---||Patna||2 Bihar seats may witness triangular contest in bypolls||PATNA: The bypolls in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly segments in Bihar scheduled for October 30 hold special significance for the NDA and its ally JD(U), which won both the seats in the 2020 assembly elections. The two seats fell vacant following the death of Mewalal Choudhary (Tarapur) and Shashi Bhushan Hazari (Kusheshwar Asthan). It is likely to be a triangular contest between Nitish Kumar’s JD (U), Lalu Prasad’s RJD and Chirag Paswan’s LJP on both the seats. The NDA partners are under pressure to retain the two seats being eyed by the RJD. The LJP faction of Jamui MP Chirag Paswan has also announced to field his candidates from both the seats. If the JD(U) loses the two seats, not only its strength in the assembly will be reduced, but it will also intensify the already growing rift with ally BJP over various issues. The Kusheshwar Asthan constituency has a strong presence of the Yadav and Paswan votes. During the 2020 assembly election, Hajari won the seat by garnering 39.5% of the votes polled and defeating the Congress’s Ashok Kumar, who had secured 34.6% votes. Mewalal Choudhary had won the Tarapur seat in 2020 and 2015 assembly elections, while his wife Neeta Choudhary was also elected to the legislative assembly in 2010 on the JD(U) ticket. Mewalal, with 36.5% votes, had defeated RJD nominee Divya Prakash, who polled 32.8% votes. Prakash is the daughter of former Union minister Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav. In 2015, Mewalal had defeated former minister Shakuni Choudhary of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/triangular-contest-likely-in-bypolls-for-two-seats/articleshow/86591391.cms||Abhay Singh

According to sources, the Patna Smart City Limited (PSCL) has identified 14 different areas where 3D paintings with social messages will be drawn. These include the walls near Adalatganj Pond, Budh Marg, Mithapur Cooling Tower, Jan Sewa Kendra, Gyan Bhawan, Atal Path, General Post Office, GST Bhawan, Gandhi Maidan, and Shaheed Smarak. The PSCL has also planned to install 3D sculptures at locations like Gyan Bhawan, Bihar Museum, Collectorate Ghat, Mithapur Flyover, Atal Path, Adalatganj Pond, and Maurya Lok Complex. The theme of the paintings and the statues will be based on social issues like women empowerment, sanitation, and ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’. A detailed project report has been prepared and a Delhi-based private firm roped in for the project which is likely to be ready by October-end at a cost of Rs 5 crore. Harshita, the public relations officer (PRO) of the PSCL, told this reporter that the project was aimed at providing a unique virtual experience to Patnaites. “The 3D paintings, which will be created using high-quality exterior colours, are expected to bring behavioural changes among the people and teach them something positive,” she said. The PRO added, “Work on a wall near Adalatganj Pond has begun and is likely to be ready within a week. The theme of this painting is ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’.” Agency roped in to screen films: An agency has been selected to show films and documentaries on the mega screen installed at Gandhi Maidan. It has already prepared a film calendar which will be approved by the PSCL. Patnaites will soon be able to watch films based on social issues every evening or two times a week from 6pm to 9pm. Important sports tournaments will also be screened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3d-paintings-to-adorn-many-walls-in-patna/articleshow/86590650.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||ED attaches Jamalpur railway engineer's assets worth Rs 3.44 crore||PATNA: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached movable and immovable assets worth at least Rs3.44 crore allegedly amassed by railways’ senior section engineer Chandeshwar Prasad Yadav. Yadav was posted at Jamalpur railway workshop in Munger. The ED sleuths of Patna zonal office had arrested him for money laundering on September 14. The assets were attached on Monday, as per the ED communique on Tuesday. Sources said attached properties include a house in Gardanibagh and plots of land at Mahnar and Hajipur in Vaishali and Dalsingsarai in Samastipur. “These plots were purchased in the name of his wife Urmila Devi,” an ED source said. The movable properties attached include investments of at least Rs35.85 lakh in seven mutual funds, Rs7.97 lakh in four insurance policies, Rs1.64 crore in 29 fixed deposits in banks and Rs17.25 lakh in the bank accounts of Yadav, Urmila and their sons Bharat Bhushan and Shashi Bhushan. “He made confessional statement after interrogation for four days in remand that how he had amassed properties from the ill-gotten money. He also revealed his connivance with Patna’s Maharani Steels owner Devesh Kumar in misappropriating disposal of 100 condemned wagons, 3220 released wheel sets and other steel fittings worth Rs34 crore from the Jamalpur workshop for earning financial gratification from the industrialist,” a source said. Devesh was arrested on August 13. The misappropriations took place between 2013 and 2017. It was detected in the railway vigilance inspection. “Railway authorities complained to CBI about this misappropriation in 2017. The CBI registered an FIR on February 9, 2018 and also filed chargesheet in the case. ED’s investigation for money laundering is based on the CBI case,” a source said. ED investigation revealed that Yadav’s earning from salary between January 2013 and December 2017 was Rs38 lakh, but he had deposited Rs2.37 crore in his bank accounts as well as those of his kin. The cash was received from Devesh. “These cash deposits were layered and then finally invested to amass properties,” the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ed-attaches-assets-worth-rs-3-44-crore-of-railway-engineer/articleshow/86590668.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Opposition parties attack Nitish Kumar's govt on special status U-turn||PATNA: The observation made by planning and development minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav that the Nitish Kumar government was now not interested in pursuing the demand for special category status to Bihar, as it has become tired of making seemingly futile efforts on pursuing it for so long, has invited sharp reactions from the oppsoition RJD and Congress. “We have been making the demand for special category status to Bihar for a long time and are now tired of it. The Centre has brought a report on it, where it has been made clear that the special category status cannot be given to a state,” Yadav said on Monday. “In the situation as prevails, a better proposition is to make the demand for the special package for the state,” Yadav also said, adding that it alone was the more worthwhile proposition to tackle the various aspects of Bihar’s backwardness. On Tuesday, the statement created an immediate flutter in political circles, with the opposition pouncing on the CM on his present position with regard to the issue. RJD and Congress mocked the state government led by Nitish for failing to get the special status for Bihar. Leaders of both the opposition parties took a jibe at Yadav’s statement. Leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted, “A CM who could not succeed in getting central university status to Patna University, how could he succeed in getting special status to Bihar. Is this the double-engine with 39 out of 40 MPs. I have already said that Nitish Ji has become tired and now his party has also accepted that they along with CM have become tired. He (Nitish) is only worried about his chair and not Bihar.” In another tweet, Tejashwi said, “If his alliance won 39 out of 40 parliamentary seats, then whoever be the PM, that person will himself come to Bihar and make an announcement regarding special status to Bihar.” Even Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra hit out at the JD(U) for taking a U-turn on the special category status demand. Mishra said JD(U) had only been doing politics on this issue and CM Nitish and his party men were never serious in acquiring special category status for Bihar. “CM Nitish had announced that he would stay with those who help him in getting the special category status for Bihar. So why is he still compelled to be with the BJP?” Mishra said, and further demanded that the JD(U) should make its stand clear. He added that the grand alliance would go to people on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-parties-attack-nitish-govt-on-special-status-u-turn/articleshow/86590734.cms||Abhay Singh

In an attempt to streamline health services in public hospitals, from the primary health centre (PHC) to government general hospitals (GGHs) and medical colleges, the government will also introduce a biometric attendance system. The government has been studying the proposal to ban private practice for the last two years. However, it was cleared recently after the revision of pay scales of doctors working in public the healthcare system. The government has started implementing the pay scales fixed by the University Grants Commission for teachers in medical colleges. “Since the government met all their demands, it is the duty of doctors to serve the public healthcare system with more dedication,” said a senior official. Previously, the NT Rama Rao government had banned private practice by government doctors in 1983. The NTR government promised to pay Rs 50 per day to government doctors for foregoing private services. However, the decision was met with resistance by the doctors as they dubbed the Rs 50 compensation too low. “Although the proposal looks good on paper, it is very difficult to implement as monitoring the services in private hospitals will become tricky,” said a senior professor at Government Medical College (GMC), Guntur. He, however, said there was nothing wrong in the government expecting senior doctors to serve the poor in government institutions as it was spending on improving the system. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had said public hospitals should be upgraded to the extent that no one from AP should have to go to a neighbouring state seeking specialised healthcare services. The CM also recently cleared a proposal to fill 1,400 vacancies in hospitals including doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. The CM made it clear that no service should be denied for want of personnel in any government hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-mulls-ban-on-pvt-practice-by-govt-docs/articleshow/86591215.cms||Samdani MN

---||Business||Sebi okays e-gold receipt trades, allows silver ETFs||MUMBAI: The board of markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday gave its nod to start a gold trading platform on which the yellow metal could be traded in electronic form, called electronic gold receipts (EGRs), which could also be exchanged for physical gold by its holders. The concept, if successful, could lead to better discovery of spot price of gold in India. This could also lead to launch of derivatives products on gold, industry experts said. Along with its nod for EGRs, the Sebi board also cleared a framework for vaults that would play a very important role of storing the physical gold that will guarantee each EGR traded on gold exchanges. In February this year, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had entrusted Sebi the responsibility to set up an exchange for trading in gold. In the same board meet, the nod for the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for silver were also cleared. The rules for silver ETFs would be similar to the one for gold ETFs, but not exactly the same, Sebi said. “EGRs will have the trading, clearing and settlement features akin to any other securities (like stocks, commodities, etc),” Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi said. A Sebi release further added that any stock exchange could launch trading in EGRs in a separate segment. The denomination for trading and conversion of it into physical gold could be decided by the bourses with Sebi’s approval. The exchanges trading in EGRs could emerge to be national platforms for buying and selling these with underlying standardised gold in India, Sebi said. This could also create a national pricing structure for the yellow metal. “The gold exchange is expected to offer a host of benefits for the value chain participants as well as for the entire gold market ecosystem such as efficient and transparent price discovery, investment liquidity, assurance in the quality of gold, etc,” Sebi noted. Like settlement of trades done on stock exchanges, for EGRs too a clearing corporation will settle the trades by transferring EGRs and funds to the buyer and the seller respectively. Sebi said EGRs will be made ‘fungible’, and ‘interoperability between vault managers’ will be allowed. This means EGR bought on one exchange could be exchanged for golds through any vault in India and not necessarily a vault associated with the particular exchange where the EGR was bought. “Given how this has been structured, the prospects for EGRs look good. If this product is well accepted in the market, it could eventually lead to launch of futures & options on EGRs,” said Sanjiv Shah, ex-founder of Benchmark Mutual Fund that had launched the first gold ETF in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-okays-e-gold-receipt-trades-allows-silver-etfs/articleshow/86592465.cms||---

Bhatt, a trustee in Pavagadh temple, had been on the run after the girl filed a complaint at Gotri police station against him and senior chartered accountant Ashok Jain. Bhatt was brought to the city on Tuesday night.  “We got information about his whereabouts from his relatives. Bhatt has many relatives as well as friends in Junagadh, so he was hiding there for the last few days,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). Bhatt will be sent for RTPCR tests on Wednesday and he will be produced in the court a day after that.  Sources in the police said that Bhatt was out to meet one of his advocate friends in Junagadh where the cops nabbed him. His arrest has brought some relief to the police as Bhatt’s disappearing act a day after the FIR had caused much embarrassment to the cops. Senior police officials said that they will track down Jain too in the next few days.  Bhatt was also booked under the Prohibition Act on Monday after a bottle of brandy was found at his residence during the police search. On September 19, the girl studying in a private university had accused Jain, who runs a CA firm, of molesting her by spiking her drink at a guest house. She said that Jain also came to her flat and raped her later. She had alleged that Bhatt, who is an investor in Jain’s firm, had also raped her and threatened her with dire consequences.  Jain too wrote a letter to the state DGP and home minister claiming his innocence. He has said in the letter that he is being framed by the girl’s friend Alpesh Vadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi who is a history sheeter. The police are trying to track down Sindhi who is also on the run in connection with a prohibition case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/raju-bhatt-arrested-from-junagadh/articleshow/86590489.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Village sectts to launch registrations||Amaravati: In a move aimed at taking the administration closer to the people, the state government has decided to launch land registration services at village secretariats. The government has identified 51 village secretariats to kick-start the service on a pilot basis. The new system will help reduce the load on existing sub-registrar offices.  In view of the inordinate delays in completing the registration process in almost all the districts, the state government had recently shifted the stamps and registration department main server from Hyderabad to Mangalagiri. The department found that frequent technical glitches in the main server and heavy load are resulting in severe delays in completing the process. People who are visiting the sub-registrar offices are being made to wait for hours to get the process completed.  The government also found that the people were not fully content with the services extended in the registration department particularly due to the ‘uncourteous’ attitude of the staff and the dominance of stamp vendors. “Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has expressed his displeasure at the services extended in the registration offices. He wanted to transform the entire system by taking the services closer to the people,” said a senior official in the registration department.  The stamps and registration department is one of the highest revenue earning departments of the government. But a majority of the registration offices are languishing in old and dilapidated buildings with low-power computer systems. These systems frequently hang in the middle of the registration even on non-peak days leading to a delay in the registration. “In some cases, we are unable to hand over the documents even after a week as the computers are unable to handle the load,” said a sub-registrar.  The department has already handed over the required land records data to the village secretariats. It has also trained the revenue secretaries in the secretariats to handle the registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/village-sectts-to-launch-registrations/articleshow/86591320.cms||Samdani MN

The dispute regarding a particular feature in Peugeot Motorcycle's popular Metropolis three-wheeled scooter, which Piaggio claims infringes its patent rights, has now attracted a Euro 1.5 million fine (nearly Rs 13 crore) fine from the French court Tribunal Judiciaire in Paris which has also forbidden the production, export, import or marketing of the three-wheeled scooter in France as long as it employs Piaggio's patented technology. The Italian court Tribunale of Milan has also slapped similar penalties forbidding Peugeot Motorcycles from importing, exporting, selling or marketing the Peugeot Metropolis scooter all over Italy. The Italian court has also slapped a fine of euro 6000 (just over Rs 5 lakh) on Peugeot Motorcycles for every unit of the Metropolis sold a month after the sentence. Further, if the vehicles are not taken back within 3 months of the sentence, the company will attract a fine of euro 10,000 (Rs 8.6 lakh) per day. When contacted, M&M did not comment on the matter. Mahindra Group inherited the ongoing patent dispute when it bought Peugeot Motorcycles from Peugeot Group. According to sources, there were several cases pending between Piaggio and Peugeot Motorcycles and all but one of these have now been settled. These current court orders will hit Metropolis sales hard given that France and Italy are its big markets. Group Mahindra has faced legal issues in global markets earlier this year when Fiat Chrysler moved the federal court of Australia over the Mahindra Thar's look which it said infringed its own Jeep Wrangler's design.

It is now looking at increasing the number of free cash withdrawals for its customers to ensure that they are not impacted by the move. “We have very less volume of cash transactions. Today nobody walks to an ATM to withdraw cash and with the proliferation of AEPS, UPI and wallets, owning a small network of ATMs was not viable,” said R Baskar Babu co-founder and CEO of Suryoday Small Finance Bank. The Bank, which has just 26 ATMs and 550 branches. Instead the Bank wants to open more micro ATMs. “Nearly 80% of the business is digital and customers have embraced digital banking. So spending money to maintain a small network of ATMs was futile. Therefore we decided to shut our own network and allow use of third party ATMs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/suryoday-bank-to-shut-down-atms-from-oct-1/articleshow/86591839.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

You call for an in-person meeting with the team to kick-start a new intervention that can revolutionise how you do business with your customer. All take copious notes while you speak — 30 minutes straight — and then you stop to ask: Any questions? Do you think this will work? What else must we do to make this possible? Silence. If this is a situation you commonly encounter, your team may be lacking the psychological safety to speak up. These times of upheaval have not only accelerated change, learning and innovation but also yanked many organisations out of industrial-era mindsets and unfolded knowledge-era cultures, where creative ideas and employee voice become key to solve wicked problems. If you’re leading a team that’s now remote, its physical and psychological safety is a priority. Most organisations are doing a good job of applying social distancing and other measures to protect their members physically. But what about their psychological safety? An employee who feels psychologically safe feels included, free to learn and contribute, and challenge the status quo without fear of being embarrassed, marginalised, or punished if they spoke up with candour. People flourish when they participate in a cooperative system with high psychological safety that covers three basic human needs — fulfilment, belonging and security. That’s what makes it so powerful when present, and also so dangerous when not. Psychological safety makes people confident of speaking up, and even sharing mistakes without fear of punishment or negative consequences. It’s a sense of permission for candour and can allow access to mission-critical information or market intelligence, or an opportunity to learn from mistakes, by enabling the comfort to share this. Psychologically safe workplaces are not about being nice or are free from conflict, where everyone agrees with each other, or places where all ideas will be accepted. They are in fact healthy places of fearless speaking up, with accountability to solve problems, so teams can take the most optimal decisions. Psychological safety is not an outcome in itself but a process leading to a goal — excellence, that comes from a) Timely employee voice, b) Encouraging alternative perspectives and deliberate divergence of thought & listening, and c) Sharpening the creative problem-solving process that triggers innovative ideas/ solutions. This is how it looks when teams lack psychological safety: * Employees don’t ask many questions during meetings * They don’t own up to mistakes and instead place blame on others when mistakes are made. There are missed opportunities for lessons learnt * The team avoids difficult conversations & hot-button topics lest these lead to conflict * Feedback is not given and neither sought * Senior executives and team leaders mostly dominate discussions and meetings * Employees hesitate to ask each other for help lest it displays their vulnerability * Employees prefer not to venture outside of their job descriptions to help each other, even if required * Employees mostly don’t know each other personally, but only professionally and keep a safe distance * There are hardly any differing points of view or disagreements Do all this sound familiar? Remote working appears to have accentuated these behaviours in some teams, and if this resonates, then your team lacks psychological safety. Let’s look at what can you do to improve this situation that adversely impacts engagement, voluntary contribution and performance: * Listen, show your team you’re engaged: a) If your employees feel that you don’t pay attention when they speak, or that you don’t value their thoughts and opinions, they’ll shut down. b) Demonstrate engagement by being present during meetings. This includes active listening by making eye contact, nodding, summarising what team members say. c) Ask questions to make sure you understand the other person’s ideas or opinions. By actively engaging, you create an environment where people feel it’s not only OK to speak up, in fact, it’s encouraged and accepted. * Avoid blaming to build trust: a) It’s easy when something goes wrong to look for someone to blame. But to build and maintain psychological safety in the workplace, focus on solutions. b) Instead of “What happened?” and “Why?”, ask “How can we make sure this goes better next time?” Notice the focus on the collaborative language. We statements turn the responsibility into a group effort, rather than singling out an individual for a mistake. * Bring your whole self to work and create self-awareness for team members: People bring their whole self to work — their unique personalities, preferences, and work styles. Build self-awareness in your team by sharing how you work best, how you like to communicate, and how you like to be recognised. Encourage team members to do the same. * Toxic energies & cliques must be nipped in the bud: If team members speak negatively about peers, talk to them about it. Be clear, let them know that you work together as a team and negativity will not be tolerated. Any groupism, bullying and marginalising of any individual or group must be nipped in the bud. * Include your team in decision-making: When making decisions, consult your team. Ask for their inputs, thoughts and feedback. Not only will this help them feel included in the decision-making process, it will also build psychological safety and lead to more positive outcomes. Once a decision is made, explain the reasoning behind your decision. How did their feedback factor into the decision? What other considerations were made? Even if your employees don’t agree, they’ll appreciate the honesty and transparency behind how the decision was made. * Encourage practice through feedback: When employees feel psychologically safe, they feel empowered to give feedback — up, down, and across. And this means they feel comfortable to come to the Leader when there’s critical information to share. Invite your team to challenge your perspectives and push back. While this may be uncomfortable at first, healthy conflict within teams lead to better decisions and greater accountability, making it a win-win for all. You might also want to lead by example by taking interpersonal risks and sharing failures. Role-modelling growth mindsets are key to set off the virtuous cycle of learning. Try getting up at the next all-company meeting and sharing a failure story, and what you learned. * Be the coach & champion development of teams: Let the team know you’re on their side by supporting their personal and professional development. Find the time for this. Share the team’s work with senior leadership to increase visibility on what your team is doing — and give credit to team members when due. Why building psychological safety pays off It’s the means to excellence, as proven by various research studies. It is the number one driver of high performance. Especially in challenging times, attempting to build psychological safety in the workplace is key to enhance employee experience. Build contemporary workplaces where employees feel included, valued and comfortable bringing their whole selves to work.

Sharma will step into the shoes of Shuva Mandal, who left Tata Sons four months ago to pursue private practice. An alumnus of Kolkata’s National University of Juridical Sciences, Sharma (39) will be the youngest general counsel at Tata Group and will report to its chairman N Chandrasekaran. The hiring will mark his return to Tata Sons, where he used to be part of the legal team several years ago. He had quit Tata Sons to follow a solo law practice, during which he advised several parties including Tata Sons parent Tata Trusts in an income tax matter against the revenue department. Prior to Sharma, Tata Sons has had two general counsels from December 2000 to May 2021. Sharma’s appointment comes amid plans by Tata Sons to expand its footprint in the e-commerce sector, which is under the government’s scanner for competitive practices. India has proposed stricter rules that could have an impact on affiliates of Tata Sons, restricting them from offering their products on Tata’s marketplace-based online platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-get-new-general-counsel/articleshow/86592045.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Although at 82%, as revealed by a recent KPMG survey of CEOs’ outlook, the number is marginally lower compared to the 92% level recorded six months earlier in March this year, just before the onset of the second Covid wave. When it comes to their organisation’s earnings outlook, there is a marginal decline in confidence among CEOs in India. While 96% in March had projected an earnings outlook for their company at 0-2.5% over the next three years, in the latest survey, the percentage for the same earnings growth stands at 95%. The survey, however, says companies are ready to combat all kinds of risks and disruptions to recover better. The KPMG survey of 125 CEOs, shared exclusively with TOI, said, “CEOs of some of the largest businesses in India are confident and ready for a recovery that is digitally driven and purpose-led to build better and stronger than ever before.” KPMG India chairman & CEO Arun M Kumar said, while the global crisis has led to a significant decline in confidence in organisational and sectoral growth, CEOs in India — much like their global counterparts — are quite optimistic about the prospects for the global economy. Living through an unprecedented crisis, CEOs had to constantly reassess their strategies for business continuity and growth, said Kumar. With the threat of new variants and advent of a third wave in India expected anytime now, Kumar added, “We may not be back to ‘business as usual’ just yet.” He said, “But what makes me immensely happy is that the CEOs in India are ready to strategise and combat operational risks despite the demanding times. Over a year later, we now have the opportunity to build a stronger, more sustainable future only if we work together and, most importantly, build back better.” Pidilite Industries MD Bharat Puri said, “With the increasing pace of vaccinations and a good monsoon, we see considerable improvement in consumer sentiment. We remain cautiously optimistic of business returning to normal in the post-Diwali period.” About 55% CEOs in the survey showed greater confidence in the prospects for the global economy and expressed readiness to combat risks and disruptions to make progress faster. Moreover, 9 out of 10 CEOs in India are slightly more optimistic that the headcount of their organisation will increase over the next three years, and hence are investing more in developing their workforce’s skills and capabilities. On growth strategies, 35% CEOs believe organic methods (innovation, R&D, capital investment) will be crucial for realising their growth objectives over the next three years. Simultaneously, the appetite for M&As has increased significantly. The percentage of CEOs who said they are likely to undertake acquisitions which have a significant impact on the overall organisation has risen from 26% in March this year to 55%. The survey also found that leading CEOs (48%) in India are looking to sharpen their digital edge further. And 64% CEOs also said they were prepared for an eventuality like a ransomware attack. Interestingly, although environmental, social & governance (ESG) is a critical business priority for CEOs in India, the survey shows a dip (at 78%) in focus to shift towards the social component of the ESG programme. This number was slightly higher in March this year at 96%. However, their focus on creating a net-zero future stands strong with 79% of CEOs in India asserting that a government stimulus is required to turbo charge climate investments being made by the business community. With purpose in business also gaining in importance, the survey showed that 66% of CEOs stated this to be their main objective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/82-ceos-bullish-on-growth-survey/articleshow/86591961.cms||Namrata Singh

Addressing reporters, he said the government had previously said it would purchase the entire paddy from farmers and changed tack after the Centre had said it would obtain only a limited quanty. Arvind demanded the government release Rythu Bima’s outstanding payment. “The state has a pending premium of Rs800 crore, which it must release,” he said.

The data of the electors has been uploaded for their biometric verification at the respective polling booths. Among the 76,279 candidates in the second round, 46,168 are women and remaining 36,111 are men, indicating that the fair sex has keen interest in rural politics.

The Election Commission on Tuesday announced bypolls in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies following the death of JD(U) MLAs Shashi Bhushan Hazari and Mewalal Choudhary. From the opposition Mahagathbandhan, RJD had contested the Tarapur seat and Congress had fielded its candidate from Kusheshwar Asthan. RJD’s Maner MLA and spokesperson Bhai Birendra said his party will contest both the seats this time. Senior RJD leader Bhola Yadav, who is also a close aide of party chief Lalu Prasad, backed Birendra statement. Bhola said the RJD workers had been working extensively in both the constituencies and his party would win them for sure. “Though Congress had got Kusheshwar Asthan during seat distribution, it has been always losing this seat. They should understand the importance of the bypoll as it will lead to change of government in the state,” he told TOI. Another RJD leader said after winning the two seats, either HAM(S) or VIP can change the arithmetic in Bihar assembly. “Both are frequent flyers,” he added. However, Congress is in no mood to relent. Congress Legislative Party leader Ajit Sharma said the distribution of seats had already been done last year and raising such issues was useless. “Our candidate Ashok Kumar is a Dalit face and lost by a margin of just around 7,000 votes. This is very much our seat and we will field our candidate. As far as the RJD is concerned, even their candidate had lost Tarapur, but we are not claiming that seat,” Sharma said. When asked what will happen if RJD does not let Congress contest the Kusheshwar Asthan seat, Sharma replied, “What is the meaning of alliance then. Also, RJD cannot take the final decision on our seats. Our party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will take the final call.” Meanwhile, Darbhanga DM Thyagrajan SM on Tuesday said the notification for the Kusheshwar Asthan bypoll will be issued on October 1 and the nomination process will begin the same day. Polling will take place on October 30 on 264 booths. Counting of votes will take place on November 2, he said. There are 2,54,999 voters in the constituency, including 1,34,072 males and 1,20,96 females.

Although a sizeable number of devotees are coming to perform ‘pindadaan’ rituals during the ongoing Pitripaksha in Gaya, it has not been able to boost business prospect. Vendors dealing in ‘pindadaan’- related items are still awaiting for customers. In normal times, the congregation of devotees has spiritual and financial aspect both as it helps to boost Gaya’s economy. In fact, Pitripaksh comes as an opportunity to make handsome earnings for a large number of people engaged in selling materials to be used in the rituals, for hoteliers, guest house and the commercial vehicle owners and Gayawal pandas. What they earn during Pitripaksha, becomes a source of their livelihood throughout the year for their family. During Pitripaksha, all hotels and guest houses in Gaya and Bodh Gaya are booked to their capacity. However, the scenario is different this year owing to the pandemic. Bodh Gaya-based Nagrik Vikas Manch president Suresh Singh said, “There is some relief to small hotels and the guest houses in Bodh Gaya. Nevertheless, all rooms are not booked. Big hotels are still awaiting customers. Because of high tarrif, everyone cannot afford to stay in big hotels.” Apart from this, the devotees used to buy utensils and other ‘dana’ (donation) related items like bed sheets, clothes, sarees etc from local market. Manish Kumar, a utensil shop owner near Vishnupad temple said, “Since last year, our earnings have been badly affected. There is hardly any buyer.” Another shopkeeper Satish Gurda too echoed similar views. However, autorickshaw and e-rickshaw drivers are are getting passengers. Even small eateries and vendors selling vegetables, milk and other edible items too have customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-traders-pandas-stare-at-losses/articleshow/86592023.cms||---

The case relates to Sebi rule violations by these entities between April and September 2017. Each of the entities have been fined Rs 25 lakh. Interestingly, the Sebi order showed that despite sending several notices, Dhoot neither replied to them nor appeared before the regulator’s adjudication officer for the case. Dhoot, the main promoter of the company, was also the chairman & MD. The other two entities named in the order are Videocon Realty & Infrastructures, and Electroparts (India), formerly Shree Dhoot Trading & Agencies. “Noticees being insiders had executed off-market transactions while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI),” Sebi said in the order. During the period of investigation by Sebi, Dena Bank, one of the lenders to Videocon, had classified its loans to the company as a non-performing asset (NPA), which in turn was expected to have a negative impact on Videocon’s stock price. Hence, this was considered an UPSI. During this period, the two promoter entities had pledged their holdings in Videocon and also transferred some shares through off market deals. Dhoot, also an insider, had traded in Videocon shares, either directly or on behalf of the two companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dhoot-2-others-fined-in-insider-trading-case/articleshow/86592475.cms||---
---||Business||Sebi makes it easier to delist companies after acquiring over 75%||MUMBAI: The board of markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday made it easier for an acquirer to delist a company after buying 75% or more in it and made the process seamless. At present, an acquirer has to first buy 75% and then undertake a reverse book-building process to delist the company. At the same time, to protect interests of minority shareholders, Sebi said that if the acquirer wants to delist a company, it has to be at a higher price to the open offer price. The regulator’s board also gave its nod for setting up social stock exchanges, aimed at making fund-raising easier for social enterprises. Additionally, it changed rules for holders of shares with superior voting rights, which is expected to make it easier for new age companies to get listed. Under the current process to delist a company, if an acquirer takes a majority ownership in a company through an open offer and has a stake of over 75% in the company, the acquirer has to first bring this down to 75% level. Only after that it could go for a reverse book-building to decide on the delisting price. This, on the one hand, takes a lot of time. On the other, if the price discovered through the reverse book-building process is too high, that could make the delisting process unviable. “Such directionally contradictory transactions in a sequence pose complexity in the takeover of listed companies, especially where the acquirer desires to get the company delisted pursuant to his takeover,” the Sebi release said. The revised framework aims to make M&A transactions for listed companies a more rational and convenient exercise, balancing the interests of all investors in the process, it said. If an acquirer wants to delist the target company, he has to “propose a higher price for delisting”, which is higher than the open offer price. “If the response to the open offer leads to the delisting threshold of 90% being met, all shareholders who tender their shares shall be paid the same delisting price and, if the response to the offer leads to the delisting threshold of 90% not being met, all shareholders who tender their shares shall be paid the same takeover price,” Sebi said. If after the open offer the acquirer crosses 75% holding level, it would get one more year to try to delist the company. Vikram Raghani, partner at corporate law firm J Sagar & Associates, said first-time acquirers can now attempt delisting by offering what they believe is a commercially reasonable price without having to worry about an exorbitant price thrown up by the reverse book-building method. “With increasing shareholder activism and sound guidance provided to minority shareholders on the reasonableness of the price offered, this should be an attractive proposition for public M&A,” Raghani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-makes-it-easier-to-delist-cos-after-acquiring-over-75/articleshow/86592457.cms||---

The tax payers’ association moved the high court challenging the new property tax regime in which tax is levied based on the capital value of the property instead of annual rental income. The government recently issued GO 198 to bring in the new property tax and vacant land tax regime in urban local bodies. Advocate Sunkara Rajendra Prasad, arguing on behalf of the petitioners, told the bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the amended Andhra Pradesh Municipal Act was in violation of constitutional and democratic principles. He also contended the process of rolling out the new tax regime without giving an opportunity to people to submit their grievances. As the objections were called amid the Covid-19 pandemic, many people were hesitant to go to the municipalities to submit their grievances, he said, adding that though representations were given to provide alternative platforms like online submission of objections, the officials did not consider the requests. The government pleader for municipal administration, G Shivaji, argued that the state government brought the amendment in line with the recommendations of the Union government, which has proposed to have a uniform tax policy across the country and issued guidelines for the same. The state government only followed the recommendations, he said. Considering all the arguments, the high court issued notices to the state government to file counter affidavits in the petition and posted the matter for further hearing after eight weeks.

While the commercial launch of the TataNeu is still some months away as several pieces are yet to fall in place, the group will open up the platform only for use among its employees. The conglomerate wants to tap its huge workforce of over 7 lakh people, a ready user base, for the super app pilot study. A super app — the term was coined by Blackberry founder Mike Lazaridis in 2010 — is many apps within an umbrella app. While some group apps like BigBasket, 1MG, Taj, Croma and AirAsia have boarded TataNeu, its other apps like Titan, Tanishq, Cliq and Starbucks are yet to get onto it. The move comes in the wake of the government proposing tough e-commerce rules. TataNeu will have a new loyalty programme where customers can earn points redeemable for any other buys made on the platform. While the Tata Group is the first to get the ball rolling on a super app, a Bank of America report released in August said, “India has the potential to have 3-4 super apps”.

The association stated that the online registration form on the Goa Online portal uses the word “handicapped”, which is banned by the central and state government, and also has many disabilities which are not considered disabilities under The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. In letters also forwarded to the labour secretary and the director of social welfare, the association stated that it has been receiving complaints from persons with disabilities who are receiving call letters from government departments for posts which are neither suitable nor reserved for their disability, thereby causing great inconvenience to them. “The employment card registration form on the Goa Online portal has an option of below 40% disability for whom reservation under the act is not mandated,” DRAG president Avelino de Sa stated. The association has asked that their grievances be resolved within 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/employment-cards-lack-info-on-disabilities/articleshow/86592578.cms||---

KPCC chief K Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan were supposed to reach New Delhi on Wednesday for discussions on the subject. The visit was postponed due to the visit of Rahul Gandhi to Kerala on Wednesday. Also, AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar will be away from New Delhi and return only on October 2. Since the assembly session is beginning here on October 4, the leaders have decided to visit New Delhi only in the second week of October. “This discussion was scheduled earlier itself as we had set a deadline of September 30 to finalize the KPCC executive committee. However, the visit has been postponed and we will be able to make it only in between the assembly session,” said the opposition leader. The discussion was scheduled to finalize the new officers for KPCC executive committee which includes vice-presidents, general secretaries and secretaries. KPCC leadership already had discussions with all senior leaders in the state and had also met the group leaders too to get their views. It is learnt that the group leaders have submitted a list of their nominees for several posts to the KPCC president. Sudhakaran and Satheesan had a meeting with former chief minister Oommen Chandy and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala to know their choices in these posts. It has to be remembered that these two leaders had stayed away and protested against the state party leadership when the district Congress committee presidents were finalized. Ramesh and Chandy had alleged that they were ‘left in the dark while finalising the names’. However, there are also reports that AICC will schedule talks with the state leadership on the present situation in Kerala. The high-command is likely to suggest certain remedial measures to pacify the disgruntled leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-leaders-defer-delhi-visit-rahul-in-state-today/articleshow/86592603.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Make PM Modi your model, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath to panchayat chiefs||LUCKNOW: Upholding Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a model whom they should emulate, chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked the newly elected zila panchayat chairpersons in the state to ensure that benefits of government schemes reached people. “In his first address after becoming PM, Modiji said that he was the PM of the country and it was his duty to ensure that people of India are given respect on an international platform. His schemes are not based on caste, class, language, state, etc, but are meant for the poor, farmer, youth and women. Learn from Modiji. He has changed the face of the country and shown how each scheme can be used to change the people’s life. We can become his soldiers,” the CM said while addressing a training programme for the chairpersons on Tuesday. Calling them the backbone of the three-tier panchayat system, the CM said that chairpersons should prioritise works and understand that it was not possible to please everyone at the same time. He asked them to focus on cow shelters and cow-based farming which he said would eliminate diseases like cancer in a few years, the one district-one product scheme and the soon to be launched matrabhumi scheme. w“It is good that 56% of zila panchayat chairpersons are women. They come with their own experience of running a home and family and there can be no better manager than one who handles a home,” the CM said, adding that a person who believes he knows everything is likely to fail and that regular training should be a part of one’s learning. Asking them to make themselves aware of good models of governance in the country, the CM said that projects should be priorities and a plan should be made to implement them in a time-bound manner. “It is not important that you are given all powers but what you do with the power you already have. Now people get benefits of government schemes without having to bribe or beg,” he said. Ex gratia to farmers hit by crop damage:Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to immediately assess the damage to crops due to rain and floods so that farmers can be given compensation at the earliest. On Tuesday, he directed officials to also identify those farmers who may have lost their homes to rain or floods and also provide them with compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/make-modi-your-model-yogi-to-panchayat-chiefs/articleshow/86593253.cms||---

We must tell our own stories,” said Nair during the online convocation of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII). Three hundred students from the 2008 to 2019 batches were awarded postgraduate diplomas and certificates, according to a statement issued by FTII. FTII chairman Shekhar Kapur, who has not been able to visit the campus since his appointment last year due to the pandemic, spoke about the changes he sees in cinema and storytelling ahead. “Cinema is becoming much more global. Mira Nair is someone who has broken the traditional norms of eastern and western cinema. I would like to see more technology in storytelling, not just in cinema, but also in gaming,” said Kapur. In her address, Nair reminisced about her education in film and theatre in India and overseas, including radical, political theatre from Badal Sircar. She spoke about the need to have “fluid and porous” borders and bridges for more stories to be told. Nair also spoke about ‘Mississippi Masala’, one of her most acclaimed films, which will be re-released in the United States on the 30th anniversary of its initial release. “Never treat what you do as just a stepping stone. Let the heart inform the brain, and allow inspiration to come from any quarter. Be brave,” were her profound words of advice for the new graduates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/must-tell-our-own-stories-says-mira-nair-at-ftii-convocation/articleshow/86591428.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Fraudsters made fake SPPU certificates for 45 youths||Pune: An analysis of the computer’s hard disc recovered from the three men held on the charge of peddling bogus marksheets and degree certificates of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), shows that they had prepared such documents for 45 youngsters from Jejuri and the adjoining villages. Pune rural police have also seized six marksheets and degree certificates from them. “The suspects were running the racket for the last seven years and had provided fake and fabricated marksheets and degree certificates to youngsters by charging them Rs45,000 to Rs50,000 each. The certificates were used to get employment in small private companies, further studies, and to secure voting rights in the graduate constituencies,” inspector Ashok Shelke of local crime branch of Pune rural police said. The LCB on Monday arrested Ganesh Sampat Javale, Manoj Dhumal and Vaibhav Lonkar, all residents of Jejuri, after receiving a tip-off. A case against them has been registered with the Jejuri police. According to the police, Javale works as an agent and secures admission for local youngsters in various colleges. Dhumal runs a printing press at Veer and Javale used to take the youngsters to him for fake certificates. Lonkar also used the same method. “We seized a computer and printer and six sets of marksheets and degree certificates,” Shelke said. The persons who ‘failed’ in the examinations were shown as ‘pass’ and in some cases the marks were enhanced to secure admission in professional courses. “We have decided to write to the SPPU and other colleges to verify these documents for investigations,” Shelke added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudsters-made-fake-sppu-certificates-for-45-youths/articleshow/86591447.cms||---

Gakuved (Gawada Kunbi Velip Dhangar Federation), which called a meeting on Sunday, alleged that the government has failed to issue sanads to 300 cultivators of kumeri lands. Deputy collector (north) Ajay Gaude, director of Sports Authority of Goa Shankar Gaonkar, director of art and culture Sagun Velip were present at the meeting that was held at the Gaondogrem panchayat. The federation also constituted a five-member committee of senior lawyers to study the matter.

---||Pune||Focus on ventilation, vax in norms for multiplexes||Pune: Though detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for multiplexes in Maharashtra have yet to be finalized, a senior Covid-19 task force member on Tuesday said their focus would be on ventilation and full vaccination of employees at multiplexes. “The SOPs will contain special measures on preventing the spread of infection at multiplexes, where crowding and unmasking are likely. A special protocol has also been suggested for visitors to be unmasked, such as while eating. All potential points of Covid transmission are being considered critically. The SOPs are being prepared in coordination with owners of multiplexes and the state Covid-19 task force,” the member said. The task force suggested proper ventilation with constant air change and reducing air recirculation in multiplexes. “Movie halls will allow patrons at only 50% of the seating capacity. Seats that are not to be occupied would be taped or crossed out,” he said. Other measures being considered include staggered timings for entry and exits before and after a show. “For better ventilation, more exhaust and table fans will have to be placed in cinema halls. If these measures are in place, air-conditioning at a specific temperature inside the theatre may be possible,” the member said. All employees must be double vaccinated, though the full vaccination pre-condition for visitors is still being discussed. “However, since several cinema halls are inside malls, visitors to these places must be fully vaccinated,” he said. A senior public health department official told TOI that the SOPs will be announced in a day or two. “The task force is currently reviewing the SOPs. Once the task force clears them, the SOPs will be published,” the official said. The official said that the full vaccination pre-condition for management and employees of any establishment is part of the latest unlock guidelines. The official further said that some technical issues on crowd management, which may crop up at entry and exit points in multiplexes, are currently being ironed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-ventilation-vax-in-norms-for-multiplexes/articleshow/86591443.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||Covid-19: 10 infections in 14 days can lead to closure of school in Maharashtra||PUNE: The state paediatric task force has suggested a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for systematic closure of schools in the event of Covid cases on premises to avoid undue panic and knee-jerk reactions. The suggestions of the task force come amid activities to physically reopen schools from October 4. “School closure should be advised when the positive cases among students, teachers and non-teaching staffers of an institute go above 5 % of the total pupil strength in a 14-day period or 10 positive Covid cases get detected on school premises in a 14-day period,” task force member and senior paediatrician Pramod Jog told TOI. For less than the stipulated positive cases, a student, teacher or non-teaching staff testing positive should be quarantined for 14 days either at home or at hospital, depending on the severity of illness. The rest of the children and staffers, coming in contact with an infected child or adult, should be closely monitored for symptoms and tested if the symptoms developed, state the task force guidelines. The task force has also clarified what SOPs to be followed if Covid infection gets detected in a student or a school staff’s family members. “If any family member of a child or teacher is positive, then that student or the teacher should not be allowed to come to school for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period,” Jog said. “The teachers should properly wear masks and all the time in the class and staff room. They should eat their lunch separately — spaced apart from the others as recommended also for the students,” he said. Paediatricians across the state had urged the Maharashtra government to physically reopen schools on account of behavioural issues being exhibited by children following months of staying at home during the pandemic. Sanjay Bafna, paediatrician and former president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Pune branch, said, “These guidelines will help a school administration initiate appropriate steps and preclude fear and panic situations.” For the reopening of schools, the paediatric task force has suggestedSOPs that include staggering school hours, school days and lunchtime, re-organizingclassrooms to allow spacing among children, re-designing school premises to prevent transmission and setting up “school health clinic” run by a trained nurse-aide appointed by the institute or a volunteer or trained teacher or doctor-parent. Last week, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray gave the green signal to reopen schools across the state, with the SOPs, from October 4. Physical classes will resume from October 4 for classes V-XII in the rural belt and classes VII-XI12 in the urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-infections-in-14-days-can-lead-to-closure-of-school/articleshow/86591430.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Raipur||Kids snatched at 15 comprise 70% of Naxal cadre: Survey||RAIPUR: Over 70% Maoist cadres are forcibly recruited as children without the consent of their parents. They are mostly roped in at 15 and given a gun at 17, says a ‘survey’ conducted by Bastar police among surrendered Maoists. The ‘recruited’ kids are not allowed to go home for years, some never, not even if any of their parents dies, say police. What’s more, a shocking 25% of them end up getting forcibly sterilised in youth, says the survey. Asked for her comment on the police findings, Bastar rights activist Bela Bhatia told TOI: “Children should not be used as soldiers. I would welcome similar surveys by independent agencies.” The survey report makes for a disturbing read. The perception was that Maoists put kids only in the ‘Bal Sangham’ and don’t give them weapons till they are 18, but the surrendered Maoists, including some senior cadres, have revealed that this is far from true, say police. “Most of us didn’t join the Maoists of our own will. We were forced,” the Maoists told police. The survey was conducted among 41 Maoists who had surrendered in Dantewada between 2013 and 2021, and had bounties of Rs 5 lakh or higher. Police officers interviewed them for over a month and got them to fill up a 10-point questionnaire before they came up with this data. “At the age of 17 when they should be studying, they were given guns and told to carry out attacks. By the age of 20, they were handling automatic weapons,” the report says. Dantewada SP Abhishek Pallava said: “The survey results will be used to spread awareness among the locals in ‘recruitment hotspot’ villages of Dantewada district so that they don’t join the Maoists. Police will tell villagers that Maoists are not revolutionaries. There are people who were taken by Maoists as children and never returned, nor do their parents know about their fate or whereabouts. Villagers should know about the dark side of ‘holding weapons and becoming powerful’.” There are 12 Maoists ‘recruitment hotspots’ identified by police — villages from where at least 10 cadres have joined PLGA. The surrendered cadres shared heart-breaking stories of the hardship and pain they underwent as children in an insurgent outfit. They were banned from visiting home or meeting parents for years. They weren’t allowed to go home even if a parent died, not to speak of visiting families for festivals. At least 25% said they never saw their parents after being taken away by Maoists, and 30% could meet their families once every five years. To add to this, they saw severe discrimination in the Maoists ranks between ‘Telugu cadres’ and Chhattisgarh tribals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/kids-snatched-at-15-comprise-70-of-naxal-cadre-survey/articleshow/86593994.cms||Rashmi Drolia

The Kisan Congress leader found fault with industries and IT minister K T Rama Rao for making several claims in the assembly on Monday in the absence of Congress members. “Before the formation of Telangana, there were Bharat Bio-Tech, IDPL, Reddy’s Labs and other firms in and around Hyderabad. In fact, the pharma industry took birth in the state even before KTR was born,” Kodanda Reddy said. Stating that Hyderabad was known as pharma-hub in the undivided state because of the pro-industry policies implemented by successive Congress governments, he alleged that the TRS government has so far acquired 6,000 acres of land for pharma city project as against its target of over 19,000 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-acquiring-land-of-scs-congress/articleshow/86592604.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||BJP seeks public feedback on Uttar Pradesh & Central government welfare schemes||LUCKNOW: The BJP has started the process of seeking feedback vis-a-vis implementation of policies and welfare schemes of the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath government in UP directly from the people -- in a significant political move that could potentially allow the saffron outfit to plug loopholes, if any, while taking on a belligerent opposition in the run up to UP assembly elections due in the next few months. Confirming the development, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that the party functionaries, who are carrying out a door to door campaign, have also been asked to put up a report card of the Modi and Yogi Government before the people and take feedback. "In case people face problems in getting benefits of the policies and schemes or have some suggestions, they can contact their respective booth president or divisional president. Their problems and suggestions will be taken up by the party and the state government earnestly," Singh told TOI on Tuesday. The exercise has been taken up in all 1.63 lakh polling booths since September 26 and will go on till October 2. The UP BJP chief, himself, has campaigned in Lucknow and Gorakhpur, the political backyard of CM Yogi. The measure also falls in line with the ambitious `Booth Vijay Abhiyan' launched by the BJP national president JP Nadda just over two weeks ago on September 11. The move is seen as BJP's aggressive bid to diffuse the probable anti-incumbency which may have gained ground amid an assertive opposition looking up at all possible opportunities to put the ruling party on the mat. BJP sources said that the party leadership desperately seeks to "gain confidence" of the people while projecting the welfare schemes initiated for different communities, including farmers who are staging a stir -- ostensibly in the west UP -- against the three new farm laws. Experts said that the BJP seeks to harp on the popularity of PM Modi while projecting Yogi as the key leader who will spearhead the party's electoral campaign in the forthcoming state polls. Yogi, as a matter of fact, has already hit the press button by visiting various districts to lay foundation stones of developmental projects and holding review meetings with the district authorities. He is expected to step up the campaign in the coming days, sources said. The development also comes close on the heels of the BJP initiating various political measures including cobbling up alliance with smaller outfits like NISHAD party, and firming up its caste equations through the recent expansion of Yogi cabinet and earlier during the rejig in the union cabinet. Sources said that the party seeks to fortify itself electorally through every measure that could counter a bellicose opposition, mainly the two UP regional satraps -- the SP and BSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-seeks-public-feedback-on-govt-welfare-schemes/articleshow/86593263.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Aurangabad||MVA, BJP to lock horns in Deglur byelection||Aurangabad: The Election Commission of India on Tuesday announced the byelection to the Deglur assembly constituency, in the Nanded district of Marathwada, on October 30. Reserved for the scheduled caste (SC) category, the seat has been lying vacant since the death of sitting Congress MLA Raosaheb Antapurkar due to post-Covid complications on April 9. The bypoll will see another contest between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The three-party alliance in power in the state had tasted a surprising defeat in the bypoll held for the Pandharpur assembly seat recently. In the 2019 assembly election, Antapurkar had defeated Subhash Sabne of Shiv Sena by a margin of over 22,000 votes to avenge the loss during the 2014 polls, when he had lost to Sabne by only 8,378 votes. Former cabinet minister and BJP leader Babanraol Lonikar, who has been appointed the in-charge by the party for the Degular assembly seat bypoll, said the MVA government would again face defeat. “The public at large is highly disappointed with the ruling parties due to the discord between the MVA partners. Whether it is the handling of the Covid situation or extending a helping hand to the rain-affected farmers, the state government has failed. The failure will reflect in the upcoming poll,” he said. Lonikar said around 13 candidates have been short-listed for candidature from the Deglur seat and the party’s top brass will reveal the final name shortly. Lonikar parried queries on whether the BJP was wooing Sabne, who earlier represented Degular. Congress is still undecided about the candidate even though the name of Antapurkar’s son Jitesh is doing the rounds. Regional party leaders expressed confidence that the Congress would retain the seat. “Antapurkar had a huge following in the Nanded district and the sympathy of voters will definitely be with us during the upcoming bypoll. Barring a few cases here and there, Nanded district has remained the bastion of the Congress and the same will be proven again in the by-poll for the Deglur seat,” state Congress functionary Jitendra Dehade said. As per official schedule, the last date for filing nomination for the Deglur assembly seat is October 8, whereas withdrawal is allowed till October 13. While the polling is scheduled on October 30, the counting of votes will take place on November 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mva-bjp-to-lock-horns-in-deglur-byelection/articleshow/86589619.cms||Prasad Joshi

The bookings opened on Tuesday after preparations in this regard were completed by the Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA). Of the nine firms that provide chopper services to the Himalayan shrine, four will not be in operation this year. Chief executive officer of UCADA, Swati Bhadoria, told TOI, “Ticket booking started on Tuesday. The Covid protocol and high court directives would be followed.” The Char Dham yatra was opened for pilgrims on September 18 after the high court lifted its three-month stay on the pilgrimage. The HC has allowed 800 pilgrims daily for Kedarnath, 600 pilgrims for Gangotri, 400 for Yamunotri and 1,000 for Badrinath. At full capacity, 2,800 devotees can offer prayers in the four shrines on a given day. Until September 28, a total of 22,844 pilgrims had paid obeisance to the four shrines. The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board has issued 69,619 e-passes for pilgrims until October 15.

---||Ahmedabad||12-ft sinkhole swallows rickshaw in Sarkhej||Ahmedabad: Sinkholes under that can swallow you up are the stuff of nightmares. They can eat up anything, regardless of size, and can cause serious injuries. At 7am on Tuesday, one sinkhole gobbled up an autorickshaw near Amber Tower on the Sarkhej–Juhapura road. Sandeep Desai, 30, the driver, said he was lucky to escape with minor injuries, and cannot forget the feeling of the ground beneath him vanishing. Shopkeepers from nearby ran to the hole and pulled Desai out. His autorickshaw looked like a crushed tin can. Such sudden cave-ins are turning regular in the city, putting commuters’ lives at risk. Images of the June 2015 incident, when a 40-year-old scooterist, Viraat Vantani, fell into a 25-foot deep sinkhole at the Mithakhali underpass come back to haunt us. The pits: This sinkhole gobbled up an autorickshaw near Amber Tower on the Sarkhej–Juhapura roadAccording to a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official a portion of the 2.2m diameter drainage line passing underneath the Juhapura road — which was several decades old — was leaking and the run-off was washing away earth below it. “The soil above the line then caved in,” said the official. He said that five major cave-ins are currently being repaired in the city. Since 2013, the AMC has recorded more than 500 incidents of roads caving in in the city. Many of these cave-ins were repaired but sank again in the next monsoon. AMC officials blame this problem on old drainage lines and shoddy work by contractors. “Apart from Ambar Tower in Sarkhej, two cave-ins have been barricaded near the Torrent sub-station in Vejalpur, one is being filled in Bapunagar, another has been reported in Gota,” he said. The AMC official said that the one that swallowed Desai was a new cave-in, but there are many roads where repeated cave-ins are reported. “Over the years, we have seen repeated cave-ins on the roads between Sahjanand College and University, Vasna and Paldi and Chandranagar. Around 42km of sewers have been identified which are more than four decades old and need to be replaced. The AMC decided to install a new sewage line with HDPE (high-density polyethylene) coating to control damage due to corrosive gases and chemicals,” he said and added that trenchless technology is being used and it will also help reduce road cave-ins. He added that many repeat cave-ins are the result of poor filling of earth by contractors. “We know that there have been instances of cave-ins due to shoddy repairs. We will take stern action against contractors where we find that the cave-ins were not caused by leaks in the drainage system,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/12-ft-sinkhole-swallows-rickshaw-in-sarkhej/articleshow/86591520.cms||---

The initiative — jointly held by the Pimpri Chinchwad police and the Pimpri Chinchwad Cooperative Housing Society Federation across Omega Tower Chowk and on the premises of different housing societies. ‘Morning Walk with Police’ will be a weekly occurrence — from 6am on Tuesday. The initiative came about after members of the federation raised concerns about citizens’ safety. The office of the assistant commissioner of police (Wakad) agreed to organize an interaction with residents. The federation’s chairperson Tejaswini Dhomse said, “Last week’s attack was not an isolated incident; it was just the tipping point. ‘Morning Walk with Police’ has been devised to address this issue.” Dhomse said the initiative will soon be rolled out in Pimple Saudagar, Hinjewadi, and Rahatni to raise awareness about citizens’ safety. “In the past few days, there were cases of gold chain and mobile phone snatching in the area. We studied the crime pattern and decided to deal it with ‘Morning Walk with Police’,” ACP (Wakad) Shrikant Disale told TOI. Disale said police have identified the routes where crimes occur and took a morning walk with people there. “This early morning ‘patrol’ by police and people will prove useful in controlling street crime,” he said. He said people can interact with the officers and give suggestions, adding that he would participate every Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-launch-morning-walk-initiative-in-wakad-to-raise-awareness-on-safety/articleshow/86591461.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Maharashtra: SDRF fund allocation for kin of Covid-19 victims||PUNE: Principal secretary relief and rehabilitation Aseem Gupta said on Tuesday that Maharashtra would finalise the total allocation of funds under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for ex-gratia assistance to the kin of Covid-19 victims as per the Union government guidelines. “The SDRF state executive committee meeting will finalise the methodology as per the Union government guidelines. We will finalise it soon so that it can be executed by all collectors,” he told TOI. The National Disaster Management Authority has recommended that Rs 50,000 be given to the kin of those who died of Covid-19. This will also apply to those involved in Covid-19 relief operations or activities associated with the preparedness for dealing with the pandemic. He said that the funds allocation for disbursing the amount would be decided at the meeting. “The Centre has sent a guideline. We will go through it and then draw an estimate as some conditions have been stipulated by them,” he added. The Centre has said that the ex-gratia assistance would be provided by the state from the SDRF. The concerned families need to submit their claims through forms issued by the state authorities along with specific documents certifying the cause of death. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of the required documents, and disbursed through the Aadhaar-linked direct benefit transfer procedures. Some states have announced compensation for families who have lost members to Covid. These include Bihar (Rs4lakh per family), Madhya Pradesh (Rs1lakh), and Delhi (Rs50,000).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sdrf-fund-allocation-for-kin-of-covid-19-victims/articleshow/86591460.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ahmedabad||First sparks: In Dhaman, old monitor||Ahmedabad: The inquiry commission pointed out that the fire in the ICU at Uday Shivanand hospital in Rajkot was ignited in a Dhaman ventilator, an indigenous device much promoted by the state government. Citing witnesses, police the chargesheet and the statement of the chief fire officer of Rajkot, the commission said that the first spark occurred in a thermos sensor located in hard flexible transparent pipe that is attached to the face mask/HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) of the patient in Bed No. 103 resulting in the pipe, which was carrying oxygen to the patient, catching fire. As a result, the patient’s hair caught fire. The machine attached to the patient was a Dhaman. Mahesh Kunvariya, the person who tried to douse the fire with a blanket, could not manage to do so. He said, “Soon there occured a second blast in the machine, resulting in the spreading of the fire,” the report quotes Kunvariya. However, the commission said that since Dhaman was not bought from the manufacturer, but was donated, the hospital management would not be in a position to take legal action against the manufacturer, even if a particular piece of equipment or any of its component was found to be defective or of sub-standard quality. The responsibility for the accident would ultimately rest on the shoulders of the hospital management, which was “definitely negligent”. For the cause of the fire at Shrey Hospital, contradictory statements by FSL officers left the picture unclear, particularly in the absence of CCTV footage of the ICU because the view was blocked by a curtain. The starting of the fire has been attributed to a fault in a patient monitor between Beds 8 and 9. The probe panel said the life of such a monitor is between two and five years. These machines had been bought in 2003-04 and were in use since then. Merely having them serviced or changing defective components was not enough. “To keep using medical equipment year after year for a period of more than 15 years, which is three times the normal effective life of such equipment, is an invitation to disaster,” the report reads. For the Shrey hospital tragedy, the commission held hospital trustee Bharat Mahant as solely responsible because the ICU windows were screwed on and smoke could not go out, there were no smoke detectors, no fire alarm system and no automatic sprinklers installed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-sparks-in-dhaman-old-monitor/articleshow/86591459.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents receive training in CPR and other basic life-saving skills||Pune: Some city-based NGOs and hospitals have been training members of various communities on cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and basic life-saving skills. A project ‘Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation for Everyone (iCARE)’ by Revive Heart Foundation & Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, has been extended to Pune and it includes workshops on CPR and basic life-saving skills for students above the age of 15, teachers and parents. “Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is one of the major causes of deaths in India. To save the victims of SCA from being clinically brain dead, timely CPR needs to be started as soon as possible. These workshops have been conducted in city schools such as St Mary’s, The Kalyani School, and some of the Symbiosis campuses. We’ve conducted workshops with the Pimpri Chinchwad police too,” a campaign volunteer Kinjal Goyal, said on Tuesday, which was the eve of World Heart Day. Aaryan Shukla, a student (17) who participated in a workshop with his peers, said, “ We’ve seen actors perform CPR in films and television, but there is a lot more to learn to do it correctly. Having this basic knowledge can be helpful.” Lokmanya Hospitals initiated first aid, CPR and basic life support training programme for people from all walks of life. Shrikrishna Joshi, vice-president of Lokmanya Hospitals, said, “Medical emergencies can strike anytime, anywhere. In most road accident cases, medical assistance is not immediately available. When basic life support techniques are implemented quickly, the chance of survival is doubled. We have set a target to train 1 lakh people in the city in CPR and basic life-saving skills, so they can be first responders to any emergency situations and help out till professional medical help arrives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-receive-training-in-cpr-and-other-basic-life-saving-skills/articleshow/86591476.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

In the last 18 months, seven people were killed in wild elephant attacks and the latest victim was a tribal woman in Sambarcode tribal hamlet, located close to Agali town. Another tribeswoman, Lakshmi (49) of Nallasingha tribal hamlet of Sholayur, was admitted at Kottathara tribal specialty hospital on Monday. She was injured after a wild tusker attacked her when she was sleeping in the veranda of her house. Her husband Rangan escaped unhurt. In Pudur grama panchayat, wild elephants destroyed crops on Monday. A car was also damaged by the animals. We tried to scare the wild elephants and they tried to attack us, said the tribespeople. Because of the wild elephant menace, people are not able to go out, especially at night. Because of this scare, the distribution of milk and newspapers early in the morning are affected in many parts of Attapadi. Though solar fencing and trenches were constructed in forest areas to prevent wild elephants from straying into human habitats, they were damaged due to the absence of maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/people-of-attapadi-living-in-fear-of-wild-elephants/articleshow/86592628.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Long work hours, stress attacking young hearts: PGI doc||During the Covid surge, most of the fatalities involved had diabetes and heart disease as risk factors. On World Heart Day, Shimona Kanwar speaks to Prof Rajesh Vijayvergia of the department of cardiology, PGI. He emphasises the need for follow-ups after Covid recovery as inflammation can continue. How does Covid affect the heart, from clots, thrombosis, inflammation, pulmonary embolism and sudden heart attacks – why is screening every six months essential?Although Covid predominantly affects the lungs, it can affect the heart and can cause damage. Myocardial infarction or heart attack in common term occurs due to blockage in blood vessels supplying the heart. They have been observed to be slightly higher in patients with Covid. The symptoms are similar, including pain in chest and jaw, difficulty in breathing etc and one needs to get appropriate tests done at the earliest in case someone develops these symptoms. Covid infection has been known to increase the formation of clots in various blood vessels. Formation of clots in blood vessels supplying the heart or lungs leads to reduced blood flow to these organs. This lack of blood supply or the hemodynamic changes related to blocked arteries leads to dysfunction of the heart. Covid can even directly damage heart muscles, causing dysfunction. The state of systemic inflammation can continue in patients who have recovered from Covid infection. Hence, screening should be done for cardiac disease if the patient continues to have or develops new symptoms of palpitations, chest pain or shortness of breath. Once detected to have heart disease, it is recommended to have regular follow up at intervals advised by the cardiologist. How have lifestyle factors resulted in a larger number of young people in India suffering from heart attacks?Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in India and its contribution to mortality is rising. Sedentary lifestyles have been associated with at least a 1.5 fold elevation in CVD risk. The nature of work is gradually shifting to less physical ones due to economic changes and increased mechanisation. The recent pandemic has also forced large proportions of working populations indoors, worsening the situation. Additionally, the number of people working for long hours is increasing and it is estimated that at least 9% of the total population globally works for long hours. The prevalence has been increasing since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, as teleworking has become the norm in many industries, often blurring the boundaries between home and work. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and overall cardiovascular risk. What can be done to prevent poor heart health?There are multiple aspects involved in maintaining good health. Starting from adopting a healthy lifestyle (diet, physical activity and mental health), timely identification of warning features, seeking health care appropriately and following the instructions of a healthcare provider. Once a person becomes aware of certain diseases like hypertension, diabetes or heart disease, appropriate care in the form of self-monitoring and strict adherence to necessary health advice are paramount. How have post-pandemic cardiovascular ailments affected India's NCD Index?As Covid-19 cases continue to appear worldwide, it is difficult to conclude that the pandemic is over. Cardiovascular risk factors like obesity, hypertension and diabetes continue to increase globally. Has there been any change in patient profile due to the pandemic?During both the first and second waves of the Covid pandemic, there was a decline in admissions for cardiovascular disease. It was believed to be related to care-seeking behaviour rather than a change in incidence. But lately, admissions for emergencies and routine follow-ups are returning to normal volume and the patient profile appears to be similar to pre-pandemic times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/long-work-hours-stress-attacking-young-hearts-pgi-doc/articleshow/86591467.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Consultant poses as ‘CA’, siphons Rs 8 crore service tax||MUMBAI: A tax consultant who posed as a chartered accountant (CA) and siphoned Rs 8 crore of clients under the pretext of paying service taxes of businessman and firms, was arrested by Mumbai Police. The general cheating branch of Economic Offences Wing (EOW) on Friday arrested Kalpesh Shamji Shah (45), a resident of Ghatkopar. Shah was booked under IPC sections for cheating, forgery, breach of trust and under Information Technology Act. He was remanded to police custody till Thursday. Service tax department officials and clients were shocked when it transpired that he was only a tax consultant and was using another CA’s degree and registration number, said investigating officer Jahangir Sayyed. Officials said Shah was since 2012 defrauding tax payers and the service tax department. Recently, superintendent of service tax Mahendra Mogre, while studying the service tax of businessman Prakash Pawar, found something amiss and immediately started a probe. Pawar had paid a Rs 26 lakh to his CA, Shah, to be paid as service tax, but the latter paid only Rs 4.7 lakh; Rs 21.3 lakh was transferred to Shah’s account. They also found a bogus service tax challan issued by Shah. “An inquiry showed he had cheated 50 clients similarly, involving around Rs 8 crore,’’ said joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik. If a client had to pay a service tax of Rs 10 lakh, Shah would take money into his accounts and pay Rs 1-2 lakh; the rest would be transferred to his own account and he would forge the figure on receipts of the service tax department and hand it over to clients. Police said recently the department started online automation, where a receipt is automatically received by PDF. Shah ensured the PDF file of payment was received on his office computer, where he would download it, convert into a Word file, manipulate figures on receipts and send it to clients. Police said he took Rs 8.5 crore from 50 clients, but paid Rs 1.1 crore online and the remaining Rs 7.4 crore went into his own account. Shah was using another CA’s registration number issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, New Delhi. Police recorded the statement of the actual Kalpesh Mahendra Shah, who had got his degree in 2002, and since then was working in the private sector. Police said that on learning that he will be arrested, he moved the sessions court and later Bombay high court for anticipatory bail, which was rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-consultant-poses-as-ca-siphons-rs-8cr-service-tax/articleshow/86593277.cms||Ahmed Ali

BJP called an urgent meeting on Tuesday evening to officially announce the party observers and media in-charge. The party had already finalised its poll strategy at the two-day ‘Chintan Baithak’ held last week. PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra expressed confidence that Congress would emerge victorious in both the seats based on the performance of the Gehlot government. Dhariawad was with BJP and Vallabhnagar was with Congress until the bypolls were necessitated due to the sudden demise of the MLAs. BJP state president Satish Poonia held a marathon meeting with party state general secretary (organisation) Chandrashekar discussing the issues to be highlighted in the polls. “Both the leaders discussed the feedback given by the locals and party workers on the ground. Also, discussed on the potential candidates from both the seats,” said a party source. Both the parties are relying on the tested formula of a sympathy wave. BJP has kept the son of former Dhariawad MLA, Goutam Lal Meena, in the panel considering sympathy votes like the way voters voted for Deepti Maheshwari in Rajsamand, the daughter of Kiran Maheswari. Congress can also follow the same path in Vallabhnagar by fielding the widow of Shaktawat or the brother of the deceased. “Congress doesn’t have many options in Dhariawad. The party might rely on its candidate and one-time MLA Nagraj (2008) who was defeated by Goutam Lal Meena in 2013-2018,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-bjp-take-poll-position-both-may-play-sympathy-card/articleshow/86592616.cms||---

Highlighting various steps taken towards ensuring ease of doing business in these domains, Thackeray said the government has brought down the number of applications and licenses required for setting up a tourism-related business from 70-80 earlier to just 10 now. Similarly, 15 NOC required have been brought down to nine self-certifications, and three-month timelines for issuance of different licenses have been doled out by his ministry. Further, the tourism and hospitality sector has been granted the industry status it wished for, pending since 1999. Thackeray said, “Basic tourism infrastructure is now on the fast track. This week, several major international five- and seven-star hotels have cited interest in setting up shop across various parts of Maharashtra. We will be holding meetings to hear out all stakeholders on improving Maharashtra tourism in coming days.” He added that the opening of the Chippi airport in October will give a major boost to tourism in the Konkan region. The Konkan Divisional Tourism Office was also inaugurated on Monday; the state’s tour guides and trainees, Maharashtra’s Master Chefs, and winners of the World Photography Day competition were felicitated. Celebrations for World Tourism Day (September 27) in the state included opening up of numerous buildings, which bear witness to Mumbai’s history, for tourists. An MoU was reached for heritage walks in premises such as housing the Bombay HC and Mumbai University. The Maharashtra tourism website and mobile app were also unveiled on the same occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-boost-for-tourism-post-pandemic-says-aaditya-thackeray/articleshow/86591470.cms||---

Parshwika Vyas, resident of Suryanayaran Society in Sector-25, said she works as a superintendent for the principal senior civil court judge in the district court in Sector 11. Her husband, Raghuveer Vyas, runs an angadia business in Bopal. Vyas said she has been renovating her house for which construction has been going on for four months. She said a stray dog was sitting on a sand mound in front of her house. “I was trying to shoo the dog away from the sand and threw a stone at it. This did not go down well with my neighbours — Chandansinh Chundawat, his wife Rekha Chundawat and their daughter Himani Chundawat — who picked a fight with me,” she said in the FIR. Vyas said that she told them not to abuse her as she was just trying to shoo away the dog, but they continued abusing her and also uttered a casteist slur. “They threatened her, telling her to leave the house and said that no Dalit would be allowed to stay in the housing society,” she said. They threatened her with dire consequences if she would did not leave the house.

The saffron party surveyors have expressed that the best winning possibility is for Janta Sena chief and former BJP MLA Randhir Singh Bhinder. Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, however, is bitterly opposed to him to an extent that he had called the entry of Bhinder at the cost of his exit from the party. Also, he led the resolution from the BJP Udaipur unit to give tickets to any party worker, they will assure his/her victory. The saffron party has been losing the seat for the past three terms to either Congress candidate Shaktawat (2008 and 2018) or Bhinder (2013) has made the contest for state unit a matter of prestige. In all three polls, Bhinder vertically divides his former party votes leading BJP to stood third in the poll race. “The performance of Bhinder makes him the ultimate choice for the party if they stick to the principle of winnability in selecting candidates,” said a senior party leader. Bhinder’s party had extended support to BJP in the Lok Sabha polls to claim that the party candidate has one side victory from Vallabhnagar. “I quit the party over differences with some leaders. I still enjoy cordial relations with several leaders,” said Bhinder to TOI, while stating that he will contest the polls for sure. Bhinder has called upon the former chief minister Vasundhara Raje at least thrice in the past six months has given rise to the speculation that the former has the backing of the latter for the party’s candidature.

---||Dehradun||Work on 8 hydel projects to get going soon: THDC||Haridwar: In what could be seen as a rickety bridging of troubled waters, authorities have decided to start work on eight new hydel projects in the state soon. Managing director, Tehri hydro development corporation (THDC), RK Bishnoi on Tuesday said the installed capacity of the projects to come up on the Yamuna and other rivers in the Kumaon region, including the Dhauli river, would be 3,000-3,500 MW. He added that the projects on the Ganga, stalled due to the Supreme Court ban on the construction activity following the Kedarnath tragedy in June 2013, would, too, be competed soon. On the designing part, Bishnoi said the THDC would take care of it and won’t involve any third party. Listing details about power generation, he said, “Our capacity to generate power is 382 GW of which 230 GW of power is available. On a given day,192 GW of power is used.” Other projects on which the THDC is working include hydrogen storage and carbon capturing. While hydrogen storage helps store electricity, carbon capturing provides a solution to the problem of carbon emission. Carbon-capturing plants capture carbon, solidify it and put it under ground or dispose it of in some other manner. On September 24, the Tehri dam reservoir touched the 830 m mark. Power and water were generated through the reservoir, proving the fact that there was nothing to worry about, Bishnoi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/work-on-8-hydel-projects-to-get-going-soon-thdc/articleshow/86590517.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

Sources said the renovation of Bungalow No 7 on Hospital Marg is on where the party plans to shift. The state headquarters have been functioning at Chandpole since 1965, but parking has become a major problem. The party had been planning to shift to a new building for a long time but ever since present state president Govind Singh Dotasra took charge, it gained momentum. According to sources, renovation work at the bungalow is on and the party hopes to shift to the new building in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-state-headquarters-to-shift-to-a-new-building/articleshow/86592629.cms||---

On an inspection of the State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC) and Social Media Cell on Tuesday, Sharma reiterated that information about any type of shutdown must be given to consumers. He said extra supply should be made in areas affected by power outages and complaints on social media be disposed of promptly. Sharma said complaints on Facebook and Twitter should be monitored real time and correct information should be given to consumers in response to their complaints. This will increase the confidence of consumers in the working of UPPCL. The minister also inspected the command centre set up at SLDC for intensive monitoring of transmission substations, monitoring of lines and supply systems. He said there should be good coordination with officials of discoms so that consumers of the affected area are informed about any planned power outage in the transmission system at least a day in advance. He directed UPPCL chairman M Devraj to ensure monitoring of supply at his level also. Sharma said the government is promoting solar projects due to which more investors are coming to the state. The minister directed authorities to ensure 100% evacuation of the generated power from solar projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tell-consumers-about-shutdowns-in-advance-min/articleshow/86593274.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Golf enthusiast who was a henchman for gangsters||Jaipur: From Anandpal Singh to Lawrence Bishnoi, city-based golf aficionado Anand Shandaliya is a coveted henchman for the gangsters. Shandaliya was arrested on Sunday for allegedly helping out Bishnoi gang in making threat calls demanding money from a Jawahar Nagar-based builder on September 7. Bishnoi and his aide Sampat Nehra have already been brought to Jaipur on a production warrant for the same case. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said Adarsh Nagar police station had been directed to make a history sheet on Shandaliya. Besides his latest involvement with Bishnoi, Shandaliya’s name first cropped up in the Himmat Singh murder case in Vidhyadhar Nagar back in 2015. He was subsequently arrested in 2017 for being one of the ringleaders of a rape-extortion racket that netted the city’ leading hair transplant doctor. He was sent to Ajmer high-security jail where he warmed up to Lawrence Bishnoi who was lodged in the same prison for a different case. “Shandaliya struck up a rapport with Bishnoi in the prison,” Lamba said. It was around the same time that Shandaliya also met another confidant of Anandpal Singh, identified as Subash Barla, alias Subash Mund. “Shandaliya wanted to forge a partnership with the builder through an MoU (memorandum of understanding). He later passed off the builder’s details to Bishnoi gang who demanded money,” an official said. “Besides gangsters, he also tried to warm up to political bigwigs and hobnobbed with city’s influential men on the golf course. He has been involved in serious cases like arms Act, extortion, forgery etc,” an official claimed. Police said the accused also knew Ajay Yadav (42), a gangster who was killed in Bani Park seven days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/golf-enthusiast-who-was-a-henchman-for-gangsters/articleshow/86592633.cms||---

Real estate agents said this land deal is the biggest ever in the city’s history, and likely to give a push to the realty sector. Known for development of high-rise residential towers in the state’s second capital, managing director of Kukreja Group Shravan Ghanshyamdas Kukreja confirmed his group was the highest bidder in the auction conducted by MSTC Limited. “We received confirmation mail from MSTC Ltd. Reserve price of the land was Rs33.01 crore and we quoted the same price in the online auction. We emerged as successful bidders,” he said. As per the advertisement notice issued by MSTC Ltd, the Air India plot measures 26,997 sq ft (2,509 sq m). Thus, the purchase price comes to Rs12,227.28 per sq ft. The Kukreja Group will need to pay 6% (Rs1.98 crore) of auction value to the state government for execution of sale deed with Air India. Thus, the purchase rate will increase to Rs35 crore, which means a price of Rs12,964.4 per sq ft. One of the oldest real estate agents, Pankaj Roshan, told TOI, “It is the highest-ever deal in the city’s history. None of the deal as yet have surpassed Rs10,000 per sq ft for open land. The deal is a good sign for the city. It will boost the realty market.” As per MSTC’s advertisement notice, 14 properties of Air India located in 10 cities, including the one in the city, were being auctioned. Earlier, the auction was on July 8 and 9 but no bids were received for the land in Nagpur. TOI had on September 10 reported Air India lowered the reserve price by 10% since it could not attract bidders in first round. The latest auction was held on September 23 and 24. Having paid earnest money deposit of Rs66 lakh, Kukreja quoted on September 24 and managed to get the landmark plot of land. Kukreja said, “We procured the land for city’s development. Also, the deal is part of our group’s ongoing efforts to give high-rise towers to the city. We have already planned a benchmark project of the city on this land. It will be the most high-end and premium residential project of the city with 30 floors. With lush green spaces in the vicinity, the project will be a hit,” he said. This will be the 11th project of Kukreja Group in the city. The group has given four high-rise buildings at Civil Lines, Byramji Town and Wardhaman Nagar. The group’s under construction Infinity project is also of 30 floors and 110 meter high, easily the tallest building of the city. A residential project is also under construction at Wardhaman Nagar and a commercial project at Mihan. Popular as office of Indian Airlines for decades, the plot procured by the group is situated right at the square adjacent to Institute of Science. Housing the office of Air India, the single-storey building with red-brick façade was brought into use in 1992. The construction of the building was reportedly started in 1988-89.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/air-india-plot-fetches-citys-highest-ever-price-of-rs12000-per-sq-ft/articleshow/86592631.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Rest and start with three readings — Discard the first reading and take the average of the next two. Newer BP monitors have this system of measuring three times with an average — The device must be calibrated. It can be done at home by taking the BP 5 times. Take average of the automatic device and take manually, the difference should not be more than 5 mm Hg — For diabetics, sit and immediately stand measure for postural hypotension for assessment of autonomic neuropathy — Take BP medicines at night, except a water pill. BP dips at night, which is critical. So cardiac outcomes are better for BP patients when medicines are taken at night — If two medicines are to be taken, they should be consumed after a gap of 12 hours each as BP is controlled with medicines for 12-14 hours —The upper reading of the BP is systolic--indicates volume of blood pumped--amount of pressure in your arteries during the contraction of your heart muscle. While diastolic is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen. Systolic control is important for end organs —Choose one day of the week to monitor BP at multiple times --for instance, for diabetic patients, it is seven times a day||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/how-to-monitor-blood-pressure-at-home/articleshow/86591496.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Pune||Fresh rules offer 300sqft homes in slum rehab projects for dwellers||Pune: New draft rules for promoting slum rehabilitation projects across Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas have got a green signal from the state government. This new policy has offered 300sqft for the slum rehabilitation schemes in PMC and PCMC on the lines of the policy for Mumbai. Height restrictions for the buildings have been cancelled paving way to construct high-rise slum rehabilitation buildings. Deadlines have been set for completing the projects to make sure that SRA projects are not unnecessarily prolonged. Suggestions and objections from the public have been sought now for these draft rules. As per the notice issued by the SRA on Monday, the new drafts will be available for suggestions and objections for the next 30 days, after which a hearing will be carried out and the final draft will be published. Currently, only 269sqft tenements are offered for slums. It will increased by 31sqft per house. It has been a long-pending demand of the slum dwellers. The draft rules state that concession has been offered even for the mandatory consent. As against current 70% approval mandate, 51% consent from the residents will be compulsory, once the new rules are made effective. “We are hoping to complete the process in the next couple of months. Our target is to start implementation of the new rules from January 2022,” Rajendra Nimbalkar, CEO of SRA, said. A provision of penalty has been made in the new rules if the developer delays the project. The amount collected from this penalty will be kept reserved for development and maintenance of SRA buildings. Civic officials said the drop in the transfer of development rights (TDR) rates is hampering slum rehabilitation schemes. The slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) schemes are built mostly on the compensation of TDR and are finding very few takers. Not many developers are coming forward to take up these projects. The TDR rates have gone down by around 40%. As many as 60 slum rehabilitation projects are affected due to the rate reduction. The officials observed that as many as 125 projects are in pipeline while 60 are underway. A majority are dependent on the TDR. These rates had gone up to Rs 4,500 per sqft during peak consumption. It has come down to Rs 600 per sqft to Rs 1,000 per sqft. The premium FSI and other instruments for compensation introduced in the unified development control rules have put the TDR on the back foot. Since TDR has no steep demand, developers are not coming forward to build the projects and accepting TDR as compensation. So, the maximum FSI limit has been increased in the new rules. Currently only up to 3 FSI could be utilised in the project. After the new rules, there will be no such limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fresh-rules-offer-300sqft-homes-in-slum-rehab-projects-for-dwellers/articleshow/86591503.cms||---

P Vasudeva Rao, the complainant said that he paid an amount of Rs 25, 412 towards the premium and obtained Liberty Health Connect Family Floater Insurance Policy for a sum of Rs 10 lakh, covering Rao and his wife for one year from October 29, 2018, to October 28, 2019. In October 2019, the complainant submitted that he was down with fever and consulted doctors at a private hospital, where he was diagnosed with pancytopenia (decrease in all three blood cell types) on October 10, 2019. After transfusion of one unit of blood and one unit of single donor platelets, he was discharged. After about a month, Rao said that he was diagnosed with leukaemia and got admitted for treatment as an in-patient on October 25, 2019, in a private hospital and opted for cashless treatment. Despite giving his health insurance details, Rao said he had to pay Rs 5.73 lakh in advance. Alleging that insurance firm wrongly repudiated his claim for non-disclosing that he has a history of diabetes and hypertension since 2006, and terminated his policy, he filed this complaint. During the trial, the bench noticed neither discharge summary nor the doctor’s notes showed any no such medical history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cancer-patient-wins-rs-7-lakh-in-consumer-forum-battle/articleshow/86591516.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The minister said that the emergency compensation to four persons, who had died in wild elephant attacks in the state during the last one week, will be distributed by Tuesday and Wednesday. “At present, there are only one or two RRTs in each district and that is not adequate to handle the human-wildlife conflict. Also, the number of forest watchers has to be increased. Steps will be taken to ensure that conflict mechanisms like fences are intact and maintained properly”" he said. The minister also added that the government is planning to increase the compensation being provided to those who have suffered losses in wildlife conflicts and have taken up the matter with the Centre. “The current compensation provided for crop loss caused by straying wildlife is inadequate and we have proposed timely revision for the same. Also, the department is consolidating the around 1,800 opinions we have received on finding solutions in wildlife conflict and preliminary talks have already taken place with finance and local administration ministers and principal secretaries of those departments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/state-to-beef-up-rrts-and-forest-watchers/articleshow/86592642.cms||---

Saying that “expeditious … investigation” is necessary for justice, the Allahabad high court has asked the principal secretary (home), UP DGP and the joint director of the Forensic Laboratory, Agra, to file their personal affidavits explaining the “inordinate delay”. Dr Yogita, 30, had completed her Master of Surgery in obstetrics and gynaecology three days before she went missing and was killed on August 19 last year, allegedly by a doctor she had been in a relationship with, Orai district hospital medical officer Dr Vivek Tewari. She was practising at the SN Medical College in Agra at the time, where she became UP’s first gynaecologist to perform a Caesarean section on a Covid-19 patient. Her family is based in Delhi. Her father Ambesh Kumar is deputy commissioner of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti in Udaipur, Rajasthan, and her brother Dr Mohinder Kumar Gautam works at the Charak Palika Hospital in Delhi. “We approached the high court on September 1 because the DNA report (of the hair samples) had not been submitted despite reminders by the local court,” Mohinder said. On August 18 this year, the special judge of the SC/ST Act, Agra, where the case is being heard, had passed an order and sent reminders to officials about the forensic report but the lab authorities didn’t file it. The hair samples had been sent for forensic examination in September last year. “It is submitted that even though the sessions court has passed orders and reminders to submit forensic report ...(it) has not been submitted … although one year has passed,” the high court order, issued last Thursday said. “Expeditious, fair investigation not only result in a fair trial but is also necessary (for) justice. Learned AGA states that the trial has commenced. However, it is not denied that the forensic report may prove to be an important piece of evidence for the purpose of the trial.” The court ordered that the matter be set up as a fresh case on October 1. Tewari had confessed to the crime and told the police that the “strained relationship” they shared was why he had killed her. The car she had been kidnapped in was found at his house and the gun he used to shoot her was one his father owned. “The autopsy found firearm wounds — one on the head, two on the chest — and one incision wound on the neck besides multiple cut marks on her left hand,” the family’s counsel SS Chauhan said. Tewari was arrested on murder, abduction, concealing evidence and criminal intimidation charges, and under the SC/ST Act. UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said the court order will be complied with, adding, “Sometimes, delays are caused by backlog in the lab."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/delhi-docs-murder-no-forensic-report-in-13-mths-allahabad-hc-asks-up-govt-to-explain-delay/articleshow/86590525.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

HUDA is going to start work on beautifying the Singh nullah, a longstanding demand of residents. Huda officials said that in their notice to residential property owners, they requested them to remove all kinds of encroachments on their own within three days of the notice, failing which a Huda team would remove the illegal structure at the cost of the owner of the residential property. Officials said over the years, residents have made parks and some temporary rooms for storage purposes behind their houses on the Singh Nullah land, which belongs to HUDA. After various meetings over the past several years, during which residents demanded covering of the nullah, Huda decided to clean and beautify it by growing grass and making a footopath for people to walk. The MC also plans to build a night food street so that the vacant land can be used. Every monsoon, residents complain about foul smell, wild grass and spotting of wild animals, including snakes here. The place also facilitates mosquito breeding. Residents who have been served notices said, “One cannot live here without cleaning the area behind the plot. When HUDA failed to clean it, we cleaned and maintained the area on our own expense and beautified it so that foul smell and other disesases do not spread here.” BOX: History of Singh Nullah: Singh Nullah is one of the “panch kuls” (five wells) this town was named after. It is now a stinking stream passing through four residential sectors (2, 4, 12, and 12-A). This seasonal rivulet older than Panchkula was last seen in full flow in 1992 and has been almost empty since. Various resident’s welfare associations have been fighting for long to get it filled or landscaped to escape its wild bushes and filth.

On Tuesday, NHRC DIG Manzil Saini was grilled by commission chairman V S Sirpurkar on who drew the rough map, why it was not drawn at the site and why they did not rely on the one already made by the police. “Woh kaun chitrakar tha (Who was that artist),” the chairman asked DIG Saini, pointing out that she was the one leading the NHRC team when she initially said she didn’t remember. On being quizzed by commission’s advocate K Parameshwar on why NHRC did not use the sketch prepared by investigating officer J Surender Reddy and given to the NHRC team on December 9, 2019, as part of spot panchnama, DIG claimed they used their own map as they had started recording statements of police witnesses from December 8. But in subsequent answers she contradicted herself and said statements of police witnesses were recorded from December 10. NHRC inspector Arun Tyagi during his deposition stated that the team could not take videos or photos from the alleged encounter site due to the huge crowd. He said that there was immense jostling as the media tried to get a ‘byte’ from the NHRC team, forcing it to leave the place quickly for safety of the team as well as the lady officer.

---||Lucknow||Congress bets on youth power in Uttar Pradesh elections||LUCKNOW: Positioning itself as the only option against the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress party may bet on young candidates in the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections. Sources said that the party may give 60% of its tickets to those in the 30s and 40s. The formula is being picked up from what is known as the Kerala Model which helped the party secure victory in the southern state. The sources said that party national general secretary’s campaign in the state capital these days has already given a consent on the count. It may be noted that the applications for the seat are being accepted till October 10. “Focus on the youth and their issues is clear in various strategy, election, campaign and manifesto meetings. The leadership feels that this is the group which has suffered most at the hands of the myopic vision of the BJP government and therefore wants change. Fielding good candidates with whom the public can relate is a natural thought,” the sources said, adding that the model did work in Kerala where over 50% of the candidates were below 50 years of age. The Kerala model is also the template to touch upon the youth through the various rallies and yatras set for roll out. The Congress’s training camps also focused on the youth. Political analysts, however, believed that the Congress needs more than a formula-44 for its revival in Uttar Pradesh. “The party is still struggling to put things in an affirmative and clear perspective. The formula may not find many buyers in a highly caste and religion sensitive UP unlike Kerala where development and candidates are considered over traditional factors,” said one of them. Another added that the grand old party’s frontal organisations such as the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India also have a meagre presence among youth. Congress poll campaign launch likely on October 9:Congress is likely to launch its poll campaign for 2022 on October 9. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra may address her first public rally in Varanasi to herald the campaign through Pratigya Yatra. Confirming that preparations for a Varanasi rally have begun, former Varanasi MP Rajesh Mishra said the event is being organised to give a message of change to people across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/congress-bets-on-youth-power-in-state-elections/articleshow/86593278.cms||Shailvee Sharda

She said that when she went to talk with him over the issue at downstairs, Maheria snatched her water bottle with which he hit her constantly. He dragged her outside the hospital campus, forcibly made her to sit on his motorcycle and took her to Vasna. There he told her to get off from the motorcycle and as she got off from it, he drove his motorcycle on her left foot.

The viral video is said to be of a religious event when he was posted as divisional commissioner, Kanpur between 2014 and 2017. The videos also purportedly feature a religious leader sitting besides the officer. In another video, Iftikharuddin is seen sitting on the ground while a Muslim cleric is giving radical lessons at his residence. The SIT will be headed by DG, CB-CID, G L Meena while ADG Kanpur Zone Bhanu Bhaskar will be member. “SIT has been directed to submit the investigation report to the government in seven days,” said sources in the state home department. After around half-a-dozen videos went viral, Math Mandir Coordination Committee national vice-president Bhupesh Awasthi also made several allegations against the IAS officer. Awasthi said the videos show Iftikharuddin telling the benefits of adopting Islam. “I have seen the video in which a lot of inappropriate things are said against Hinduism. A lot of allegations are made. Statements are made in favour of a particular religion,” Awasthi added. “In one such video, a Muslim cleric is speaking on conversion and the IAS officer is sitting and listening carefully to his plea. Muslim expert is inciting conversion by talking about Hindu religion. At the same time, in another video, Iftikharuddin is seen sitting on a chair and reading tales from religious books. He is saying... Declare to the people of the world that the sovereignty and authority of Allah is to be established in the whole world,” he said. After the videos went viral, police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun instructed additional deputy commissioner of police (East) Somendra Meena to investigate the matter. “The investigation of the viral videos of IAS officer Mohd Iftikharuddin taken at Kanpur commissioner’s residence has been entrusted to ADCP East, police commissionerate, Kanpur Nagar. It is being investigated whether the videos are authentic and if there is any crime in it,” tweeted police commissionerate, Kanpur Nagar. On Monday, even deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya had said, “This is a serious matter. If there is anything like this, it will be taken seriously.” Iftikharuddin was the divisional commissioner of Kanpur from February 17, 2014 to April 22, 2017.

An estimated 8.5 lakh students have applied for the examinations. Tope had declared that the examinations will be held on October 24 and 31. Originally, they were scheduled to be conducted on September 25 and 26, but were postponed at the last minute over large-scale goof-ups about the exam centres and hall tickets. In the weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday, members led by deputy CM Ajit Pawar expressed concerns over the fiasco which has resulted in hardships for students. A section of the cabinet members felt that the credentials of the firm were doubtful, and it would be in the larger interest of the students as well as the credibility of the state that the examinations should be cancelled and a new agency appointed for the purpose. Ultimately, it was decided that Thackeray will examine the issues raised by the cabinet members, as he is also minister for information technology, and take a decision on whether the contract for conducting the exams should be cancelled and the task should be entrusted to a new agency. Significantly, Tope has taken the stand that the public health department has had a limited role in the entire episode. “As health minister, Tope can’t escape his responsibility. Even after this biggest goof-up, he does not want to own responsibility for the mess. Four days after the episode, Tope did not set up even a committee to conduct a probe,” a senior NCP minister said. Leader of opposition Pravin Darekar blamed Tope. “If the CM is serious, he should first sack Tope and entrust the probe to the CBI or CID. A probe should be conducted and should be completed in a time-bound manner. It’s the biggest scam in the public health department,” Darekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uncertainty-over-health-dept-exam-as-cm-to-do-check/articleshow/86593295.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt sets up panel as police urge ban on 14th century religious book||Thiruvananthapuram: The state police have asked the government to ban a 14th century religious book titled ‘Mashari al-Ashwaq ila Masari al Ushaaq’, citing it as anti-national and one which misguides the youth to join terrorism. According to the police, the book, the title of which means ‘The Door of Victory, in the Shadow of Sword’, written by Ahmed Ibrahim Muhammed al Dimashqi al Dumyati, known as Ibn Nuhaas, an Islamic scholar who lived in 14th century in Egypt, contains extreme religious fundamentalism, anti-national attitude, and tends to spread hatred among religions that can misguide the youth into extremism and encourages them to join terrorist organizations. The police recommended twice on December 23 last year and on July 21 this year to the government to ban the circulation of the book in all platforms, including on social media. As per an order (GO (Rt) No. 2628/2021/Home) issued by the home (secret section) that deals with the sensitive matters and intelligence inputs, on September 25, a committee has been constituted to examine whether the book contains any incriminating material which are in conflict with any law in force and to make recommendations accordingly. The committee consists of director (information and public relations department), IG (internal security) and legal expert and former advisor to the chief minister on legal matters N K Jayakumar. The order further says that the director (I and PRD) will be the convener of the committee who will hold the meeting of the committee and facilitate the committee to make appropriate recommendations to the government regarding the book. According to the information available in the public domain, the book was written in AD 1411. The book was resurrected from centuries of obscurity in the late 20th century by the Egyptian author Sayyid Qutb. In a similar instance, in October 2013, the state special branch had recommended the government to ban publishing of literature that could invoke religious sentiments. The recommendation was made then in the wake of raids in a publishing company and seizing some literature allegedly inciting hard-line religious sentiments. The state special branch had recommended that the incidents that occurred in the state then, including Kashmir recruitment case involving Tadiyantavide Nazeer, Kozhikode double bomb blast and the hand chopping of college professor T J Joseph, were all inspired from such kind of books that were aimed at flaring up religious sentiments. On September 4, 2013, the police raided a book stall at Thirurangadi and seized a copy of the book ‘Da’watum Jihadum’. A case against the publisher and distributor of the book was registered alleging that the book instigated the innocent youth to join jihad, by misinterpreting Holy Quran. The book was originally penned by Hyderabad-based cleric Moulana Abdul Aleem Islahi and translated from Urdu to Malayalam by an Urdu school teacher in Kozhikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-sets-up-panel-as-police-urge-ban-on-14th-century-religious-book/articleshow/86592675.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Hyderabad||Disha encounter hearings: Why were cops’ statements not recorded, says SC panel to NHRC DIG||HYDERABAD: The SC-appointed panel grilled NHRC investigation team for not taking photographs or videos of alleged encounter site at Chattanpally and for not recording the statements of the injured cops at the hospital during its visit after the alleged exchange of fire in December 2019. Commission chairman VS Sirpurkar, members — Rekha Sondur Baldota and DS Karthikeyan — and its advocates posed several questions to NHRC DIG Manzil Saini during her deposition. She said NHRC team did not draw the map of the incident at Chattanpally or take photos and videos during its visit on December 7, 2019, due to the presence of a crowd, including media. DIG said that her team visited the hospital where the two injured cops were admitted and met them but did not record statements. When the panel asked her as to why they did not record, she said: “As per doctors, police personnel were admitted in the hospital on account of having received injuries during the encounter and they were not in a condition to give their statements.” The panel then asked the DIG to give the name of the doctor who told the NHRC team that the injured cops were not in a position to give a statement. The panel then drew the DIG’s attention to the letter (dated December 9, 2019), signed by an authorised signatory of a private hospital where the two cops were admitted, permitting NHRC team to talk to the two cops. The team was also given access to the notes of one of the doctors, Dr Rajesh Rachha, who attended an injured cop mentioning (on December 9) that “on examination, the patient was conscious, coherent and in a clear state of mind. Vital observations like BP, pulse, respiration rate are normal and stable.” The DIG, however, maintained that statements of the two cops were not recorded as they were not discharged from the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-were-cops-statements-not-recorded-sc-panel-to-nhrc-dig/articleshow/86591559.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Goa||Trinamool’s pitch for Goa: Credible opposition and ability to fight BJP||PANAJI: Last week when West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee warned BJP of ‘khela hobe’ in Tripura, UP, Assam and Goa, it almost went unnoticed in the small tourist state. And before anyone could realise, Trinamool Congress MPs Derek O’Brien and Prasun Banerjee descended on the state. Their entry in Goa created the buzz that TMC was looking for and the party had its first catch in the form of former chief minister and Congress veteran Luizinho Faleiro, who will be joining them in Kolkata on Wednesday. But much before TMC showed its seriousness, it was I-PAC, the political management agency that the party has engaged for five years, who swooped down on the state with its 180-member team and did the groundwork, collecting data, analysing it and finally submitting a report to Mamata early this month. The report was clear: Time was ripe for TMC to plunge into Goan politics and become the main contender to BJP. “Why Goa? First, there is very strong anti-BJP sentiment in the state. Second, availability of huge opposition space and third, Goa is a small state,” O’Brien told TOI in an informal chat a couple of days ago. Goa is one of the small states the party has targeted to get the requisite percentage of votes aimed at getting national party status. The party has been scouting for disgruntled politicians, including from BJP, and intellectuals to woo them into their fold and expand its base to be ready for the state elections. Faleiro’s induction is seen from this point and that his long stint in the north-east, when he was the AICC in-charge, would help TMC to strengthen its base in the region. Riding high on its success against BJP in Bengal, the TMC is hoping to position itself as a party that has the capacity to be the main contender against the saffron party. TMC’s posturing to Goan voters is, unlike Congress, it can provide a serious challenge to BJP and stop the mass exodus of MLAs and politicians towards the saffron fold. Congress, despite being the single largest party with 17 members after the 2017 elections, finds itself with just four members in the 40-member House as everyone, except Faleiro, who has quit the party has joined BJP. TMC is looking at capitalising on the angst among Congress workers and supporters who feel humiliated and betrayed by their MLAs who defected and disenchanted by the party for failing to stop them from joining BJP. On the other hand, the party also reckons that it can exploit the resentment in BJP by the old guard, who feel sidelined after the party inducted 13 MLAs from Congress during this term. TMC wants to portray that it is a party with a difference having a strong leadership and control over its flock. O’Brien indicated that the party will have in place a mechanism to ensure that their MLAs do not jump the ship. What also tilted TMC's entry into Goa was the size of the state to manage elections. On an average, each assembly constituency has around 25,000 voters and TMC feels that they can manage these with the resources available with them. Party insiders say that deputing Prasun Banerjee to Goa is not without a purpose. It’s about football. With both Goa and Bengal passionate about the game and many of the Goan footballers being contemporaries of Banerjee, TMC fancies a chance there too. But this isn't the first time that TMC has tested its electoral fortunes in Goa. In 2012, under the leadership of former chief minister Wilfred de Souza, TMC contested 20 seats and secured less than 2% of the total vote share. Churchill Alemao had also unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha polls on a TMC ticket in 2014 for the South Goa seat. Ask O'Brien, and he has a different take. “Our objective is to not (just) participate in the next assembly elections in Goa but to win,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trinamools-pitch-for-goa-credible-opposition-and-ability-to-fight-bjp/articleshow/86592650.cms||Vijay Desouza

---||Jaipur||‘Blood thinners good for Covid patients’||Jaipur: The second wave of Covid in April-May is taking its toll on the heart of many people who had a prolonged stay in ICUs for treatment and those who got infected with virus but already had underlying risk factor of heart diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity and family history. Hospitals are witnessing cases of heart attacks among such patients who had survived from onslaught of Covid-19, but now they have to rush to the hospitals for emergency care. Two days ago, Cardiological Society of India had organised a conference in which they discussed ‘Covid and Cardiovascular Diseases’. “Many studies were discussed in the conference which are quite useful. If two different persons are infected with Covid, one has risk factors for heart diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and family history, while the other has no such complication, the chances of cardiovascular diseases are higher in the patient who has risk factors and in those who had a prolonged stay in ICUs for covid treatment,” said Dr Rajeev Bagarhatta, head of the department (cardiology), SMS Medical College. Dr Bagarhatta further added that such patients should take care of their heart even after getting recovered from Covid-19. “We are advising such patients not to stop anticoagulants for at least six months to minimise chances of heart complication such as heart attack,” he said. Covid-19 affects health of the heart in different ways. “Covid can decrease the pumping capacity of the heart and cause heart failure symptoms. It can also cause heart attack by causing blockage the arteries. It can also cause rhythm disturbances. It can cause sudden increase in heart rate which can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. It can also cause decrease in heart rate leading to symptoms of giddiness and syncope,” Dr Kush Kumar Bhagat, consultant (cardiology) at a private hospital. Cardiologists advise people to get vaccination against covid-19. “People with pre-existing heart conditions need to keep in mind that Covid-19 vaccination is not a choice for them, but a necessity. As far as safety is concerned, Covid-19 vaccines are safe for all eligible age groups. To stay safe from cardiac diseases, people need to follow certain prevention methods like avoid both active and passive smoking and consumption of tobacco, maintaining a healthy weight, balanced and healthy diet, reduce and manage stress can be helpful,” said Dr Amit Kumar Singhal, senior consultant, cardiology, at a private hospital. The possibility of having a heart attack may arise because of blood clots. In this case, the life of the patient can also be lost, shows researches. “Even after recovering from covid-19, get a heart checkup done once, so that it can be known how badly your heart has been affected due to covid,” said Dr Ankit Mathur, senior cardiac surgeon at a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/blood-thinners-good-for-covid-patients/articleshow/86592647.cms||---

This spray prevents mild Covid infection from progressing to moderate/severe disease, phase II trials have shown. The manufacturer claims that those who tested RT-PCR positive up to 48 hours ago can get themselves cured by using this spray six times a day, for three days. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has sponsored the human trials of the nitric oxide nasal spray (NONS), developed by Canadian biotech firm SaNOtize Research and Development Corporation. “Currently, Covid-19 patients are given standard supportive care at Covid Care Centres. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of NONS along with the standard care,” said Dr Rajesh Gosavi, who is the principal investigator of trials in Nagpur GMCH. He has appealed to Covid-19 patients to contact the GMCH medicine department though authorities and get enrolled for the trials. Total 90 patients will be enrolled for the trials and 45 of them will be given the nasal spray treatment. After enrolling Covid patients for the trial, fresh RT-PCR test will be conducted. If the viral load is found enough, they will be given the nasal spray which has to be used six times a day (after 2-hour interval) for three days. Fresh RT-PCR will be conducted every day during these three days and on the 8th day of the treatment to know the viral load. According to Dr Gosavi, the phase II trial of this spray had shown 99% reduction in the viral load at the end of three days of treatment. Head of the department of medicine Dr Prashant Patil, and GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta said they are excited that GMCH is one of the sites for such a milestone trials in the country. “We are hopeful that the spray, which is highly affordable as compared to the antibody cocktail, will change the way we treat Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Gupta. The antibody cocktail by Switzerland-based Roche has already been used on patients in a few hospitals, but it is costly. Experts say the nitric oxide nasal spray by Glenmark is going to be cheaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-to-host-nasal-spray-trials-to-treat-covid-ve/articleshow/86592664.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

He was welcomed into the party fold by state Congress president Girish Chodankar in the presence of AICC incharge of Goa, Dinesh Gundu Rao and leader of opposition Digambar Kamat at the party headquarters. Speaking on the occasion, Chodankar charged Luizinho Faleiro, who quit Congress on Monday, with betraying the party at the eleventh hour. He, however, said that with Faleiro’s exit, Navelim has gained freedom as it has paved the way for the younger generation from the constituency to enter politics. “This will enable new leadership to emerge in Navelim,” Chodankar said. Speaking on the occasion, Chodankar said, “Avertano had expressed his desire to contest the 2022 assembly elections only on a Congress ticket. So, he is now joining Congress.” He, however, said the party hasn’t promised ticket to anybody. Stating that Navelim has always been a Congress stronghold, Chodankar urged youth to join Congress. Rao said that Furtado had joined Congress unconditionally. Welcoming the former MLA in the partyfold, opposition leader Digambar Kamat said Furtado’s eagerness and enthusiasm to join Congress is a clear indication of the mood of the people in the state, especially in Navelim constituency. Speaking on the occasion, Furtado said “In 2017, when I lost to Faleiro, I had decided not to contest. But I had continued with social work”. As he was active, Navelim constituents approached him to fight the polls, he claimed. As soon as Faleiro decided to resign and join TMC, he said, Congress workers approached him to join the party. People of Navelim are disheartend, as Faleiro quit as MLA without consulting the constituents, he said. “I don’t think they will forgive him,” Furtado said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ex-navelim-mla-former-mantri-avertano-joins-cong/articleshow/86592666.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The shop-with-your-waste campaign helps raise awareness among residents and provides economic opportunity as it allows people to trade PET bottles, milk pouches, paper, cardboard and other recyclables against monetary incentive. Currently each of the two Caranzalem-based centres collect one ton of dry waste per day. Waste from smaller collection centres of the CCP are also sorted here. “There is a large floating population in Panaji comprising people that work in Panaji, hospitality industry and tourists, besides its own population and business establishments. When people realised that the campaign is working well, they started responding more proactively towards it,” said CCP commissioner, Agnelo Fernandes. He further said that they have plans to expand the concept by “improving and improvising it” to make the city efficient in garbage management. A total of 25 types of items can be submitted to the centres for the shop-with-your-waste campaign. However for now, ten types of items are rewarded with payment. While items that can be used again are sent to recyclers, the non-recyclable items are sent to cement factories to be incinerated. Dinesh Kumar, who handles the Caranzalem-based sorting centre overlooking the Miramar beach, said that households, building societies, shops, outlets are the primary people that exchange their waste with them. However, the city’s kabadiwala community (junk dealers) have also found a dedicated space to trade their collection. “People from various walks of life are responding positively to the shop-with-your-waste campaign.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/200-tonne-of-waste-recycled-under-pay-per-garbage-model/articleshow/86592659.cms||Nida Sayed

The one-and-a-half year old boy was suffering from fever, stomach ache and other health complications and needed immediate medication. Senior officials sat together and decided upon the drone to send the medicines. A person who runs a photo studio in Banswada had a drone. Pitlam tahsildar Rammohan, revenue and police officials and health personnel talked to the photo studio owner and used the drone to deliver the medicines across the rivulet which was in spate. A health worker in the village received the medicines and administered them to the child. A nondescript village, Kurthi has a population of about 1,200 and Bodhan is the nearest town, 50 km away. “First, we explored the option of accessing the village by boats. We came to an understanding that it would not be easy to get across to the village because of the heavy flow of water in the rivulet. It was then we thought of the drone option,” Rammohan told TOI on Tuesday. With heavy inflows into Manjira river, excess water being released from Nizamasagar and incessant rains, the village has lost road link to the outside world. Rammohan further said: “We have delivered medicines that will last for the next fortnight for the village which may need medication for BP, diabetes and other common ailments.” A bridge across Manjira is under construction and once it is completed, accessibility to the village will be easy. There is a low-level bridge which has marooned now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drone-used-to-deliver-medicines-to-save-baby-in-flooded-village/articleshow/86591590.cms||---

A probe later found that both the boys were minors and belonged to the Hindu community. Their families, shocked at the FIR against them, said the boys were students of class 12 and were engaged in a “friendly debate” and “someone complained unnecessarily”. The FIR was registered against the boys in the video under section 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between classes) of the IPC, a non-bailable section, at the Sasni gate police station on Monday. The case was filed after the video went viral and a local BJP member approached police. In his complaint, Ram Gopal said, “I have seen a video in which one boy is threatening Hindus and asking them to convert to Islam. The video has created anger among people and the content can create religious enmity.” In the video, a masked boy on his bicycle is pretending to be Muslim and another a Hindu. Police probe later found that the boys in the video were minors. “They belong to the same community,” said circle officer Raghvendra Kumar, adding that they were not arrested as they were minors and “legal proceedings are on in the matter”. Families of the two boys said they were taken aback by how quickly the matter had escalated. Uncle of one of the boys, a BJP member from Hathras, said it was “a friendly debate” between them that was misinterpreted. “They were returning from their coaching classes and were discussing things. We will approach police as the boys didn’t mean any harm,” said the uncle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-boys-discussing-islam-on-video-booked-probe-finds-theyre-hindus-minors/articleshow/86590553.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Ahmedabad||Look at public interest instead of doctors’ private interest: Commission to govt||Ahmedabad:The inquiry commission asked the state government to form its policies not in keeping in mind the interests of medical practitioners, but the welfare of the public at large. It called for balancing the private interests of medical fraternity against the greater public interest. Recommending measures, the probe panel said, “The state government has to pose a question to itself: whether the interest of medical practitioners, who might be totalling about one lakh or may be slightly more, is to be given precedence over the interest of the total population of the state running into crores?” It further said, “When there is conflict between private and public interest, precedence has to be given to public interest. For the sake of private interest of a limited number of persons, howsoever highly qualified they may be, the larger public interest, the larger public good cannot be ignored or given the go bye.” Stop outsourcing essential services like fire departments: Justice Mehta commission Ahmedabad: To address inefficiency in the fire and emergency services, Justice (retd) D A Mehta commission has strongly recommended that the state government do away with the practice of outsourcing, particularly in essential services like fire departments. The commission said every decision cannot be taken by applying the touchstone of cost and revenue. “The welfare of the entire population of the state has to be paramount consideration, which cannot be modulated on consideration of revenue impact. Fire and emergency services fall within a priority sector which requires an adequate number of workers to be in readiness round-the-clock,” the report reads. It further said that the concept of privatisation has to be restricted and made applicable only to commercial sectors. This practice cannot be stretched to shirk the government’s responsibility on public health and well-being. Health is primarily a state subject. The commission called for immediate lifting of the embargo on recruitment and termed the present recruitment policy in fire departments ‘flawed’. It said not hiring for long periods in the fire services would lead to people losing their interest in acquiring skills and degrees on this subject. This is the reason for the present absence of skilled manpower. Even top posts in state’s fire department are staffed as stop-gap arrangements. It said there are serious deficiencies in the government’s functioning because outsourcing employees is not only detrimental to effective government, but creates a situation, a culture, which yields negative results. It reprimanded the government saying, “The state government has to realise that it is required to govern the state i.e. govern the state effectively, and not make a show of governing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/look-at-public-interest-instead-of-doctors-private-interest-commission-to-govt/articleshow/86591593.cms||---

The crime branch of the city police had launched a manhunt for Shaikh Jawed, alias Tipya, (29), a resident of Garkheda area, after his alleged involvement in recent serious cases, including attacks on two policemen in different cases. Jawed also allegedly tried to usurp a plot owned by a constable serving with the Latur prison department. Jawed, along with his mother, turned up before court number 16 and claimed that he feared for his life and so he was surrendering before the court. After hearing his plea, the court remanded him in judicial custody. Since 2018, eight serious offences have been registered against the accused, following which, he was booked under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act, and was behind bars for a year. The accused, soon after stepping out of prison, was allegedly involved in criminal activities again. Police inspector of the crime branch Avinash Aghav told TOI, “The accused is an extremely violent criminal and has a track record of attacking policemen. If he had attacked our police team trying to arrest him, our team would have definitely acted in self-defense.” The officer said that after he committed two serious offences in a span of 24 hours, four police teams were deployed to track him. The teams had already raided different locations in Malegaon, Yeola and Andarsol in Nashik district and Jatwada in Aurangabad district. Authorities maintained that the police will move to the court and seek his custody to question his involvement in serious offences he allegedly committed over the last few days. According to the police, even during the lockdown, a video depicting him dancing along with a woman on a car had gone viral online. Following this incident, Jawed was arrested under the Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/criminal-fearing-for-his-life-surrenders-before-court-remanded-in-judicial-custody/articleshow/86589682.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The number of cases related to Covid-19 is lower even as some cases of chikungunya and dengue have been detected in the town recently. “The situation related to Covid is very stable in the corporation limits as the number of fresh cases from across the town, including the east and west regions, is maximum two cases on alternate days,” said Bhalchandra Gosavi, municipal commissioner. As of now, all Covid positive patients are under home isolation. “The number of the cases reported are in the range of zero to four, per day. The health teams quickly carry out contact tracing, tracking and testing of people, who may be under the high-risk category. This is helping us contain the spread,” said Dr Sapna Thakre, medical officer at Malegaon Municipal Corporation. The officer also pointed out that almost all of them were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, not requiring institutional quarantine. Dr Thakre also pointed out that around 250 tests were being carried out on an average per day in the town. The total number includes both RTPCR and antigen tests. “Apart from RTPCR tests of people falling under high-risk category, we are also carrying out testing of people in the field and that includes antigen testing,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/all-ncov-patients-in-malegaon-town-under-home-isolation/articleshow/86589731.cms||Abhilash Botekar

They ruled out the possibility of the herd turning back towards the human settlements of Mohammadi. Three tuskers of the herd have already crossed the river Sharda and reached the Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal, said the forest department officials. The rest of the elephants are in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary, probably looking for a safe passage for the calves once the river water recedes, said deputy director, Dudhwa tiger reserve (buffer) Anil Patel. So far two calves have been spotted with the herd. Now, the elephants are on track in their known wildlife corridor, which they use to migrate from Nepal to India and vice versa every year, the foresters said. Earlier, a herd had attempted to migrate to Nepal but could not cross the Sharda swollen due to heavy rains in September. This probably explains why the elephants chose a “forgotten corridor” to reach Mohammadi range. Field director, DTR, Sanjay Pathak told TOI, “There is a high possibility that the tuskers that crossed the river have gone to do a recce of the area and will return to meet the herd and guide it towards Nepal through the safest route to enable the young ones to cross the river.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/wild-elephant-herd-back-on-known-corridor-to-nepal/articleshow/86590564.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He declined on health grounds. What more could have I offered him? Gandhi asked’,” Fernandes, who met the Congress leader in Delhi, told TOI. He said Gandhi expressed concern that Congress has lost so many MLAs to BJP and called for giving more weightage to loyalty to Congress workers while distributing tickets for the 2022 polls. “We need to have MLAs who are wedded to Congress ideology and who will remain loyal to the party. Loyalty to the party is important. Only then they will not go to other parties,” Fernandes, a Congress ticket aspirant for the Calangute constituency, said quoting Gandhi. The two-time MLA also met AICC’s election observer to Goa P Chidambaram and discussed the current situation in the state unit . There were speculations that Fernandes, who had come out openly criticising the state leadership of the party in support of Faleiro, would also follow him to TMC.

Dharamveer Singh, Bijnor’s superintendent of police, said during questioning, Nau Bahar told police that he was in a relationship with Priyanka, who was pressing him to get married. He had refused, citing caste differences. But she would not listen. So he lured her out of her house on Sunday night. Later, he strangled and stabbed her repeatedly. His friend, Rohit Kumar, helped him to throw the body into a sugarcane field, barely 30 metres from her house. The body was found the next morning. SP Dharamveer Sing told TOI, "We had lodged a case against unidentified assailants. Two teams were formed to arrest the killers. During investigations, we learnt about Nau Bahar, a resident of Bhaisa village, under Shivala Kala police station area. He worked as a helper in a clinic at Kopa village and lived with his uncle. He had met Priyanka at the clinic.” Nau Bahar said Priyanka belonged to the Pal caste and he Saini, so a marriage between them was not possible. Besides, his family would not have accepted it. Police said the case was cracked with the help of a surveillance system and informers. A bike, a knife used in the crime and blood-stained clothes were recovered from the duo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/lover-friend-held-for-womans-murder-in-bijnor/articleshow/86590589.cms||Harveer Dabas

A senior technician of the Undri sub-station of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) was allegedly abused and threatened by three residents of a housing society, after he seized the power meter of one of these men for non-payment of power bills.  An MSEDCL special squad, led by technician Suresh Pawar (32) from Phursungi, had on September 23 disconnected electricity supply and confiscated the power meter of a 40-year-old man residing in a housing society at Undri. The latter had not cleared his pending dues of Rs 5,000. Elaborating on the details, sub-inspector Sujatha Jadhav of Kondhwa police station said on Tuesday, “The man, along with two others, visited the MSEDCL office around 3pm on Monday and picked a fight with Pawar for disconnecting the power supply a day earlier. After the dispute between the two groups became heated, the suspects threatened to kill Pawar and fled from the spot.” Pawar registered a first information report (FIR) against the flat owner and two unidentified men. “We will arrest the flat owner and establish the identity of his two accomplices,” added Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-staffer-threatened-for-seizing-meter/articleshow/86591596.cms||---

The GR states that the “kin of Group A and B officials will be eligible for recruitment in Group C and D categories on compassionate grounds.” This is the first time that such a decision has been taken by the state government. Earlier, only the immediate, eligible relatives of group C and D employees were hired on compassionate grounds by different departments of the state government. Authorities clarified the latest GR is based on the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s decision taken during the state cabinet meeting held on August 26 this year. The government resolution states that the compassionate appointment policy has been made uniform for all the appointments in the state. “The policy is aimed helping the immediate family of the state government’s serving employees, who died on duty, to overcome financial crisis as well as to help them survive the emergencies and difficulties resulting from the death of their family member serving as a state government employee,” reads the GR issued on Monday. The government resolution, citing the outbreak of the pandemic and the related deaths it caused, rules that it will be implemented from January 1, 2020. The GR has clarified that the eligible kin of group A and B officials who have died during service, will be recruited in group C and D positions. A senior official of the general administration department said: “Those serving as class A and B officers in any of the state government departments are either through the Maharashtra Public Service Commission or through promotion that comes after a particular number of years in service.” He said that irrespective of the educational qualification of the eligible kin of the deceased government official, he or she will have to go through the seniority list meant for recruitment on compassionate grounds. “Once recruited, he or she may appear for inter-departmental exams or MPSC to climb the ladder in the department,” said high court lawyer Abhaysinh Bhosale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/senior-state-officials-kin-too-eligible-for-jobs-on-compassionate-grounds/articleshow/86589736.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Delhi||Delhi: Jail officials on alert as intel says 5 inmates may try to flee custody||NEW DELHI: Another layer of security was added to the Tihar and Mandoli jails, which are already like fortresses, following an alert that at least five gangsters could attempt to escape from custody during routine court and hospital visits from these jails. The alert came just days after gangster Jitender Gogi was gunned down in a busy courtroom in Rohini on Friday allegedly by members of the rival Tillu Tajpuriya gang. According to the officials privy to the information, the tip-off named five gangsters involved in several cases of robbery, murder, extortion and under the Arms Act and said that they might try and escape from prison with the help of their gang members. Four of the five inmates are lodged in Tihar Jail and the fifth inmate is in Mandoli, an official told TOI. Jail officials said posting of security personnel around the cells where the five inmates stay has been increased and there is added monitoring through CCTV cameras. “We have informed Delhi Police and the paramilitary personnel deployed in jail security,” said an official. “Patrolling inside the jails has been stepped up. Surprise checks are also being conducted at odd hours. Delhi Armed Police, which escorts prisoners to courts and hospitals, has also been briefed. The arrangements inside the jails are adequate to thwart attempts at escape.” Sandeep Goel, director general, Tihar Jail, however, did not comment on the development. The alert has been sounded just four days after Gogi was gunned down in a courtroom in the Rohini complex by two assailants. Even though the killers were soon neutralised by commandos of Delhi Police's Special Cell escorting the gangster, the incident has raised serious concerns about security on the court premises. Delhi Police arrested two other men, who confessed to be working at the behest of Tillu Tajpuriya, one of the biggest known rivals of Gogi. Police have said the two assailants who were shot down also had links with Tajpuriya. The latter was allegedly keeping in touch with the accused men from his prison cell. Officials suggested that he also could be one of the five men who had been named in the alerts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jail-officials-on-alert-as-intel-says-5-inmates-may-try-to-flee-custody/articleshow/86591633.cms||---
---||Goa||Doctors’ reminder: Now, nobody is too young for a heart attack||PANAJI: If a decade ago doctors mostly saw the sixty-plus developing heart disease, these days it is not uncommon to see incidences of acute myocardial infarction among those under 50. Doctors, at times, also see heart patients as young as 18 and 19, though such cases are few. While conventionally vices were blamed for heart disease, youth in their twenties and thirties today face the risk of developing heart disease due to their sedentary lifestyle, stress, and diet. In the last seven-and-a-half-years, Goa Medical College (GMC) has treated about 7,400 heart patients. Of these, 4.1% were less than 40 years of age and 21% under 50. The most difficult part for a doctor treating a young patient of heart attack is to convince parents, who fail to understand how their supposedly healthy child could develop an ailment as serious as a heart attack so young. Last week, when a 26-year-old man, a driver by profession, was rushed to hospital with acute chest pain, which was later diagnosed as a major heart attack, his parents had difficulty in accepting the reality, said consulting cardiologist at Victor hospital Dr Vinayaga Pandian. “The parents kept saying he was just 26. They thought a ball had hit him while playing cricket. It was nothing like that. He had suffered a heart attack, and his condition was so bad he could not walk when he was brought to the hospital. He was discharged last week after treatment,” Pandian said. Professor and head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department at GMC, Dr Shirish Borkar, said that since January 2020, he has performed 420 bypass surgeries, and that a 21-year-old man has been his youngest case in the state so far. Borkar said that of the total surgeries performed, 14% were on patients below 45 years of age, while 33% were in the 20-50 age bracket. Compared to the Asian population in a similar age group, the number of young people with heart disease in Goa, Borkar said, appears high, though definitive figures are not available. He, however, felt that a high incidence of diabetes among the Goan population could be one of the reasons why more people in their youth are detected with a heart condition, with some even requiring bypass surgery. “In several cases, diabetes was detected after a patient was brought to the hospital with a heart condition. Diabetes does not occur suddenly but gets detected suddenly with patients not doing regular check-ups,” Borkar said. Head of the cardiology department at GMC, Dr Guruprasad Naik said that Goa probably sees more cases of heart disease since there is better health care available. More importantly, treatment is free. Plus, the state runs the STEMI programme at 18 health centres, where a patient suspected of having a heart disease can access immediate care. At GMC, he said, their youngest male patients were an 18-year-old and a 19-year-old whereas a 33-year-old was the youngest female patient that underwent a heart procedure. As many as 40 patients in the 20 to 29 age group received treatment for acute myocardial infarction in the last seven-and-a-half-years. Overall, he said, the percentage of men suffering from heart disease in the state has been higher than that of women. A consultant interventional cardiologist at Manipal Hospital Dr Jyoti Kusnur said that young people have a predisposition for heart conditions owing to their stressful job and overall lifestyle. They are also likely to delay seeking treatment by ignoring symptoms. “Suppose a 27-year-old man develops chest pain, he is likely to brush it off thinking it is acidity. What follows is a sudden cardiac arrest. We hear of a young man collapsing in an office or home suddenly and being brought dead to the hospital. That’s because young people don’t expect they will have heart ailments whereas if a 50-year-old man has chest pain, he is likely to seek immediate medical help,” Kusnur said. She said that it doesn’t surprise her that 25- or 26-year-olds present themselves with heart disease. Her youngest patient was a 19-year-old girl who was a chain smoker and had an angioplasty done about five years ago. While the girl was an exception, besides smoking, drug addiction can hasten a heart ailment among youth, Kusnur said. Pandian said Covid conditions have forced a sedentary lifestyle upon people, as also stress that has many origins.

According to experts, there has been a steep rise in the number of Covid-recovered patients suffering from heart problems like sudden palpitation, chest pain, heart attack, heart failure, heart swelling, low pump capacity (low ejection fraction), blood clotting, etc. “We are seeing increasing cases of patients developing heart disease after getting infected,” Dr Sai Ravi Shanker, head of department cardiology, Prathima Hospitals, said. Most common cardiac disorders in Hyderabad and Telangana include acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiac failure, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and dysrhythmia. “High levels of inflammation in body is destroying healthy tissues post-Covid and causing heart ailments. Pandemic has also led to increased stress levels and imbalances which are affecting the heart,” said Vikram Thaploo, CEO, Apollo Tele Health. “There’s been an increase in the number of cases of heart attacks, strokes and aggravation of deep vein thrombosis in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. It has been observed that 78 out of the 100 patients diagnosed with the infection reported symptoms of heart damage and inflammation,” he added. With sedentary lifestyle fuelling the risk of heart diseases among youth, it is important to undergo preventive heart check ups for anyone above 40 years, say experts. “Nearly 70-80% heart diseases are preventable with regular heart check-ups and lifestyle changes,” said Dr Bharat Purohith, senior consultant cardiologist, Care Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spurt-in-heart-problems-post-covid/articleshow/86591613.cms||Amrita Didyala

Four years ago, when a child died while crossing the busy four-lane highway (NH-58) that cuts through the village, that hesitation turned into resolve — girls would be kept home. It was too dangerous to let them navigate the speeding traffic on the Delhi-Dehradun highway to get to school, which was on the other side. As the Upper Primary School for Girls saw its students dropping out, it came up with a solution — teachers would help the kids cross the highway. For three years now, teachers have been holding up two ends of a long banner that says “STOP, children crossing road” and giving cover while the little girls scurry across. “In the three years since we started this, the number of girls at the school has gone up from 150 to 350,” said school principal Shabnam Sharma. Siwaya-Jamalullapur is about 11km from the Meerut district headquarters, with most engaged as farmers, marginal workers and labourers. The last Census in 2011 had found male literacy in the village was 75% and female only 58%. That its 900 households lie on one side of the highway and the school on the other made things even more difficult over the years. “It was dangerous for us to send our children to school … Life is more important than education,” said Asharfi Devi, 75, whose granddaughter goes to the school now. Sharan Singh, 42, whose daughter also studies at the school, added, “The traffic is fast and accidents are common.” To address their misgivings, the school sent out its teachers. Going door-to-door, they spoke to parents, convinced them they should not pull their daughters out of school and that they would ensure the girls got home safely. “We move the children in two shifts,” said Shabana Azmi, a teacher at the school. “It is a huge responsibility to move so many kids at the same time across a busy highway. Most vehicles stop but a few try to negotiate their way even when children are crossing. We stand our ground then.” A long-term solution, the villagers said, would be an overbridge or an underpass. “Without them, accidents will keep happening,” said Mangat Ram, in his early 40s. Village pradhan Kirender Singh said he has set the ball rolling on that. “I have initiated the process to write to the authorities for an underpass. Our village is on both sides of a highway. A pedestrian-friendly structure is essential."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/girls-school-cut-off-by-deadly-nh-stretch-teachers-ferry-kids-across-daily-for-yrs/articleshow/86590598.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Balbeer Giri to succeed Narendra Giri as head of Baghambari Math||PRAYAGRAJ: Honouring the will of late president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) Mahant Narendra Giri, office-bearers of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani have decided to anoint his disciple Balbeer Giri as the next 'peethadhishvar' of Baghambari Gaddi Math. The position fell vacant following the mahant’s death. However, Balbeer Giri will have to get approval for all the major decisions pertaining to math by a five-member administrative body. He would be formally anointed at a coronation ceremony on October 5. The mahant, whose body was found hanging from the ceiling of a room in Baghambari Gaddi Math here on September 20, had named Balbeer Giri as his successor in his last will on June 4, 2020. Talking exclusively to TOI, general secretary of Niranjani Akhada, Mahant Ravindra Puri said, “As desired by Maharaj Ji (Narendra Giri) in his last will, we have named Balbeer Giri as his successor. He had also mentioned his decision in the suicide note and we have seen it in the video recorded by Maharaj Ji before committing suicide.” “We have decided to honour the will of Maharaj Ji and Balbeer Giri to be made the head of Bagamabari Math. The ceremony will be held at the Math on October 5,” he added. In a will made on January 7, 2010, Narendra Giri had mentioned Balbeer Giri as his successor. However, he changed his will on August 29, 2011, where he named Anand Giri as his successor. He again changed his will on June 4, 2020 (which is his last will as per his lawyer Rishi Shankar Dwivedi) and mentioned the name of Balbeer Giri to succeed him as the pithadhishvar of Baghambari Gaddi. Ravindra Puri also told TOI that various senior seers of the 13 akharas under ABAP ambit, along with respectable individuals of the society, officials of the district administration, etc., would be invited for the coronation ceremony on October 5. “The coincides with the ‘Shodashi’ ceremony of Mahant Narendra Giri, a ritual to be performed on the 16th day of the Mahant’s death," he added. Balbeer Giri would not only be the head of the Baghambari Math, but also be the head mahant of the Bade Hanuman temple of Sangam. The office-bearer the Niranjani Akhara said that a five-member ‘supervisory board’ would look after the working of the math. For all major decisions, like sale or purchase of land, the future head of the math would have to get approval of this five-member administrative body. “This all-important body would have members from Niranjani Akhara alone and besides me (Ravindra Puri), the other members would be Mahant Dinesh Giri, Mahant Omkar Giri, Keshav Puri and Mahant Har Govind Puri,” said Ravindra Puri, adding, “We are following set practices and traditions of the Akhara to take the decisions.” He said, “The seers of the akhara, including office-bearers, are sad over tarnishing of the akhara’s image in some sections of the media by highlighting false information about the property of the Math and the Akhara.” “No one talks of how the math is educating around 300 students residing in the hostel inside the mMath or the gaushala of around 150 cows, without selling a drop of milk or any by-product,” he added. Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani is the parental organisation of Baghambari Gaddi Math, and since Mahant Narendra Giri was also the secretary of the Akhara (besides Ravindra Puri), the ‘Panch Parmeshwar’ — a body constituting prominent seers of the Akhara — has the responsibility to appoint the successor of a mahant or peethadhishvar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/giris-closest-aide-to-succeed-him-as-math-peethadhishvar/articleshow/86593336.cms||Rajeev Mani

Police said the worker — Keshavan Basavraj Kamble (25) of Pandavnagar — was creating a ruckus in an inebriated condition in front of the police chowky. The constable, Mahendra Tukaram Kargal, told Kamble to maintain peace and took him inside the police chowky. Kamble began abusing the policeman and picked up a plastic chair and hit Kargal on his chest. Kargal screamed at Kamble, drawing a local resident’s attention and prompting the latter to rush inside the chowky. The resident grabbed Kamble and took him outside and tried to pacify him, when Kamble picked up a brick and hit Kargal on the head. The constable suffered a deep cut injury, police said. The Chatushrungi police arrested Kamble on Monday after Kargal lodged a complaint. Police filed a case under Sections 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (Voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 352 (Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) and others under the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inebriated-man-assaults-constable-with-brick-held/articleshow/86591631.cms||---

Three people have died in different rain-related incidents. The heavy rain prompted the water resources department (WRD) authorities to begin discharging water from the Gangapur dam in Nashik district for the third time in less than a month. Water was released at the rate of 3,452 cubic feet per second (cusec) since 10 am on Tuesday after the dam was filled to the brim. Jalgaon resident deputy collector Rahul Patil said that Sonali Barela, aged 14, from Vitner village in Jalgaon taluka was killed on Monday, when she was struck by lightning. Another woman, Murkhi Waghela (26), resident of Vivre village of Raver taluka, was also killed on Monday due to lightning. Four children accompanying her were injured and their condition was stable. Patil said that Chalisgaon region had witnessed heavy rainfall for the fourth time in a month, leading to flooding of Titur and Dongri rivers. The WRD officials opened the gates of Waghur dam for the first-time this season. A 32-year-old man, Nilesh Pardeshi, resident of Kalamdari in Nandgaon taluka was swept away while trying to cross the Panzan river, which was in spate on Tuesday morning. His body was found in the neighbouring farm, said Nashik RDC Bhagwat Doifode. Nashik city as well as the parts of district received average 30mm rainfall between Monday midnight and Tuesday forenoon.

---||Nashik||Sugar mills assigned colours based on fair & remunerative price payment history||Kolhapur: As many as 27 sugar mills in the state are coded ‘red’ for failing to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the sugar cane farmers. Fourteen other factories are also coded ‘red’ as the sugar commissionerate has issued revenue and recovery certificate (RRC) orders to them. These orders attach properties for non-payment of dues. A high-powered committee, led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, had asked the sugar commissionerate to colour code the factories based on their history of payment of sugar cane prices to the farmers. Accordingly, sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad has released a list. In the notification, he states: “The intention to colour code the factories is to let the sugar cane farmers know which factories pay the FRP on time, which make delayed payments, and even which factories default on payments. The farmers should know the financial capacity of the mills to pay the farmers. The sugar cane harvesting season is going to start on October 15 this year. The farmers are, therefore, advised to check the colour code before allowing the mill to crush their produce.” As many as 190 sugar factories are registered in the state. A green code means the mill pays the FRP on time; an orange code means the mill pays the FRP after the legally prescribed days; while red shows that the mill had defaulted in payment for the past season. While 13 of the ‘red’ mills are private enterprises, the rest operate as cooperatives. The highest number of red-coded mills (7) is in the Solapur districts. No mill in Kolhapur district has been coded red. Ramchandra Shinde, a sugar cane farmer from the Sangli district, said: “The colour coding system will help us choose the mills. We will avoid the mills that default frequently. It will also encourage the mills to pay as per FRP on time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sugar-mills-assigned-colours-based-on-fair-remunerative-price-payment-history/articleshow/86589750.cms||---

It was literally a deluge as over three inches of rain left most areas of the city waterlogged. The Sayajigunj underpass that connects the eastern part of the city with the posh Alkapuri area too got submerged in the rainwaters throwing traffic out of gear. The weather was overcast since morning with the sun coming out occasionally. But by 3 pm it began pouring heavily making the commuters scurry for cover. The Sayajigunj area witnessed traffic jams as the main underpass got water-logged, compelling the commuters to take a diversion. Most areas in the old city including Raopura, Mandvi, Dandia Bazaar and Panigate got submerged in knee-deep waters. Such was the flooding within a matter of minutes that many cars and two-wheelers parked on the roads in Sayajigunj as well as old city areas got submerged in the rainwater. In the evening, rains again lashed the city, this time accompanied by lightning, catching the commuters by surprise. The busy Rajmahal Road too witnessed long queues of vehicles while the Old Padra Road where a flyover is under construction was in a complete mess. Fire brigade officials said that there were some calls of trees falling in different areas but no one was injured in the incident. Apart from Vadodara, Dabhoi received 83 mm of rain, Karjan received 42 mm and Waghodia got 32 mm of rain on Tuesday.

---||Kochi||Kochi Metro Rail Ltd plans to take up beach maintenance in Fort Kochi||KOCHI: In an effort to give facelift to tourism in Fort Kochi, Metro authorities are mooting a proposal to take over the maintenance of the beach along with other facilities in the vicinity like bus station. Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) authorities will soon hold meetings with Kochi corporation and district administration in this regard. Construction of Water Metro jetty is progressing at Fort Kochi. The plan is to start ferry service from Fort Kochi when the Water Metro services would be started by December-end. KMRL authorities have given instructions to the contractor to complete the construction of the jetty by December 25. The Metro authorities plan to launch the first phase of Water Metro by December end. “If the corporation authorities and other stakeholders give their nods, we will be taking over the maintenance of the beach. Proper maintenance of the beach will attract more people to Fort Kochi,” KMRL managing director Loknath Behera said. More footfall in Fort Kochi beach will help increase the passenger turnout in Water Metro boats. Proper maintenance of bus station at Fort Kochi will help design an integrated transport facility. As of now, the condition of Fort Kochi beach is pathetic, thanks to poor maintenance and other reasons. The extent of beach is fast decreasing with the intrusion of sea by each passing year. “The waves carry garbage from the sea and the backwaters and deposit it in the beach. This makes cleaning the beach a difficult task. Along with this, apathy on the part of the authorities make Fort Kochi beach a tourist unfriendly destination,” said corporation standing committee chairperson for education Priya Prashanth. “The beach is fast becoming a danger zone. Unless the authorities take special care in maintenance of the beach, tourists won’t come to the beach,” Prashanth said. Many of the travel agencies are striking down Kochi from the list of favourite destinations due to lack of hygiene.  “Even if KMRL undertakes the maintenance of the beach, there should be proper monitoring on the part of the authorities. Otherwise, the situation will continue to be the same. Progress of many of the projects being implemented by Kochi Metro in the area is not so satisfactory,” Prashanth said. At the same time, Antony Kureethra, the councillor from Fort Kochi and opposition leader in Kochi corporation, expressed hopes of better days for the beach if the Metro authorities take over its maintenance. “The other day, we cleaned the beach using excavators,” Kureethra said. Though Fort Kochi beach, among other ones in the state, was opened a few days ago, the number of tourists visiting the beach is very low. “It is mainly those from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts who visit the beach. No tourist from other states is paying a visit to Fort Kochi,” a resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kmrl-plans-to-take-up-beach-maintenance-in-fort-kochi/articleshow/86590613.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

For instance, Nitesh, a resident of Habsiguda, had been requesting the Rangareddy district collectorate for the last seven months to remove his patta land. Instead of one part of the survey number, the entire survey number was included in the prohibitory list, as a result of which he is unable to sell his land. Like Nitesh, thousands of residents’ grievances, which were accepted a few months ago, remain unresolved. Officials said as many as 30 issues pertaining to Dharani portal have been identified by district collectors and sent to the chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA). The state cabinet a few days ago constituted a cabinet subcommittee headed by finance minister T Harish Rao and other ministers to identify and resolve various issues of Dharani. “While some survey numbers are wrongly entered into the prohibitory list as government land or ceiling land or waqf land, there is no option for entry of section 22A (prohibiting the sale and fresh registration of the listed land) land cases in the prohibitory list in respect of missing government land and court cases,” an additional collector in north Telangana said. He said in case of non-agriculture land assessment (NALA) issues, the land records show a piece of land as agriculure land even after land conversion orders had been issued. “In some cases, agriculture land is being shown as NALA,” he explained. People are upset with the revenue department, especially CCLA, as there is no option for correction of wrong entries of pattadars. “For the mistakes done by revenue staff, we are compelled to approach the district collector by submitting all evidences through MeeSeva,” B Ravi Kumar, a resident of Boduppal, said. While the government claimed that successions and mutations would happen within minutes on Dharani, the situation on the ground is far from satisfactory. “The succession in land records has not been happening in tribal belts while in other areas, succession is being accepted for assigned land only after the demise of the original assignee. In case of settlement issues, the succession and mutations for assigned are not happening,” a tahsildar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-30-issues-pertaining-to-dharani-portal-identified/articleshow/86591648.cms||Koride Mahesh

Agriculture superintendents from each of the districts in the state have been appointed as nodal officers by the respective district collectors to assist the ACB. “In the drought-prone Marathwada region, 287 water conservation schemes in Beed, 43 works in Aurangabad, three in Jalna, one in Osmanabad, 25 in Nanded, 13 in Parbhani, seven in Latur and five in Hingoli district will be investigated,” said an ACB official. Aurangabad ACB superintendent of police Rahul Khade told TOI, “We will investigate to see if there were any violations in terms of the tendering process, quality of work, measurements of the actual work as compared to the details on record and supervisory flaws.” Those privy to the probe maintained that all ACB units in the state received a written communication and initiated an open inquiry into the identified works carried out under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan in the first week of September. The Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan was started by the Devendra Fadnavis-led government between 2014 and 2019. It aimed at making the state drought-free by 2019 by improving the groundwater level. Under the scheme, several works, including construction of farm ponds, cleaning and deepening of river beds and construction of weirs on streams and channels were carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/acb-probes-384-works-under-jalyukt-shivar/articleshow/86593350.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Somaiya also leveled fresh allegations against Mushrif and his relatives, alleging that they are involved in another major scam. Somaiya’s complaint at the Murgud police station is related to the alleged siphoning of money from non-existent companies into Sir Senapati Santaji Ghorpade Sugar Factory, which, Somaiya claims, is a benami property of Mushrif and his family members. After registering the complaint, Somaiya said, “I will be giving the evidence in a few days. I expect the police to register the FIR against Mushrif and his family members within seven days. If that is not done, I will move appropriate court.” At a press conference, Somaiya — who had earlier alleged scams worth Rs 127 crore and Rs 50 crore — leveled fresh allegations claiming that Mushrif had given the contract to collect taxes from 28,000 gram panchayats to his son-in-law. “Mushrif is the rural development minister and is misusing his position. He has given the contract to his son-in-law’s firm. The firm collects Rs 50,000 from each gram panchayat, while the actual tax the gram panchayats have to pay is Rs 2,500,” he said. Mushrif refutes allegations, files Rs 100 crore lawsuit Mushrif, however, refuted Somaiya’s latest allegation. “Like the two earlier allegations, the third one is baseless too. None of my family members has received any tender. Now he (Somaiya) will come up with a fourth and then a fifth allegation. I will not respond to these.” Mushrif has filed a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against Somaiya for making false claims. Prashant Chitnis, Mushrif’s lawyer, said: “Over the past 15 days, BJP leader Somaiya has been making statements and publishing allegations on various platforms. This has tarnished the image of the minister. To seek compensation for the defamation, we have filed a suit with the Kolhapur civil court. We have requested the court to issue an order asking Somaiya to not make further allegations.” Somaiya’s visit was otherwise peaceful as he faced no opposition from Mushrif’s supporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/somaiya-lodges-complaint-against-mushrif-levels-new-allegation/articleshow/86589740.cms||---

Acting on a complaint lodged by the Salcete mamlatdar, the Fatorda police have already booked a case with regards to the fraudulent manner in which several properties were sought to be grabbed from the original landowners without their knowledge. TOI on Wednesday had highlighted a case wherein a Curtorim resident had been fraudulently dispossessed of 1,20,000 sqm of his land. “It appears to be a serious matter of forgery in survey records and operation of a suspected gang or persons in collision with staff related to mutation in the above cases cannot be ruled out,” reads the letter written by the South Goa collector to the vigilance department, while asking it to conduct an inquiry into 13 such cases. Besides, deputy collector (revenue), Snehal Prabhu, has written to the town and country planner (TCP), Margao, state registrar, and sub-divisional officer, Salcete, drawing their attention to such cases so that any further progress in the fraudulently-done process is preempted. “Some instances have been reported to this office of forged sale deeds being executed without being registered with the sub-registrar’s office concerned and mutations have been carried out based on such forged sale deeds which are now being reviewed by this office,” Prabhu said in her letter to TCP, Margao. Stating that a review application is pending for revision with the appropriate authority with regard to some 11 properties, Prabhu has asked the TCP “not to give any NOC and ensure that no permission for sub-division of plots and development of any nature is permitted” on the land bearing those specific survey numbers till further notice. In a similar letter to the state registrar, Prabhu has asked that no sale deed, gift deed or any other conveyance deed or mode of any transfer pertaining to those survey numbers be processed or registered. The conversion cell of Salcete mamlatdar and the Salcete sub-divisional officer have also been directed against proceeding with partition/conversion cases pertaining to those properties. As the offences were committed between 2018 and 2019, Prabhu has asked those departments to furnish details of any such NOCs or permissions issued with regard to those survey numbers from January 2018 till date “for taking necessary action if required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vigilance-dept-to-probe-13-land-grab-cases/articleshow/86592695.cms||---
---||Nashik||Agri dept fears fresh crop damage in north Maha||Nashik: The agriculture department on Tuesday apprehended that fresh spell of rains could damage the ready-to-harvest mung, urad and bajra crops in North Maharashtra . These crops are grown on over 2 lakh hectare in Nashik, Jalgaon and Dhule districts and out of this bajra crop alone is cultivated on around 1.37 lakh hectare. “Harvest of these three crops takes place at this time every year. Currently, around 60% of mung and urad have been harvested, but that of Bajra is yet to start. Our fear is that part of the remaining 40% of mung and urad crops along with Bajra that is yet to be harvested could either be partially or fully damaged due to the ongoing rainfall,” an agriculture department official said. According to the official, wet field condition may lead to sprouting in mature crops, damaging the crops before it is harvested. It would be an economical loss to the farmers involved in cultivating these three crops. In Nashik district the damage would be more in Malegaon, Nandgaon and Satana talukas. “The rains can also damage some varieties of vegetables due to water stagnation in the fields. But the damage would be in some pockets of the region,” the official said, adding the agriculture department with the help of the local revenue officials will undertake a survey to ascertain the quantum of crop damage. Rajendra Talekar, farmer from Nandgaon taluka, said the frequent rainfall this month have spelled doom for a large section of the farmers. “Many farmers are unable to harvest their crops due to the rains. It has been raining in our taluka for the last one week due to which water had filled in our fields,” he added. An assessment by the state agriculture department after the rain earlier this month said crops in over 64,400 hectare were partially or fully damaged in North Maharashtra — adversely affecting over 83,000 farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/agri-dept-fears-fresh-crop-damage-in-north-maha/articleshow/86589739.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Menace can’t be moved from roads||AHMEDABAD: Each year between June and September, just when monsoon arrives, thousands of stray cattle migrate to city roads, not for pasture but to escape insects like mosquitoes and flies. This clearly reflects in the average 10,000 to 15,000 cattle seizures made by the civic body’s cattle nuisance and control department (CNCD) during these months. During other months, the numbers are just half. “Rainy season results in an increase in the insect density across the city including mosquitoes and houseflies in stables. Due to this proliferation of insects, cows get irritated and tend to come out in the open dry places. The strength of CNCD teams remains the same but the number of cattle on the roads increases every year during these months creating a problem for the department as well as commuters,” said a senior official. The department caught 17,752 stray cattle in 2019, 10,064 cattle were caught in 2020 while this year the department has caught 6,456 stray cattle so far. The official said that the CNCD teams also have to face violent attacks from cattle owners when they try to catch strays. “Many a time our teams get attacked by cattle owners when we are in the process of catching strays. Local residents are also scared of these cattle owners as many of them are notorious and violent,” he said. Hitesh Barot, chairman of AMC’s standing committee, said that the civic authority is planning to take strict action against such cattle owners who attack or create obstructions in CNCD’s performance of official duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/menace-cant-be-moved-from-roads/articleshow/86591645.cms||---

The civic agency had keenly felt the shortage of doctors when the twin cities reeled under the onslaught of the pandemic’s second iteration.Many prominent private doctors have expressed their willingness to lend their expertise to the HDMC. They have agreed to visit the HDMC’s maternity hospital daily, and address the various problems that the patients may have. Dr Rajan Deshpande, a senior paediatrician, and former governor of Rotary Dharwad, expressed his desire to see glory and reputation restored to HDMC’s maternity hospital in Dharwad.“We requested members of Rotary, who are also doctors, to collaborate with the HDMC in the capacity of honorary consultants, and all of them have consented. Paediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, gynaecologists, general surgeons, among other experts, have expressed their interest to serve at the hospital. They will spend at least two or three hours at this hospital,” Dr Deshpande said.HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said, “We have made all the necessary arrangements at the hospital in Dharwad, including setting up of five separate cabins for doctors, and building a laboratory. The building is being renovated, and the road to the hospital being asphalted. We are launching this programme on a trial basis, and depending on the response, we will decide on extending it to other hospitals, should more private doctors volunteer.”HDMC health officer Sridhar Dandappanavar said that the honorary doctors would work at the hospital in the afternoon. “Consultation will be free, and the registration charge for patients will be nominal. We have installed an ultrasonography machine at the hospital, and will fix the price for the scan soon,” Dandappanavar said.Malamaddi resident Ashok Kurahatti lauded the initiative, confident of its success. “It is a unique idea, one that will greatly benefit the poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hdmc-to-rope-in-pvt-doctors-for-dharwad-maternity-hospital/articleshow/86590615.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Visitors park their vehicles on the arterial roads and create traffic bottlenecks, often leading to verbal spats with local people. Lack of a designated parking area and ample signboards to direct devotees through alternative routes were cited as major reasons for the troubles.According to Trichy city traffic police, close to 500 cars arrive at Arulmigu Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam every day. Since Purattasi month is considered auspicious, devotees from various parts of the state arrive in their personal vehicles. More than 75% of the vehicles are parked in the no-parking zone, troubling public transportation and local people. Traffic police said that the devotees were forced to violate rules as there is no mechanism to guide the visitors to reach the temple and the dedicated parking area. “Some devotees intentionally park their vehicle well on the roads, but some are genuinely unaware. Signboards to help tourists reach the designated parking area and temple are missing at crucial junctions,” a traffic police official said. The devotees often pay Rs 300 for parking violations.While devotees arriving in their own vehicles can access Ranga Ranga gopuram and Thayaar Sannidhi entrances via Raghavendrapuram, most of them enter the congested Thiruvadi street. While leaving the temple, devotees continue to use the congested Amma Mandapam and Gandhi Roads instead of taking the Kollidam Flood Bank Road to reach Chennai NH. There is no signboard to suggest alternative routes.Same is the situation of Thiruvanaikoil Jambukeswarar temple that lacks a spacious parking arena. Entering and exiting the temple frustrates the devotees. “Signboards were placed by the temple management to guide the devotees. As far as parking, temple management has no land, only Trichy corporation can resolve this issue,” an official source with HR&CE said. Lack of coordination between the HR&CE, traffic police and Trichy Corporation was cited as the major reason for the inconveniences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-end-to-traffic-woes-in-srirangam/articleshow/86592696.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||Pune: 6 booked for Rs 52 lakh fraud promising good returns||PUNE: The Alandi police on Monday registered a case against six persons, including two women, on the charge of duping seven people of Rs 52.32 lakh on the promise of good returns on their investments. The suspects allegedly took money from the victims over the last two years, but failed to deliver on any promise. A 34-year-old woman from Ambegaon taluka lodged a complaint with the police. The complainant and her relatives have lost Rs 24.40 lakh to the fraudsters. When contacted, the complainant told TOI that she first came in contact with one of the woman suspects in 2019. “This woman promised us that if we invested money in a Bavdhan-based company, we would get double the amount within a year,” the complainant said. The victim borrowed money by mortgaging her gold ornaments and gave it to the accused. “We gave her Rs 24.40 lakh, but got no returns. Moreover, the woman also lured us to buy a vehicle for her. We took a loan in her name. Now, we are repaying that loan,” the complainant said. She added that some of the directors of the bogus company are from Thane district. “Recently, when we went to the house of one of the directors, he did not turn up. Instead, he sent over some men to threaten us. He had alerted the local police,” the complainant said. The woman tracked down six more investors, who were duped by the suspects, and filed a first information report (FIR). “There are more than 30 people who have invested money with these scamsters,” she alleged. An officer of Alandi police told TOI that the suspects have been booked under sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6-booked-for-rs-52l-fraud-promising-good-returns/articleshow/86591668.cms||---
---||Kochi||Poll fiasco: CPM expels Shaju Jacob||Kochi: In a major disciplinary action, the CPM has decided to expel Ernakulam district committee member and Koothattukulam area secretary Shaju Jacob from the party and also to suspend many leaders, including district secretariat members N C Mohanan and C K Manishankar, for one year. Though the district committee had settled on comparatively minor disciplinary action like demoting Manishankar to the district committee and censuring Mohanan, the state committee demanded serious action against all those who failed to discharge their responsibilities in the last assembly elections. The stringent action against top leaders at a time when organizational conferences and polls are getting underway is seen as a strong message that the party wouldn’t allow indiscipline and anti-party activities by anybody. The strict disciplinary actions were taken on the basis of inquiry reports by C M Dineshmani, P M Ismail, Gopi Kottamurickal and K J Jacob. Shaju Jacob had come out in the open against the candidature of Sindhumol Jacob of Kerala Congress (M) from Piravom constituency immediately after the LDF announcing her candidature. This had adversely affected the prospects of the LDF candidates in many segments. As most of the all-powerful leaders from Perumbavoor facing the sword of disciplinary action, the party would be facing a dearth of leadership in the area. At the same time, there is another view that it will be an opportunity for a fresh and clean leadership to lead the party. The party found that the leaders from Perumbavoor such as N C Mohanan, V K Soman, V P Saseendran, area secretary P M Salim, area committee members CBA Jabbar, M I Beeras, former MLA Saju Paul and R M Ramachandran failed to work for the victory of LDF candidate Babu Joseph of Kerala Congress (M). All the leaders except CBA Jabbar have been suspended, while Jabbar has been removed from all the elected posts in the party. The CPM Ernakulam district committee and district secretariat meeting held on September 14 had decided to take disciplinary action, mostly demotion, against those including top leaders. Manishankar, former deputy mayor of Kochi corporation, had been an aspirant for mayor’s post this time. But the party didn’t approve of his candidature in the elections. He was also eyeing the candidature from Thrikkakara seat in the assembly elections, it is learnt. District committee member and former secretary of Tripunithura area committee C N Sundaran has been suspended for his lethargic approach in the election campaigns of CPM candidate M Swaraj in Tripunithura. Sundaran had been the power centre in Tripunithura for several years. Another powerful leader and secretary of Vyttila area committee, K D Vincent, faced the action for not working for the victory of LDF candidate Dr J Jacob from Thrikkakara. Also, there are allegations that some of the leaders received huge sums from candidates of other constituents in the LDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/poll-fiasco-cpm-expels-shaju-jacob/articleshow/86592719.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||GIC now green drive across country, 16 cr saplings planted||Hyderabad: The Green India Challenge (GIC), which was taken up with a slogan Hara Hain Tho Bara Hain (If it is green, it is complete) three years ago to improve green cover, has now turned into a green movement across the country. Over 16 crore saplings were planted in 10 states under the green movement. Many people right from celebrities, political personalities and environmentalists participated in the GIC in the past three years. The GIC was initiated by TRS MP Joginapally Santosh Kumar taking inspiration from Telanganaku Haritha Haram (THH) programme launched by Telangana CM KCR five years ago. The Haritha Haram programme was started by the state government to increase the forest cover in the state from the existing 24% to 33%. “THH is a testimony of KCR’s vision for the overall development of state and its citizens. The logic behind is simple. The thick, dense forest cover ensures timely arrival of seasons, rains, which in turn increases the agricultural productivity, reduces environmental pollution, instils healthy living and the list of benefits will go on, right? And I too wanted to do my bit for the environment,” Santosh Kumar told TOI. The founder of GIC, Santosh adopted 2,042 acres of Keesara reserve forest as a part of ‘Gift A Smile Challenge’ on the occasion of minister KTR’s birthday. It was perhaps the first time an entire forest was adopted by an individual with an aim to care for it. Later Bahubali star Prabhas came forward to protect 1,650 acres of Kazipally reserve forest and Hetero Pharma agreed to shield the greenery and life in 2,543 acres of Mumbapur-Nallavelli reserve forest. The challenge gained momentum with people from all over the world sending in images, videos, responses, positive opinions about taking part in GIC, Santosh said.  The GIC announced May 10, 2020 as a Sweet Lime Day or Battayi Day and urged public to buy it in large quantities. The unique concept paid off, with various NGOs, companies, apartment, gated community associations, even individuals stepping forward and buying around 200 metric tonnes of sweet lime. This generated ample income for the farming community. KCR expressed his happiness on this initiative and planted a Rudraksha sapling. “I hope that Green India Challenge will grow forever and continue to motivate all of us around to be a part of nurturing and saving the environment. I congratulate Santosh Kumar and his team for this wonderful programme,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gic-now-green-drive-across-country-16-cr-saplings-planted/articleshow/86591804.cms||Koride Mahesh

The fire brigade and civic administration were on their toes following calls of tree-felling and need to pump excess rainwater from waterlogged areas. While authorities concerned attended 28 such calls from different areas of the city till Tuesday evening, the necessary work resulted in power outage in some areas where branches of fallen trees had led to snapping of overhead power cables. In one of the major incidents, a large tree near Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) headquarters was uprooted on Tuesday morning, damaging four four-wheelers and an autorickshaw. No loss of lives were reported due to rain-related incidents till Tuesday evening. The incessant showers also saw heavy discharge from nearly filled Harsul dam, resulting in snapping of road-connectivity between Jatwada area and the main city due to submerging of the connecting bridge. The Kham River which passes from old city limits and other parts of Aurangabad was in full vigour. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said the civic administration was prepared to deal with rain-induced emergency following an alert from IMD. “The ongoing public movement for restoration of Kham river that involves cleanliness and ecological revival of the river has minimized the possible damage due to incessant showers. We appeal to the citizens to contribute in our sustained efforts towards keeping Kham river clean and alive by making it free from dumping and other man-made damages,” he said.

---||Kochi||Kochi: Uncertainty looms large over fate of ‘pandemic pets’||KOCHI: With workplaces and schools reopening, fear looms large over the fate of pet animals they bought during the lockdown period to tide over the boredom. Animal rights activists and vets in Kochi have already started receiving calls from people seeking options to put up their pets for adoption as they have to go back to offices in other places. Some people even expressed willingness to sell their pets at throwaway prices. Once schools are open, they fear abandoning of pets will snowball into a major issue. “I have a cat and three kittens. I got her during the last lockdown. I was the one who took care of her. Now, I have to move back to Bengaluru and no one is there to take care of her. So, will you be able to accommodate her?,” reads one of the messages received by Daya Animal Welfare Organization in Muvattupuzha recently. “Sadly, most of the pets were adopted by them during various adoption drives or picked up from roadsides out of sympathy or fascination. We receive many calls from parents saying that their kids insist on buying a pet. But parents are not keen to keep it. Once the puppy grows up, people find ways to give up animals. Let the stray dogs survive on the streets. Now, they lose both home care and survival instinct on streets, if they are abandoned on roads,” says Ambili Purackal of Daya Foundation. Dr Sooraj K, a veterinary doctor in a private hospital in the city, says they receive calls from pet parents asking to find out people in his acquaintance to buy their dogs as they are moving outside Kerala as restrictions have been lifted. “When many returned to Kerala from Bengaluru and other places during the lockdown last year, they bought puppies at Rs 20,000-30,000. As offices reopened, they wanted to go back. They are asking to find out anyone who can buy their pet dogs even at half the price,” says Dr Sooraj. Another animal rights activist laments that there are takers for foreign breed puppies, though most of the pet parents are ignorant of how to take care of them. “There are no takers for Indian breed dogs when we put them up for adoption. But we receive calls for foreign breeds, including Rottweiler, Labrador and German Shepherd. But once these puppies grow up, pet parents find it difficult to keep them due to rising expenses and its behaviour. This is all because of their ignorance,” says Aswini of Pet Oneness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uncertainty-looms-large-over-fate-of-pandemic-pets/articleshow/86590644.cms||T C Sreemol

The objective of the eviction was to ensure a clear view of the stone architecture, but now all the efforts have turned into a futile attempt.The space between two stone pillar halls situated in front of the colossal Rajagopuram of Ranganathaswamy temple is occupied by hawkers and shops. While the HR&CE department evicted three shops unlawfully occupying the stone hall on May 31, the encroachers are back again to utilise the public space near the hall. “There was no follow-up by the authorities. The space near the stone hall is encroached again,” T Santhanakrishnan, a resident of Thiruvalluvar Street, said. Visitors to the shops are further causing bottlenecks by parking their vehicles on the road.“We will discuss the issue with other stakeholders to evict the encroachments near our property,” an official with the HR&CE department said. However, the futile eviction drives are not only restricted to Srirangam. Encroachers have made a comeback on Heber Road in Bhima Nagar and East Boulevard Road near Gandhi market months after the eviction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/encroachments-back-at-stone-pillar-hall/articleshow/86592710.cms||Deepak Karthik

Malakiya was on his way to a doctor after he had mild fever and seasonal cold, when the incident happened. His neighbours at Rajdhani society in Chharanagar were in a state of shock when TOI contacted them. Malakiya along with his two grandsons in their twenties, Saurabh and Sohel, and a neighbour Ajay Kamlekar were on the way to a nearby general physician when a stray cow near Malakiya’s house attacked the four. TimesViewIn May 2018, AMC had promised the high court that it will ensure that all cattle is shifted from roads to gaushalas and animal hostels. It also began radio-tagging stray cattle. The AMC identified 2,822 pastoral families living within city limits for this purpose. The HC had clearly stated to “remove cattle from public roads because they not only hinder smooth and safe traffic movement, but also are very dangerous and sometimes fatal”. The state government as well as the AMC should adhere to its promise made to the HC and speedily shift the animals to areas outside city limits.The bovine continued to butt, trample and kick Malakiya even as neighbours desperately tried to rescue the old man. The trio accompanying Malakiaya had escaped the attack with minor injuries, but could not save Malakiya. The elderly man, by now had received injuries on his legs, back and chest and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Doctors could not save him and declared him brought dead. Sardarnagar Police inspector M M Solanki said that they had not received any complaint late in the evening on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stray-cow-kicks-butts-octogenarian-to-death/articleshow/86591726.cms||---

---||Meerut||Army jawan’s kin get closure 16 years after he went missing on Himalayan expedition||MEERUT/UTTARKASHI: In 2005, while negotiating the dangerous downward climb of the Satopanth peak in the Garhwal Himalayas, three Indian Army soldiers went missing. Two bodies were found, but that of Amrish Tyagi, a Naik from UP, wasn't. Sixteen years passed, a daughter he never got to see grew up, his mother died with the unfulfilled wish to see her son one last time and his wife remarried after a long wait. Last week, during another Satopanth expedition by the Army, a body was found, frozen, in fatigues and with mountaineering equipment strewn all around it. The Army has now confirmed it was that of Tyagi, giving his family a long-due closure. “Naik Amrish Tyagi, from Modinagar in UP, was just 32 when he fell into a crevasse and died,” said Colonel Rajendra Prasad, commanding officer of the 9th Bihar Regiment. “His identity was confirmed on the basis of the Army uniform and the (mountaineering) toolkit that was found intact. His family members also confirmed the identity.” The Army had initially said they would wait for a DNA report before confirming his identity but given the evidence they had — Tyagi was the only soldier in the records who had gone missing on Satopanth and his physical description matched — they didn’t have to wait for it. “We handed the body over to the Army after they sent us a confirmation letter,” said Uttarkashi SP Manikant Mishra. A long convoy of those from his village, Hansali in Muradnagar, followed the hearse as his body was brought home, playing patriotic songs, raising slogans, waving flags. The body was handed over with military honours. “Our mother died in 2019, still hoping to get one last look at her lost son,” said Vinesh Tyagi, Amrish’s elder brother, after the cremation. The Tyagi men have always been farmers. Amrish was the youngest of four brothers, following in his father’s footsteps to join the Army at 19. His father, too, was a Naik. “I am unlettered, so I could not join the Army. Our eldest brother had started working at a very young age to help the family. We didn’t have much,” Vinesh said. “Another brother was preparing for a government job. Amrish was the youngest and said he wanted to serve the nation, like father … He went in right after passing his Class X exams. He always loved running. He’d cover really long distances.” In 2003, his marriage was solemnised. His wife, Babita, was five months into her pregnancy when Amrish had to leave for the Satopanth expedition. He could never see his daughter, now 15. Babita remarried — another Army man — and attended Amrish’s funeral on Tuesday. Vinesh said, “It was hard, seeing his body. We bade him farewell with a heavy heart but finally found closure."

The video of the incident has gone viral on social media. According to the Government Railway Police (GRP), the incident was reported after the mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) train left the city railway junction for Mettupalayam around 5.55pm on Monday. K P Rahman, a lawyer who recorded the video of the incident and posted on his Facebook page, said he was surprised to see the train stopping near Thudiyalur around 6.10pm. “I am a regular train traveller and the MEMU stops only at Coimbatore North and Karamadai railway stations. When it neared Thudiyalur on Monday evening, the loco pilot applied brakes, bringing the train to a sudden halt. The loco pilot got down from the train and forced the man lying on the track to leave the place with the help of home guard Dharmaraj. The man was in an inebriated state,” Rahman told TOI. He said the loco pilot had spotted the man on the track from a distance. “While he applied the brakes, at least five train coaches had passed over the man before it came to a halt. The drunk man didn’t suffer any injuries.” The GRP said they hadn’t registered any case against the drunk man. “He would have died had he attempted to get up from the track while the train was moving. The loco pilot made the right decision by stopping the train on seeing him, as anything would have happened otherwise.” They said they had decided to intensify patrol along the track to control people’s movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/loco-pilot-stops-train-on-time-to-save-drunk-man-on-track/articleshow/86591751.cms||---

Such initiatives were affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in staff shortage. Sarika Funde, a veterinary surgeon who joined the PMC last month to oversee sterilisation and vaccination work, said, “Though birth control measures took a back seat during the pandemic, we have ramped up operations now. We have partnered with Canine Control and Care NGO, which will sterilise the strays at the PMC dog pounds on a no-profit-no-loss basis. We have given work orders to two NGOs to run the three dog pounds in Baner and Mundhwa, each of which currently have around 100 kennels, and at Sangamwadi area (Naidu Hospital pound), with over 60 kennels.” She added, “The target is to carry out 1,000 sterilisations every month at each pound. Strays not sterilised are caught by the PMC workers and brought to any of the three pounds, where they are operated upon and kept under observation for three days before being returned to the place they were picked up from. All the dogs brought in are also given anti-rabies shots and their right ear is clipped to indicate that they have been sterilised.” On the occasion of World Rabies Day on September 28, the PMC sent eight veterinarians in as many vehicles to different parts of the city to give anti-rabies shots to strays. “This initiative will continue till October 13,” she said. Surashree Deshpande, who works for the welfare of strays, said, “There has been a 40% increase in female dogs discarded by breeders over the last few months. People bought puppies during the start of the pandemic, but now that they have been called back to work, there has been a rise in dogs being abandoned.” Neha Panchamia, founder and president, RESQ Charitable Trust, said that they have been working on female-dog centric sterlisation initiative while also educating communities about it. “Sterilisation is only one part of animal birth control programme. We also need to educate the public about co-existing with strays,” she said Animal activist Anita Shetty said, “NGOs should collaborate with local feeders who are more acquainted with strays in their areas, to help get them sterilised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-steps-up-to-check-stray-dog-population/articleshow/86591746.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The BJP-run East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) is planning to construct a building at the place of the temple in Chauhan Bangad ward, he claimed. “EDMC has put up a board outside the premises, which reads ‘the map of this plot has been approved by EDMC’. BJP’s intention is to construct a building there and then spread hatred on WhatsApp,” Bharadwaj said, adding that BJP wanted to make it an issue in the election, not the party’s work. “When our councillors exposed this conspiracy, both the elected and nominated councillors were suspended for 15 days. This is a blatant abuse of power,” said the AAP functionary. He asked why BJP was yet to take action on the temple issue. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP was cooking up baseless stories. “The temple owners got an online building plan sanctioned and as soon as it came to the knowledge of the zonal authorities, they got it stalled and it is being revoked,” said Kapoor. “Civic bodies can act against unauthorised construction, but can’t stop individual property owners from applying for building plans,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-bjp-trying-to-polarise-opinion-before-civic-elections/articleshow/86591778.cms||---

All 1,200 OFB officials and staff have been transferred to the newly formed seven defence PSUs and directorate of ordnance (coordination and services) from October 1. The OFB was the corporate headquarters of the 41 ordnance factories across India and has been operating from this office since January 9, 1979. The offices were first located at Park Street and then Esplanade East. “Earlier, the OFB was known as Directorate General of Ordnance Factories (DGOF), and before that as Directorate General of Munitions Production (DGMP),” said Baren Banerjee, former union leader and an ex-OFB employee. A senior OFB official said: “We have to honour the government’s decision.” After OFB employees vacate their offices, the part of the building will be handed back to the defence ministry. “While this was to happen, it is depressing to think that this will be the last working week for all of us in these offices,” said an employee, adding “While we have been asked to join on a two-year deputation at the new units, our service conditions and rules have not been framed. So, there is a lot of anxiety, but we have been told that it will not be below the level of our present job.” The secretary of OFB could not be contacted and OFB chairperson CS Vishwakarma did not respond to a TOI email on the issue of the dissolution of OFB. Sandeep Jain, director, defence department of production (DDP) under the ministry of defence (MoD), in a communication on September 24, wrote that this was pursuant to a Union cabinet decision on June 2021. The letter quoted Jain, saying, “GoI has decided to transfer, with effect from October 1, 2021, the management, control, operations and maintenance of these 41 production units. Earlier, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dola Sen had met Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and requested that none should lose job. She urged him to set up at least two defence PSUs in Bengal and have a directorate of ordnance in Kolkata.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ofb-to-shut-babughat-offices-after-4-decades/articleshow/86591788.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Mumbai||Report on compliance of order on potholes, Bombay HC tells state govt||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the state chief secretary to reply about compliances made to orders passed in a suo motu public interest litigation on the poor condition of roads across Maharashtra. A bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and S G Dige heard contempt petition filed in 2019 by advocate Ruju Thakker regarding wilful non-compliance of February 24/April 12, 2018 orders. Her petition said that “most roads in Mumbai, including arterial roads, have developed potholes.” “This is statewide and not only confined to the city of Bombay (sic). The state has not bothered to reply. We are here to assist the court as citizens,” argued senior advocate Janak Dwarkadas for Thakker. He said the HC, besides holding that it was the statutory duty of authorities to maintain good roads, had imposed a further duty on the state government to set up a centralised grievance redressal mechanism and file quarterly reports. This was in addition to grievance mechanisms for municipal corporations and councils . “As far as we know, it is non-existent, not working and nobody is able to access it. There are people dying because of potholes. Pregnant women have lost children…The taxpayer is paying taxes to get this at the end of the day,” said Dwarkadas. He added that had the orders “been complied with rather than observed in breach, we would not see what we are seeing.” Dwarkadas referred to BMC’s reply that it has complied with the orders. “Corporation wants us to believe there are no potholes in the city. On a daily basis, there are 900 potholes whether you are travelling from western or eastern express highways. The condition of roads is pathetic. What has the state done to hold any body accountable?” he asked. The judges enquired if there is a grievance mechanism for Mumbai. Dwarkadas replied that “there is an app (by BMC) and we have listed the difficulties faced to access it.” He urged that a responsible officer of the state file an affidavit on compliances. The judges then directed the chief secretary to file the affidavit and the advocate general to appear in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-report-on-compliance-of-order-on-potholes-hc-tells-state-govt/articleshow/86593407.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Mokariya was arrested by the crime branch on Monday night for helping Bhatt escape from the city. The police said that Mokariya had taken Bhatt to Ranoli highway some days ago for ‘settling’ the matter of rape through some associates. “From there, Mokariya dropped Bhatt in Ahmedabad in his own car,” the police said. Senior police officials said that Mokariya knew the girl since last year. “Mokariya owns Harmony Hotel in the city. The girl had stayed in that hotel last year for 20 days during the lockdown. She was introduced to Mokariya by her friend Pranav Shukla, a small-time businessman, last year. Mokariya had later introduced her to Bhatt,” the police added. Investigating officials said that Mokariya had also tried to strike a compromise between the girl and Bhatt some time ago. But Mokariya’s arrest before the key accused could be traced surprised many in the police department, as he was neither an accused nor the girl, had made any accusations against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mokariya-tried-to-strike-compromise/articleshow/86590504.cms||---

The photograph on the hoardings showed a knife and blood oozing from it.

---||Coimbatore||Corpn to desilt four major canals||Coimbatore: The city corporation is planning to desilt major canals running through its limits before the onset of northeast monsoon to prevent flooding of low-lying areas. The corporation had cleaned storm water drains for about 184km in a week-long exercise that ended on Saturday. The city has storm water drains running up to 1,500km. An official with the corporation’s engineering wing said there were four major canals running through the city. Sanganoor Pallam, which starts at Thadagam Valley and ends at Singanallur tank, covering a distance of 11.5km, is the longest of them, followed by Raja Vaikkal, which starts in Noyyal and ends in Periyakulam, covering a distance of 6.5km. The remaining two major canals include the one running through Ganapathy and the other one passing through Ondipudur. An official with the East zone corporation office said three of the canals were running through their limits. “The cleaning drive will commence on Wednesday. Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara had inspected a couple of canals and given go ahead on Monday. They are clogged at a few points. It will take nearly one to three hours to unclog each point. We are planning to complete the work within this week itself.” Pointing out that the canals come under the purview of the Public Works Department, the official said it was normal for the civic body to clean them ahead of monsoon to ensure smooth flow of water and prevent flooding of low-lying areas. “There are many smaller canals in the city. They will be cleaned as and when required.” Another corporation official, meanwhile, urged the people residing along the canals not to dump waste into them. “People often dump garbage, and construction and demolition debris in the water channels, clogging them.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-to-desilt-four-major-canals/articleshow/86591792.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra hits 8 crore vaccinations, but with urban-rural skew||MUMBAI: Maharashtra has completed eight crore vaccinations against Covid-19, immunizing nearly 62% of its population with at least one dose and over a quarter with both. Experts, however, called for an urgent review of the immunisation strategy to address disparity in coverage between districts. The state administered 8,00,57,994 doses until Tuesday evening, covering 5.65crore with at least one shot and 2.35crore with both. But 23 of the 35 districts are below the state’s average of 25.6% in complete vaccination. Nanded and Hingoli at the bottom have given double doses to barely 14% of population in comparison to Mumbai’s 44% and Pune’s 39%. With travel unhindered now, it could be a threat. Immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune said in places where vaccine coverage and sero-positivity is low, chances of outbreaks are higher. “If somebody is coming from a district with low coverage and goes to another district with similar poor coverage, person will be capable of spreading the infection to a significant population because a big share is uncovered,” she said. While the third wave may not be huge, there could be localised outbreaks, say after a wedding or a political rally. Disproportion plays out in single dose immunization too, where 19 districts are far below the state average. In Nanded, which has lowest coverage, 38% of its population has got a single shot. In comparison, 89.5% in Mumbai have got at least one jab. Experts say the state must urgently alter its strategy of allocating the bulk of doses to bigger districts, particularly if seroprevalence is more than 80%. They say the urban bias may impact those with limited access. In terms of age, data shows more than 30% who are 45-plus are yet to get even one shot. In the 18-44 group, it is nearly 50%. Epidemiologist Dr JP Muliyil, member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, said states mustn’t forget the end goal of vaccination is to prevent deaths. “In younger people, there have been three deaths in a population of 10,000, which is negligible,” he said, calling it imperative to cover elderly or those with comorbidities In Maharashtra, almost 45% of vaccine doses have been administered in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Nagpur alone. An official justified it saying the focus was always on vaccinating thickly populated cities, where mobility is higher. But in Muliyil’s opinion, it is flawed to link vaccination to RT-PCR positive cases rather than deaths. The strategy should also consider serological survey findings, says Bal. Mumbai’s fifth sero-survey found antibodies in 85% people, which begs the question as to whether centres with higher seroprevalence should continue to get more doses, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hits-8-cr-vaccinations-but-with-urban-rural-skew/articleshow/86591796.cms||Sumitra Debroy

District police have formed a dedicated team to probe the case. According to a senior police official, the child is currently under treatment for burn injuries at the Belagavi Institute of Medical Sciences (BIMS). The official said that the investigation team is also suspecting the role of parents as a missing complaint has not been filed so far in this regard. Police said the child was found in the sugarcane field on September 23 in a semi-conscious state with burn injuries. It looked like the girl was branded with burning camphors. The injuries were in a certain pattern all over the body which hinted at black magic. Police have also sent photographs of the toddler to neighbouring states to check for missing complaints. “No missing case has been filed in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with regard to the child,” said Belagavi SP Laxman Nimbaragi. Police are now working to trace the parents of the child. As there was no missing case, there is a possibility of parents’ involvement in subjecting the baby to black magic, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/police-suspect-black-magic-on-baby-girl-found-in-sugarcane-field/articleshow/86590329.cms||Shreyas HS

---||Kozhikode||Muslim woman’s Krishna painting presented to Kerala temple deity||KOZHIKODE/ KOTTAYAM: A painting of Lord Krishna as an infant by Jasna Salim, a 28 year-old devout Muslim homemaker and mother of two from Koyilandy in Kozhikode, was ritually presented on Sunday before the deity at Sree Krishna Swamy temple in Ulanadu, a small village near Pandalam in Pathanamthitta district. For Jasna, once fondly nicknamed ‘Kanna’ (‘dear child’ and a synonym for Krishna) by her family, it was a dream come true to have her painting of the infant Krishna (Unni Kannan) formally accepted by a Hindu temple. Though she had earlier gifted her paintings to Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple and also to a temple at Koyilandy, it was on Sunday for the first time that she could present it before the deity. Jasna’s interest in painting was by accident, while she was recuperating after a fall during her pregnancy, but soon became a passion.“I was moved by the gesture of the Ulanadu temple authorities when the priest adjusted the Tulasi garland which adorned the deity a bit so that I could see the flute held by Lord Krishna properly,” said Jasna. She added that she had gone to the temple after offering her regular morning namaz. Jasna’s interest in painting was by accident, while she was recuperating after a fall during her pregnancy, but soon became a passion. “I used to be called Kanna by my parents and relatives in my childhood. When I saw an image of Lord Krishna as a child in a newspaper while I was bedridden, I felt an urge to paint the picture and it came out well,” Jasna said, adding that she was hardly a born artist and had struggled to draw even the country's map during her student days. She has painted hundreds of pictures ever since this accidental artistic foray six years ago, and all her creations have featured just one single image — Lord Krishna. Jasna, whose immediate family comprises her husband Salim, who is employed in Dubai, and two children Lenshan and Leniska, revealed that initially she had to face opposition from some family members from her maternal side for drawing Lord Krishna, with some of them saying that it was against Islamic religious principles.Jasna, whose immediate family comprises her husband Salim, who is employed in Dubai, and two children Lenshan and Leniska, revealed that initially she had to face opposition from some family members from her maternal side for drawing Lord Krishna, with some of them saying that it was against Islamic religious principles. “But my husband and immediate family members supported me as they know that I am painting the image of Lord Krishna in the pursuit of art. Also there have been many instances in which Hindu families have made arrangements for me to offer namaz when I visit their houses and so what is wrong in drawing and giving a painting which helps a person of another religion pursue their faith,” she said. Ajith Kumar, the secretary of the Ulanadu temple committee, said that the temple authorities had requested Jasna for such a painting after coming to know that she had presented a similar one to Guruvayur temple. “The deity in this temple is Lord Krishna as a boy. Most of the paintings of Jasna were also of Lord Krishna of that age,” he said. He also said that a Pune-based devotee group ‘Tatvamasi’ helped in making this happen. “She had learnt more about the temple from the Facebook page of the temple and was also keen to present her paintings here,” added Ajith Kumar. He clarified that nobody is barred from visiting this temple. Jasna once gifted one of her Lord Krishna paintings to a Hindu family in her neighborhood and they kept it in their pooja room. “Later they told me that many of their wishes got fulfilled after that. Over a period of time people started approaching me for paintings and I was happy to paint Lord Krishna for all of them,” Jasna said. She said that she paints around five to six pictures a month and she has been getting a good number of orders, mostly from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jasna-salims-unni-kannan-a-hit-in-krishna-temple/articleshow/86592761.cms||K R Rajeev

The medical officer and nurse were suspended on Tuesday evening. Officials said on Monday evening, Rajkumar Yadav, from Atkoneshwaar Nagar, went to a nearby civic centre and mistakenly approached the unit where anti-rabies vaccines are given. Yadav was given the dose in two shots on his arms, without any medical staff ascertaining his case papers. But Yadav said he had undergone a critical operation two months back and showed his case papers to staff. “When I asked for the certificate, they realised their folly,” he said. Corporator Mangala Kalambe alerted mayor Naresh Mhakse, and a preliminary probe was ordered.

Patil, while reviewing the project, said the work would have been completed this year, but there was a delay due the second wave of the Covid pandemic. “The pipeline work along the 53-km-long stretch is almost complete. The work to develope the filter plant at Puikhadi has also been completed. Only the work at the Kalammawadi dam site is remaining. The major work of developing an intake well is difficult and has been halted due to the rain. The contractor will be deploying around 200 workers to speed up the dewatering and construction work,” he said. The project with a total outlay Rs 485 crore was launched in 2014 and has still not been completed. The main reason for non-completion of the project is the difficult terrain at the dam site and opposition by some villages over laying the pipeline. “All permissions were sought on time. Now, all major hurdles have been dealt with and I am hopeful that citizens will get clean and regular drinking water from the dam from May next year,” Patil said. “The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has undertaken the work to lay the pipeline network in Kolhapur city. The work was hampered by the contractors not carrying out road restoration after digging. The authorities will now discuss the issue with the contractors and get the issue resolved,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/water-supply-project-will-be-complete-by-may-22-satej-patil/articleshow/86589828.cms||---
---||Business||ED attaches Wadhawans’ Rs 578cr assets||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached assets worth Rs 578 crore (57 million) of Wadhawan Global Capital UK Ltd (WGCL) in a fraud case involving the Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). The attached assets are in the form of investments through WGC in UK companies. It’s the first provisional attachment in a money laundering case where DHFL used funds of the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL). The accused, DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and brother Deeraj Wadhawan, are already in custody in another money laundering case connected to Yes Bank. The state-owned UPPCL had allegedly invested Rs 4,123 crore from its employees’ provident fund corpus in DHFL as fixed deposit without taking required approval. The DHFL is yet to pay back Rs 2,268 crore of the principal. The ED investigation found that the Wadhawan brothers had siphoned off Rs 1,000 crore of the UPPCL money to UK after layering it through over 30 Indian companies controlled by them. The money trail led ED to WGCL. DHFL was disbursing high-value loans to other companies related to its promoters at the time when it received the UPPCL investment. DHFL sanctioned the unsecured loans to those companies on the direction of its then chairman Kapil Wadhawan, and most of the loans turned into non-performing assets. DHFL had a common account in which it would receive the UPPCL investment. In the same account, they were getting money from others sources, including as loan and investments. The brothers would siphon off money from this account showing them as loan to the other group companies. During the probe, the ED found that around Rs 450 crore came to the DHFL’s common accounts and was diverted in Wadhawan Global Capital (India) Ltd. From there the money was further diverted into the account of WGCL as investment. The ED case is based on a UP police FIR, which names Pravin Gupta, the then secretary of the UP Power Sector Employees’ Trust, and Sudhanshu Dwivedi, the then director, finance, of UPPCL. Later, the investigation was transferred to the CBI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ed-attaches-wadhawans-rs-578cr-assets/articleshow/86594024.cms||Vijay V Singh

Despite an increase in the number of seats this year, students are unable to secure admission to their favourite courses or schools. As the threefold rise in the number of students with A+ in all subjects is cited as the main reason, teachers and education experts suggest changing the SSLC exam evaluation from grade-only system to grade-cum-marks system just like for Plus Two. Teachers said that the grade-only assessment system makes admission to Plus One complex as all students scoring between 90% and 100% are treated equally as A+ grade, without mentioning their marks in the certificate. Hence, with the number of students securing full A+ rising, the competition too would get tougher, making the allotment more difficult. If the final marks are also mentioned, the allotment list could be based on it, thus reducing the crowd, teachers said. S Manoj, state general secretary of Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association, said that 4,76,040 applications were received last year in single window system, but this year there were only 4,65,219 applications, with a decrease in the number of applicants from state, CBSE, ICSE and other streams. Grading is indicative of the percentage range of the student’s result, but with marks, a student knows where exactly he/she stands. “The present SSLC evaluation system is unscientific as the number of students securing top grades is unusually higher than previous times. Those who work very hard and those who don’t equally, might sometimes end up with the same grades. So government could consider mentioning marks along with the grades to make the admission process easier,” said Manoj. Meanwhile, education department said that there are no such plans to introduce a marking system in SSLC as the grading system was introduced a decade ago to resolve issues and reduce the pressure on students. “Grading system has worked well all these years and there are no talks to re-introduce marking system,” said K Jeevan Babu, director of general education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/need-grade-and-marks-evaluation-system-for-sslc/articleshow/86592802.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

In case someone still doesn’t have a double dose vaccination certificates, he/she will have to provide an RT-PCR negative report before entering the poll booths. Prodded by the new norms, political party leaders in Bhowanipore started checking vaccination status of their polling agents and ensured everyone had printed certificates of double dose vaccination and those who still hadn’t received the double shots, RT-PCR tests were conducted on them on an urgent basis at the Mayors’ Clinic in Chetla and other private diagnostic centres on Tuesday. “Since Monday evening, we have been calling up our polling agents to ensure they have received their both doses of vaccines. On Tuesday, we called them to respective party offices from where print-outs of certificates were handed out to each of them which they need to keep in a file that will contain their identity cards, party seals, copies of electoral rolls, blank sheet of papers and pens. The Covid vaccination certificate will be a new addition to this list for the first time,” said Kartik Banerjee, a Trinamool Congress leader and brother of Bhowanipore’s TMC candidate and chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Banerjee said almost every polling agent in their party has been vaccinated. In fact, TMC ran a drive over the last three weeks to identify and vaccinate all their party workers who were involved in the election campaign of Mamata Banerjee with special stress on the polling agents. “Even on Monday, we had vaccinated a group of party workers with the second dose of the vaccine who would work as polling agents on Thursday,” said another senior leader in the party. BJP on the other hand said a large section of their polling agents are yet to receive two doses of the Covid vaccine and hence between Monday and Tuesday, all of them were made to undergo RT-PCR tests which they would carry to the polling booths on Thursday. “Many of our polling agents are yet to receive the second dose. Hence, the party made appointments and paid for their tests at different centres over the last two days to ensure all of them receive the report by Tuesday afternoon,” said Sajal Ghosh, chief election agent of BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal. Party leaders have also told polling agents to take care of themselves during this period and ensure they do not fall sick. “I had contracted Covid following the last assembly election which had delayed my vaccination process. However, I took my second dose of Covid vaccine last week and now I am all geared up to conduct my duty as a polling agent in the all-important election on Thursday,” said a Trinamool Congress polling agent from Chakraberia. Vaccination certificates or RT-PCR tests were not mandatory for polling agents even during the assembly election held in the state five months ago as vaccination for citizens below 45 — other than frontline workers — hadn’t begun then. Bengal had vaccinated 4.7 lakh poll officials though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/double-dose-vax-certs-must-for-poll-officials-and-agents/articleshow/86591838.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Schools want to open after Diwali, BMC yet to decide on October 4 date||MUMBAI: Most city schools are not keen on reopening next month as that’s when first semester exams will be held online. Principals said the best time to reopen schools would be the second semester that begins after Diwali, in November second week. That apart, in Mumbai, the civic chief is still to take a decision on reopening schools from October 4 for classes VIII to XII, as has been permitted by the state government for urban areas. Meanwhile, before schools reopen, the state paediatric task force has suggested a standard operating procedure (SOP) for systematic closure of schools in the event of Covid-19 cases on campus to avoid panic and knee-jerk reactions. Schools have also been told to use their own funds to set up health clinics and order equipment such as oximeters and infrared thermometers. “School closure should be advised when positive cases among students, teachers and non-teaching staffers of an institute rise above 5% of the total pupil strength in a 14-day period or 10 positive Covid cases get detected on school premises in a 14-day period,” Pramod Jog, task force member and senior paediatrician, told TOI on Tuesday.  On the reopening, the principal of a state board school said, “We have chalked out our plans for the first semester online exams, including for Class X. Teachers won’t be able to conduct physical classes and attend online exam-related work.” He said there are 50 to 60 students per class. Dividing them into batches to conduct online and offline classes needs a lot of planning. Another school head said exams will begin next week and the state is not in favour of conducting theory exams at least two weeks after physical schools resume. “We are starting our first semester exams for Class X from October 4. So, it will not be possible to have students in class,” said the principal. Students have been told of the possibility of offline exams but parents are not keen, the principal added. This time schools have not begun putting Covid protocols in place. “In August, we sanitized our classrooms but schools did not open. Now only after orders are received will we get down to putting all Covid protocols in place,” said a principal. Schools in Mumbai have remained shut since the March 2020 lockdown. The final decision to open schools rests with the civic chief or the collector.  Some international schools said they are fully prepared to start physical classes. Kavita Chatterjee, principal of Orchids The International School, Kurla, said, “Our students have exams till the second week of October and we can reopen by the end of next month.” Podar Education Network director Harsh Podar said they have put in place detailed and well-planned safety protocols for students’ return to school. Paediatricians have requested the state government to physically reopen schools on account of behavioural issues being exhibited by children following months of staying at home. Hyperactivity in children has increased. Sanjay Bafna, paediatrician and former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics, Pune branch, said, “These guidelines will help a school administration initiate appropriate steps and preclude fear and panic situations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-schools-want-to-open-after-diwali-bmc-yet-to-decide-on-oct-4-date/articleshow/86591848.cms||Sandhya Nair

Between September 22 and 24, polling personnel recruited by the Election Commission of India visited multiple households in the constituency, facilitating the voters aged above 80 years and those suffering from disability to vote at home on postal ballot. While the facility had started during the assembly  this year, voters had to apply for postal ballot system. This time, however, ECI officials visited the houses of elderly people and asked them whether they wanted to vote from home. Jharna Bhattacharya, an 82-year-old Harish Mukherjee Road resident, had skipped casting her vote for the first time on April 26 this year as she was too panicked to step out amidst the pandemic. She had hoped to skip it again but this time she could vote from the comfort of her bedroom. “My mother hadn’t voted last time as she was scared of stepping out due to the pandemic. But this time, she had voted happily from home. ECI officials came to our house around 10 days ago and asked her if she wanted to vote from home on a postal ballot. She agreed and voted while sitting on her bed last Wednesday,” said Sukhdeb Bhattacharya (60). Purnendu Mukherjee (83), a resident of Kedar Bose Lane and a retired travel agent, too, was elated with the facility and relieved that he wouldn’t need to stand in a queue to vote for the second time in around five months. “The entire process was very smooth and I could cast the vote sitting in my drawing room. I didn’t have to go anywhere and my vote was cast — that too before any of my other family members,” said Mukherjee. The octogenarian was, however, miffed that his 75-year-old wife was denied the right to vote on postal ballot even though he requested the officials. “They should revise the age category and bring it down to at least 75. Now I may be safe but my wife will have to go to the polling booth and cast her vote,” he rued. A senior women’s group in Bhowanipore — Mahila Mahal — has appealed to the EC that the postal ballot should have an age relaxation for women. Chartered accountant Kishorebhai Dattani said that many elderly members would have been benefited had the postal ballot been better publicised. “So many would have been benefited by voting from home. I pray that the administration reaches out to more people next time,” Dattani said. As per the postal ballot system, two polling personnel, a videographer, a police officer and a member of the Central Armed Police Force visit a household. Polling agents of different parties can be present as well. However, indelible ink is not applied on the fingers of the voters. Of the 2,06,389 voters in the constituency, only 1,26,592 had cast their votes at polling booths on April 26 and 784 exercised their franchise through postal ballots. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay won and later resigned to vacate the seat for Mamata Banerjee. Chattopadhyay won the seat by securing 57.7% votes while BJP candidate, actor Rudranil Ghosh, came second with 35.2%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/postal-ballot-ensures-vote-at-home-experience-for-seniors-in-cov-times/articleshow/86591865.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Agriculture superintendents from each of the districts in the state have been appointed as nodal officers by the respective district collectors to assist the ACB. “In the drought-prone Marathwada region, 287 water conservation schemes in Beed, 43 works in Aurangabad, three in Jalna, one in Osmanabad, 25 in Nanded, 13 in Parbhani, seven in Latur and five in Hingoli district will be investigated,” said an ACB official. Aurangabad ACB superintendent of police Rahul Khade told TOI, “We will investigate to see if there were any violations in terms of the tendering process, quality of work, measurements of the actual work as compared to the details on record and supervisory flaws.” Those privy to the probe maintained that all ACB units in the state received a written communication and initiated an open inquiry into the identified works carried out under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan in the first week of September. The Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan was started by the Devendra Fadnavis-led former state government between 2014 and 2019. It aimed at making the state drought-free by 2019 by improving the groundwater level. Under the scheme, several works, including construction of farm ponds, cleaning and deepening of river beds and construction of weirs on streams and channels were carried out. According to the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), tabled before the state assembly in September 2020, a total of 6.41 lakh works has been carried out under this scheme in 22,586 villages of the state, by spending Rs 9,634 crores. However, the CAG concluded that the scheme had little impact, despite spending a huge amount as the drought-hit areas ended up ordering more water tankers than in previous drought years. The MVA government, replaced the water conservation scheme with the three-year Chief Minister Water Conservation Programme (CMWCP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/acb-looking-into-384-jalyukt-shivar-abhiyan-works/articleshow/86589857.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The decomposed bodies of the woman and her child were recovered from a sack about two months after they were killed and dumped. According to the prosecution, the main accused, Rohtas Kumar, wanted to develop an “intimate relationship” with the married woman, but she had spurned his advances. To take revenge, Rohtas planned and committed the murders in Jahangirabad, Bulandshahr. In January 2016, he told the woman that her husband, Amichand Singh, had fallen ill and was admitted to a hospital. On pretext of taking her to the hospital, he took the woman and the child to a secluded place and killed them with the help of the two brothers. Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Chandrabhan Singh said, “For two months, Amichand kept looking for his family. It was in March 2016 when police found the two bodies and Amichand was called. It was only with the help of a tattoo on the hand of his wife that he recognized the highly decomposed bodies.” “Soon after the bodies were recovered, Amichand had filed an FIR under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) against Rohtash Kumar and two brothers Dinesh and Jitender Singh.” After a trial which lasted for over two years, the court of additional district judge, Bulandshahr, found the three men guilty and convicted them. The court of Neelam Dhaka also slapped a fine of Rs 60,000 on the convicts. The husband of the deceased, Amichand, said, “I was expecting death sentence for these men who took away everything I had. But life sentence will also bring some peace to the souls of my wife and daughter.” Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Singh said, “Police had taken the case as a challenge. The bodies were highly decomposed and it was almost impossible to identify them. Our team continued to look for missing persons in the entire district police stations and zeroed in on Amichand, who identified the body. Later, the team also built a strong case against the accused that eventually led to their sentencing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/3-men-get-life-in-jail-for-killing-woman-daughter-in-bulandshahr/articleshow/86590702.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: FIR lodged, 8 held for clash near Jadubabur Bazar||KOLKATA: Police on Tuesday arrested eight persons after a scuffle between Trinamool and BJP supporters around former state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh near Jadubabu’s Bazar on the last day of campaigning for the Bhowanipore bypoll.  The arrests were made on a suo moto FIR lodged by Bhowanipore police for unlawful assembly, rioting with arms and weapons, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation. The eight were later granted bail. Police, however, didn’t disclose the political identities of the arrested. “We have arrested eight persons. The matter is under probe, and we do not wish to divulge other details at this stage,” a senior officer said. The arrests were made after studying video and CCTV footage. Earlier, in their report to EC, cops stated that BJP did not take permission for the door-to-door campaign. The fact that Ghosh’s securitymen had brought out pistols was also mentioned in the report. Baiswanar Chattopadhyay, the election agent of Trinamool chief and bypoll candidate Mamata Banerjee, claimed BJP was raising these issues as they are not getting any support on ground. “It is an administrative decision to carry out the arrests. The administration is neutral and will act on its own. Interestingly, it is the BJP leader’s securitymen who had brought out the guns and pushed away common people. Now they have a problem with police action too,” he added. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar expressed his concerns on the issue at a meeting with party president J P Nadda. Bengal BJP spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said the way Ghosh and other BJP workers were attacked — and the police move of slapping bailable sections against the accused the next day — raised questions about the law-and-order situation in the state. BJP seeks Sec 144, more forcesBJP leaders in Delhi met the EC, seeking the imposition of Section 144 on September 30 and deployment of central forces.

In Mumbai, cases ticked up from 376 on Monday to 394 on Tuesday. “While Mumbai saw a marginal rise in cases just before the Ganpati festival due to the opening up of the mass transport systems, there hasn’t been a massive surge,’’ said Dr Rahul Pandit, head of intensive care in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, and member of the state government’s Covid task force. “If we manage to show restraint during the festivals ahead and there are no new variants of concern, we may be okay,” he said. The increasing vaccination coverage, he said, is the biggest factor. “Even though the number of people under quarantine has increased, there is no corresponding rise in the number of critical patients or those needing ICU,’’ Pandit said. The number of critical patients in the city dropped below 300 (291) and only 502 out of the 2,204 ICU beds are occupied in the city. According to a Covid presentation to the state cabinet, 1.6 lakh cases were detected in August, which fell to 96,947 till September 27. Similarly, deaths too dropped from 2,801 to 1,232.

Union minister Pralhad Joshi has assured to extend us all the required support. The jurisdiction of Dharwad centre will include Karnataka, Goa, and some parts of Kerala and Hyderabad.“We have also asked 15 acres of land in Hyderabad to set up a centre. We have plans of setting the regional centres in all states in the coming years,” he added.On choosing Dharwad to set up a centre which is slated to have the biggest space for the LKA in the country, Pacharne said Dharwad is the hub of artistes and has the supportive ecosystem and connectivity for the development of any art. “We visited the proposed places in Dharwad and will submit a report to the government. We have also prepared an action plan if government allots 15 acres of land. Though this centre is meant to focus on research, it will also have a gallery, a studio, administration building, sculpture garden and other facilities. As of now, we have planned works at the cost of Rs 75 crore. “Once the centre is set up, it will boost tourism and other industries relying on fine arts,” he said, adding that the aim of setting up more centres is to give a boost to creative and artistic activities by facilitating research, workshops, exhibition, exchange ideas and lending technology support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dharwad-to-get-lalit-kala-akademi-centre/articleshow/86589870.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Proper ventilation, double vaccination of staff critical for Covid-proof multiplexes’||PUNE: Though a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for multiplexes in Maharashtra is still to be finalized, a senior Covid-19 task force member on Tuesday said their focus would be on ventilation and full vaccination of employees. “The SOP will contain special measures on preventing the spread of the infection at multiplexes, where crowding and unmasking are likely. A special protocol has also been suggested for visitors to be unmasked, such as while eating. All potential points of Covid transmission are being considered critically. The SOP is being prepared in coordination with owners of multiplexes and the state Covid-19 task force,” the member said. The task force suggested proper ventilation with constant air change and reducing air recirculation in multiplexes. “Movie halls will allow patrons at only 50% of the seating capacity. Seats that are not to be occupied would be taped or crossed out,” he said. Other measures being considered include staggered timings for entry and exit before and after a show. “For better ventilation, more exhaust and table fans will have to be placed in cinema halls. If these measures are in place, air-conditioning at a specific temperature inside the theatre may be possible,” the member said. All employees must be double vaccinated, though the full vaccination pre-condition for visitors is still being discussed. “However, since several cinema halls are inside malls, visitors to these places must be fully vaccinated for entry,” he said. A senior public health department official told TOI that the SOP will be announced in a day or two. “The task force is currently reviewing the SOP. Once the task force clears it, the SOP will be published,” the official said. The official said that the full vaccination pre-condition for the management and employees of any establishment is part of the latest unlock guidelines. The official further said some technical issues on crowd management, which may crop up at the entry and exit points of multiplexes, are currently being ironed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-proper-ventilation-double-vax-of-staff-critical-for-covid-proof-multiplexes/articleshow/86591896.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||‘Organisations need to invest in stressmgmt of employees in national interest’||Stress is a lethal enemy of the young when it comes to matters of the heart, according to the president of Cardiological Society of India, UP Chapter, Prof Satyendra Tewari. Talking to Shailvee Sharda on the eve of World Heart Day, Prof Tewari said organisations should make stress management a mandatory element of their employee welfare programmes in social and national interest. Excerpts: Why is stress management among young Indians crucial to their heart’s health? Stress is a leading contributor to cardiac problems among the young. Its association with sudden cardiac deaths is strengthening by the day. Since little can be done to curtail work pressure, lifestyle modification and stress management hold the key. This is crucial to India as compared to the US and Europe as Indians are at a greater risk. What does stress do to the heart? Stress alone cannot trigger a heart attack in a normal, healthy person. However, it can precipitate heart attack in people with a history of diabetes and hypertension, and those who smoke. In terms of physiology, stress triggers unscheduled release of hormones that adds to plaque formation and may cause plaque rupture. This may lead to clotting which can block arteries and cause heart attacks. What puts Indians to a higher risk? In Europe and the US, people suffer heart attacks in their 60s, unlike India where it is common in the 50s. Over 25% of patients are below 45 years. The extent of damage caused by heart disease is also high among us. While in the West, heart attacks are localised and often involve one of the four arteries, they are lethal and malignant in India. Is it true that certain Indians are genetically predisposed to heart diseases? Yes. Certain genetic factors make Indians highly vulnerable. A CSI multi-centric study indicated that one in three young heart attack patients was genetically predisposed. Higher presence of genetic markers like lipoprotein(a) and apolipoprotein(b) (both meant for blood coagulation) can clog arteries and cause premature coronary artery disease. If such a person leads a sedentary lifestyle, heart disease is inevitable. What can individuals do to minimise risk? There is no sure shot method. A 360-degree approach is required. Physical activity is the first step and ‘Taking it easy’ is the next. Keeping tabs on one’s health numbers such as cholesterol (both good and bad), sugar, vitamins, coronary calcium score, blood pressure and BMI at least once a year after 35th birthday is a must. Eating mindfully and getting quality sleep is crucial. One should stay away from smoking and spend some time in pursuit of peace (without cell phone or computer).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/organisations-need-to-invest-in-stressmgmt-of-employees-in-national-interest/articleshow/86593450.cms||---

Ever since, it was neither repaired nor replaced. Thousands of people use this area right from early hours till midnight. Since there are stray dogs in the area, immediate replacement was the need of the hour,” said Bhaskara Rao, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. The area connects to the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University metro station and is extensively used by commuters using the metro. The citizen reporter had aired the grievance with the civic authorities multiple times. However, it got resolved only after it was published in these columns. “My grievance was aired in these columns on September 2. The next day itself, the streetlight was repaired and was functional,” said Rao. When contacted, the Nizampet Municipal Corporation commissioner, Venu Gopal Reddy said – “During rainy season, some of the streetlights get damaged. We have got multiple complaints this season. However, we ensure that all of them are repaired and the issue is resolved in not more than 48 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/streetlight-fixed-in-nizampet/articleshow/86591899.cms||---

The minister entered a farm, owned by Narasimha Yashwant Chaugale in Bhuvashi village, astride a bullock cart. In a symbolic gesture to kickstart his day, Patil transplanted shoots of sugarcane plants in the field.Patil, who is slated to spend the next few days in the company of farmers while tours the state, exhorted ryots not to limit themselves to a single crop. “Farmers must cultivate other crops to supplement their income, and engage in dairy and bee farming,” said the minister.Patil opined that diversification would help farmers guard themselves against the vagaries of climate. “Sheep farming is becoming very popular, and it helps ryots earn a good income. The state government is also offering subsidy and working on setting up food storage facilities for farmers’ benefit,” he added.The minister pointed out that nearly five-and-a-half lakh farmers in Belagavi had benefitted under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Scheme in 2019. “In all, they have received Rs 1,090 crore,” said Patil, who assured farmers of addressing the problem of power outages in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/adopt-a-comprehensive-farming-method-minister-patil-tells-ryots/articleshow/86589883.cms||---

MMRCL said works are in progress at Aarey in accordance with this sanction. It was the third committee set up under former chief secretary Sanjay Kumar that recommended shifting the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. The reply was sent to activist Amrita Bhattacharjee who had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inquiring on the status of the car shed site in Aarey. The letter was forwarded by the chief minister’s office to the urban development department who in turn forwarded it to MMRCL. “The answer is very vague. I had in the past sought a Detailed Project Report (DPR) on the merger of the two lines (Metro Line 3 and Metro Line 6) which has still not been provided. The laying of tracks has begun at the Metro car shed site. Neither MMRCL nor MMRDA have put the DPR in the public domain for scrutiny,” she said. The dispute on ownership of the 102-acre Kanjurmarg plot is now before Bombay High Court. It has asked the Centre and state to reach a settlement in public interest. In January last year the Salt Commissioner wrote to MMRDA saying it was willing to give the Kanjurmarg land to the state for Rs 3,000 crore. Thereafter, the Centre challenged the state’s decision to shift the Metro 3 car shed to Kanjurmarg. Recently when members of Niti Aayog visited Mumbai, Thackeray called for an amicable solution to the Kanjurmarg dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-has-cleared-shifting-of-metro-shed-from-aarey/articleshow/86591904.cms||Clara Lewis

As per the election schedule, voting will be held on October 30 and counting of votes will take place on November 2. The election notification for both the seats will be issued on October 1. Nominations can be filed till October 8. Elections were necessitated to the seats after Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar Gajendra Singh Shaktawat died due to Covid-19 on January 20, and BJP legislator from Dhariawad Gautam Lal Meena died of the infection on May 19. The ruling Congress currently has 106 MLAs in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 71, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) three, the CPM and the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) two each, Rashtriya Lok Dal one and independents 13. Two seats are vacant. In the bypolls held earlier for the Sahada, Sujangarh and Rajsamand assembly seats in the state, Congress had won two and BJP one. It will be a prestige battle for both the parties to at least retain the seats they had held. Other than the bypolls in Rajasthan, the EC also announced bypolls to three Lok Sabha seats and 28 other assembly seats in various states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bypolls-to-2-assemblyseats-on-oct-30-in-raj/articleshow/86592824.cms||---

---||Delhi||On road? Ignorance about bad air isn’t bliss||NEW DELHI: An observational study on the impact of air pollution on public health says awareness levels about pollution were least among those who spent over two hours in traffic daily as compared to other groups who spent less time in traffic. Track the pollution level in your cityThe study was conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College and Delhi Pollution Control Committee for a period of 15 months from April 2019. The study suggested that unawareness about air pollution is one contributory factor towards spending time in traffic as they are not cautious about the ill-effects of air pollution. “Inappropriate behaviour along with lack of awareness also puts the exposed population at risk and restricts them from adopting effective measures to mitigate the effects of air pollution,” said the study. According to the study, cardiopulmonary admissions in hospitals increase significantly with rising air pollution. The increase in cardio-pulmonary admissions (coronary artery diseases, bronchitis, bronchial asthma) is directly proportional to increase in air quality index (AQI) and PM 2.5. However, no such relation could be established with Ozone. For the study, five hospitals were included in the sample representing each zone to collect data for cardiopulmonary illnesses in Central, East, West, North and South Zones of Delhi. It was also observed that a higher AQI was related to a significant increase in acute onset of symptoms like dyspnea, cough and dry throat among the general population residing in areas with a higher AQI. This can lead to added stress and reduced work productivity, the study said. “Apart from increasing cardio-pulmonary admissions in hospitals, air pollution causes an impact on the routine day-to-day life of the people by causing physical discomfort (acute respiratory infections). It can also pose as a risk factor for chronic lung diseases and allergies and asthma,” the study concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-road-ignorance-about-bad-air-isnt-bliss/articleshow/86625775.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Are Hyderabad’s Trees Protected?||‘Every tree felled is compensated for’ Protecting trees and preserving the environment should be everybody’s responsibility – not the forest department’s alone. Unfortunately, though, I do not see that happening. There have even been instances where people have put trees on fire, and we have had to rush our staff to the scene to save them from burning down. Whenever we get the chance, we ensure we do our best to stop the axe from falling on trees. It is for this reason that we also follow a strict procedure. Anybody who wants to cut a tree cannot do so arbitrarily. He/she must apply through the Telangana Forest Department’s website. The portal allows an individual to register his/her request, which is then verified by officials, in a very time-bound manner. Depending on how justified the reason is, permission is either given or denied. All of this happens online, in a rather transparent fashion. Also, even if people are granted permission to fell a tree, there is a set procedure that they have to follow. To begin with, they have to pay a security deposit of Rs 450 for planting two trees or saplings. So, for each tree felled there are two trees raised. Once they plant these trees, they are also expected to show us the tree that they planted, after three years so that we know that the plant survived, and it is healthy. At that time, we return the security deposit. If they don’t have space and are unable to raise any trees, we take the responsibility of planting and raising those trees in some other place. As per the guidelines, we try to plant them within aa three-km radius of that place where the tree was felled. In Hyderabad and other urban areas, the forest department now ensures that only native trees are planted. The same is communicated to those who are given permission for felling trees and then take part in the compensatory plantation. We have also advised the GHMC to plant native trees except in a few places where they want to take up ornamental plantation. However, in some gated communities and ventures, they don’t pay attention to these rules. We also, very proactively, react to complaints of tree felling that are brought to our notice. We take whatever remedial action is required -- impose a fine and report the issue to the media so that people are educated and made aware of the consequences of such violations. - Sidhanand Kukrety, Additional PCCF & chief, Tree Protection Committee …...................................... ‘No checks in place to arrest brazen fellings’ On paper, we have all the processes required to arrest tree felling – a tree protection committee, government bodies and officials appointed especially for this work. Yet, the problem of trees being cut down brazenly, without any reason or permission, continues unabashed. Reason: None of the ‘custodians’ are doing their job. They only wake up and take note when someone like you or I file a complaint. If that is the case, why do we need these authorities? Shouldn’t civic officials who are constantly on the ground keep a tab on such things and raise it with the forest department? And shouldn’t the latter then act on it before citizens can raise a grievance? Also, the current system of issuing permissions for tree felling is a farce. When someone goes to the department seeking one, he/she is only levied a fine and allowed to go ahead with whatever they want to do. So, basically people can pay their way through it all. There is never any question asked about how the person is planning to compensate for the shrink in tree cover. Nobody ever goes to inspect or confirm the person has taken up compensatory plantation. \ Also, while the guidelines categorically state that one who cuts a tree should ensure that compensatory plantation is done within a three-km radius of the project, this rule is seldom followed. So, for instance, if a flyover is being built in KPHB and 100 trees are being cut, 300 to 500 saplings should be planted within three-kms of the flyover -- which is very good on paper. But, in reality, we don’t know just where the afforestation is done. Now with Haritha Haram, they are showing most of these target-based plantations as compensatory plantations also. When we recently filed an RTI for details of compensatory plantation and the trees that they marked for translocation, the department could provide absolutely no information. - P Uday Krishna, founder, Vata Foundation .......................................... ONLY ON PAPER? Created to spread awareness about the importance of trees and the need to save them from being felled, the tree protection committee comprises government officials, environmentalists and NGO representatives. While government authorities argue that the committee has been diligently discharging its duty – from ensuring translocation of trees wherever possible to levying fines on offenders felling trees on the sly – green activists claim otherwise. According to them, this committee is being used by the government as a rubber stamp to approve cutting of trees, to make way for ‘developmental’ projects. They also allege that the committee pays no attention to ensure, that saplings are planted as compensation when trees are cut. ......................... PHOTO QUOTES Every day in some corner of the city, trees are being cut whether it's for electricity wires or some other generic reason. The impact has become more and more dangerous, because of the rapidly decreasing green cover. Earlier it might not have been such a big problem. But now, when we have limited resources, we should learn to preserve and manage it. -- Nishat Anaira So many fully grown trees are chopped regularly across the city. It has become so commonplace that we don’t even notice it anymore. Trees of native species play a vital role in sustaining ecosystems. Even our life depends on them. Incessant loss of tree cover can impact air and water quality and affect quality of life. We need to be guardians of these life-preserving beings. -- Ananya Sangameshwar Tree felling has become unregulated, unmonitored and unrepented. Public agencies continue to be the biggest enemies of single trees, groves and lane dotting trees. Loss of trees in Hyderabad is also irreversible. No tree has been allowed to come back, once chopped down. Consequences can be seen in the rise in microclimate temperatures, pollution and lack of shade. -- D Narasimha Reddy Graphic Guidelines/procedure for tree felling For exempted trees: Applicant to go to below to link on tree felling website and fill the form – http://fmis.telangana.gov.in/EDB/Exempted_Form13A.aspx After filing of application form (self-certification), the applicant has to make payment of fees online.

BHU scientists, led by Prof VK Mishra, claimed that Malviya 838, which is also called Hindu University Wheat (HUW) 838, variety is fully resistant against ‘wheat blast disease’ that has emerged as a major concern for Asian countries after it migrated to Bangladesh from Brazil in 2016 and started posing threat of expansion in Indian territories. The PM dedicated 35 crop varieties with special traits to the nation through video conferencing on Tuesday on the occasion of virtual inauguration of the newly constructed campus of the National Institute of Biotic Stress Management Raipur (Chhattisgarh) and distribution of the Green Campus Award to agricultural universities. The scientists, academicians, students and even non-teaching staff celebrated the occasion at the institute on BHU campus. On being contacted by TOI, Prof Mishra said, “We had started working on developing a bio-fortified variety of wheat in 2014-15 by involving breeders and scientists of various departments. Incidentally, one of the devastating diseases of wheat, known as wheat blast, hit Bangladesh in 2016 and covered its maximum area. It emerged as a matter of concern for India as well as neighbouring Asian countries.” Since the disease is airborne, the threat for neighbouring states of India was very high, said Prof Mishra. He said it is a fast-acting and devastating fungal disease. “One of the most fearsome and intractable wheat diseases in recent decades, it spreads through infected seeds, crop residues as well as by spores that can travel long distances in the air, posing a major threat to wheat production in tropical areas. It can shrivel and deform the grain in less than a week from the first symptoms, leaving no time to act for farmers. The Malviya 838 variety seeds were sent to Bangladesh for cultivation and the result was surprising as it proved to be highly resistant to wheat blast disease, said prof Mishra adding, the variety also has 20% higher zinc and iron contents with high yield than other popular wheat varieties. The variety has proven potential even under limited irrigation conditions, said Prof Mishra. The team comprising Prof HK Jaiswal, Dr Sandeep Sharma from the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Prof Ramesh Kumar Singh of Agronomy, Prof Ramesh Chand, Prof SS Vaish from Mycology and Plant Pathology of institute, led by Prof VK Mishra, had started work to develop a bio fortified variety. They are jubilant as the variety developed by them has proved to be fully resistant against the wheat blast disease, which has emerged as the greatest threat for Asia, the world’s largest wheat producing area after reaching Bangladesh from Brazil during seed import in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-dedicates-disease-resistant-ias-bhu-wheat-variety-to-nation/articleshow/86592831.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

He was inaugurating the higher education workshop organized by Kerala State Higher Education Council. “Each and every department of higher education institutions should excel. Government plans for a total overhaul of the higher education system so that it would become competitive. We need to have a serious introspection to know if our higher education institutions have achieved the expected standard,” Vijayan said. The chief minister said the low ranks of higher education institutions in state was a major concern. “Efforts should be made so that all universities in state achieve a minimum of 3.5 NAAC grade. It should help to get a better position in NIRF ranking. To achieve this, academic quality should improve significantly,” he added. Vijayan said that higher education institutions should shed their reluctance for self-appraisal. Only a few higher education institutions currently undergo the assessment and accreditation process. This practice should change. “All higher education institutions should apply for the rating of state assessment and accreditation centre. Each institution should be aware of the areas where improvement is required,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pick-institutions-for-coe-status-cm/articleshow/86592827.cms||---
---||India||SC/HCs can’t substitute legislative draft with its own craft: SC||NEW DELHI: Stopping the constitutional courts from supplementing or changing words in statutory provisions while interpreting, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that language and drafting of a law or rule is in the legislature’s sole domain, where the judiciary is barred from stepping in. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna said, “The court in the exercise of judicial review cannot supplant the terms of the provision through judicial interpretation by re-writing statutory language. Draftsmanship is a function entrusted to the legislature. Craftsmanship on the judicial side cannot transgress into the legislative domain by re-writing the words of a statute. For then, the judicial craft enters the forbidden domain of a legislative draft.” Frowning at the Madras High Court’s attempt to enter the arena of redrafting a statutory provision while giving relief to broadcasters/FM Radios, which was not intended in the Copyright Rules, the bench said the HC could not have re-written the provisions relating to advance payment of royalties to copyright holders of songs, that too through an interim order, when the petitions challenging the rules are pending final consideration before it. Outlining the clear demarcation in functional domains of the legislature and judiciary, the bench said, “The court is entrusted by the Constitution with the power of judicial review. In the discharge of its mandate, the court may evaluate the validity of a legislation or rules made under it. A statute may be invalidated if is ultra vires constitutional guarantees or transgresses the legislative domain entrusted to the enacting legislature. Delegated legislation can, if it results in a constitutional infraction or is contrary to the ambit of the enacting statute be invalidated.” However, the bench said that it was impermissible for the HCs and the SC to enter the arena of legislative draftsmanship. “That precisely is what the division bench of the high court has done by its interim order. Section 31D(2) speaks of the necessity of giving prior notice, in the manner as may be prescribed, of the intention to broadcast the work stating the duration and the territorial coverage of the broadcast, together with the payment of royalties in the manner and at the rates fixed by the Appellate Board. While the High Court has held the broadcasters down to the requirement of prior notice, it has modified the operation of Rule 29 by stipulating that the particulars which are to be furnished in the notice may be furnished within a period of fifteen days after the broadcast. The interim order converts the second proviso into a ‘routine procedure’ instead of an exception (as the High Court has described its direction),” the bench said. “This exercise by the high court amounts to re-writing. Such an exercise of judicial redrafting of legislation or delegated legislation cannot be carried out. The high court has done so at the interlocutory stage,” Justices Chandrachud and Nagarathna said. It said an exercise of judicial re-drafting of Rule 29(4) was unwarranted, particularly at the interlocutory stage. “The difficulties which have been expressed before the HC by the broadcasters have warranted an early listing of the matter and this Court has been assured by the copyright owners that they would file their counter affidavits immediately so as to facilitate the expeditious disposal of the proceedings,” it said. “That having been assured, we are of the view that an exercise of judicial re-writing of a statutory rule is unwarranted in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, particularly in interlocutory proceedings. The HC was also of the view that the second proviso may be resorted to as a matter of routine, instead of as an exception and that the ex post facto reporting should be enlarged to a period of 15 days (instead of a period of twenty four hours). Such an exercise was impermissible since it would substitute a statutory rule made in exercise of the power of delegated legislation with a new regime and provision which the HC considers more practicable,” the bench said. Allowing the appeal of Saregama and setting aside the August 2 interim order of the HC, the SC said, “This is, however, subject to the clarification that this Court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the rival submissions which would fall for determination in the exercise of the writ jurisdiction of the HC in the pending proceedings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc/hcs-cant-substitute-legislative-draft-with-its-own-craft-sc/articleshow/86594063.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

As part of initial efforts to establish an EV charging network, KSEB had set up charging stations at the board’s own land in 2020. They were opened to the public in November last year. "After this government came to power, three charging stations set up by Anert were inaugurated. The work of 56 charging stations, covering all districts, is fast progressing. At least 40 of them would be operational in November. Three more EV charging stations of Anert would also be functional in November," he added. The charging stations of KSEB and Anert would have facilities for charging all electric vehicles, including two, three and four-wheelers currently available in the market. The minister said that by next month, the board would complete a pilot project for introducing EV charging points on electricity distribution poles, exclusively for e-auto rickshaws. "The pilot project is in Kozhikode where the highest number of electric auto rickshaws are present. A network of 10 charging points attached to electric polls are currently being tested in Kozhikode. If the model is found to be feasible, the facility would be introduced on a large scale across the state," Krishnankutty said. The minister said that energy management centre would soon launch a programme that would help people to buy electric auto rickshaws at a price lower than the market rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/all-districts-to-get-ev-charging-stations-by-nov-min/articleshow/86592848.cms||---

Mon, a native of Kerala’s Kannur who was residing in Bengaluru’s RT Nagar, was initially believed to have died of natural causes. It was suspected that he lost his way in the Jaisalmer desert during a practice run and died of dehydration or thirst. Cops began an investigation after the biker’s brother and mother cried foul, alleging that Mon was murdered. Jaisalmer SP Ajay Singh said Mon had come to Jaisalmer for the rally along with his wife Sumera Parvez and five friends Sanjay, Vishwas, Neeraj, Sabik and Santosh. On August 15, 2018, all of them saw the track and went on a ride the next day, and ended up losing their way. All others returned except Mon, who was later found dead in an area with no network coverage. An autopsy revealed a back injury. Moreover, Sumera showed no suspicion over his death and police filed a final report in the case, the SP said. After studying the final report, however, SP Singh said he found the roles of Sumera and Sanjay suspicious. After a thorough probe, sleuths concluded that the biker had been murdered after meticulous planning and registered a case against Sumera and Mon’s five friends. Police said Mon had numerous disputes with his wife on several issues. He earlier used to reside in Dubai before shifting to Bengaluru. On the day of the murder, Sanjay was the first to reach the spot and took away Mon’s mobile and other items, the SP added. After obtaining proof of the murder, arrest warrants were issued against Sanjay and others. The investigation officer went to Bengaluru and Kerala in search of the accused, who went underground. Later, another police team went to Bengaluru, arrested Sanjay and Vishwas and brought both to Jaisalmer. The duo was sent to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/biker-death-in-jaisalmer-wife-friends-plotted-murder-2-arrested-from-bluru/articleshow/86592838.cms||---

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the police to file the chargesheet within a month and it was submitted in 18 days. The chargesheet said the accused claimed to have known the victim closely and she had avoided meeting him for 25 days before he managed to track her down. According to the chargesheet, when the accused saw her after 25 days, he attacked and raped her in anger for refusing sex and even used a rod-like weapon in the crime. It said the crime was not pre-planned. The victim died almost 36 hours after being brutally sexually assaulted and suffering lacerations to her private parts. She was first assaulted by the accused on the pavement and then inside a stationary tempo which was captured on CCTV. A special investigation team was set up to probe the case. Police recorded statements of 77 witnesses in the case and attached CCTV grabs from the crime spot along with the chargesheet. They also mentioned the route taken by the accused to reach Kurla (West) from Sakinaka in Andheri (East) from where he was nabbed within 24 hours of the offence. “We have recovered the rod-like weapon that he had used in the offence. After assaulting the victim, the accused inserted the weapon which resulted in severe damage to her intestines,” said a police officer. The incident occurred outside Rashid Compound near Chandivali Studio in Sakinaka. “Around 3.15am, a security guard outside Rashid Compound called the police control room to inform them that a woman was being beaten up in the tempo. The Sakinaka police team reached the location within 10 minutes of the call and found the injured woman bleeding in a parked tempo. Wasting no time, a police constable along with other cops got the tempo keys from the security guard and rushed the victim to the hospital,” said a Sakinaka police officer. The security guard is the prime witness in the case as he had called the police control room. The victim’s post-mortem was carried out at the state-run J J Hospital in Byculla. One of the experts has mentioned that she died due to complications following injuries. The autopsy was video-graphed and her viscera have been preserved for histopathological analysis. The victim had also suffered other minor injuries to her body.

---||Hyderabad||Pen and paper became my best friends||By Kirti Bihani  This pandemic brought a lot of changes into my life. I learnt many things like graphic designing and numerology and finally tried my skill in writing. I discovered my passion for writing and my life has now got a new direction. I started with journaling my thoughts. Soon, the pen and paper became my best friends and companions. I started writing my deep embedded views and random thoughts on various issues that crossed my mind throughout the day. As my writing started getting favourable reactions and acclaims from people around me, it boosted my confidence. Every write-up now is a learning experience for me. Going forward, I aspire to write more and more to connect with people. It gives me solace and a sense of contentment from doing something creative. I took to writing as a mode of de-stressing but now I am enjoying it thoroughly. It has kept me away from the negativity that can easily set in during such a tumultuous time.  The virus as an intruder changed our lives, caged us in our houses but it also had a bright impact on our lives. It gave us time to listen to our inner voice, break away from the regular drill of life and relax, rest, evaluate things and respond back with renewed energy. I am happy that it allowed me to introspect and evaluate the importance and essence of life which I had forgotten in the humdrum of my daily routine.  I am happy that I did justice with my free time and used this adverse time in a creative manner. My feelings and thoughts that were mute inside got wings through words. I doubt I would have discovered and developed this passion of mine if not for the lockdown.  (The writer is a homemaker) ............................... I am more confident, self-aware By Neha S One thing that I started to do during the lockdown, and have continued since then, is reading newspapers. It has helped me gain a lot of knowledge on current affairs this year. Apart from this, I have made it a habit to brush twice a day because I realise how important it is for everyone to have clean and hygienic teeth, and go on regular walks with my dog, Whyskey, to keep myself fit.  Soon after the lockdown started, my intermediate classes moved online. While people say there have been ill-effects of this, the virtual sessions have worked well for me. It helped me speak up more confidently and interact well with my peers and teachers. My confidence levels rose to such an extent that now I can go and give a speech on stage. I also made a Youtube video on my brother's channel about memorising the periodic table in just five minutes.  Besides these routine things, I also learnt basics about the stock market and invested some amount – out of my pocket money – that's now giving me small profits. It is very exciting. Personally too, I have grown up during the last two years as I got to know myself better and appreciate the things in my life. As we adapt to this post Covid-19 world, I hope to carry these changes with me as I embrace the new normal.

---||Mumbai||Wadhawan brothers’ Rs 578 crore UK assets attached in UP case||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached assets worth Rs 578 crore (57 million pounds) of Wadhawan Global Capital UK Ltd (WGCL) in a fraud case involving the Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). The attached assets are in the form of investments through WGC in UK companies. It’s the first provisional attachment in a money laundering case where DHFL used funds of the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL). The accused, DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and brother Deeraj Wadhawan, are already in jail custody in another money laundering case connected to Yes Bank. The state-owned UPPCL had allegedly invested Rs 4,123 crore from its employees’ provident fund corpus in DHFL as fixed deposit without taking required approval. The DHFL is yet to pay back Rs 2,268 crore of the principal. The ED investigation found that the Wadhawan brothers had siphoned off Rs 1,000 crore of the UPPCL money to UK after layering it through more than 30 Indian companies controlled by them. The money trail led ED to WGCL. DHFL had a common account in which it would receive the UPPCL investment. In the same account, they were getting money from others sources, including as loan and investments. The Wadhawan brothers would siphon off money from this account showing them as loans to the other group companies. DHFL sanctioned the unsecured loans to those companies on the direction of its then chairman Kapil Wadhawan, and most of the loans turned into non-performing assets. During investigation, the ED found in one instance around Rs 450 crore came to the DHFL’s common accounts and was diverted in Wadhawan Global Capital (India) Ltd. From there the money was further diverted into the account of WGCL as investment. The ED case is based on a UP police FIR, which names Pravin Gupta, the then secretary of the UP Power Sector Employees’ Trust, and Sudhanshu Dwivedi, the then director, finance, of UPPCL. Later, the investigation was transferred to the CBI. Earlier, the ED had attached properties worth Rs 1,412 crore of the Wadhawan brothers in a separate case connected to the Yes Bank. In that case, the ED has also seized five vehicles of the Wadhawans worth Rs 12.6 crore. The ED has also chargesheeted the Wadhawan brothers in another case connected to drug kingpin Iqbal Mirchi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wadhawan-bros-rs-578cr-uk-assets-attached-in-up-case/articleshow/86591953.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Varanasi||In a first, death notification app developed by Chandauli e-governance society||Varanasi: In a first- to end the problems faced by families in procuring death certificate, succession documents and other benefits of government schemes after death of any member, the Chandauli e-governance society have developed a death notification service app which will be introduced in Chandauli Nagar Panchayat and Shahabganj block as a pilot project. The app will alert the sub-divisional magistrate concerned to initiate action in scheduled time after information of death is uploaded on the app so that family members do not have to run from one office to other for official formalities. “As a public servant I have noticed that after death of a person, the basic formalities like application for death certificate, succession or other benefits of government schemes are mostly started after 14-15 days after the death related rituals are completed,” DM Chandauli Sanjiv Singh said while talking to TOI on reason behind the idea of developing this app. Besides, other formalities like removal of deceased’s name from ration card, voter list and pension schemes are either initiated late or forgotten, he said. For completing formalities like replacing name of spouse for releasing pension amount, benefits of labour welfare department in case of registered labourer, insurance schemes and others the family members have to run from one office to other, he said. The DM said that, in view of the same a concept was developed by him and a format to solve these issues was discussed with the e-governance society members and technical experts. After exercising hard on this idea the death notification service app was developed, said Singh adding, “Now, in case of death of a person the family members concerned or any villager can alert the authorities through this app by uploading the details of the deceased and information provider.” The app will generate a ticket number, which will reach the information providers and the SDM concerned, he said adding, the SDM will forward it to lekhpal of area, labour welfare and other departments. While beneficiary will be able to track status of his ticket number the lekhpal will have to complete the process of issuance of death certificate, succession in case of undisputed property and procedure of insurances it applicable in scheduled time. In case of disputed property the SDM will ensure sending the matter to court concerned, he added. The departments concerned will ensure removal of name of deceased from ration card, voter list and other schemes, he said adding if these actions do not take place in the scheduled time then a red flag will appear with ticket number after which action will become inevitable against lekhpal and other officials concerned.

The government in reply to a question by Palanpur MLA Mahesh Patel stated that the state, as on July 31, has to recover Rs 4,881.36 from Madhya Pradesh, Rs 1,683.09 crore from Maharashtra and another Rs 548.36 crore from Rajasthan. The MLA also sought to know what steps were being taken by the government in the past two years to recover the amount from the three states. To this, the state government replied that Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) has been writing to the concerned departments of all three states every month in this regard. The government said that even during the meetings of the Narmada Valley Development Authority, the issue has been raised by the government. The last meeting was held on August 24 and the neighbouring states were asked to pay their dues. Officials said that the government had in March stated that the three states owed Gujarat a sum of Rs 6,934.19 crore as part of the Narmada project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sardar-sarovar-project-rs-7112-cr-dues-pending/articleshow/86591968.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Bay of Bengal turns cyclone hotbed as Andhra Pradesh sees 60 storms in 50 years||VISAKHAPATNAM: Nearly 60 cyclones have crossed the coast of or severely hit Andhra Pradesh in the last five decades. From the devastating ‘Diviseema Uppena’ in 1977 and the ghastly Hudhud to Cyclone Titli and the latest Gulab, the frequency of weather systems has increased over the years. The Bay of Bengal continues to generate intense cyclones at regular intervals. The total losses caused by Cyclone Hudhud alone were pegged at Rs 21,000 crore, while the other cyclones like Diviseema, Kakinada cyclone (1996), Machilipatnam cyclone (1990), Ogni (2006), Laila (2010), Helen (2013), and Titli (2018) left behind a trail of destruction. Nearly 10,000 people died in the cyclone which crossed the coast near Diviseema in Krishna district in 1977. Andhra Pradesh has a 972-km-long coastline. The majority of tropical cyclones that ripped through the state originated in the Bay of Bengal, making it a cyclone hotbed. When the cyclones move north-westwards, they hit the coast of Andhra Pradesh. All these factors make the state prone to intense cyclones. According to experts, global warming and climate change also contribute to the brewing of more cyclones in the Bay. All this points to the need to strengthen forecasting, early warning system, preparedness, and disaster management in the state. Speaking to TOI, Sai Praneeth, a weather blogger known as Andhra Pradesh Weatherman on social media, said; “The majority of the cyclones that form in the Bay towards the end of September and the first half of October are hitting either north-coastal Andhra Pradesh or south Odisha. Cyclones generally do not occur in September. But as per the ongoing trend, the September ones are mostly approaching north-coastal Andhra Pradesh, while the systems that form in the first half of October are heading towards Odisha. After that, they hit south-coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, etc.” According to the AP State Disaster Management Authority, 2.9 million people are vulnerable to cyclones as 3.3 million people are located within five kilometres of the coastline. Thus, a storm surge with small wave length from the sea level affects thousands, in addition to strong cyclonic winds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bay-turns-cyclone-hotbed-as-ap-sees-60-storms-in-50-yrs/articleshow/86590793.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi govt gives two-month breather on renewal of DL, other documents||NEW DELHI: Is the validity of your driving licence or any vehicle-related document set to expire on September 30? Don’t fret, you have at least two more months to get the documents renewed. Though there has been no advisory regarding the extension of validity of documents from the Union road transport and highways ministry, Delhi government has decided to extend their validity till November 30. “Those whose driving licence or other motor vehicle documents and permits are set to expire on September 30, don’t need to worry. We have extended the validity of all motor vehicle documents and permits till November 30, 2021,” Delhi’s transport minister, Kailash Gahlot, told TOI. “The order is going to be issued by Wednesday,” he added. The order that is expected to be issued by Delhi government’s transport department would allow any vehicle-related document, which had expired since February 1, 2020 or would expire by September 30, 2021, to be treated valid till November 30. Once the official order is issued, directions will also be issued to the departments concerned, including all licensing authorities and motor licensing officials. In view of the Covid-19 situation, Delhi government had earlier extended the validity of such documents till September 30. The decision was taken in accordance with an advisory of the ministry. A Delhi government official said that even in the earlier instances since the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, when the validity of vehicle-related documents were extended, the order was always issued by the transport department. The official said that even if the Centre didn’t issue an advisory, Delhi government could issue an order. The official, however, reiterated that the extension would not be valid for Pollution Under Control Certificates and owners needed to get their vehicles checked, as not carrying a valid certificate would mean a fine of Rs 10,000, suspension of driving licence for three months and even imprisonment of up to six months. The president of Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association, Sanjay Samrat, said the validity needed to be extended as those associated with the transport business had suffered maximum losses due to the pandemic.

---||Nagpur||Actor revokes plea in harassment case||Nagpur: Bollywood actor Vijay Raaz has withdrawn his plea challenging sexual harassment accusations against him after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court refused to quash a chargesheet against him. The complaint was filed at Ram Nagar police station in Gondia for offences punishable under Sections 354A and 354D of IPC. “When his application was placed before the court, petitioner counsel Akshay Pandya, appearing on behalf of Akash Gupta, submitted that the petitioner has given instructions not to invite order and wishes to withdraw his application. Accepting his statement, his application is dismissed as withdrawn. The court is not giving detailed order on why we were to dismiss the application,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amir Borkar said. The bench earlier clarified its intention to dismiss Raaz’s application after perusing the chargesheet. “We had heard senior counsel Avinash Gupta and additional government pleader Sanjay Doifode in detail. They requested to adjourn hearing to obtain instructions from the petitioner on whether he wants decision or wishes to withdraw the application,” the judges said. The chargesheet was filed after the survivor, who was working with the actor as an assistant director on the set of film ‘Sherni’ movie starring Vidya Balan at Gondia, accused him of sexual misconduct during the shooting. Raaz used to call her to his room under the pretext of some urgent work but only passed time. On October 27 last year, he tried to keep his hand over the shoulder, repeated his acts and passed remarks. After the survivor filed a complaint with Gondia police on November 3, the 51-year-old actor was booked under Section 354A and 354D of IPC. He was, however, released on bail by Gondia JMFC the same day. Police then filed a chargesheet on December 12 in the JMFC court. The petitioner contended that the survivor had filed the case to malign his reputation and gain popularity, and it was nothing but a figment of her imagination. The contents of the chargesheet clearly show that contents of the FIR are not made out, he had pleaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/actor-revokes-plea-in-harassment-case/articleshow/86593512.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

In an unusual development on Monday night, the high court bar association said that they would not attend the single bench court of Justice Satish Kumar Sharma, who has been assigned cases under CrPC 482, till his roster was changed. Justice Sharma is currently assigned cases related to CrPC 482 where the court exercises inherent powers on petitions seeking fair investigation of cases. The bar association is reportedly agitated after the judge refused to give preferential treatment to a case involving a lawyer. Following the announcement, judges did not turn up in their chambers in the morning to hear cases. Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty, already on transfer, was not present in Jaipur. But following the directions of the chief justice, the judges deliberated on the move of the bar association. After consulting the bar association, they constituted a six-member judicial panel to look into their grievances. The court resumed only in the afternoon but the association stuck to its stand of boycotting the judge. Association president Bhuvnesh Sharma said the boycott would continue till the roster was changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bar-boycotts-judge-raj-hc-ops-affected/articleshow/86592868.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Metropolitan Region: Heavy rain with gusty wind come with remnants of Cyclone Gulab||MUMBAI: The remnants of Cyclone Gulab over southwest Vidarbha and the neighbourhood brought heavy rain spells accompanied with gusty wind across Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Tuesday evening. IMD said Mumbai may see thunder accompanied with lightning, gusty wind and heavy rain at isolated places on Wednesday too, but with lower intensity. IMD said the remnants of Gulab were likely to emerge into the Arabian sea and adjoining Gujarat coast around September 30, and the system may intensify. If a new cyclone is formed, it will be called ‘Shaheen’. Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist, said if Cyclone Shaheen forms, it will be for the first time that a tropical cyclone will give birth to another one over the north Indian Ocean region, if we consider the period between May 1975 to October 2020. “I won’t be examining data prior to 1975 due to lack of satellite observations, said Deoras, adding that systems are known to disintegrate after hitting the coast, but the remnants of this have been getting a lot of moisture due to the monsoon conditions, keeping it alive. “In a pre- or post-monsoon period, dry air in the atmosphere generally kills the cyclone, but here, after the crossover from Bay of Bengal, monsoon conditions have kept it active,” he said. In the nine hours ending 5.30pm on Tuesday IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 78mm of rain, while Colaba recorded 18.4mm. Data from BMC’s automatic weather stations showed that average rainfall recorded on Tuesday (8am-6pm) in the island city was 71mm, eastern suburbs 76mm and western suburbs 68mm. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist (IMD, Mumbai), said the deep depression (remnants of cyclonic storm Gulab) on Tuesday was over southwest Vidarbha and the neighbourhood (Parbhani). “The direction of movement is west north westwards. It is likely to weaken into a well-marked low pressure area and its impact will be felt over Vidarbha, Marathwada and Konkan. In Mumbai, an orange alert has been issued and its intensity is expected to reduce on Wednesday,” she said. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Meteorology & Climate Change, Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd, said that Mumbai was expected to see less rain from Wednesday afternoon. “Some areas of Mumbai are expected to see over 100mm of rain coupled with waterlogging in low-lying areas. But as this low pressure area slowly moves towards Gujarat, the intensity of rain is likely to reduce,” said Palawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-heavy-rain-with-gusty-wind-come-with-remnants-of-cyclone-gulab/articleshow/86591975.cms||Richa Pinto

For the last three years, monsoon has been continuing till Navratri, leaving the sprawling salt pans in Kutch and parts of Saurashtra in water, thus making it impossible to harvest salt and register a fall in its production. And, if this trend continues, there could be serious issues about salt availability, according to Indian Salt Manufacturers Association (ISMA), the apex body of salt makers, which has estimated the production to drop 30% over the next three years. Gujarat produces an average 2.86 crore tonnes of salt, but last year it reduced by nearly one crore due to extended monsoon. “This time, the salt production season is expected to begin by the end of December. Parts of Saurashtra and Little Rann of Kutch where salt production units are present have received an estimated eight inches rainfall over the past two to three weeks. Due to cyclonic conditions on the eastern coast, the rainfall is expected to continue. It will take at least two months or even more for the land to dry out adequately to set up salt pans,” said Bharat Raval, president, ISMA. “This year, due to the cyclone Tauktae, salt production season was curtailed by the end of May itself. A further delay in the onset of the new production season will impact production. We expect that an estimated 1.7 crore tonne of salt production will take place this year, assuming that the activity begins in December,” Raval added. Over the past two years, actual salt production in Gujarat had not been in line with targeted production. Salt manufacturers suggest that in 2019-20, extended rainfall and unseasonal rainfall during Diwali hampered salt production process. In 2020-21, the lockdown imposed to contain Covid-19 further hit production activity, said industry players. “In 2020, India did not feel the shortage because the industry was not working full-fledgedly due to lockdown which had an impact on export also. This year, however, the season has been delayed by three months because of extended monsoon and we fear that in 2022 or 2023, there will be an issue of salt availability,” said Raval. According to salt industry sources, out of 2.86 crore tonnes production, 80 lakh tons is used in food while 1.20 crore tonne is consumed for industrial purposes. India exports around one crore ton salt. “We have to export 50-60 lakh tonnes to our traditional partner countries who are totally dependent upon us for salt, so it’s not the question of salt getting costlier but the problem of non-availability,” according to ISMA officials. Salt making season ends on Ashadhi Beej, traditionally the day when monsoon sets in according to the Gujarati calendar. Ashadhi Beej generally falls in July and traditionally from Navratri when rains recede, the next salt production starts October. The season has been shortened by two to three months in the last three years. Shamji Kangad, vice-president of ISMA said, “Last year, the export to China was down by around 30 lakh ton and next year the trend is expected to the same due to high freight and container rates. This will help bridge the demand-supply gap in the domestic market.” Bachu Aahir, president of Gujarat Small-Scale Salt Manufacturers Association, added,“We can’t delay the end of season because one round of rain comes during June-July and thereafter a long break shortens the season.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/extended-rains-hit-salt-production-hard-isma-warns-of-shortage/articleshow/86589953.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The state’s share of Union taxes stood at Rs 20,232 crore in 2019-20 as compared to Rs 23,489.33 crore in 2018-19, the CAG stated in its report on the state’s finances for the year ended March 31, 2020. “Both the components of central tax transfers i.e., direct taxes and indirect taxes also decreased by 13.27% and 14.78% respectively over the previous year,” the country’s premier watchdog said in its report. “They also dipped in 2019-20 for the first time during the period 2015-2020,” the report said. “No IGST (integrated goods and services tax) share was released to the state during the year,” the CAG added. However, grant-in-aid from the Government of India increased by 34.26% or Rs 6,507.54 crore from Rs 18,992.48 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 25,500.02 crore in 2019-20.  “The increase was mainly due to increase in GST compensation by Rs 4,497.52 crore, grants for urban local bodies by Rs 684.06 crore, grants for rural local bodies by Rs 605.97 crore and grants for state disaster response fund by Rs 436.85 crore,” the CAG said. During 2019-20, according to the CAG, 32% of revenue receipts of the state came from the Government of India in the form of the state’s share of Union taxes and grants-in-aid. “The transfers (share in taxes and grant-in-aid) from the Centre increased by 312% from Rs 11,109.99 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 45,732.11 crore in 2019-20,” the CAG said. “The percentage increase over the previous year ranged between 7.65% (2019-20) and 30.09% (2016-17) during the ten-year period.” ‘Improve revenue receipts-GSDP ratio’ The state government needs to improve its revenue receipts-GSDP ratio; at 8.59%, it was lower than the 9.06% achieved during 2018-19, the CAG said. Also, the percentage of capital expenditure to total expenditure (15.28%) during 2019-20 was lower than what was registered during 2018-19 (17.26%), the CAG observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-share-in-union-taxes-drops-14/articleshow/86592005.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Army jawan’s kin get closure 16 yrs after he went missing on Himalayan expedition||Meerut/Uttarkashi: In 2005, while negotiating the dangerous downward climb of the Satopanth peak in the Garhwal Himalayas, three Indian Army soldiers went missing. Two bodies were found, but that of Amrish Tyagi, a Naik from UP, wasn't. Sixteen years passed, a daughter he never got to see grew up, his mother died with the unfulfilled wish to see her son one last time and his wife remarried after a long wait. Last week, during another Satopanth expedition by the Army, a body was found, frozen, in fatigues and with mountaineering equipment strewn all around it. The Army has now confirmed it was that of Tyagi, giving his family a long-due closure. “Naik Amrish Tyagi, from Modinagar in UP, was just 32 when he fell into a crevasse and died,” said Colonel Rajendra Prasad, commanding officer of the 9th Bihar Regiment. “His identity was confirmed on the basis of the Army uniform and the (mountaineering) toolkit that was found intact. His family members also confirmed the identity.” The Army had initially said they would wait for a DNA report before confirming his identity but given the evidence they had — Tyagi was the only soldier in the records who had gone missing on Satopanth and his physical description matched — they didn’t have to wait for it. “We handed the body over to the Army after they sent us a confirmation letter,” said Uttarkashi SP Manikant Mishra. A long convoy of those from his village, Hansali in Muradnagar, followed the hearse as his body was brought home, playing patriotic songs, raising slogans, waving flags. The body was handed over with military honours. “Our mother died in 2019, still hoping to get one last look at her lost son,” said Vinesh Tyagi, Amrish’s elder brother, after the cremation. The Tyagi men have always been farmers. Amrish was the youngest of four brothers, following in his father’s footsteps to join the Army at 19. His father, too, was a Naik. “I am unlettered, so I could not join the Army. Our eldest brother had started working at a very young age to help the family. We didn’t have much,” Vinesh said. “Another brother was preparing for a government job. Amrish was the youngest and said he wanted to serve the nation, like father … He went in right after passing his Class X exams. He always loved running. He’d cover really long distances.” In 2003, his marriage was solemnised. His wife, Babita, was five months into her pregnancy when Amrish had to leave for the Satopanth expedition. He could never see his daughter, now 15. Babita remarried — another Army man — and attended Amrish’s funeral on Tuesday. Vinesh said, “It was hard, seeing his body. We bade him farewell with a heavy heart but finally found closure."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/army-jawans-kin-get-closure-16-yrs-after-he-went-missing-on-himalayan-expedition/articleshow/86590811.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt initiates preliminary works on light metro DPR||Thiruvananthapuram: The proposed light metro project for the capital city is still awaiting clearance from the ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), even when the government is proceeding with the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR) for the extended stretch of the project till Technopark. The state government has already furnished the replies to the preliminary queries raised by the MoHUA and are being appraised by the ministry. Now, the Kerala rapid transit corporation limited (KRTL) which is the special purpose vehicle (SPV) for implementing the project, has decided to continue the preliminary works on preparing the detailed project report (DPR) for the Technopark link of the project. The Delhi metro rail corporation (DMRC) has been finalised as the consultant and the DPR for the Technopark link is expected to be submitted before December 31 this year. Meanwhile, it has been decided to expedite the land acquisition for the three flyovers at Sreekaryam, Ulloor and Pattom. With regards to the land acquisition for Sreekaryam, the district collector has issued 19 (1) notification in November last year, under which the declaration for the land required for the project and resettlement has been made. The district level fair compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement committee (DLFC) had met in July this year, and subsequently, the state-level empowered committee (SLEC) that met in August, approved the rate fixed by the DLFC in the case of 40 land owners. Regarding the flyover in Pattom, the 11 (1) notification, that notifies the land required for a public purpose in the official gazette, was issued in February this year. A public hearing on the rehabilitation and resettlement package was held on September 6, and the package is awaiting approval. However, in Ulloor, the alignment of the flyover itself is facing resistance. A fresh requisitioning form and the alignment sketch will be prepared and submitted to the government, and once it is approved, the 4(1) notification for conducting a social impact assessment study will be issued. The 21.82 km long fully elevated light metro project has 19 stations beginning from Technocity in Pallipuram to Karamana. The estimated cost for the project is Rs 4,219 crore. A 5.4 km branch-line of the light metro connecting all the phases of the Technopark also has been proposed additionally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-initiates-preliminary-works-on-light-metro-dpr/articleshow/86592007.cms||KP Saikiran

The ENC immediately deployed an advanced light helicopter (ALH) from INS Dega for the mission. The aircraft arrived at the reported location (approximately 120 km from Dega), but could not locate the villager due to severe weather conditions. Subsequently, a Seaking 42C helicopter with night vision devices was launched to undertake the mission about 11 pm. Despite strong winds, the helicopter undertook a search, located the survivor and rescued him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/navy-rescues-man-stranded-in-river/articleshow/86590808.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Businessman dies of injuries during raid in Gorakhpur, 6 cops suspended||Gorakhpur: A 36-year-old real estate businessman of Kanpur died after receiving severe injuries when police were checking credentials of guests at a hotel in Gorakhpur on intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. Six policemen, including the police station in-charge, who were present at the scene, have been suspended pending an inquiry into the entire incident. A friend of the businessman, who was sharing the same room, alleged to have seen the police thrashing his friend before he too was repeatedly slapped and whisked away from the room. He said that the police started thrashing them when they questioned the reason behind disturbing them in the middle of the night. Police, however, claim that the victim slipped and fell as a result of which he suffered injuries on his face and died during treatment at the hospital. Deputy inspector general (DIG) Gorakhpur range J Ravinder Gaud told TOI that a postmortem report was awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death. He said that investigations were underway to decipher the sequence of events which eventually ended up in the businessman’s death. “We have not ruled out anything till now. We are waiting for the post-mortem examination report to establish the cause of death and statements of all those present at the scene before we reach a logical conclusion,” said Goud. The DIG is personally monitoring the probe. On Monday morning, real estate businessmen Manish Gupta of Kanpur, Pradeep Chauhan and Hardeep Singh Chauhan, both from Gurugram, checked into a hotel in Ramgarhtal area of Gorakhpur. The three had reached Gorakhpur on the invitation of a friend Chandan Saini, a resident of Mahadeva Bazar in Sikriganj area of Gorakhpur. In the evening, the four spent time talking in the room after which Chandan left with plans for sight-seeing with his friends the next morning. According to Hardeep Singh, it was around midnight when police reached their room and asked him to provide his identity proof. “When I questioned them about the manner in which they had barged in, I was slapped even after I showed them my Aadhaar card. I gave them Chandan’s number and they spoke to him as well. They then woke up Manish who too questioned them on disturbing them so late in the night,” Hardeep said. On being questioned, the police started thrashing Manish while Hardeep was whisked away out of the room. Minutes later he saw the police dragging Manish out of the room. Manish had blood on his face, said Hardeep, adding that some of the policemen appeared drunk. The police took Manish to the hospital where he died. Later Manish’s father and wife reached Gorakhpur and accused the police of having thrashed the businessman to death. Taking serious note of the incident, SSP Gorakhpur Vipin Tada said that the police team had visited the hotel as a part of a checking drive across the district. Quoting the policemen who were present at the scene, the SSP said that Manish apparently fell off his bed and got injured as he appeared to be heavily drunk. He, however, suspended all the six policemen who were present at the scene including station house officer of Ramgarhtal police station inspector JN Singh and Phalmandi police post in-charge Akshay Mishra and four constables. SP (city) Gorakhpur has been directed to probe the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bizman-dies-of-injuries-during-raid-6-cops-suspended/articleshow/86592874.cms||Arjumand Bano
---||Delhi||High-speed Delhi-Meerut corridor: This is India's first Regional Rapid Transit System||NEW DELHI: The 82-km-long Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor will not only pass through the median of Delhi-Meerut Road (erstwhile NH-58) but also cross over rivers, bridges, rail crossings, metro corridors, expressways, etc. The project will see the use of ‘special spans’ to bridge over gaps wherever the corridor has to cross over existing structures or natural features. India’s first RRTS corridor is being constructed by National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) and out of the total 82 km, a total of 70 km stretch of the corridor is elevated. Two special spans with customized shape are coming between Sahibabad and Ghaziabad.A NCRTC spokesperson said that to construct the elevated viaduct of the RRTS corridor, the corporation was erecting piers (pillars) at an average distance of approximately 34 metres. “However, maintaining this distance between piers is not practically possible in some complex areas where the corridor is set to cross over rivers, bridges, rail crossings, metro corridors, expressways, or other such existing public infrastructure,” he said. The entire corridor is targeted to be completed by 2025.This is where the ‘special spans’, which are mammoth civil structures with beams made of structural steel, come in the picture. Two such special spans are coming between Sahibabad and Ghaziabad, with customized shape, elevation, design, and weight, he said. One of the spans is being set up at Vasundhara, which is 73 metres long and weighs 850 tonnes, to cross the railway crossing. “NCRTC is taking all measures to ensure the services of Indian Railways running below are not affected and the construction work is completed on time,” he said. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has used such concrete and steel spans at locations where constructing a pillar to support the viaduct has not been possible. The longest of these is 100-metre-long and was constructed at Okhla in south Delhi to cross over four railway tracks. “NCRTC is building special spans at a factory which are then transported to the sites on trailers during the night to avoid any bunch up of traffic and assembled in a systematic way with the help of specialised cranes,” he said. “The size and structure of these steel spans are designed aesthetically in advance, in line with the overall requirements of construction, installation and usage,” he added. NCRTC has been able to construct 900 piers and 10 km of viaduct, most of which is located in the 17-km-long priority section between Sahibabad and Duhai in Uttar Pradesh, which is targeted to be commissioned by March 2023, while the entire corridor is targeted to be completed by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/high-speed-delhi-meerut-corridor-is-readying-to-bridge-several-gaps/articleshow/86592009.cms||Sidharatha Roy

As on March 31, 2020, the aggregate net worth of all the 88 government companies and corporations was Rs 1,27,069.45 crore against their paid-up capital of Rs 1,05,856.96 crore, it said. Of the 35 state PSUs (SPSUs), 21 SPSUs incurred losses of Rs 2,528.53 crore in 2019-20 while 14 SPSUs, though did not incur any losses (including zero profit) in 2019-20, had accumulated losses of Rs 15,640.07 crore till March 2020.

---||Kolkata||UG admission date extended to October 8 in Bengal||KOLKATA: The last day of undergraduate admissions in Bengal has been extended to October 8 to help universities and colleges to fill vacancies. The higher education department on Tuesday permitted educational institutes to reopen their online admission portals and receive fresh applications for subjects, where seats are still vacant. First-semester UG classes are, however, likely to begin from October 1, as mentioned earlier, as the circular did not mention anything about it. “Both will continue simultaneously,” an official said. Some universities and colleges still have 30% to 50% seats vacant after multiple rounds of admissions, prompting them to appeal to the state to extend the deadline by over a week. The earlier September 30 deadline will end in another two days.  Before this date-extension circular was issued, institutes across the city had gone in for a last-minute blitzkrieg to admit as many candidates as possible from their lists. While some came up with innovative methods for rapid admissions, others have rolled out multiple wish lists so that those lower on the merit list but genuinely interested in studying there could register and take admission. Some initiated further rounds of online reporting so that only interested candidates could be considered for preparation of provisional merit lists. Maulana Azad College started something called a rapid round admission to fill its vacancies. Students expressing interest in taking admissions will get two hours to carry out all the admission formalities. The college published five merit lists for rapid round admission till Tuesday evening, the first one being at 10am on Monday. “Less than 10% seats are vacant now. The rapid round immensely helped because interested students are finishing admission formalities within two hours,” said Subhasis Dutta, principal of the college. Since the beginning, the college has been publishing their lists in quick succession to offer chances to a large number of students. After publishing three merit lists, Presidency University has initiated another round of online reporting for almost all subjects. “Candidates will require to upload copies of their marksheets and certificates. Only those with all documents in place will be considered for provisional merit list in the next rounds,” said an official of the university. Seth Anandram Jaipuria College has started registration for wish list for vacant seats, including those from the reserved category. “We wish to fill as many vacant seats as possible and want to give every applicant a fair chance to take admission,” said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal of the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ug-admission-date-extended-to-oct-8/articleshow/86592011.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Mahendri as reserve leaves greens fuming||NAGPUR: The state government’s final notification for Mahendri conservation reserve in Warud forest under Amravati circle has ruffled feathers of several locals who wanted the area to be declared a sanctuary instead of a reserve. The 68 sqkm area will be the 15th conservation reserve in Maharashtra. The notification was issued on September 13 but was received a couple of days ago. A farmer from neighboring Pusla, Swapnil Mandhale said, “We are really disappointed with the conservation reserve (CR) status. We learn that with CR status, all ongoing practices like grazing and forest produce collection will continue as earlier and people won’t get any tourism and other benefits if the sanctuary is not declared.” Mandhale added, “My farm is close to Mahendri and on September 5, a tiger entered it and killed a sambar. Due to tiger terror, labourers did not venture into the farm for 15 days. Besides, herbivores are damaging orange and other substitute crops but paltry compensation is paid. People are ready to sell their farmlands due to the wildlife menace.” Former Amravati honorary wildlife warden Vishal Bansod said, “CR status to Mahendri is just a formality. To get the facts clear, the state should ask for status reports on conservation reserves that were notified earlier. Officials who claimed that people will suffer if the sanctuary is declared will continue to suffer even now. Sanctuary status would have opened employment opportunities.” Talking to TOI, a section of wildlife experts said, “Areas that were declared as conservation reserves earlier are not doing well as no management plans are prepared and all forestry activities are done as per the working plan only. For these reasons, officials don’t want sanctuaries. In 2014, Muktai-Bhavani in Jalgaon was declared a conservation reserve but no management plan has been prepared yet.” Mahendri connects Melghat-Pench-Satpuda tiger reserves and is part of the corridor. It already has the presence of 3-4 tigers, leopards, hyenas, wolves, wild dogs, 212 species of birds, and 60 species of butterflies. Honorary Amravati wildlife warden Sawan Deshmukh said, “Had it been declared a sanctuary, it would have proved to be a stepping stone for tiger conservation. Not declaring it a sanctuary is a lost opportunity, especially when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray himself was positive about the issue. We have failed to protect such areas by lowering their status as CR. Many locals were keen to relocate and were eyeing opportunities through ecotourism.” Rajendra Mane, a young farmer from Warud, said, “I support the sanctuary, as better protection and soil conservation works in Mahendri would help improve water table in the region in the long run and reduce man-animal conflict, which is the need of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahendri-as-reserve-leaves-greens-fuming/articleshow/86592001.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Rajkot||Lion prides spotted 80km from Rajkot again||RAJKOT: Asiatic lions have once again ventured close to Rajkot!. Forest department teams have spotted the lions sauntering around in villages of Jetpur taluka which borders Junagadh, the abode of Asiatic lions and home to the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary. Several different prides of lions have been camping in the villages, barely 80km from Rajkot, since September 7, officials confirmed to TOI. According to the villagers, the lions are sighted around Bordi Samadhiyala and other villages located on the fringes of Gir, the natural habitat of lions. Sources in the forest department claimed a group of six lions were sighted in this area in the first week of September but they left later. Thereafter, four lions including three sub-adults and one lioness are currently camping in these villages. Prasad Radhakrishna, deputy conservator of forest, Rajkot said, “We can’t divulge the names of the villages for the safety of lions but geographically this area is very close to Gir, so they are coming here. Due to heavy rains, they get water and enough prey base like stray cattle and wild boars.” The lions also preyed on a nilgai in one of the villages. According to officials, there is a significant growth of cotton crop with good height in this area which lions use for hiding. These lions had preyed on a domesticated bull on Monday night. The forest department’s team and trackers are keeping a watch on their movement and sensitizing villagers about the behaviour of the big cat. According to officials, lions in the villages of Jetpur taluka are not a new thing. Four lions were sighted in Pipalva village in March and they also hunted few domestic animals. In December last year, 10 lions attacked a gaushala in Arab Timbdi village during the night and killed half a dozen cows. In January the forest department captured eight lions from villages of Jetpur following vociferous representation by local MLA Jayesh Radadiya. Over the past 18 months, lions have ventured into various talukas of Rajkot district. Three lions were camping for nearly a month in Halenda village of Jasdan, Sardhar and Tramba near Aji dam before they were taken into the sanctuary by the forest department overnight stating that their lives were in danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lion-prides-spotted-80km-from-rajkot-again/articleshow/86589969.cms||---

The direction was issued during a recent meeting chaired by him and attended by MC commissioner Anindita Mitra and other senior officers of the administration. Sources said earlier the deadline given by the UT adviser was October-end, but the MC officials submitted that there were still some issues that had to be addressed. The project of doorstep waste collection through MC vehicles was launched in December last year by former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore. The civic body is yet to cover commercial areas of the city, 10 rehabilitation colonies and certain pockets in villages. Besides, the collection in residential areas was also not satisfactory.

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Tardy police probe draws court's ire||NEW DELHI: A court again pulled up Delhi Police for delay in registering an FIR and “no progress in investigation” on a complaint filed by an alleged victim of the northeast Delhi riots. It is “really a sorry state of affairs”, the court rued. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said it appeared that the case had not got the attention of either the commissioner of police, Delhi Police or the “special investigation cell” constituted to monitor the ongoing probes in the riots cases. Police had clubbed the complaint of Nisar Ahmed with two other complaints. On April 26, 2021, the court had directed it to lodge a separate FIR on Ahmed’s complaint. Three complaints were clubbed into a single FIR no 78/2020 at Gokalpuri police station. The complaint of Aas Mohammad alleged that his shop was robbed and put on fire by a riotous mob on February 25, 2020, while Shaheen alleged that her house was robbed during the riots. The third complaint was of Ahmed, who claimed to have witnessed the communal riots on two different dates, February 24 and 25. He further claimed that on both the dates, he made several calls to police, but to no avail. He alleged that some people had put up a public address system and exhorted their fellow community members to vandalise, rob and put on fire the houses and shops of people belonging to another community. On Tuesday, Yadav noted that FIR no. 134/2021 was registered at Gokalpuri police station on June 7, 2021, after about two months of the court order. The court pointed out that the initial investigating officer (IO) as well as the current IO were present and both of them had submitted that “no progress in the investigation” had taken place. “The persons named in the FIR have not been interrogated. This is really a sorry state of affairs. It is being claimed by police in other cases of riots that the circumstances prevailing during the period of riots and almost four weeks thereafter were really difficult and police could not investigate the cases properly. Thereafter, Delhi was engulfed in the coronavirus pandemic and as such, the quality investigation in the matter could not take place. I wonder whether the police can take the same excuse qua the investigation of the case... The answer has to be a ‘clear No’,” the judge said. It is a matter of record that Ahmed has been shown as a witness in at least 11 riot cases in different blocks, the court pointed out. His son stated in a case that “he had not seen the riots happening at Block-A, as the said place is situated at a distance of more than half a kilometer from his house. Same is the position in other cases where he has been shown as a witness”, it observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sorry-state-of-affairs-tardy-probe-draws-ire/articleshow/86592043.cms||Usha Das

Nearly 60,000 students will receive the vaccine. The state government is keen to complete the vaccination process for students before Durga Puja and so, the deadline for their inoculation was on Friday set for October 8. Within the next 10 days, 57,419 students will have to be inoculated. Of them, 19,902 students will require the first dose and 37,517 students will require the second dose. TimesViewThis gives students some hope of returning to the campus.

Among the city-based institutes will be Calcutta University, which alone has 1,600 PG students who require first dose and 2,800 second dose. KMC health officials said they would be able to provide a maximum of 300 vaccine doses to each camp. Earlier on September 22, the health and family welfare department issued a notice, urging all district magistrates to look after the arrangement of free vaccination camps at various institutes within their jurisdictions. The vaccination data of all students at those campuses were subsequently submitted. A list of 88 colleges and universities has been prepared for the free vaccination drive. The nodal officers earmarked for colleges and universities have been instructed to inform students to register their names on Co-Win; those seeking second dose will have to be told to list the names of the vaccines they will require, whether it will be Covishield or Covaxin. Surendranath College principal Indranil Kar said the vaccination camp would start from September 30 and continue till October 8. “We are calling students in different batches and hope to complete within the deadline,” he said. Scottish Church College has submitted a list of 800 names, most of whom are either from the districts or other states. “The requirement for the camp is for only 30 doses which will be done by Medical College and Hospital on October 4,” said Scottish principal Madhumanjari Mandal. Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne, said, “HODs will monitor the number of students taking the vaccine and the nodal officer will conduct the entire process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campus-officials-meet-kmc-health-dept-for-student-vax/articleshow/86592026.cms||---

The police had filed a case against the rider’s wife Sumera Parvez and his five friends Sanjay, Vishwas, Neeraj, Sabik and Santosh. The police managed to arrest Sanjay and Vishwas and both were brought to Jaisalmer. Initially, the death seemed to be a normal one. Mon was believed to have lost his way in the Jaisalmer desert during a practice run and thought to have died possibly of dehydration or thirst. The police began investigation into the death after the deceased’s brother and mother termed it as murder. Mon belonged to Kannur district in Kerala, but was residing at RT Nagar in Bangalore. According to Jaisalmer SP Ajay Singh, Mon had come with his wife and five friends for the rally. On August 15, 2018, they saw the track and went on a ride the next day where they lost their way. All others returned except Mon who was later found dead in an area where there was no mobile network. Post-mortem report revealed an injury to his back. His wife showed no suspicion over his death and police filed a final report in the case, the SP said. Singh said that he studied the final report and found the case suspicious. Singh said the roles of the rider’s wife and friend Sanjay were found suspicious. After thorough investigating the police concluded that this was a planned murder. Deceased had disputes with his wife on many issues, said police. He earlier resided in Dubai and shifted to Bangalore later. Similarly, Sanjay was first to reach the spot and took away the rider’s mobile and other items, the SP said. Singh said that after getting the proof of planned murder, arrest warrants were issued against Sanjay and others. The investigation officer in search of culprits went to Bangalore and Kerala but the accused went underground. Then a team led by Bhawani Singh went to Bangalore and arrested Sanjay and Vishwas. Later, they were sent to judicial custody, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bikers-death-in-rally-planned-by-wife-friends-two-arrested/articleshow/86592889.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court posted the matter for October 12 after the Centre’s counsel sought time to seek instructions. The petition filed by Delhi Waqf Board said the waqf properties, which were old and important places of worship, were likely to be impacted by the ongoing project. “The petitioner is conscious that the project was cleared by a Supreme Court order, in which the top court held that it was of national importance. The petitioner seeks to clarify that it is not in any manner seeking any order or direction against the respondent and does not in any manner seek to delay or obstruct the project. The petition is instituted with a limited objective to ensure the religious or waqf properties, which are also of historical importance, are preserved in the redevelopment process,” the plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-gets-time-to-reply-on-central-vista-petition/articleshow/86626105.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Saeed’s remand application, the ED stated, “Bhavana Gawali, through her aide Saeed Khan and his accomplices have criminally conspired to convert the Trust (Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan) into a company under Section 8 of the Companies Act through forgery and fraud.” The trust had 11 members, but after converting it into a company, Saeed Khan and Gawali ’s mother Shalini became its directors. Thus, the two got compete control of the trust and its various assets worth Rs 69 crore, the ED said. The trust was converted to a company with the tag of an NGO under Section 8 of the Companies Act, thus making siphoning of funds comparatively easier, sources said. The trust was registered with the charity commissioner, where Gawali was president and there were 11 trustees. The trust runs Mahila Utkarsh Pratishthan’s Ayurved College, Hospital and Research Centre in Washim, among other institutions.

It alleged that multiple times, large amounts were deposited into the trust account and withdrawn the same day on instructions of Gawali. During investigation, ED also found that in 2010, Gawali had fraudulently acquired property of Rs 50 crore for Rs 25 lakh.” The ED case is based on a police FIR where Gawali is a complainant. In the FIR, Gawali named 12 people, some of them who were earlier associated with the trust and had disputed her decision to convert it to a company. She accused them of cheating of Rs 18.18 crore. She alleged that in July 2019, the accused had walked into the trust’s office and taken away Rs 7 crore cash along with documents. They also cheated the trust of another Rs 11 crore, it was alleged..

A large number of senior citizens, who had been avoiding civic body’s vaccination clinics despite their second dose dates getting over, fearing that they would contract the novel coronavirus from the milling crowd, have finally started queueing up. The KMC health department roped in honorary health workers to reach out to such senior citizens and other bona fide recipients and offered them coupons, showing which they could get their jabs at the civic centres without having to wait in lines. Now that the number of vaccine recipients has gone up, the clinics have asked civic authorities to reserve the lion’s share of the allocation for second dose recipients. Going by the KMC health department data, around 75% of the allocations are now being used for second dose recipients. “Every day, we are sending 250 doses of Covishield to a clinic. Around 75% are being kept for second dose recipients,” said a KMC health official. Civic officials said some senior citizens chose not to visit KMC vaccination clinics in Garia, Patuli, Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Kasba and Garfa to avoid the crowds . Witnessing a sharp drop in the number of second dose recipients, KMC started a survey in some neighbourhoods to find out why some senior citizens had given their second doses a miss. On getting their feedback, KMC decided on the coupon system. “Now we are satisfied that second dose recipients are visiting my clinic in large numbers. We don’t have a dearth of doses at present and citizens should take the advantage and get inoculated before the Pujas,” said a medical officer and a KMC-run vaccination clinic in-charge. KMC mega centres are also witnessing a sharp rise in second dose recipients. According to a health official, mega centres in Bhowanipore, Chetla, Harish Mukherjee Road and Behala are witnessing a rush.  “We send 600 doses to a mega centre daily. Of them, 400-450 are being used for second dose,” he said. People from Howrah, Hooghly and South and North 24 Parganas continued to visit KMC centres. “Most first dose recipients are from other districts. As long as we have vials, we will help them,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coupons-bring-sr-citizens-back-to-clinics-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/86592046.cms||Saikat Ray

According to officials, HUDCO has inquired to get more details from the corporation before clearing their first amount cheque. A senior official of JMC, Greater said that HUDCO has asked about the progress of all the ongoing projects that were listed on the loan files. “We have given them the list of projects that are ongoing and money required for further development. This is a technicality and we are preparing the report of the same. If everything is approved, we will get the loan amount within a month,” said the official. TOI tried to contact JMC, Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai, but her phone was switched off. JMC, Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar said that they are expecting money will be given to the corporation before Diwali. “It is important to get loan or else we will not be able to do any development work. We have to pay contractors around Rs 30 crore and other civic work cannot be continued because of cash crunch,” said Gurjar. Both the corporations have applied for Rs 500 crore of loan but initially they will be given Rs 100 to 200 crore. With necessity and security by the state government, the amount will increase. Major civic work related to Roads, gardens, street lights, garbage collection, community halls repair and construction of councillors offices will be done only with the help of loan. Contractors of the JMC, Heritage and Greater have twice gone on strike due to non-payment of bills. After the loan amount is received, the next two years will be Moratorium period i.e. no payment of loan amount during this period. After that JMC, Heritage and Greater will have to pay Rs 4 crore per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/municipal-corps-to-get-loan-from-centre-after-1-mth/articleshow/86592896.cms||---

The patient was taken off the ventilator within 36 hours of the heart transplant, is conscious and responding well. The brain-dead student’s heart was harvested in Kochi and transplanted in the patient in Kozhikode on Saturday, with the health department and police creating a ‘green corridor’ to swiftly and safely transport the live organ within three hours. The heart transplant was carried out at Metromed International Cardiac Center (MICC) “The patient is doing well and without any equipment support. His recovery is fast. He has now started taking a liquid diet too. We have overcome a major risk and now our concern is the risk of rejection,” said Dr P P Mohammed Musthafa, chief interventional cardiologist and managing director, MICC. The recipient was suffering from cardiomyopathy, a condition that affected his heart muscle. Due to this, his heart couldn’t efficiently pump blood to the rest of the body. As a result, the patient experienced fatigue, shortness of breath or heart palpitations. Due to cardiomyopathy his condition worsened over time and he was unable to even move around in the hospital. To ensure medical treatment, the patient had moved to a rented house near the hospital and registered under the organ donation programme with Kerala Network of Organ Sharing (KNOS) six months ago and was awaiting a donor. There are very few centres in Kerala doing heart transplants. So far, the state has seen 54 heart transplants under the Kerala Deceased Donor Transplant. The main concerns about heart transplant is the high cost and risk of rejection. Heart transplant costs anywhere between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/college-students-heart-now-beats-in-a-59-year-old-man/articleshow/86592931.cms||---

The video is said to be a religious event that took place when IAS was posted as divisional commissioner, Kanpur between 2014 and 2017. The videos also purportedly feature a religious leader sitting beside the IAS officer. In another video, Iftikharuddin is seen sitting on the ground while a Muslim speaker is purportedly giving radical lessons at his residence. The SIT will be headed by DG CB-CID GL Meena and ADG Kanpur Zone Bhanu Bhaskar will be a member of the probe team. “SIT has been directed to send the investigation report in the case of senior IAS officer Iftikharuddin to the government in seven days,” said sources in the state home department. After the videos, which are said to be around half-a-dozen in number, went viral on social media platforms, the national vice-president of Math Mandir Coordination Committee Bhupesh Awasthi also made several allegations against the IAS officer. Awasthi alleged that in these videos, Iftikharuddin is telling people the benefits of adopting Islam as a religion. “I have seen the video in which a lot of inappropriate things are being said against Hinduism. A lot of allegations are being made. Statements are being made in favour of a particular religion,” Awasthi added. “In one such video in which he has become a listener, an expert from Muslim religion is speaking on conversion and he is sitting in the forefront and listening carefully to his plea. Muslim expert is inciting conversion by talking about Hindu religion. At the same time, in another video, Iftikharuddin is seen sitting on a chair and reading tales from religious books. He is saying... Declare to the people of the world that the sovereignty and authority of Allah is to be established in the whole world,” he said. After the videos went viral, police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun also instructed additional deputy commissioner of police (East) Somendra Meena to investigate the matter. “The investigation of the viral videos of IAS officer Mohd Iftikharuddin taken at Kanpur commissioner’s residence has been entrusted to ADCP East, police commissionerate, Kanpur Nagar. It is being investigated whether the videos are authentic and if there is any crime in it,” tweeted police commissionerate, Kanpur Nagar. On Monday, even deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya during his visit to Unnao had said, “This is a serious matter. If there is anything like this, it will be taken seriously.” Iftikharuddin was the divisional commissioner of Kanpur from February 17, 2014 to April 22, 2017. Later, he took over the post of labour commissioner. At present he is serving as a chairman of UPSRTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/up-govt-forms-sit-to-probe-videos-of-senior-ias-officer/articleshow/86592899.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

By doing this, they violated the protocol and decorum of the house. The Congress councillors started answering the questions of the Opposition that were posed to the mayor. Mayor Amarjit Singh, alias Jeeti Sidhu, the senior deputy mayor and the deputy mayor sat as mute spectators. Azad group councillors alleged the Congress leaders had come prepared to counter opposition in the cattle shed issue of allotting land to the dairy owners for shifting the animals to a designated place on the lines of Milk Colony in Chandigarh. Congress councillors showed photographs of stray cattle seen on roads when the opposition councillors started questioning the agenda point. Opposition councillors Gurmeet Kaur, joined by Aruna Sharma, Ramanpreet Kaur from Kumbran and Harjinder Kaur from Sohana, raised objections over renting out sheds to dairy owners to set up cattle rearing units. Ramanpreet Kaur said, “We are not opposing the agenda for shifting the cattle out of the city, but the charging of rent from the dairy owners. The Congress mayor did not listen to our demand and instead, through his councillors, deviated the issue to the cattle pound. We fear small dairy owners will not be able to pay rent of Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month, but the Congress councillors snubbed us.” After the meeting, the mayor said, “We will take care that the opposition and the ruling party councillors do not create ruckus in the house, but address the chair in future.” Elderly councillor says insulted by mayor Senior Azad group councillor Gurmeer Kaur alleged that she was insulted by the mayor, who asked her to “stay home at this age instead of fighting in the house”. The mayor allegedly made the remark when the Azad group councillor came up to the bench to register her resentment over the cattle shed issue. Instead of listening to her, she alleged, the mayor said, “You must stay home at this age instead of speaking on the issues in MC house.” She said she felt insulted, and the mayor must be neutral and listen to all members of the house. However, the mayor said, “We have never slighted any councillor and have always taken them along irrespective of their political party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-congress-councillors-violate-protocol-in-house-meet/articleshow/86592033.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Uranium from seawater possible, says CSMCRI scientist||RAJKOT: Globally, nuclear energy is considered as the future of clean energy. However, since the primary source of nuclear energy — Uranium — is finite, scientists across the world are working on efficient ways of extracting the heavy metal from secondary sources. In a breakthrough development, a scientist from Bhavnagar-based CSMCRI (Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute) Shilpi Kushwaha has developed a method to extract Uranium from secondary sources such as seawater and acidic effluents using crystalline thin films and polymer nanorings. Khuswaha was conferred with the Young Scientist Award (YSA) for innovative research by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) during a function held in New Delhi on Sunday. She was awarded by the Vice President M Venkaiha Naidu, under the category of Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences. According to Kushwaha, India needs a sustainable option for clean energy to follow the Paris agreement on climate change. “The demand for energy is increasing day by day. It’s expected that in the near future the demand for nuclear energy will increase worldwide as it is carbon neutral. However, the Uranium reserves are limited and it is estimated that it would be exhausted in over 100 years,” she said. Here the recovery of Uranium from secondary sources such as contaminated groundwater, mining effluents and seawater comes into picture. “Uranium extraction from seawater (UES) is amongst the seven chemical separations processes where progress would lead to global gains. UES provides additional benefits to the energy security of any country. It is independent of terrestrial Uranium ore which reduces the concerns of environmental damage from land-based mining,” Khuswaha told TOI. She added that the heavy metal extracted from seawater is at par with the similar experiments done globally. Elaborating further, the scientist said that secondary sources of Uranium include spillages from mines, effluents of nuclear power plants or fly ash dumps that go into water sources after mixing with rainwater and ultimately end up in the sea. “We have been able to extract Uranium from acidic effluent as well as seawater. In future, we will try to make it cost-effective after improvisation so it Uranium can be extracted on a larger scale and is commercially viable,” She said. The director of CSMCRI Kannan Srinivasan said, “This kind of breakthrough research is required for the nation’s transition towards sustainable development of carbon-neutral energy and clean water resources.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/csmcri-scientist-successfully-extracts-uranium-from-seawater-acidic-effluents/articleshow/86589983.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Vizianagaram police chief Deepika M Patil said the cyclone claimed four lives even as one person was yet to be traced. As per reports, a 70-year-old-woman, Sunkari Suramma, was killed after a wall of the house collapsed on her due to rains at Tamatada village under Bondapalle mandal. In another incident,V Srinivasa Rao drowned in a tank at Kotagandredu village under Gurla mandal. Fifty-five -year-old P Burarayya was killed after a papaya tree fell on him at Gadabapeta. In the fourth incident, 35-year-old G Rama Rao went missing in the waters while he was fishing in Vizianagaram town. A search is on to trace Rao. It may be recalled that the cyclone had claimed one life each in Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, and West Godavari districts. Though the farmers claimed the cyclone has caused damage to thousands of hectares of various crops in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, and a few parts of Vizag district, the officials said they will be able to assess the extent of crop damage only after the water recedes. Power supply has been restored in over 90% cyclone-affected areas in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. Teams of NDRF, SDRF, and police have removed the uprooted trees from roads in most of the places in these two districts. Heavy rains in the hilly areas of north coastal Andhra Pradesh pushed boulders on to the ghat roads.

Later, Parab told the media he was cooperating with the investigation. “I am answerable to the authority. I answered all their questions.” The ED called Parab for his statement after dismissed API Sachin Waze, in his statement earlier, said he overheard that Parab, through deputy RTO officer Bajrang Kharmate, received Rs 20 crore for reversing the controversial transfers of DCPs last year. ‘ED asked Maharashtra minister Anil Parab if he knew Sachin Waze on personal level’The ED questioned state transport minister Anil Parab for around eight hours on Tuesday in a money laundering case it is investigating against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. It is learnt that ED inquired with Parab if he knew Sachin Waze and RTO officer Bajrang Kharmate on a personal level. It is learnt that Parab denied knowing them personally. At around 10 am, Parab started from his Bandra home and went to his official bungalow in South Mumbai. From there he left for the ED office at Ballard Estate (a distance of a couple of km) after telling the waiting mediapersons that he would cooperate with the investigation. Parab reached the ED office at around 11 am and left from there at around 7 pm after briefly addressing mediapersons. He avoided making any political statement. Earlier, the ED had recorded Kharmate’s statement in the case to confirm Waze’s allegation after searching his premises in Pune. The officials collected details of Kharmate’s firms and properties for examination. In July 2020, the then Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had issued an order for transfers and postings of about 10 DCPs at a go, about which then home minister Anil Deshmukh and transport minister Anil Parab were not happy. They got the transfer orders reversed. In his statement to the ED, Waze said, “After 3-4 days, I came to know that after some adjustment and consideration of money, the said order was issued. I further state that I came to know about a total sum of Rs 40 crore had been collected from police officers listed in the said order and out of which Rs 20 crore each was given to Deshmukh through Sanjeev Palande and Parab through Bajrang Kharmate.” Parab’s name was not mentioned in the CBI FIR that was registered after the preliminary enquiry (PE) conducted on directions of the Bombay high court. The court ordered for the PE after a petition filed before it demanded a CBI inquiry on the allegation made by Param Bir Singh where he claimed that Deshmukh, then home minister, had told Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners in the city illegally every month for him. Afterwards, the CBI registered a corruption case against Deshmukh. Subsequently, the ED registered a money laundering case against Deshmukh, who is untraceable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-asked-parab-if-he-knew-waze-on-personal-level/articleshow/86592065.cms||Vijay V Singh

Water entered houses in low-lying areas with many having to use electric pumps to drain it out. Following excess inflow of water, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) lifted 12 gates of Himayatsagar reserviour up to two feet, and six gates of Osmansagar reservoir up to three feet. This led to an increase in the water levels in the Musi. As a precautionary measure, traffic police closed Chaderghat causeway and Moosaram bridge for vehicles following the rise in water levels as a result of huge inflow from upstream. Areas such as Barkas, Mecca Colony, Chandrayangutta, Aliyabad, Bahadurpra, Malakpet, Kalapather, Nawab Sahab Kuntta, Hasan Nagar, Rajendar Nagar and Karwan were heavily flooded. “Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and town planning officials should check as to how people are being allowed to build illegal constructions along open nalas, amid water channels. The rains expose the apathy of authorities towards public problems Old City areas,” said TTDP’s GHMC minority vice-president Mohammed Ahmed. Those living in areas along the Musi river were alerted and asked to move to safer places or take precautionary measures in case water level rises. Residents are also concerned that the downpour will give rise to a mosquito menace which could result in a rise in cases of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. “So far, no officials have come to resolve issues being faced by us. We urge the GHMC mayor and the commissioner to come around Old City to find out more about public issues,’’ said Mohammed Samad, a resident of Mustaidpura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-enters-homes-along-musi-locals-decry-apathy-of-officials/articleshow/86592304.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Hyderabad||Provide immediate aid to rain-hit farmers, says high court to Telangana & Centre||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court slammed the state government over its failure to compensate farmers who suffered crop losses as a result of the heavy rains in September and October last year. It directed the state government and Centre to assess crop damage and extend financial assistance to farmers within three months. The court asked the governments to provide financial aid in the form of input subsidy within one month of assessment. As the administration failed to put in place any crop insurance scheme, the state was asked to take steps within four months to provide additional and appropriate relief to small and marginal cultivating farmers who suffered huge economic loss in the absence of crop insurance coverage. “Use the funds that were put at your disposal under the state disaster relief fund and national disaster relief fund for the purpose,” the bench of acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar said in its judgment pronounced after hearing a PIL filed by Vissa Kiran Kumar and two other farm sector activists. Significantly, the judges in their order made a specific mention about tenant farmers and directed authorities to extend the required help to them. The judges also rejected the government’s claim that it was rendering help through Rythu Bandhu which would take care of such damages and sought to remind that even that help was not reaching tenant farmers. The bench did not appreciate the state’s somersault in extending the help to the aggrieved farmers and said that the state was speaking in one language, while seeking central assistance for the flood-hit farmers and was not speaking the same language when it comes to helping the farmers even with the central funds. The judges summoned the letters the state government wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that the state claimed that the loss was more than ₹7,200 crore. However, Centre got the matter examined through its cabinet sub-committee which recommended a mere ₹188 crore. The bench verified the matter with the help of communication received from the accountant general and concluded that the state has at its disposal over Rs 1,450 crore of SDRF funds. “Leaving farmers in the lurch, the state did not provide any crop insurance facility for the farmers in the state during the year 2020. Nor did it opt for the central crop insurance scheme. Worse still, the state agricultural officials did not bother to inform the farmers that the centre has made the scheme optional, it is for the farmers to go for insurance coverage of their crops or to remain without any protective cover,” the bench said. The bench rejected the state’s argument that though its primary estimates of loss was high, its subsequent assessment of the situation, conducted after rains receded, showed that there was no loss suffered at all by the farmers. “If that is the case, the state should have written to the Centre later asking it not to extend any financial help for the 2020 crop losses,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/provide-immediate-aid-to-rain-hit-farmers-hc-to-state-centre/articleshow/86592176.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Delhi||Delhi child panel identifies 53 begging hotspots||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has identified 53 “child begging” hotspots in the capital. These hotspots have been identified after field observations by the panel, analysing data of various government departments, past attendance records of nearby schools and surveys conducted by NGOs. According to DCPCR, a field survey conducted by Save the Children, an NGO, a few years ago estimated that around 70,000 children live on the streets of the capital. Officials said the first logical step would be to remove the children from the streets and, later, rehabilitate them. DCPCR, which has launched a drive to rescue such children, has conducted rescue operations at eight hotpots so far and rescued over 25 children in the last 45 days. According to an official, after a child is rescued, they are produced before the child welfare committee and kept in children’s home. Such children are rehabilitated or restored after following the due process. Anurag Kundu, chairperson, DCPCR, said: “The hotspots for child begging have been identified at the micro-level and the number of hotspots may go up. We have initiated the process to help such children through the sponsorship scheme of the Delhi government.” Under the scheme, individuals can sponsor education, health and other basic facilities of a child. Explaining how child begging operates in the city, Sudarshan Suchi, CEO, Save the Children, said, “Every kind of inhuman method is adopted for begging, using toddlers and children. The condition of young girls who are pushed in this profession is worse and they are exploited physically and sexually. Children are regularly inflicted with wounds, even maimed, so that they became more pitiable and, therefore, draw more alms from passersby. These kind-hearted men and women often don’t know that the money they give isn’t used to buy food or medicine or providing access to education. Instead, it goes into buying alcohol and drugs, and also given to traffickers.” Suchi added: “The kids are, according to accounts of those rescued, given daily targets for their begging trips. Drugs are also used to keep the children sedated – it is common to see women pretending to be mothers, with a ‘sleeping’ child – the child is usually drugged into submission. It is also not rare to hear of cases where babies ‘rent’ babies from labour-class mothers, to make them much more pitiable to the passersby.” Another survey by Save the Children, ‘Surviving the Streets’ in all nine districts of Delhi in July-August 2010, revealed that an astonishing 70% of street children have to fend for themselves, though their parents, siblings or other relatives also live in the city. Only around 10% were found to be totally cut off from their homes and villages. As many as 61% children were in the 7-14 years age group, while 23% were in the 15-18 bracket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/innocence-lost-child-panel-identifies-53-city-hotspots-begging-for-attention/articleshow/86592107.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: SCB climbs ‘Swachh Survekshan’ rank, but still needs to clean up its act||HYDERABAD: The Secunderabad Cantonment Board’s (SCB) ‘Swachh Survekshan’ ranking in 2020 among all 62 cantonments may have climbed to 31, but the improved rank has not translated into better infrastructure, say residents. In 2019, SCB was at the bottom of the rankings. “There has been absolutely no change even after the ranking improved last year. In fact, the infrastructure has become much worse now. Every time the budget is made, it shows only deficit. We are always told that the money is not coming from Centre and SCB has to pay arrears to the state government for water and other services,” said Chandrasekhar Sankaran of the Open Secunderabad Cantonment Area Roads (OSCAR) group and resident of Alwal. “When the cantonment board is not able to run on its own, and GHMC or water board is doing the work for them, then they might as well be merged,” said Sankaran responding to TOI’s ongoing campaign to merge the two bodies. On the other hand, the GHMC’s ranking has gone up from 275 (2015) to 23 (2020) in the above10 lakh population category in the ‘Swachh Survekshan’. “The concept of cantonments is a British legacy. It is not required now. And unlike GHMC, we do not have proper roads, water supply or other infrastructure. We are paying taxes too, then why can’t we get benefits similar to GHMC residents? Although there are issues to be resolved in GHMC areas, residents at least know the amount being sanctioned by the civic body and are able to question officials if things go wrong,” another SCB resident M Raghuveer said. While SCB officials were not able to provide budget details for the current year, former vice-president of the board J Rama Krishna blamed the state government. “The sad state of affairs is that the state government has completely neglected the cantonment area. Although the cantonment is part of 119 constituencies of Telangana, even a single rupee has not been spent for infrastructure,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-climbs-swachh-rank-but-still-needs-to-clean-up-its-act/articleshow/86591981.cms||Moulika.KV

As per the order dated September 28, land will be allotted at 50% concession for first 500 renewable energy based EV charging stations installed within five years. An official said, " The land at concessional rates will be given to applicants whose applications will reach the urban local bodies of the district concerned through Renewable Energy Corporation. These urban bodies will prepare a proposal for allotment of land and send it to the state government". In the budget speech, the chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced Rajasthan Solar Energy policy, 2019 and Rajasthan Wind and Hybrid Energy Policy-2019. The provisions to allot land on the concessional rates are made under these policies. An official informed, two types of charging stations—fast and slow, can be developed in the state. The fast-charging stations take 60 minutes and slow charging stations will take six hours to charge the vehicle. As per the calculations, for slow charging stations in urban limits minimum 800 square feet land is required where at least 10 vehicles can be charged at a given time. Similarly, fast-charging stations require a set-up on minimum 460 square feet land where it can have capacity of six vehicles. Meanwhile, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has also invited expression of interest (EOI) from private companies to install, operate and maintain charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) in the city. For the same, the civic body has identified nearly 75 locations. Recently, JDA also organised a pre-bid meeting to learn the queries of the investors. Following this, companies have been asked to submit EOI on October 28. "The companies discussed several issues such as procurement of electricity, time for lease, revenue share model and others. Now, based on the queries the document will be prepared for tenders". As per a survey, there are 15,000 EVs in the city. In the coming days, these stations will be as ubiquitous as petrol pumps in the JDA region. "The tentative cost of running an e-vehicle is between Rs 1.25 and Rs 1.50 per km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-allot-land-at-cheaper-rates-to-promote-e-vehicles/articleshow/86592923.cms||---

There are others in public life who are being forced to do the same just because they share the same name as those linked to the case. When Raju Bhatt, a trustee of the Pavagadh temple was named as an accused, his political links also became a talking point. But the member of the media team of a political party from north Gujarat shared the same name. Sources said that the media team member contacted his counterparts in Vadodara asking them why was his name being dragged into the controversy. The real name of accused Raju Bhatt is Hemant Bhatt, but few know him by that name. An entry of a hefty amount found in the bank account details of the complainant woman also raised eyebrows. The name of the person who had transferred the money was soon in the public domain. The name was similar to that of a former corporator and a state-level office bearer of a political party. The former corporator got a series of calls. He said that he was not connected remotely with the case. The corporator was not the only one to find himself in a hassle. A food business operator who is also linked closely to politicians in the city also found himself in a fix. His name was exactly the same as the man who had transferred money. Even he reached out to his political connections wondering what was happening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/persons-with-similar-names-face-barrage-of-questions/articleshow/86590514.cms||Sachin Sharma

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: As streets brim, lake overflow hits airport traffic||HYDERABAD: Following Monday’s heavy rain, the route to Shamshabad and the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) via the PVNR Expressway was briefly disrupted on Tuesday after Appa Cheruvu started overflowing on National Highway 44 near Ganganpahad village. While the traffic was diverted to the Outer Ring Road (ORR), it was opened for two-way traffic around 2 pm. The Appa Cheruvu is a small water body between Jalpally lake and Premavathi lake. An under-construction flyover near Gaganpahad added to the woes of commuters as the road turned extremely narrow, leading to vehicular congestion on one of the busiest stretches of NH-44 that links the city to the RGIA in Shamshabad. “I was worried that I would miss my flight as I wasn’t aware about the traffic diversion when I left home. It took me almost 30 minutes to cross the stretch and finally head towards the airport,” said Vamshi Krishna, a techie who was travelling to Bengaluru. The Cyberabad police advised commuters travelling towards RGIA, Kurnool, Bengaluru to use the ORR. Accordingly, traffic was diverted at Attapur pillar number 215 towards ORR service road. Likewise, traffic was also diverted at Laxmiguda junction towards Jalpally-Pahadisharif-RGIA. “The water was diverted from the upstream as well as from the downstream. The irrigation department placed some sandbags as a temporary measure to stop the excess water from flowing onto the NH-44,” said B Nagender Goud, executive engineer, Rajendranagar circle, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The traffic was partially restored around 10 am after police converted the two-way road into one-way in order to clear the congestion. In view of overflow from Himayatsagar on ORR service road, the traffic towards Shamshabad from Telangana State Police Academy (TSPA) on the service road was diverted at TSPA-Khaleejkhan dargah-Kismatpur-Budwel extension-pillar number 194-Aramghar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-streets-brim-lake-overflow-hits-airport-traffic/articleshow/86592241.cms||---

Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) has constructed a depot for Kanpur Metro on Government Polytechnic ground. The first set of Kanpur Metro remained packed even after its arrival here and would be uncovered and unloaded to be moved further inside the depot on Wednesday when UPMRC managing director Kumar Keshav will also be present. This first set of Kanpur Metro would be used for conducting trials scheduled to be held in the middle of next month, exactly two years after the launch of the Metro construction in the industrial city. So far, the Metro tracks have been laid till Geeta Nagar crossing station. The work to lay the track on the remaining route is going on at a fast pace. However, for Kanpur denizens Metro operations will commence in January next year. On September 18, the first Metro train was flagged off from Alstom’s manufacturing plant in Savli in Gujarat and it was then expected that this vehicle mounted metro train would reach Kanpur city by the end of September. Metro train arrived in Kanpur city via road route. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on September 18 virtually unveiled the first Metro train set. UPMRC MD Kumar Keshav and Alstom managing director Alain Spohr were present in Salvi at the flagging off ceremony. There will be a total of 39 Metro trains and each will have three coaches and would be able to accommodate over 950 persons. In the first phase, Metro will run between IIT-Kanpur and Motijheel — named as priority corridor. This corridor is nine-kilometre-long and will have nine stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/first-kanpur-metro-train-set-reaches-polytechnic-depot/articleshow/86592957.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Dehradun||Litigant’s lack of trust in Bar members saddening: HC||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court last week observed that a litigant’s lack of trust in the Bar should prompt advocates and the legal fraternity ‘to engage in introspection’. The court said it was ‘saddening’ that a litigant claimed that “he has no faith in the members of the Bar”. The comments came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma on a petition filed by whistleblower IFS officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi. The officer, who is posted as the chief conservator of forests (research) in Haldwani, has approached the court against the order of central administrative tribunal (CAT) chairman, directing the transfer of his petition to the tribunal’s principal bench in Delhi. Chaturvedi appeared before the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma on August 28; and said he wanted to argue the case in-person and did not want a counsel. The bench, however, suggested that amicus curiae be appointed in the matter since the petition involved a series of litigations that needed to be examined and even made several allegations against the CAT. The bench added that there were many other legal issues arising out of lateral entry of people at the joint-secretary level in government and, therefore, appointing a senior counsel on his behalf would be in the ‘interest of justice’. Chaturvedi, however, said he had lost faith in the members of the Bar. Earlier, several advocates who appeared for him had to face criminal contempt and which was why “he finds it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to engage the service of any counsel”, he added. The court then reserved its orders last month and a copy was uploaded online on Monday. The bench has said, “It is, indeed, saddening to note that a litigant claims that “he has no faith in the members of the Bar”. But, perhaps, this is a misplaced impression in the mind of Sanjiv Chaturvedi. For, there is no dearth of honest and hardworking lawyers in the Bar. A litigant must have faith before he engages the service of a counsel. The impression carried out by Chaturvedi may not be in an individual one but, undoubtedly, may be a general one. Such an impression should merely force the learned members of the Bar and learned members of the legal fraternity to do a bit of introspection.” The court has now allowed Chaturvedi to argue his case in-person and listed the case for further hearing on October 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/litigants-lack-of-trust-in-bar-members-saddening-hc/articleshow/86590924.cms||---

As on Sunday, survey teams deployed under four community development societies have surveyed 1,16,890 houses and 37 institutions. The survey teams have reported to the corporation about reluctance among residents in certain wards towards co-operating with the survey. Mayor Arya Rajendran had the other day appealed to the residents to ensure full support so that the city can achieve its objective towards becoming a fully vaccinated corporation. “It has come to the notice that some residents are behaving irresponsibly towards survey teams. I appeal to all residents to cooperate with the survey and help the corporation attain 100% vaccination status,” the mayor said in a press note. She said that only the most essential information is being collected through the survey. The survey teams are collecting data based on forms which mainly look at five aspects. Those who have missed the vaccination due to ignorance or lack of awareness, those who are aware but have not been able to access the vaccination centres, persons who have skipped vaccination due to religious reasons, those with health issues and those persons who are away from the city for job related reasons or other causes. The city corporation had planned to kick-start the survey on September 15 and planned to complete it by September 30. However, the survey could not be initiated in all the wards simultaneously due to which the survey teams have not been able to meet the target. In addition to this, non-co-operation of some residents to the survey has been another challenge for the team. Each ward has been allotted survey teams comprising 10 members. The corporation plans to prepare a data bank of people who have been vaccinated and those who are yet to be vaccinated for various reasons. Based on this data, the corporation will organise vaccination camps in respective wards so that the civic body can attain the target of becoming the first fully vaccinated corporation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vax-survey-team-covers-1-lakh-households/articleshow/86592094.cms||---

Police said that an FIR was filed on September 18, in which the victim alleged that he had transferred Rs 1,07,50,000 into the bank account of two persons for trading in share markets. A few days later, he tried to spoke to the traders but they had switched off their phones. Police identified the accused as Rama Kant Khandelwal (46), and his son Rakshit Khandelwal (25). Both are residents of the Vaishali Nagar area. Police said that the duo had absconded as soon as they learned that an FIR was filed against them. “We found that they had shifted to Tonk district.

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice M Duraiswamy observed, “There is no doubt that this petition is fuelled by the petitioner’s ambition to propel himself to stardom by questioning the participation of several prominent personalities in certain advertisements.” The judges said that it will be open to the petitioner to approach the appropriate authorities to take steps to prohibit online games or such activities that do not appeal to his taste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/online-games-plea-against-celebrities-dismissed/articleshow/86592109.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Jaipur||Lands given to people by erstwhile rulers will be regularised||Jaipur: Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Heritage, will be issuing lease deeds to people who have documents of land given by erstwhile rulers of Jaipur in Walled City. This rule will apply only in the case of documents given before 1959 as after that the power to grant land to people rested in the state government. The decision was taken under the ‘Prashasan Shaheron ki Aur’ campaign. In the Walled City area, many families have been living for decades in havelis that were given to them by the rulers of Jaipur in return for the services provided in those times. Mayor of Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Heritage, Munesh Gurjar said, "It is important to give such lands legal status as people have been living here for generations. People in the city have been waiting for this and Prashasan Shaheron ki Aur is a positive campaign in their favor." Neha Saini, great-granddaughter of a vaidh or doctor of the then Jaipur Maharaja, has also applied for an official lease deed from the corporation. The haveli in Chandpol, where the family is residing, was given by the Maharaja to Neha’s family and now needs regularization. "This is a positive step as when applying for a loan, banks don’t consider Royal Court documents in Urdu. By getting regularization from the state government we will get a legality on the property," said Saini. Other residents of the Walled City, however, believe that this facility will benefit only five percent of the population. Vikas Kothari, former councillor and resident of Johari Bazaar, said that very few people have these documents. "Common man had no access to the royal court in those times. Only people serving the royal family have these documents. Moreover, there will be a lot of problems because of the division of property amongst siblings and many property claims. It will be difficult to give such property documents," said Kothari. JMC, Heritage, revenue official Surendra Yadav said that there will be no problem in deciding the owner as they will give the lease deed to the person who has the property in his/her name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lands-given-to-people-by-erstwhile-rulers-will-be-regularised/articleshow/86592948.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The UT administration will then take a call on the mode of their running. During the inspection of Sector 17 multi-level parking lot, the adviser asked MC commissioner Anindita Mitra, chief engineer NP Sharma and other officials to submit the comprehensive plan. Talking to the TOI, the adviser said, “There is a need for similar parking system in entire Sector 17, including the multi-level lot. There can’t be two different systems, as they will ultimately fail the multi-level parking space. Automated parking system will address this issue. The MC officials will submit the plan within a month on automated parking in entire Sector 17.” “Boom barriers were installed in multi-level parking lot, but they are not functional,” he added and asked the officials to improve its infrastructure.  The MC officials informed the adviser that the multi-level parking lot has a capacity to park 950 cars. On an average, 400 to 500 vehicles utilize this facility on a regular basis. Recently, the adviser had asked for a report on ‘smart’ features at all paid parking lots of the city. The MC officials had maintained that 80 of the 89 paid parking lots have put up functional screens. In the first week of September, Mitra had given the parking contractors a week for implementing smart features. It was decided that the features will be verified by an MC team following which further action will be taken. Earlier, the adviser and later the MC general house had raised the issue of non-implementation of smart features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-adviser-seeks-plan-for-making-all-sec-17-parking-lots-automated/articleshow/86592095.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Ahmedabad||Friendly match in Gujarat assembly, with some drama||GANDHINAGAR: On Tuesday, it appeared that a friendly match was unfolding between the ruling party and the opposition. First, four MLAs of the opposition Congress were suspended for creating a ruckus over Covid-19 deaths. Soon thereafter, their suspension was revoked. The elected representatives of both parties were seen supporting each other while participating in routine matters on the second day of the two-day monsoon session of the assembly. Congress MLAs arrived in the assembly with posters and banners, demanding financial assistance to families bereaved by Covid-19 deaths. Soon, the opposition MLAs rushed into the well of the house, forcing speaker Nimaben Acharya to suspend four Congress MLAs. The functioning of the assembly was disrupted for some time. The remaining Congress MLAs then sang bhajans in the well of the house, demanding compensation of Rs 4 lakh to every family which has lost a member to Covid-19. The impasse was resolved when Congress MLA Shailesh Parmar held a meeting with the speaker and the BJP MLAs. Congress MLAs ended their protest and participated in the launch of a book on the processes followed in the assembly. When speaker Acharya proposed to withdraw the suspension of the Congress MLAs, the BJP members readily agreed. Keen observers of the state assembly proceedings termed the episode a “pre-decided friendly match between the BJP and the Congress.” However, during the question hour, MLAs from both parties engaged in a heated debate over the number of deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Citing Gujarat Congress’s own survey, the leader of the opposition, Paresh Dhanani, said that over 3 lakh people have died in the state as against the government’s toll number of 10,082. “There is a huge discrepancy in the actual figures and the official death toll,” Dhanani said. “According to the figures provided by 106 municipalities in response to RTI queries, over 37,600 people have died due to Covid-19 in these cities and towns.” The Congress leader sought to know if the BJP government will pay compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of each Covid-19 victim. Health minister Rushikesh Patel challenged Dhanani to tell his party to first pay the compensation in the Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan and Punjab. After a heated debate, all Congress MLAs stood up and started raising slogans against the BJP, alleging “criminal negligence” on the part of the ruling party in handling the pandemic. Later, Congress MLAs Virji Thummar, Baldevji Thakor, Kirit Patel, and Vikram Madam rushed into the well of the house with banners and raised slogans against the state government. Speaker Acharya suspended them for the entire day and adjourned the house till the end of the question hour. However, when the house met again after 15 minutes, Acharya revoked the suspension. Discrepancies in Covid tollThe new health minister, Rushikesh Patel, in response to many questions asked by Congress MLAs on Covid-19 deaths, said that only 3,864 deaths have occurred due to Covid-19 in 33 districts. In response to other questions, the minister said that a total of 211 children have lost both their parents (total deaths 422). He said 10,827 children have lost one parent, making it a total of 11,249 deaths. The daily press release issued by the state government on Covid-19 figures mentions the death toll to be 10,082. The health minister did not provide a clarification on the discrepancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/friendly-match-in-house-with-some-drama/articleshow/86592097.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by R Chandrasekar of Ramanathapuram district, father of the deceased Banupriya, 31, who was working at the Soolakkarai police station in Virudhunagar district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that his daughter Banupriya got married to N Vignesh of Madurai district in 2016. They had two children aged four and two years respectively. Due to her work, his daughter was residing in Virudhunagar. He stated that on August 20, at around 10.15pm he received information that Vignesh had murdered Banupriya by strangling her using her uniform belt, over a quarrel between them. The Soolakkarai police registered a case against Vignesh for offence under Section 302 of IPC. He claimed that even after registering the criminal case, the police neither remanded nor took custody of Vignesh. Though the postmortem report indicates that the death was homicidal, no proper investigation was conducted. Alleging that no proper investigation was conducted in this case so far, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai seeking to transfer the case to CB-CID. During the course of hearing, Vignesh also sought permission of the court to file an impleading petition in this case. Justice G Ilangovan sought response from the state and adjourned the case to September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-for-cb-cid-probe-into-murder-of-policewoman/articleshow/86592111.cms||---
---||Madurai||Part of illegal hospital sealed, Govt tells HC||Madurai: The government on Tuesday informed the Madras high court that a portion of the illegally constructed private hospital at Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district, has been sealed. Following this, the court directed the commissioner of Tirunelveli Corporation to file an affidavit indicating that the entire hospital has been sealed, within a week. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice M Duraiswamy passed the order after taking into account the submission of the counsel appearing for the corporation who stated that the government had cancelled permission for treating Covid-19 patients in the private hospital. The counsel informed that the several rooms at the hospital were sealed leaving the portion where patients are admitted. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S Ferdin Rayan, who sought to take action against an unauthorised construction of a private hospital named V J Hospital at Palayamkottai. The petitioner stated that the hospital was constructed by violating the building plan. He also stated that the person who owns the hospital had put up additional construction in the adjacent land in an attempt to expand the hospital. During the course of earlier hearings in this case, the corporation commissioner who appeared through video conference, submitted that though planning approval was obtained for construction of a commercial shop, two hospital buildings were put up with a deviation of 2,800sqm. He submitted that a penalty of Rs 54,000 has been collected so far and they would continue to impose a penalty. Taking a serious view in this case, the court had observed that the authorities had closed their eyes and had permitted an unauthorised construction to be put up with serious deviation. The authorities need not be intimidated to initiate proceedings on unauthorised construction as per statutory proceedings. Mere imposition of penalty is not sufficient and the authorities should take steps to immediately lock and seal the unauthorised constructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/part-of-illegal-hospital-sealed-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/86592116.cms||---

The department officials did not disclose the amount or valuables found on the commercial and residential premises. Sources close to the development said that the search was carried out on premises associated with B-Safal developers. The realtor’s headquarters near Pakwan Crossroads, residences of promoters, and other properties were searched by the teams. Moreover, two land brokers and dealers with offices and residences in Gurukul and Drive-In Road areas were also covered under the operation. “Several land deals in the past few years – primarily in the past decade – are under the agency’s scanner. It is suspected that the tax was evaded by fudging records of land acquisition and deals. Further probe is on,” said sources close to the development. “Changing the modus operandi, the teams were asked to go to specific locations near the intended properties without usual police teams or hired taxis. After the teams reached the locations, they were given addresses.

---||Vijayawada||Ganja consumption: 400 youths counselled by Vijayawada police||VIJAYAWADA: In a bid to reduce ganja smuggling and peddling, Vijayawada police began counselling and rehabilitation sessions for youngsters smoking across the city in the past one year. The Commissioner’s Task Force initiated the move to not only arrest peddlers but also gather information on consumers so they could tackle the issue from both supply and demand sides. Till date, close to 400 youngsters, mainly students, have been counselled with the help of clinical psychologists. Speaking to TOI, city police commissioner Bathina Sreenivasulu explained that the network of consumers is being tracked by interrogating peddlers who are caught. “If a student is caught, the parents and the teachers are made aware of their children’s activity. Counselling sessions are held with experts giving a presentation about the harmful effects of smoking ganja,” Sreenivasulu told TOI. Interestingly, a significant number of family members are coming forward to let the cops ‘counsel’ their children. However, civil society activists find the move to publicise their initiative by exposing the students’ identities doing more damage to their lives than just smoking weed. “Putting up photos of students being counselled in public domain doesn’t encourage him or her to quit smoking weed. It just spoils their career and demoralizes them further. Rehabilitation should be done privately,” Rama Rao, a student’s rights activist says. Cops have seen a spike in the number of youths involved in ganja smuggling, selling and consumption in the past year. “Initially the students are offered free sample packets of ganja. If they (students) like the product, the peddlers ask them to bring in more customers to purchase the product,” a task force official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ganja-consumption-400-youths-counselled-by-vijayawada-police/articleshow/86590929.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Pournami (Malu), 18, daughter of Shaji and Mini of Poornendu house, Mottamoodu, is the deceased. The Naruvamoodu police have registered a case and launched a probe in connection with the death. The police, however, said that prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide. Pournami was a class XII student of St Mary's Higher Secondary School, Pattom. She was supposed to take the class XI exam. When her family members broke into her room on the first floor of the house after she did not respond to their calls, they found her hanging from the cross bars of the window. Her maternal uncle Anilkumar said that the family did not think that she was under any pressure owing to the exams. ''She was a very hardworking student. She told us that she was going to study till 11 pm last night after having dinner,'' Anilkumar, who lived next door, said. The uncle’s daughter too was supposed to take the same examination and he was planning to drop them off at their respective schools on Tuesday morning. Pournami's father Shaji is a retired sub inspector of Indo-Tibetan Border Police. Her mother Mini is a high school teacher working at an aided school at Uzhamalakkal. She has an elder sister, Nimmi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/teenage-girl-found-dead-hours-before-class-xi-exam/articleshow/86592113.cms||---

Additional commissioner (law and order) Rahul Prakash said instead of challan, police will issue a ‘pink slip’, stipulating a mandatory counselling session at traffic police’s centres in Mansarover and Amba Bari. “The campaign will begin from the OTS intersection on Wednesday and will continue for three months. Initially, we will not issue a challan but instead will focus on sensitizing people about perils of persistent honking,” he said. The programme will kick off at 1pm on Wednesday and a few days later it will be extended to eight spots and then to 15 traffic spots. “As per the Act, Rs 1,000 challan can be issued under honking violation. But we intended to ensure that more people become aware of honking’s effects on commuters,” he said. Besides the pink slip, a no-honking poster will be pasted on the offender’s vehicle. “Pink slip will include a mandatory counselling. If an offender fails to attend the counselling session, then we will issue the challan,” Prakash said. Police said honking had become a major menace on all arterial roads, especially on JLN Marg and Tonk Road. Police have earmarked OTS intersection specifically to combat the problem. “As the awareness programme progresses in following months, same campaign will be extended to other intersections too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-honking-drive-from-today-traffic-cops-to-issue-pink-slips/articleshow/86592988.cms||---

The police, in its response filed to Hussain’s petition, stated that “any aspersions on the grant of sanction to prosecute him in the case lodged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) can only be looked at by the trial court.” Justice Mukta Gupta directed that the Delhi Police’s response be brought on record and listed the matter for further hearing on November 29. The affidavit filed by deputy commissioner of police (Special Cell) said, “It is abundantly clear that the petition is nothing but an attempt to short circuit the trial and stall the same. Therefore, any aspersions cast on the grant of sanction can only be looked at by the trial court and the same does not fall within the adjudicatory realm of the writ court.” The police also said that while the trial court took cognisance of the offence on September 17, 2020, the petitioner has not challenged the same. “The present petition is an abuse and misuse of the process of law. The petition has been filed on baseless, concocted, and absurd facts and circumstances,” it stated. On July 23 this year, the court had sought a response from the police on Hussain’s plea seeking to set aside UAPA provisions relating to terror activities invoked against him in the chargesheet in a case relating to an alleged larger conspiracy that led to the northeast Delhi riots during the anti-CAA protests. The petition also challenged the grant of sanction to prosecute him in the case lodged under UAPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tahirs-plea-against-uapa-case-an-attempt-to-stall-trial-claim-police/articleshow/86592142.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Days after mayor Dayashankar Tiwari opens new DP road, traffic cops shut it down||NAGPUR: Within days of mayor Dayashankar Tiwari inaugurating the new DP road between Morris College Square and Institute of Science T-point, Nagpur city traffic police closed the same citing lack of safety measures like zebra crossing, synchronisation of signals, stop line etc. The office of DCP (traffic) also objected to the narrowing down of the 18-metre wide road near Morris College Square, resulting in a bottleneck. “The width of the road has squeezed to 11.6 metre near Freedom Park Metro station,” said a senior official from the NMC’s traffic department. DCP(traffic) Sarang Awad on Monday convened a meeting with officials from NMC’s traffic department, electrical department and MahaMetro. The meeting was convened after TOI reported how the new DP road is creating traffic congestion on the busy patches between Morris College Square, Zero Mile, Variety Square and Manas Chowk on Loha Pul Road. Taking cognizance of the report, the DCP and traffic cops from Sitabuldi traffic zone conducted spot inspection. The traffic department of Nagpur city police concluded that the road was opened for the public without proper study and ignoring safety of the motorists and pedestrians. The Freedom Park Metro Station is situated adjacent to the new DP road and it has also squeezed the width of the road near the station at Morris College Square. “Here the narrow road has created a bottleneck and also creates confusion for motorists coming from the Institute of Science side,” traffic cops who inspected the site told TOI. An NMC official said the MahaMetro revised construction plan of the station thrice due to alignment of the pillars and it resulted in acquisition of additional land. This narrowed down the road width from 18 metre to 11.6 metre. When the Metro gets fully operational, the rush of passengers and feeder vehicles may further add to the chaos at this square, said the official. The DCP has asked the MahaMetro to submit its movement plan for passengers boarding and alighting at this station. The DCP has also asked the NMC’s electrical department to improve synchronization of traffic signals at Morris College Square along with connecting junctions including Zero Mile, Samvidhan Square, Variety Square and Cotton Market Square. “Until the traffic safety measures are complied with, the new road will remain closed,” said a senior cop from the traffic police department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/days-after-mayor-opens-new-dp-road-traffic-cops-shut-it-down/articleshow/86592126.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Education minister Adimulapu Suresh said the state government took the decision on aided institutions in a bid to improve the public education system. The minister said, “Though welfare schemes like Amma Vodi, Vidya Deevena, and Vasati Deevena are made available even to those studying in aided institutions, the enrolment rate was not satisfactory and the system failed to deliver results. The government had set up a committee to study the situation. Based on the report, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy placed three options before these institutions; either voluntarily withdraw grant-in-aid status, or hand over the assets to the government or run them as private institutions.” Of the 133 degree colleges, 125 managements, almost 93 per cent, have come forward to surrender either their grant-in-aid status or staff to the government. About 5-7 institutions have agreed to give their assets along with staff to the government. Similarly, out of 122 junior colleges, 103 have come forward to withdraw their grant-in-aid status and five institutions have voluntarily agreed to hand over their assets to the government along with staff. As far as grant-in-aid schools are concerned, 1,276 have agreed to withdraw their status and 100 schools have agreed to hand over the assets and staff to the government. The minister said if anyone can’t run their institution, the department will run it as a government school. He assured no school will be shut. “The problems of contract lecturers were ignored by the previous government, but the current government will take steps to provide job security to them. We have constituted a committee to study the possibilities,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-aided-school-will-be-shut-says-minister/articleshow/86590984.cms||Venu Lanka

This year, World Heart Day’s theme is harnessing the power of digital health. Digital influence in health care has been there for long. Digital technologies are already transforming healthcare, from the use of drones to deliver blood products and other medical supplies, to the use of artificial intelligence to give paraplegic patients improved mobility and develop new medicines. But it has made a quantum leap since the advent of Covid-19. There are several modalities or situations where digital technology can be implemented in our daily life. Some of the are: Digital health recordWhen a patient gets an ECG, a scan report, a blood lipid profile or blood sugar, it is important that he/she scans it and keeps it in his/her mail as a separate folder in a computer or phone. This data should be readily accessible and also should contain information regarding allergy to medications or side-effect of medications or drug interactions. Medical care is a continuum so much so that as the doctor sees the patient it is important to know the background and the past history of all the illness. If a summary is digitally available with the patient, or if that information can be made available in a very short period of time, then that is going to deliver better safer and faster health care. TeleconsultationThe term telemedicine or teleconsultation was in vogue for quite some time, but it was only in March 2020 that government legalized telemedicine. More than 50% of physical hospital visits can now be avoided by telemedicine. Just for checking blood pressure or blood sugar or adjusting insulin levels or for getting a medication for high cholesterol one need not go to the hospital and wait for the doctor from morning to evening. This practice would put a check on waste of resources, time and resultant physical and psychological stress. We have online payment systems too. This makes life easier for both doctor as well as the patient and the net total medical expenses definitely would come down. E-pharmacyWe are now able to get practically any medicines at much subsidized cost from anywhere in the country, as this is made possible by few e-pharmacies who are doing commendable service. Wearables and Apps for monitoring health activities A number of health apps are available in Play Store or Apple store for tracking the number of steps we take per day, the intake of calories, water etc. It is very well known that if we can do something closer 7000 steps for day it reduces incidence of heart disease and diabetes. There are numerous fitness apps to pick and choose from to embark upon a healthier life style if one is motivated to follow them. Home Digital devicesNowadays we have a variety of digital appliances at home to check blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, O2 saturation, etc. Remote MonitoringMany healthcare organisations have embarked on means and methods for continuous remote monitoring of patients especially who are bedridden at home and also patients who are in the ICU especially in the step-down care where they can be monitored from a remote location. Delivery of medicines by dronesThis is a new thing which is catching up as medicines usually carry less weight so that drones can be used to deliver them to different places. This is going to be much useful, recently we have heard in the news that if a person has a cardiac arrest medicine can be delivered on site before even the paramedics arrive The pandemic has illustrated that health is not a luxury; it’s the cornerstone of social and economic development and of global health security. It is in fact, an opportunity to redesign the world — to make it healthier, safer and more inclusive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/deploying-digital-means-to-combat-cvd/articleshow/86592999.cms||---

Bindu Kapoor and her daughters Radha Kapoor Khanna and Roshini Kapoor had moved the HC after a special trial judge on September 18 denied them bail. “These crimes are more heinous in nature as they intend to destroy the economic fabric and financial edifice of the state,” said Justice Bharati Dangre in her order. “Such offences are occurring in plenty and have resulted in stultifying overall growth of the nation and also have caused tremendous impairment to the economy of the nation,’’ she added. The HC also rejected the petition by Rajiv Anand, employed with Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). The Kapoor trio, lodged in the Byculla women’s jail, argued that the CBI court judge erred in observing that the accusations against them prima facie show complicity with the other co-accused in receiving loans “as quid pro quo for favour shown by Yes Bank to DHFL”. But the HC order said: “It is apparent that all the applicants (Kapoors and Anand) are alleged to have indulged in commission of offences, which have resulted in serious dent to the financial health of the state as well as defrauding the public at large.” Arguing for the Kapoors, senior counsel Amit Desai and Mahesh Jethmalani said since they had appeared in court after summons and had applied for bail, they ought to have been released. They also cited a latest Supreme Court judgment on bail for accused who were never arrested during probe and invoked section 170 of the CrPC which contemplates bail when an accused was not arrested during investigation. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda for Anand also said he was never arrested during investigation. The HC pointed out the section does not indicate the power of court to grant bail in cases where the offences are non-bailable. CBI counsel Hiten Venegaonkar opposed bail, saying they were “influential and affluent’’ and there are fears of them tampering with evidence and influencing witnesses who are likely to be employees. Rana Kapoor is in jail since last year in another case of alleged kickbacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-denies-bail-to-rana-kapoors-wife-daughters-in-rs-600cr-case-says-such-crimes-dent-economy/articleshow/86592146.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Savings swell bank deposits in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Stalled capital expenditure and the habit of saving money since the pandemic has led more people to deposit money in banks and keep their savings intact, causing bank deposits to surge. According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), bank deposits in Gujarat surged 12.5% in the June quarter of 2021-22 against the corresponding quarter of 2020-21. Bank deposits in Gujarat stood at Rs 8.84 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2021-22, up from Rs 7.85 lakh crore in the corresponding quarter.  Explaining reasons for surge in bank deposits, M M Bansal, convener of SLBC-Gujarat, said, “Post-Covid pandemic, industries which were planning for expansion or fresh capital expenditure stalled their plans and the trend continued till the first quarter. New projects are yet to take off. Meanwhile, since the pandemic and especially because of the second wave, people made provisions for emergency medical expenditures as savings. As a consequence, bank deposits showed buoyant growth.” Bankers also mentioned that the awareness towards investment into other asset classes such as stock markets, mutual funds and gold is relatively less and masses always prefer to keep their money safe in banks. Private sector banks showed the highest growth in deposits at Rs 47,327 crore during the said period. According to SLBC report, private bank deposits surged from Rs 2.18 lakh crore in the June quarter of 2020-21 to Rs 2.65 lakh crore in 2021-22. Profit-booked stock market gains are also being deposited in banks and people in general are spending less due to which bank deposits are growing. “Since the Covid pandemic, people are consciously focusing on savings, specifically savings in banks with ease of liquidity that can be accessed, should it be required in emergencies. Further, stock markets have been performing well, leading people to book their profits and park it in bank deposits,” said Thomson Jose, branch banking head - Gujarat, HDFC Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stalled-capex-savings-swells-bank-deposits-by-12-5-in-q1/articleshow/86592139.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: As adults lower guard, kids suffer from infections||NAGPUR: Even as Covid incidence has gone down, adults accompanied by children socialising without using masks in crowded places is resulting in a subtle spike in lower respiratory diseases among kids, say doctors in the city. Pointing out that though kids are testing negative for Covid-19 infection, but are vulnerable to bacterial and viral respiratory infections, the doctors have urged people to ensure kids are administered influenza vaccine till a Covid jab is available for them. Paediatrician Dr Anand Bhutada said rainy season and early winter have been a time for upper and lower respiratory infections. “Since we had been taking precautions for Covid, we were also protected from other diseases. Right now, hospitals are over-occupied with cases of bronchiolitis. Not just in Vidarbha, but patients are coming from nearby states also.” “Kids between 2-3 months to 4 years are needing ICU admissions for five to 10 days. Usually such situation is witnessed from October onwards, but this time it is being seen early. Last year, number of such cases was surprisingly low as we were following Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Bhutada. Paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charade said cases of many lower respiratory tract infections, not Covid, are on the rise. “Many kids are infected with bacterial or viral pneumonia. There are a couple of reasons for this. Citizens have nearly shunned physical distancing and use of mask. During festive celebrations, people mingled a lot. Kids have been exposed to these infections. As of now, influenza vaccine can be given to the kids, in case Covid cases go up... they will have protection,” said Dr Charade. Paediatrician Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala held sudden variations in temperature majorly responsible for the spike in respiratory diseases among kids. “Last year, kids were mainly indoors and the monsoon didn’t extend for so long leaving kids in good health. Now, we have a lot of kids wheezing or suffering from pneumonia. There is a bit increase in the number of cases usually seen in pre-Covid times. The civic body has mandated RT-PCR test for all kids, but they are testing negative. Recovery is good among pneumonia cases, though they need hospitalization,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-adults-lower-guard-kids-suffer-from-infections/articleshow/86592152.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||In 10 years, BMC spent Rs 7,000 crore on desilting, SWD works: RTI||MUMBAI: The BMC has spent Rs 7,000 crore on desilting works and stormwater drain (SWD) projects in a decade, showed the civic body’s data in reply to a Right to Information (RTI) application. The data further showed that of the Rs 7,000 crore, Rs 1,000 crore has been spent on desilting nullahs and Mithi river. TimesViewThe Rs 7,000-crore spent on flood mitigation and preventing waterlogging in Mumbai shows that a lot of money has gone down the drain in the last 10 years as Mumbai still floods eve ry monsoon. No lessons seem to be learnt from the 2015 desilting scam. The chronic flooding spots, like Hindmata and Milan Subway, continue to go under and new flooding spots are added every year. The BMC must appoint independent auditors to check the desilting works and get its act together.BJP MLA Ameet Satam, who got the data under RTI Act, said that despite spending so much money between 2010 and 2020, the BMC has failed to make Mumbai flood-free. “BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had made bogus claims that the municipality has carried out 114% desilting in 2020 and 104% desilting in 2021. The claims are hollow; the city gets flooded even when it rains for a few hours,” Satam said. “This is nothing but misusing taxpayers’ money to fund contractors and get kickbacks,” he alleged. According to Satam, in a period of 10 years, the BMC has spent close to Rs 1,000 crore for desilting Mithi River (Rs 140 crore), major nullahs (Rs 460 crore), nullahs under railway tracks (Rs 26.6 crore) and minor nullahs (Rs 338 crore) . “In addition, the BMC has spent Rs 6,000 crore on SWD projects like pumping stations and widening of rivers. All this money has literally gone down the drain.” Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu refused to comment on Satam’s claims. In June, after BJP’s allegations that the municipality had failed to clean up the city’s nullahs ahead of monsoon, the BMC had claimed that it had removed around 3.24 lakh tonnes of silt and completed 104% of desilting works. According to BMC officials, more than 3.2 lakh tonnes of silt was removed from city drains instead of the target of 3.1 lakh tonnes. In another RTI plea by Satam, in January, the BMC had said that its road department had spent more than Rs 21,000 crore on the repair, maintena-nce and construction of roads since 1997. The data also showed that the maximum money —Rs 3,201 crore—was spent between 2013 and 2014. Thereafter, in 2015, the road scam came to light, raising questions over the expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-10-years-bmc-spent-rs-7k-cr-on-desilting-swd-works-rti/articleshow/86592164.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

On being ragged, dial 112 for police help!.” The police have also suggested seniors to help juniors in a way that they feel like that they are at home. “Go around and show them the college, drink hot tea with juniors and indulge in healthy talks,” stated one such poster. In yet another poster, it was written ..if ragging is happening? Dial 112, call for help. The victims have also been asked to contact Commisionerate police on Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram address numbers.

According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), the non-performing assets for the MSMEs surged by 5.7% in the first quarter of 2021-22 at Rs 10,640 crore from Rs 10,064 crore in the corresponding quarter. Bankers suggest that worst affected were MSMEs in the tourism, hospitality sector in addition to textiles. “In tourism, hospitality sector, the business failed to pick up for most part of the year due to the pandemic and restrictions. The relief package was announced much later for these sectors. That apart, textile sector continued to struggle for demand revival due to which stress remained in smaller units, pushing bad loan burden up,” said a senior SLBC official. “Transporters felt the heat of taxes whereas travel agents’ funds were stuck with airlines at a time when they battled piling overhead costs with a steep decline in revenues. Hindered travel also impacted hoteliers’ business all of which caused bad loan burden to increase,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat chapter. Overall, NPA burden on banks in Gujarat went up from Rs 35,471 crore to Rs 43,487 crore during the said period – up by Rs 8,016 crore. “With moratorium period ending, the bad loan burden reflected in the first quarter is a cumulative effect of the past three quarters. Therefore, the overall burden is high,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC, Gujarat. The highest NPA growth was reported for housing loans at 85%, albeit on a lower base, which surged from Rs 1,034 crore to Rs 1,923 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stressed-tourism-hospitality-sector-causes-5-7-rise-in-msme-bad-loans-slbc/articleshow/86592155.cms||Niyati Parikh

The directive came at separate meetings held by Madurai city and district police with them in the wake of the recent statewide crackdown on anti-social elements following a series of revenge killings and criminal activities. “Sales of kitchen knives or sickles for domestic purposes are understandable. However, we find many rowdies possess weapons like billhooks that are much bigger in size, and even swords. We have asked weapons manufacturers and sellers to hence collect all personal details possible of customers, including even Aadhaar number. We also asked them to report any suspicious activity and for CCTV cameras to be installed on their premises,” said V Baskaran, Madurai district superintendent of police. He said station-wise meetings were held with weapons manufacturers and sellers in the area. Police hope this move will help monitor movement of weapons to some extent. “The weapons manufacturers and sellers too want to keep themselves safe and so we are expecting them to co-operate. They may sell to rowdy elements out of compulsion. So we are hoping that they will alert the police quickly of any suspicious activity ,” said the SP. City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha also instructed such weapons manufacturers and sellers and to maintain a register with details of those buying weapons and the reason for the purchase. CCTV cameras were also to be likewise installed in the shops to monitor suspicious activity. The city police also told autorickshaw drivers to alert the police immediately of any suspicious movement of rowdy elements carrying weapons. Madurai, Othakadai, Nelpettai and Villapuram are prominent areas where weapon sellers and manufacturers are located. One such weapons seller, who did not want to be named, said they will try to follow the instructions but 100% compliance may not be possible immediately. “We have mostly farmers coming in to buy tools for agriculture work. We will have to see how far customers will comply with it and we cannot force them in any way,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/collect-aadhaar-no-of-buyers-cops-to-sellers-of-knife-sickle/articleshow/86592147.cms||---

A city-based NGO Prayas Team Environment (PTE) is vaccinating stray dogs to keep them free from rabies so that they do not pass on the virus to humans. Every year, PTE vaccinates around 7,000 stray dogs that they rescue or treat. Apart from these dogs, nearly 1,500 canines are vaccinated by visiting specific areas. On Tuesday, stray dogs in Dumas were vaccinated. “We identify areas for carrying out vaccination with some local support. At present, we are vaccinating 8,500 dogs every year and we are working to increase the numbers to 10,000,” said Darshan Desai, a volunteer of PTE.  A pamphlet to create awareness about behaviour of dogs and measures to be taken regarding stray dogs has been prepared and distributed. “We are distributing the pamphlets in schools, residential societies and through social media platforms. Along with vaccination and awareness, we are working for sterilisation of dogs,” added Desai. “The vaccination and sterilizing drives sterilization are being carried out so that we can control rabies. If rabies is eliminated, cruelty to dogs will also be reduced,” said Desai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ngo-to-vaccinate-stray-dogs-for-rabies/articleshow/86590087.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Justice Subramonium Prasad said that no useful purpose would be served by keeping the accused, an engineering graduate, in further custody and directed that he be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 75,000 with two sureties of the like amount. “A perusal of the site map shows that the petitioner hit the victim and drove a considerable distance before stopping the vehicle as another car came in front of him from the other side. The site map shows that the petitioner was not driving on the straight road but took at least four turns before stopping the vehicle. Be that as it may, the investigation is more or less complete. Most of the witnesses are police witnesses and their statements have been recorded. The chargesheet will be filed on or before 10.10.2021,” the judge said in his order dated September 27. The court added that the “Supreme Court has laid down a number of times that a man is innocent until he is found guilty and bail is rule while jail is an exception” and therefore, the accused cannot be kept behind bars only on account of being accused of committing an offence of attempt to murder. “No doubt the petitioner is charged with an offence under Section 307 IPC and if convicted, the petitioner may be sentenced for life, but that alone cannot be a factum to keep the petitioner in incarceration,” the order said. “The petitioner is an engineering graduate having roots in the society,” it added. The judge directed the accused to not leave the city without the court's permission or tamper with evidence and try to influence the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-grants-bail-to-engg-grad-who-dragged-cop-on-car-bonnet-says-probe-almost-over/articleshow/86592161.cms||---
---||India||EC writes to WB Govt delegation meets EC, seek strict measure to ensure free, fair poll in Bhabanipur||NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Tuesday wrote to the West Bengal chief secretary conveying grave dissatisfaction over the incidents of violence during polls in the state and directed him to fix responsibility for the failure to prevent poll-related violence even when just three assembly constituencies are going to bypolls. “You are hereby directed to immediately examine at your level the facts and circumstantial evidence including deployment of adequate security personnel, locations of patrol parties, call logs of control rooms and other arrangements to anticipate and prevent violence incidents….and initiate appropriate action as per extant procedure and send a report to the Commission by 29th September, 2021, 2 pm,” said the EC communication. EC also directed the chief secretary to ensure that no further violent incident or atmosphere that perpetrates possibility of violence takes place anywhere in the poll-bound districts or cities that may vitiate the poll process during the silence period and counting. “Looking at the post-poll violence as a continuum assumes potential to disturb democratic process, hence you should also take adequate measures to ensure that no incidents of post-poll violence occur. Chief secretary, home secretary, DGP and Commissioner of Police, Kolkata, shall be personally responsible for the same,” warned EC. Stating that violence-free, peaceful atmosphere was an absolute must for conduct of free and fair polls, Commission reminded the West Bengal government that it has repeatedly, regularly and in unequivocal terms stressed on the criticality of not only violence-free atmosphere but also against atmosphere of even perceived threat at any stage of election process, i.e. during campaigning, voting, counting and post poll. “The same was reiterated when the Commission held a video conference with you along with home secretary, DGP and Commissioner of Police, Kolkata on September 9, 2021, followed by regular reviews held with DEOs,” EC told the chief secretary.. “Despite your basic duty to ensure violence-free elections, Commission's repeated instructions, incidents of violence have been reported including the one yesterday which have the serious potential to vitiate the conduct of free and fair polls and also creating/furthering fear psychosis. Commission strongly condemns any form of violence during election process and hereby conveys grave dissatisfaction on the incidents of violence,” said EC. The EC’s rap came despite the West Bengal chief secretary, in his report to the poll panel on the Bhabhanipur clash in which BJP leader Dilip Ghosh was allegedly manhandled, informed the poll panel that it has registered an FIR in connection with the incident and arrested eight persons. Sources added that the state government also claimed that all political leaders needed to inform the police in advance about their plans for door-to-door campaigning so that proper security can be arranged. It not done in the immediate case, it insisted. However, EC was not satisfied with the explanation. Earlier on Tuesday, a high-level BJP delegation met the Election Commission and lodged a complaint against TMC and the state government for indulging in violence and sought measures to ensure free and fair polling. Union ministers Bhupender Yadav, Anurag Thakur and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi were among the members of the delegation which also urged the EC not to release Form 20, which publishes election-related statistics and data, for the one year. This will protect the innocent voters from the wrath of TMC and its agents and also from the state government that is more of an extension of the party, rather than a constitutional body, the BJP delegation said. BJP hit out at the TMC government in the state and accused it of resorting to violence to target its rivals and referred to the alleged attack on its leader Dilip Ghosh by TMC workers. “Met EC officials along with senior party colleagues over Bhabanipur violence. The attack on Dilip Ghosh and other BJP workers is shameful. We demand strict action as Mamata Banerjee and TMC have no respect for democracy and the rule of law,” Yadav told reporters at the EC office. BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal is pitted against Mamata in Bhabanipur bypolls slated for September 30. “The Commission must issue appeals to the general public and particularly the voters of the area, of the steps that it has taken to ensure safety of voters and arrangements made for a fair poll. Voters need to be reassured of their safety,” the party said in its petition to the panel. . The party demanded that polling officers should not be drawn from the offices of the state government. Instead they should be drawn from organizations not under the control of the state government. “Intensify patrolling and area domination with immediate effect and ensure that it is further strengthened on the day of polling,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ec-writes-to-wb-govt-delegation-meets-ec-seek-strict-measure-to-ensure-free-fair-poll-in-bhabanipur/articleshow/86594098.cms||Bharti Jain

It is not the first time that Kejriwal has made false promises, they alleged. Gupta said Delhi BJP would march to Kejriwal’s residence on Thursday in protest. They said Kejriwal had promised to all landlords during the first Covid wave in 2020 that Delhi government would pay them rent if a tenant couldn’t afford it. Gupta said Delhi High Court had remarked that the AAP government did not have the intention, but made the promise. Bidhuri said Kejriwal should promise that he won’t make another false promise. “The CM announced that every doctor, nurse, medical staff, sweeper, teacher, policeman, and any other staff who die on Covid duty will be considered Corona warriors and their families will be given Rs 1 crore. Only around a dozen people have received this compensation so far while over 400 have lost their lives,” Bidhuri said, demanding that all such families be given the compensation. No reaction was available from Delhi government despite TOI’s attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-govt-failed-to-fulfill-vow-on-free-rent-to-poor-tenants-bjp/articleshow/86592201.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||‘Small but consistent routine changes key to control cardiac problems’||Nagpur: Onset of heart disease in younger age group in India has been a matter of concern for doctors, especially in last 10 years. People as young as 35 and even younger are suffering from ‘heart failure’ in India. On the occasion of World Heart Day, doctors in Nagpur suggested some simple modifications in lifestyle to prevent heart problems. Heart failure doesn’t mean the heart has stopped working, said Cardiologist Dr Nitin Tiwari. “Rather, it means that the heart works less efficiently than normal. Due to various possible causes, blood moves through the heart and body at a slower rate, and pressure in the heart increases. As a result, the heart can’t pump enough oxygen and nutrients to meet the body’s needs,” he said. Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in the country. A study states that 50% of patients suffering from heart failure die in the first five years of diagnosis and 90% in the next ten years. Heart failure can be ongoing (chronic), or it may start suddenly (acute). “We must learn some basics of heart health. Signs and symptoms like shortness of breath with activity or when lying down, severe fatigue and weakness, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet and rapid or irregular heartbeat could not be neglected,” said Dr Dinesh Padole. Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged mucus, swelling of the belly area (abdomen), very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup, and chest pain are among other symptoms. Cardiologist Dr Hrushikesh Umalkar said minimal positive dietary changes and very normal and easy exercise can bring good results, provided you fo it consistently for a long time. “There is no need to start heavy exercise at once or introduce sudden changes in your daily diet like quitting sugar or salt at once. Such sudden resolutions made in excitement, in fact, create health hazards. It’s always better to go step by step,” he said, advising marginal changes in diet and moderate exercise. “Just ensure consistency and these good habits will soon become part of your lifestyle. This slow but sure shift to a healthy lifestyle will head you towards a healthy heart,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/small-but-consistent-routine-changes-key-to-control-cardiac-problems/articleshow/86592193.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The contest was between Naran Patel and Priyavardan Korat, both members of Akhil Gujarat Rajya Shala Sanchalak Mahamandal. The confusion prevailed till late evening and the final result was not known till 10 pm, said sources. The elections were held on the lines of a new set of rules introduced by the state government in the form of The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (Amendment) Act, in September 2020. The new rules have reduced the number of elected members to the board from 26 to nine. With two candidates being elected unopposed, the elections were held for seven members. Dhiren Vyas of Ahmedabad had a landslide victory for the seat meant for representative of parents’ association. The president of All Gujarat Vali Mandal Naresh Shah was also in the fray but he lost.

---||Goa||FC Goa edge past Bengaluru to enter Durand Cup final||Goalkeeper Naveen Kumar redeemed himself to secure FC Goa a 9-8 sudden-death tiebreaker win over Bengaluru FC and enter the Durand Cup final at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan (VYBK) in Kolkata, on Wednesday. The teams went head-to-head but the scores were level 2-2 after extra time. Sivasakthi (1’, 82’) scored a brace for Bengaluru while Devendra Murgaonkar (8’) and substitute Redeem Tlang netted one each for Goa. Goa started strongly with three foreigners on the pitch as centre-back Ivan Gonzalez made his first appearance of the season. Juan Ferrando’s side are used to building up moves from the back, but it backfired in the very first minute. Naveen delayed in his clearance after a back pass from Papuia and Sivasakthi pressed hard to get a touch off the ball that rolled into the net. Bengaluru coach Noushad Moosa could hardly believe his eyes when his side took an unlikely lead and they kept on pressing hard throughout the match. It was only the third goal conceded by Goa in four matches and they were trailing for the first time in the tournament. But they responded within seven minutes as Muhammed Nemil set up his striking partner Devendra for a glancing header. Goa captain Edu Bedia and fellow Spaniard Alberto Noguera tried hard to create openings even as they kept the ball for long periods. But Bengaluru’s developmental players were well organised. In the second half, last season’s top Indian scorer in the I-League, Bidyashagar Singh, came close to scoring before he saw his effort sail over Naveen. Bengaluru had another chance, but Akashdeep Singh’s shot lacked direction. At the other end, Goa finally took the lead in the 72nd minute when Noguera found Redeem inside the box. The attacker turned and shot powerfully which was too much to handle for Bengaluru goalkeeper Lara Sharma. Goa thought they had done enough and tried to maintain ball possession, but Bengaluru didn’t give up. With eight minutes to go for regulation time, Mamgayal Bhutia whipped in a cross and Sivasakthi once again got the better of Naveen, this time with a header. Both the team players were drained out in extra time due to cramps. However, Edu came closest to score in the last five minutes when his feeble effort hit the upright. It was an even contest in the penalty shootout as well, but Naveen finally breathed a sigh of relief when he blocked young midfielder Damait Lyngdoh’s spot kick to send Goa through to the final. Goa will take on I-League side Mohammedan Sporting in the summit clash on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-edge-past-bengaluru-to-enter-durand-cup-final/articleshow/86626474.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The accused, who was wielding a sickle, also attacked a passer-by who tried to intervene. The victim, Varsha Goshe, died on the spot, while the man who tried to help her, Vilas Bolada (40) is under treatment for his injuries. The Dahanu police said that while the motive behind the girl’s murder is not clear, the accused Pramod Goshe (46) had a rift with her parents. Villagers also told the police that the accused was of unsound mind. The girl was walking on the Ranshet-Vangadpada road around 1 pm, when the accused stabbed her with a sickle. Eyewitnesses told the police that he then ran into the nearby jungle. A police team combed the forest and caught Pramod in a few hours. The sickle was seized from him. He has been booked for murder and attempt to murder under the IPC. He will be produced before the Dahanu court on Wednesday. The police added that his wife had left him three years ago due to his mental condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farm-labourer-hacks-8-yr-old-girl-to-death/articleshow/86592220.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Villagers penalised for conducting jallikattu after digging hillock||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed a group of villagers in Tirupur district to pay Rs 1.9 lakh for illegally excavating a portion of a local hillock and cutting down trees to conduct jallikattu (bull taming event). K M Muthuswamy, a resident of Thogutti Palayam village, had filed a case alleging that ‘Alagumalai Jallikattu Kaalaigal Nalasangam’ conducted an event in January on land belonging to Muthukumara Bala Dhandayuthapani Temple. The group dug and excavated a portion of the hillock, which is spread over 70 acres, and used heavy earth movers to cut down trees, Muthuswamy said in his petition. Subsequently, the NGT southern zone (SZ) formed a joint-committee, composed of officials from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), revenue, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) and forest departments, to look into the issue. During the inspection, the committee found out that bushes and ‘unusable’ trees were cut down from the jallikattu event field and topsoil was removed for a depth of about 1.8m on the western side of the temple land. This altered the topography of the area, the report said. The department of geology and mining, which inspected the site, told the tribunal that a total of 682.5 cubic metres of minor minerals were illegally mined for the purpose of creating a shelter for 784 bulls, which participated in the event. Based on these findings, the NGT SZ members — Justice K. Ramakrishnan and K Satyagopal — on September 23 directed the group, which organised the event, to pay Rs 1.9 lakh as expenditure incurred and the loss sustained due to the illegal mining of minor minerals. The group has three months’ time to pay the amount, level the land and plant the trees as suggested by the joint-committee. Failing which, the Tirupur district collector has been directed to carry out the same and recover the amount from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/villagers-penalised-for-conducting-jallikattu-after-digging-hillock/articleshow/86592202.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC orders Morbi ceramic units to deposit 25% of penalty||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked nearly 600 ceramic units in Morbi-Wankaner cluster to deposit 25% of penalty amount with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The HC said that all the units were responsible for causing environment damage and liable to pay but permitted the units to make full payments after the authorities complete their damage assessment and fix final liability on each of the units. GPCB had ordered all ceramic units in this cluster to pay fine of Rs 5,000 per day since their establishment for causing environmental damage by using coal gasifiers. The interim compensation imposed on these units comes to around Rs 500 crore. The authorities are yet to determine final compensation. After demand for interim compensation, more than 500 units approached the HC, complaining that they were not given an opportunity to defend themselves. After hearing the petitions, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati refused to buy the argument that the units were not granted an opportunity of hearing before determining the interim environment damage compensation. The HC said, “We are of the view that the writ applicants (ceramic units) are liable to pay the interim environment damage compensation.” It said that the final payment would be subject to the final damage assessment report by three institutes — National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) and Advanced Materials and Processes Research Institute (AMPRI). The HC has requested these institutes to speed up their study. The court said that by the time the study is completed and appropriate report is filed, the units should deposit 25% of the amount stipulated in the notices issued by GPCB. Last November, the HC had stayed the authorities from taking coercive steps for recovery of compensation for their continuing to use coal gasifiers despite a strict no by the National Green Tribunal and the Gujarat high court. The GPCB had cited a report by a committee set up by the NGT, which held the ceramic units responsible for violation of pollution norms and recommended penalty of Rs 5,000 per day since the day GPCB gave consent for establishment to that particular unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-morbi-ceramic-units-to-deposit-25-of-penalty/articleshow/86592199.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Fresh tenders, same result: Contractors in Mumbai again bid low for gardens’ maintenance||MUMBAI: Contractors have beaten the BMC’s garden department yet again. Despite losing deposits over low bids in the previously scrapped tenders for the maintenance of more than 200 parks and gardens in the city, contractors have again placed bids around 40% below estimates in the fresh tenders. Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide, who had taken the decision to scrap the initial tenders and make contractors forfeit their security deposits, said that the file was under process and an appropriate decision would be taken soon by the competent authority. TimesViewThe need for well-maintained, easily accessible open spaces has become even more acute after the pandemic. It was a good move that the BMC had forfeited the security deposits of contractors who had bid way below the estimates and would have ended up doing a shoddy job. But with the contractors still bidding below estimates for the second time, the BMC must put in place strict audits, quality checks and supervision to improve and beautify open spaces.In July, the BMC had scrapped 24 tenders worth Rs 50 crore for the maintenance of more than 200 parks and gardens for a year after contractors bid over 40% below estimated costs and allegedly attempted to create a cartel. The contractors had also lost deposits totalling around Rs 50 lakh for the low bids. Even the civic roads department had faced a similar situation. Earlier this month, the BMC held back road contracts worth Rs 1,200 crore after contractors bid 30% below estimates. Civic officials said that they are likely to call fresh bids and propose to increase the retention money to be paid to contractors to 15% from 2% at present, and pay the amount only after the sixth year of construction based on the quality of work. The BMC has 1,052 open plots, together measuring 1,200 acres. “We had floated fresh tenders for the the maintenance of parks and gardens and the estimates were reduced by 20%, but even then, contractors have bid close to 40% below the actual cost. This may be because there is no business due to the lockdown and they want to get work to ensure their survival. So many contractors are ready to work at no profit-no loss too just to keep their companies alive,” said a senior civic official. With the contractors bidding below estimates once again, now several parks and gardens are without any full-time maintenance contractors. The BJP alleged that the municipal body has failed to break the cartel of contractors. “This shows that the contractors are more powerful than the civic body,” claimed BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. “The BMC is now giving out short-term quotation contracts to the same companies at over 50% below the estimated costs. Scrapping the tenders and then giving work to the same companies doesn’t make any sense,” Mishra said. “Those companies who have bid below 30% for the second time must be blacklisted. The BMC must put in place very strict quality checks and audits and appoint contractors at once. The BMC must also conduct an inquiry against the officials who prepare the estimates. How can contractors bid below 40% of the actual estimates?” While usually the BMC floats tenders for a two-year contract, this year it had planned to give it out for only a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fresh-tenders-same-result-contractors-again-bid-low-for-gardens-maintenance/articleshow/86592277.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||The verdict: Security upped at Delhi's Rohini court, chinks remain||NEW DELHI: Security has been intensified at the Rohini district courts when it reopened for the public on Monday after last Friday’s shootout in which notorious gangster Jitender Gogi was killed in a courtroom. While there are still some chinks in the armour, the cops, bar associations and judicial members are working on a foolproof security plan. The shootout exposed the loopholes in the security at the Rohini courts, and all faulty metal detectors and X-ray machines were replaced. Entry to the court has been restricted and entry points specified for visitors. When TOI visited the courts on Tuesday, it saw five policemen and five paramilitary personnel on duty at the gates through which advocates and court staff are allowed entry. Besides having to go past two metal detectors, visitors had their ID cards thoroughly checked and scanned. A police officer also had a pocket camera. Similar arrangements were in evidence at Gate No 4m through which litigants and the general public pass. Everyone has to undergo a second round of checking when entering the courts too. TOI witnessed a couple of litigants being denied entry into the court premises despite constant pleading because they did not carry their identity cards. The two variously said, “I have come from very far”; “I won’t be able to come every day”; “Please let me in just for today”; and “I have reached here, some-how managing the money for the trip”. The security personnel remained unmoved. Manjeet Mathur, secretary, Rohini Court Bar Association, said, “Lawyers, litigants and court staff have cooperated fully with the strict checking. Advocates weren’t allowed to park their cars if they didn’t have the special stickers issued by the bar association. In fact, bar association members manned the gates for half an hour in the morning to check lapses. Even police vehicles weren’t allowed to park inside.” Despite such a major boost to security, there were still some weaknesses on the court premises which is visited by 8,000-10,000 people every day. After the lunch hours, one of the scanning machines at one entrance ceased functioning and the two policemen at Gate 4 frisked litigants manually instead of using hand-held devices. And though the crowd was big since the courts have now reopened for physical hearings, there was only a single woman police officer present, at Gate 5. Mathur said that in a series of meetings since Friday, the district judge and Delhi Police have been given proposals on installing 200 more closed-circuit television cameras on the complex to cover all the blind spots. New stickers for lawyers’ cars and a database to be maintained by the bar association are also being considered. Said Mathur, “Everyone tries to park their cars inside the court premises to avoid theft of vehicle parts. We have also come across misuse of the car stickers by non-advocates. We are also trying to implement a plan to have parking slots for lawyers, court staff and police at specified areas.” He added that temporary ID cards would be issued for interns and an advocate would be allowed to take two interns under his/her guidance. The bar also proposed to have different attires for the clerks and wanted to implement a pass system for all the canteen staff and other non-advocate people working on the premises. Mathur revealed that a meeting on the security issue was held by the district judges in which the deputy commissioner of police for security (headquarters), Intelligence Bureau officials and president and secretary of the bar association were present. A security personnel confided, “Earlier, we couldn’t dare to frisk a lawyer or stop them and ask them for their IDs. Now it has changed. Everyone is cooperating.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-verdict-security-upped-chinks-remain/articleshow/86591090.cms||Usha Das
---||Hyderabad||MSP for paddy continues tobe a ticklish issue globally||Hyderabad: Even as ambiguity over paddy procurement persists despite chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao meeting Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal twice in Delhi, minimum support price (MSP) for the produce continues to be a ticklish issue. The conflict on providing MSP for paddy is not only at the state or country level but also at the global level. For the last two years, India has been fighting a complaint filed by the United States in the court of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the MSP offered to farmers in the country. Experts said that the absence of MSP could lead to a situation where the consumers would end up paying a higher price. The WTO has instructed member countries not to provide aggregate measures of support (like MSP) for crops because it will disrupt the free trade of crops and cause market anomalies. As WTO treaty countries, India and the United States are obligated to follow WTO’s guidelines. The apex international trade body said that any assistance to farmers must take the shape of a non-price discriminatory subsidy. It would imply that direct advantages (such as Rythu Bandhu) might be provided without generating a trend in produce pricing. However, if the aggregate support measures are directly related to the price of output in these countries, the WTO felt it will lead to monopoly of such crops not only in cultivation but also in the availability of other crops. According to experts, the MSP issue is a delicate problem and must be approached with caution. “India argued in the WTO court that MSP was not really meant for farmers but to give price benefits to consumers. But, how much MSP benefit is given to the farmers is very important as there are many variations,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, agriculture scientist with Centre for Sustainable Agriculture. States like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh receive lesser MSP benefits when compared to states like Punjab, he added. An agriculture expert said MSP for various crops, including paddy, could be offered in a measured manner in countries like India. However, over the years, MSP for the crops has been increasing, especially paddy, due to several factors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/msp-for-paddy-continues-tobe-a-ticklish-issue-globally/articleshow/86592255.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He also demanded the government to take necessary steps to control the use of drugs. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Ramadoss said as per data released by the national crime records bureau (NCRB), children in conflict with law has involved in many criminal activities including murders and the numbers of children involvement in crimes have been increasing every year in Tamil Nadu. This is the issue which cannot be ignored by the government and people. “In 2016, as many as 1,603 murders were reported in Tamil Nadu. Of them, children were linked with 48 murder cases. However, in the next four years, the murder cases were not increased. But more number of children were involved murder cases in the last four years. In 2020, the rate of murder cases increased to 3.61% (1661 murders). But children in conflict with law were involved in 104 murder cases (116.66%) in the last year. More number of children were involved in murder cases in Chennai, Trichy, Madurai, Tirupur, Thoothukudi and Thiruvallur districts. This is deeply a worrisome situation,” Ramadoss said. “The government should ban sales of tobacco products near colleges and schools. Parents should monitor their children. The government should increase police boys’ clubs and should conduct sports activities with the help of NGOs. This way, the children can be prevented from the choosing wrong path,” said Ramadoss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pmk-ensure-kids-arent-dragged-into-criminal-activities/articleshow/86592225.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Post Covid-19, hospitals shift focus to heart care||NAGPUR: With heart care assuming even more importance in the post Covid phase, leading private hospitals in the city have started dedicated cardiac care units in the last two weeks, and many are in the process to launch such facilities. “There has been a significant increase in heart disease in the last 10 years. Stressful lifestyle, uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure are the reasons. Alarmingly, 30 out of 100 heart attack patients today are under the age of 40 years,” said cardiologist Dr Pankaj Harkut. Heart disease has been the leading cause of death, especially in the last few decades. It has been found that 30% of hospital admissions and deaths are due to heart disease. According to World Health Organization, heart disease is on the rise in India and will reach its peak between 2025 and 2030. This data has made corporate hospitals to invest more on heart care facilities. Doctors say Covid-19 can damage heart muscles and affect its functioning, pointing that they are seeing many patients with post Covid heart issues. “There are several reasons for this. The cells in the heart have angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors where the coronavirus attaches before entering the cells. Heart damage can also be due to high levels of inflammation circulating in the body. As the body’s immune system fights off the virus, the inflammatory process can damage some healthy tissues, including the heart,” said Dr Lalit Phulkar. “Post Covid, people have become aware about their general health,” said general physician Dr Satish Kamble. “At least in cities, awareness has increased about regular check-ups, maintaining heart health and sugar levels. A dedicated heart care unit where all tests and expertise is available at one place becomes handy even for patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-hospitals-shift-focus-to-heart-care/articleshow/86592235.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Sawant met the empowered working group that was formed for the Swayampurna Goa mission, and reviewed the achievements of individual stakeholders. The chief minister said that the department, once it adopts the village, must implement government schemes in that village. He said that officials should go to the people and not the other way round. During the meeting, Sawant cited cases of how the common man is unaware about schemes of various departments. He also said that there should be proper utilisation of funds, and stressed the need for a time-bound action plan. He also said that publicity for the mission should be undertaken throughout the state, and stressed the need to organise special gram sabhas in forest areas. The chief minister asked each department to appoint a nodal officer for Swaympurna Goa due to the magnitude of work, inter-departmental links and for the smooth functioning of the project. “Collective consciousness is the main boosting force for self-reliance,” he said. It was also decided that there is a need to compile important data on Goa about geographical resources, demography, water resources, forest resources, agricultural produce, horticultural produce, animal husbandry, fisheries, the tourism industry, transportation and other economic indicators. Under Swayampurna Goa, panchayats and municipalities are supposed to get funds under the 15th Finance Commission and under the funds allocated for the 60th celebration of Goa’s Liberation. The state, through the scheme, wanted to ensure 100% coverage of water and electricity connections to the people. The government has roped in the agriculture department to increase vegetable and agricultural production so that the state does not have to depend on other states for food. Sawant had announced the Swayampurna Goa programme last October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/each-dept-should-adopt-one-village-to-fulfil-swayampurna-goa-mission-cm/articleshow/86592293.cms||---

Apart from following cluster strategy, the government is focusing on five alternative crops of green gram, groundnut, sunflower, sesame and Bengal gram. The agriculture department has issued instructions to prepare farmers on the new cropping pattern. Sources said the officials will continue communicating with farmers for some more days. The plan is to gradually reduce paddy cultivation by about 20% in the coming seasons and three zones have been identified to press ahead with alternative crops. “They will be classified into three zones based on the characteristics of the districts,” sources said. These zones have been established in 33 districts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-to-be-cut-down-by-20-govt/articleshow/86592290.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

NMC will also organise health check-up camps for senior citizens at 10 different clinics across 10 zones. Patients detected with cataract problems will be provided free-of-cost operations at Mahatme Eye Hospital, said the mayor, adding that those detected with high blood pressure and diabetes will be provided free medicines for life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/free-aapli-bus-ride-for-sr-citizens-on-oct-1/articleshow/86592288.cms||---
---||Delhi||SDMC makes submission of life certificate mandatory for pension plan||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the Lokayukta inquiry being initiated in some cases related with the disbursement of pension to people of special categories, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has made submission of ‘life certificate’ of the new applicants mandatory. It has also directed its councillors to verify all details before submitting the names as the wrong information may lead to FIR. The issue of Lokayukta inquiry was highlighted in the standing committee meeting on Tuesday after which the commissioner asked the councillors to double verify the details of the applicants. “Submission of life certificate is mandatory and even in other government departments, the procedure is followed to avoid any issue,” said SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti. Councillors have been asked to take help of licensing inspectors to cross-check the information. Life certificate is a sort of guarantee through government documents that the person is alive. A special pension scheme allows each councillor to help up to 450 needy people in six categories, including bed-ridden, transgender, divorcee, disabled and widows, in getting financial help of Rs 1,000 per month from the civic body in each ward. Before submitting the name of a beneficiary, councillors have to submit his/her information along with the life certificate. The Lokayukta has raised red flags in some cases where even dead people allegedly received the pension amount. Civic officials, however, refused to share details of such cases. Most of such cases are in West and Najafgarh zones, according to sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-makes-submission-of-life-cert-mandatory-for-pension-plan/articleshow/86592292.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Security at Delhi courts: Checks on at Saket, but paradigm shift needed||NEW DELHI: Around 12.20pm on Tuesday, people formed a short queue at Gate No 3 at Saket district courts. A policeman frisked them using a hand-held metal detector. A private security guard was also present there and manually checking bags. Three other policemen, including an armed one, sat nearby with some private security guards. Clearly, the gunfight in which gangster Jitender Gogi was shot dead in Rohini on Friday had spooked security personnel at the court and they were on the alert on Tuesday. Inside the court complex, police and security personnel manned a bag scanner and scrutinised the identity cards of lawyers. In contrast, there was no security at the entry to the lawyers chambers. On the ground floor, no one among the 50 lawyers and litigants took care to keep a distance from each other. The lawyers informed TOI about the steps taken on the security lapses. “Why wait for any incident to happen? Security should remain tight to prevent any untoward incident,” said one lawyer. Meanwhile, at the family court complex, TOI noticed two policemen and one security guard at the entrance gate, and while people passed through a metal detector, no one asked them why and where they were going. A woman police officer sat near the baggage scanner even as her male colleague was busy on his mobile phone. Some construction work was going on near the lockup block and at least six prison vehicles were parked there. According to lawyers, judicial officers and prisoner vans also enter the court complex from other gates. Lawyer Dhir Singh Kasana disclosed, “We noted some non-lawyers brandishing advocates’ parking stickers on their car windshields and gaining entry into the premises. The distribution of these stickers to common people should not be allowed.” He said that all district courts should have a common sticker system. Another lawyer pointed out that if an advocate sold his car without removing the sticker, the buyer would not remove the sticker and could use it to enter the court complex. It was important, therefore, to renew advocate stickers every year, he argued. Another lawyer, Priya Gujral, said that hearings related to high-risk prisoners could be limited to video conferencing. Others said that the unnecessary crowding by friends, family and neighbours of prisoners on the day of hearing should be stopped. “Only people who are required to be present should be allowed in through a proper mechanism such as a pass system,” suggested advocate M T Malik. Lawyer Masood A Khan added that the clerks and interns should have proper identity cards. "They have a similar dress code as the advocates and this creates confusion. That's why a proper identity card is important,” Khan explained. Vinod Sharma, president, Saket Courts Bar Association, complained about 75-80 unattended vehicles in the parking lot. “I have instructed all lawyers to have such vehicles removed from there. So far, 35 have been removed,” he said. The bar association is also thinking of entry stickers. “We are planning to introduce a smart chip system for the entry of lawyers’ vehicles,” Sharma said. He has also directed all lawyers to cooperate with police during frisking and to produce their identity cards when asked. The lawyers happily claimed that a few metal detectors were repaired and were back in working order. A Delhi Police officer said that a week before the Rohini court shootout, they had conducted a security review of the Saket courts complex. “We will upgrade our entry-exit plans and deploy gadgets and manpower. We will also conduct surprise checks,” the officer said. As per Delhi Police, more than 650 CCTV cameras had been installed on the court complex and most of them were working.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/checks-on-at-saket-but-paradigm-shift-needed/articleshow/86591094.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Allahabad||Balbeer to succeed Narendra Giri as head of Baghambari Math||Prayagraj: Honouring the will of late president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) Mahant Narendra Giri, office-bearers of Shri Panchayati Akhada Niranjani have decided to anoint his disciple Balbeer Giri as the next pithadhishvar of Baghambari Gaddi Math, a position that fell vacant following the mahant’s death. However, Balbeer Giri will have to get approval for all the major decisions pertaining to math by a five-member administrative body. The mahant, whose body was found hanging from the ceiling of a room in Baghambari Gaddi Math here on September 20, had named Balbeer Giri as his successor in his last will on June 4, 2020. Talking exclusively to TOI, general secretary of Niranjani Akhada, Mahant Ravindra Puri said, “As desired by Maharaj Ji (Narendra Giri) in his last will, we have named Balbeer Giri as his successor. He had also mentioned his decision in the suicide note and we have seen it in the video recorded by Maharaj Ji before committing suicide.” “We have decided to honour the will of Maharaj Ji and Balbeer Giri to be made the head of Bagamabari Math. The ceremony will be held at the Math on October 5,” he added. In a will made on January 7, 2010, Narendra Giri had mentioned Balbeer Giri as his successor. However, he changed his will on August 29, 2011, where he named Anand Giri as his successor. He again changed his will on June 4, 2020 (which is his will as per his lawyer Rishi Shankar Dwivedi) and mentioned the name of Balbeer Giri to succeed him as the pithadhishvar of Baghambari Gaddi.Ravindra Puri also told TOI that various senior seers of the 13 Akharas under ABAP ambit, along with respectable individuals of the society, officials of the district administration, etc., would be invited for the coronation ceremony on October 5. “The coincides with the ‘Shodashi’ ceremony of Mahant Narendra Giri, a ritual to be performed on the 16th day of the Mahant’s death. Interestingly, Balbeer Giri would not only be the head of the Baghambari Math, but also be the head mahant of the Bade Hanuman temple of Sangam. The office-bearer the Niranjani Akhara said that a five-member ‘supervisory board’ would look after the working of the Math. For all major decisions, like sale or purchase of land, the future head of the Math would have to get approval of this five-member administrative body. “This all-important body would have members from Niranjani Akhara alone and besides me (Ravindra Puri), the other members would be Mahant Dinesh Giri, Mahant Omkar Giri, Keshav Puri and Mahant Har Govind Puri,” said Ravindra Puri, adding, “We are following set practices and traditions of the Akhara to take the decisions.” He said, “The seers of the Akhara, including office-bearers, are sad over tarnishing of the Akhara’s image in some sections of the media by highlighting false information about the property of the Math and the Akhara.” “No one talks of how the Math is educating around 300 students residing in the hostel inside the Math or the gaushala of around 150 cows, without selling a drop of milk or any by-product,” he added. Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani is the parental organisation of Baghambari Gaddi Math, and since Mahant Narendra Giri was also the secretary of the Akhara (besides Ravindra Puri), the ‘Panch Parmeshwar’ — a body constituting prominent seers of the Akhara — has the responsibility to appoint the successor of a mahant or pithadhishvar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/balbeer-to-succeed-narendra-giri-as-head-of-baghambari-math/articleshow/86593034.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Don’t want to lose more lives’: Delhi HC seeks status report on courts' security||NEW DELHI: We don’t want to lose lives, Delhi High Court remarked on Tuesday while seeking the stand of police on a plea to ensure adequate security in the district courts in the national capital in the wake of the recent shootout inside a crowded Rohini courtroom. Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to Delhi Police and Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) on a petition filed by a woman advocate. It asked police to file a status report within five days and listed the matter on October 11. “You have to gear up, this is urgent, lawyers may end up as victims,” the court told standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi, representing the government. Police said it was taking steps to ensure that the security in the district courts was geared up adequately. The petitioner said she had been practising in various Delhi courts, which had become an easy terrain for gangsters to settle scores with each other and unsafe for thousands of lawyers. She sought directions to Delhi Police and BCD to consider instructing all police personnel at court entrances to ensure that they check the ID cards of every lawyer entering the premises. “In the recent past, there have been incidents of shooting in the Dwarka court, a firing near the Saket court in May 2019, and earlier in 2017, an undertrial was killed after being shot inside Rohini Court Complex,” the plea contended. “A shocking incident similar in line to the incident in the Rohini court was the killing of a Delhi Police head constable when four armed assailants open fired inside a courtroom at Karkardooma Court Complex in 2015.” The ease “with which the assailants entered into the court premises in the attire shows that they were well aware that it is easy to get access into the court by being in a lawyer’s attire,” the petitioner pointed out. Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw police firing in retaliation. A video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-want-to-lose-more-lives-hc-seeks-status-report/articleshow/86591118.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||Top cop should be made liable for violation of firecracker ban: SC||NEW DELHI: Noting that its various directions including ban on sale and manufacture of polluting firecrackers is not being implemented, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said that responsibility has to be fixed for flouting of its direction and suggested that the police commissioner should be held responsible for any violation. A bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna said that its various directions to curb pollution due to firecrackers can be enforced in true spirit only when someone is made accountable and responsibility is fixed. It suggested that the head of the police force should be liable for any violation of its order. Ahead of the festive season the court is examining the enforcement of its order by which only green crackers are allowed to be sold and manufactured in the country. It will decide the contempt petitions filed agai-nst manufacturers for violating SC’s order. The bench said its “prime focus” is the right to life of citizens and will pass an appropriate order to maintain a balance between right to employment and the right to life. Senior advocate Gopal Shankarnarayanan, appearing for the petitioners on whose plea ban order was passed by SC in 2018, told the bench that the SC’s directions that only green crackers would be allowed to be manufactured and sold in the country was being violated with impunity. He said that Calcutta HC had passed the order to make the DM e responsible for violation of order to enforce ban on crackers and pleaded the bench to pass an order on that it could be enforced across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-cop-should-be-made-liable-for-violation-of-firecracker-ban-sc/articleshow/86594119.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Nagpur||Bail can’t be denied based on antecedents only: HC||Nagpur: In the absence of prima facie strong evidence, a murder accused cannot be denied bail on the basis that he or she is already facing two similar criminal cases, said the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court. “If the material on record is not sufficient in view of the court to establish reasonable prima facie case, bail cannot be denied based on only antecedents. It would be a different matter altogether where bail is sought, but the prosecution makes out a reasonably strong prima facie case based on material, in such eventuality the antecedents of the accused may be extremely relevant,” said Justice Rohit Deo. An Akola resident Pawan Sedani was booked by Akot police for allegedly killing one Tushar Pundkar, as an act of revenge on February 21, 2020. A complaint was lodged by constable Bhaskar Sangle, who first saw both the accused and the deceased conversing with each other near his home at about 10pm and later heard a gunshot after which the deceased was seen lying on road in serious condition. On this basis, the accused was arrested under sections 302, 120, 120-B, 201, 403 read with 34 of IPC and 3/25, 5/27, 7/27 of the Arms Act and 47/177, 130(1)(2)/177, 3/181 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Through senior counsel Subodh Dharmadhikari and Kartik Shukul, Sedani applied for bail. The prosecution led by MJ Pathan opposed it citing adverse antecedents of the accused, who is facing two cases of alleged involvement in communal strife that led to deaths in 2012. In the first crime, Sedani was one of the over 100 accused and in the second case he was among 25-30 accused facing charges of unlawful assembly and causing death of people from a particular religious group. According to Pathan, Pundkar was accused of playing a role in the murder of the petitioner’s cousin and to extract revenge, Sedani orchestrated the killing with the assistance of two contract killers and other co-accused. Justice Deo granted bail to the petitioner and directed him to execute a PR bond of Rs16,000 with one solvent surety of similar amount. He was barred from entering the territorial limits of Akot till the conclusion of trial, except when called by the judge to depose. Sedani was further told not to indulge in any criminal activity directly or indirectly, make any attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with the evidence. Any breach in the conditions would lead to instant cancellation of bail, the petitioner was warned by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bail-cant-be-denied-based-on-antecedents-only-hc/articleshow/86592308.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Allahabad||A shy Balbeer Giri took diksha from his guru Mahant Narendra Giri||PRAYAGRAJ: Balbeer Giri, 35, the disciple of Mahant Narendra Giri who has been named as the new pithadhishwar of the Baghambari Gaddi Math after the mahant’s death, was one of his most beloved and had been with him for the past 15 years. A soft-spoken media-shy sanyasi, Balbeer Giri hails from Uttarakhand and had left his family in 2005 and taken sanyas. He was given diksha by Narendra Giri at Haridwar. He is presently looking after the Bilkeshwar Mahadev temple in Haridwar. Sources at the math said that Balbeer and Anand Giri became disciples of Narendra Giri almost at the same time and also got along well with each other. In due course of time, as differences surfaced between Narendra Giri and Anand Giri, Balbeer became the mahant’s most trusted disciple. When Narendra Giri expelled Anand Giri from the akhara and math in May 2021, Balbeer Giri became number two in math after the mahant. Balbeer Giri is presently the deputy mahant of Niranjani Akhara and is entrusted with the responsibility of managing Bilkeshwar Mahadev temple of Haridwar, which is owned by Niranjani Akhara. Having a clean image and a soft-spoken person, he always stayed away from the limelight. He was seen sitting next to the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath when the CM visited the Math to pay homage to the departed president of ABAP on September 21. Although Balbeer Giri spent most of his time at Bilkeshwar Mahadev temple, he attended the Maha Kumbh of 2013 and also Kumbh-2019. However, on both occasions, he refrained from interacting too much with the media. During all the ceremonies related to the last rites of Narendra Giri, Balbeer Giri was seen in the forefront, be it sitting on the vehicle carrying the mortal remains of the seer or bathing his body in the Ganga and performing the ritual of ‘bhoo samadhi’. After taking diksha from his guru Narendra Giri, he quickly went on to enjoy his proximity so much so that when Narendra Giri made his first will on January 7, 2010, he named Balbeer Giri as his successor. However, in his second will (August 29, 2011), Anand Giri replaced Balbeer Giri as the successor. The will was again changed in 2020 (June 4), and Balbeer Giri was named as successor of his guru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/a-shy-balbeer-took-diksha-from-his-guru/articleshow/86593064.cms||Rajeev Mani

The interim order by a bench led by Justice Ramesh Dhanuka came on a petition by Solapur residents Vaishnavi Bhopale and Abhishek Kapase. Their petition said they were to receive a question paper and an answer booklet with the same code and 7-digit serial number in a sealed cover. The invigilators, though, had already opened the sealed covers. The petitioners received answer booklets with a different code. Their advocate Pooja Thorat argued as a result they would secure zero marks as their answer sheets will be assessed according to the matching code on the question paper. The test centre wrote to the National Testing Agency, which conducts NEET, admitting a mistake occurred when test booklets to six students fell. The judges issued a notice to the NTA and the ministry of health and directed that till the next hearing on October 7 they will not declare results of the petitioners.

He said that out of the total target of planting 33 lakh saplings in 2021, 22 lakh saplings had already been planted.Delhi government will also organise a Wildlife Conservation Awareness Campaign at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary from October 2 to 8, the minister stated.In a meeting with the forest department, Rai said, “To curb pollution in Delhi, tree plantation drives have been great contributors. The balance which trees create in the environment is being restored by Delhi government aggressively. We started working on this pledge right from Van Mahotsav and have achieved 22 lakh of the total target already. Nineteen departments are working with us to plant saplings and we are targeting to plant the remaining saplings by March 2022.”Commenting about the green cover target completion of Delhi, Rai said, “Forest Survey of India has mentioned two categories of terrain for the purpose of green cover—first one is hilly and the second one is plains. It says that the hilly areas should have at least 60% of their land under green cover and the planes should have at least 20%. We are pleased to inform you that Delhi has crossed this 20% mark. In 2019 itself, the report by the Forest Survey of India stated that Delhi had 21.88% of its area under the green belt. In 2015, the total area of Delhi was 1,483 sqkm. Out of this, 325 sqkm green belt was developed in the city that amounted to 21.88% of the area.”As the third-party audit of planted saplings is underway, the minister said, “The primary report submitted by Forest Research of India stated that some areas have 90% success rate, some 65%, some even lower than 50%. A detailed final report will be sent in one month, according to which we will plan to increase survival rates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-7-crore-saplings-planted-in-7-years-says-rai/articleshow/86591147.cms||---

Officials said that the information will help consumers to raise complaints with the food safety department if they are not happy with the quality of food served by a FBO. The FSSAI number is available on the packed foods. The new mandate of carrying license/registration numbers on the bill will create pressure on the FBOs to get themselves registered with the food safety department if they have not registered yet. Designated officer for food safety for Coimbatore district Dr K Tamilselvan said that food safety officials will check FBOs starting from the beginning of October to see if license/registration number is printed on the bill. Legal notices would be initiated against those who have not printed the details. People can also raise the issue through WhatsApp number 94440-42322, he said. With the license/registration details available with the customers, FBOs will do their business more responsibly, he added. In the absence of license or registration details it would be difficult for the customers to raise complaints against a FBO. FBOs with annual turnover of Rs 12 lakh and more will have to get license by paying Rs 2,000 a year. FBOs with turnover less than it will have to register by paying Rs 100, officials said. Tamil Selvan said that at present there are more than 8,000 licensed FBOs and more than 23,000 registered FBOs operating in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/printing-of-licence-numbers-on-bills-must-for-fbos/articleshow/86592310.cms||---
---||Delhi||As rain takes a break, Delhi’s air quality nosedives in just 4 days||NEW DELHI: With Delhi witnessing a rain break, its air quality has deteriorated in the past 48 hours, touching the “moderate” category with an air quality index (AQI) of 120, stated Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Only four days ago, AQI was 64, in the “satisfactory” zone. AQI may spike further in the next few days, with no rain expected until October 1, forecasts show. India Meteorological Department (IMD) said local dust upliftment and pollution from localised sources might be becoming more prominent once again in the absence of rain. The CPCB data showed while most stations across Delhi had touched the “moderate” category, Ashok Vihar was the most polluted with an AQI of 247 — “poor” — in the morning. Prior to September 26, AQI was below 100, even hovering in the lower “satisfactory” range. According to IMD’s early warning system, wind speeds were ranging between 10-12km/hour with easterly winds blowing towards Delhi. It said wind speeds would remain similar on Wednesday, with the direction changing to southeast by Thursday. “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from the east of Delhi with 12-14kmph speed and generally cloudy skies on Wednesday. It is likely to be coming from the southeast with the wind speed up to 12kmph on Thursday,” stated the IMD forecast. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), another forecasting body, AQI could deteriorate further in the next few days owing to similar meteorological conditions. “Delhi’s AQI is in the ‘moderate’ category as predicted by SAFAR. This is due to dry conditions with moderate wind that allows local road dust upliftment and resuspension. Similar meteorological situation will keep AQI in the moderate category,” it said. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said gases such as CO, NO and ozone became more prominent during rain, as particulate matter settled down. “During waterlogging, vehicles release more emissions, especially during traffic snarls,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-rain-takes-a-break-citys-air-quality-nosedives-in-just-4-days/articleshow/86591131.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

He also issued fresh instructions to engineers on how potholes would be filled. “Since April, the BMC has filled more than 40,000 potholes, but continuous rain over the la-st few days and increased traffic on roads have led to their resurgence. They should be filled by the ward officials and road dep-artment in the next two to three weeks on priority,” Chahal ordered on Tuesday. Potholes reported should be filled on the same day, he added. Pointing out that of the city’s 772km of roads, 147km are project roads and 625km under the defect liability period, Chahal said: “The contractor/central agency concerned must fix potholes on these roads and at the ward level, the assistant municipal commissioners should take action. Road engineers should inspect each road in their wards and within a day submit information on the number of potholes and quantity of cold mix required to fill them. The material should be supplied within two days. The engineers should be relieved of all other duties so that they focus on road maintenance for the next one month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fill-potholes-within-3-wks-bmc-chief-orders-his-men/articleshow/86592320.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||DPCC notifies blanket ban on crackers in Delhi till January 1||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Tuesday notified the ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the capital till January 1, 2022. It has asked district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to strictly implement the ban and submit daily action taken reports. DPCC said it was a ‘complete’ ban, including even green firecrackers that had been allowed in the past. The decision was taken keeping in view the need in public interest to curb high air pollution in Delhi as well as to prevent another possible surge in Covid-19 cases, it stated. “Several experts have indicated the possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and large scale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will not only result in agglomeration of people in violation of social distancing norms but also in high levels of air pollution, leading to serious health issues in Delhi...” the notification said, adding that bursting of firecrackers would also release metals, toxins, harmful chemicals and gases into the air. “These form one of the main sources of pollution. The air quality in the severe category may cause respiratory effects even on healthy people and may severely impact people with lung or heart diseases,” it added. Last year too, the NGT had banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in NCR. CM rvind Kejriwal had announced the ban on September 15, appealing to traders to not stock up on firecrackers this year. He had tweeted, “In view of the dangerous condition of pollution in Delhi during the Diwali period for the past three years, like last year, a complete ban is being imposed on the storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers. So that people’s lives can be saved.” Meanwhile, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board also directed all 14 NCR districts in the state to impose a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers with immediate effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dpcc-notifies-blanket-ban-on-crackers-in-delhi-till-jan-1/articleshow/86591138.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Burglary of 170 phones solved with single clue||Mumbai: An autorickshaw with a peculiar rear light and curtains was the only clue the Dindoshi police had when a break-in was reported at a mobile phone store recently. Burglars had made off with 170 phones besides the digital video recorder of the electronic surveillance system and cameras, collectively worth Rs 33 lakh.“We have arrested four accused and recovered all stolen phones as well as the tools used in the break-in,” said DCP DS Swami. The break-in at the mobile store in Gokuldham, Goregaon East, was reported on September 22. The investigators later learnt that the burglars lived only a few kilometres away, in Malad East, and had done a recce of the store. They chose to target the store as it did not have a central locking system. They broke open the shutter at night and gained access to the store. As cameras inside were deactivated, police looked through footage from cameras on the street and other establishments. They found that the getaway vehicle was an auto with a partially visible number plate. After checking different combinations of registration numbers in RTO records, and physically examining autos, they found the vehicle. One of the accused, Mayur Khaire, an auto driver, had borrowed the auto from its owner on the pretext of taking his mother to hospital. “After committing the crime, the accused steered the vehicle into the Sanjay Gandhi National Park where they divided the loot among themselves. All the handsets were passed to Tejas Ambekar, a Kamathipura-based buyer,” said investigating officer Chandrakant Gharge. Ambekar has also been arrested. The whereabouts of the other gang members led the cops to a red light area in Pune where they arrested Meghwal, a carpenter. Police said Meghwal masterminded the break-in along with Khaire. Another Malad (E) resident, Ramesh Porwal, joined them. On the day of the offence, Porwal led a group on his bike while the rest travelled in the auto. “Most of the accused have a past criminal record,” said Swami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-burglary-of-170-phones-solved-with-single-clue/articleshow/86593083.cms||---

Named Fastminar, the 40-feet sculpture of a tooth that has been made using nearly 80,000 toothbrushes has been certified by Guinness World Records as the largest toothbrush sculpture of a body part in the world (supported), Dr Reddy’s said. The record busting feat saw participation from 8,890 dentists across the country who contributed toothbrushes for the construction of Fastminar as part of an attempt to draw attention to the topic of dentine and tooth sensitivity, treatment options, maximising outreach and encouraging timely action to bring India relief from sensitivity. The sculpture was created by the Hyderabad-based pharma major’s team that handles its medicated oral gel offering. The sculpture has been put up at the Terna Dental College in Navi Mumbai where it will remain on display for 365 days. Dr Reddy’s said the materials used will be dismantled, pulverised and re-used in construction activity after the display ends. MV Ramana, CEO-branded markets (India & emerging markets), Dr Reddy’s Labs, said, “Minars take years to be built.

---||Goa||Mining corp formed, rules being framed||Panaji: The state government has formed the Goa Mining Corporation and has started framing rules for the restart of the industry in the state. The chief minister is chairman of the corporation, with MLAs representing mining belt constituencies as its members. A senior state official said that once the rules are finalised, the corporation’s actual work will start. He said that the corporation has been notified, adding that the state would soon take a decision either to auction the mining leases through the corporation, or to have the corporation itself run the leases by engaging contractors. The Act that paved the way for the corporation’s formation was passed during the assembly session that ended a couple of months ago. Earlier in September, the governor granted his assent to the bill, making it an Act and setting the stage for the corporation. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. On September 7, the apex court dismissed an appeal filed by mining companies to allow them to operate mining leases till 2037. In July this year, the SC had dismissed the review petition filed by the state government seeking to renew the operations of the 88 mining leases cancelled in 2018 on the grounds of delay in filing the petition for more than 20 months, and said that the plea had no merits. The mining concessions in the state were granted under the decree of 1906. On December 19, 1961, Goa, Daman and Diu were liberated from Portuguese rule and Goa became a part of India. However, the concessions were deemed to have expired on December 12, 1961, which was the appointed date as per the Abolition Act, 1987, from which date the concessions were treated as deemed leases under MMDR Act. The state government has provided documents of 77 mining leases to the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) for identifying the quantity of iron ore lying in these mines before they are auctioned. The MECL will check the documents of the leases which are spread across the state. “Once the MECL verifies the records, its officials will shortlist the mining leases and visit the sites next month for exploration and identifying the quantity of iron ore available at each lease,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-corp-formed-rules-being-framed/articleshow/86592374.cms||---
---||Delhi||New Parliament building to have Mirzapur carpets, Nagpur teakwood||NEW DELHI: Cushioned handwoven carpets of Mirzapur, teakwood furniture of Nagpur and Mumbai and wooden floors of Agartala bamboo will welcome MPs when they enter the new Parliament building during the winter session of 2022. Similarly materials from across the country have been used like Kesharia greenstone of Udaipur, white marble of Ambaji, red marble of Lakha in Ajmer, and sandstone of Sirmathura in the “first Indian Parliament built by the people, of the people and for the people of the country.” “The new Parliament is an intrinsic part of the vision for Azadi@75 and symbolises our commitment and efforts towards building self reliant India. It has been designed and is being built by Indians using Indian materials,” secretary housing and urban development Durga Shanker Mishra told reporters at the construction site, a couple of days after PM Modi’s surprise late evening visit to the site. He said the PM has reviewed the status of construction activities at the site multiple times and his noteworthy inputs have been instrumental towards enhancement of functionality of the new building. With an architectural strategy to harmonise the two buildings such that they work in conjunction, the new Parliament building’s architecture and aesthetics will reference the present Parliament building, other buildings of the Central Vista, and the classical, folk and tribal arts and crafts of India. The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha interiors will have reference to the national bird (Peacock) and national flower (Lotus) respectively. While the courtyard will have national tree (Banyan), national emblem will crown the new Parliament building. Mishra said that with a construction timeline of 21 months, it is planned that the new Parliament building will house the winter session of Parliament in its 75th anniversary of Independence in 2022. It will cater to the future demands of ‘New India’, while preserving the iconic heritage of the Central Vista, Mishra said. In the new Parliament building, the Lok Sabha capacity will be up to 876 seats, Rajya Sabha 400 seats and joint session (in the Lok Sabha Hall) — up to 1,224 seats which will be sufficient to accommodate an expanded Parliament, post reconstitution in 2026.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-parl-to-have-mirzapur-carpets-nagpur-teakwood/articleshow/86591159.cms||Akhilesh Kumar Singh
---||Coimbatore||Garden of herbal plants helps man come out of his grief||Coimbatore: O Saravanan, a sanitary supervisor working with the Coimbatore corporation, lost his wife to Covid-19 in May. He could not come out of his grief even after a month and struggled to do his day-to-day activities, including his work. His friend advised him to concentrate on things he likes the most. Saravanan did so by planting herbal plants at his office in ward 71. Seeing this, sanitary workers helped him with gardening and number of plants in the garden increased. Susequently, Saravanan put up a fence and set up a green garden shade to protect the plants. Now, the garden has 30 varieties of herbal plants procured from different places. Saravanan has taken upon himself to create awareness on making best use of space around houses and terrace for gardens. Apart from visitors, passersby and morning walkers inquire about the garden and Saravanan patiently drives home the message to each one of them. He uses his free time to tend the plants and some sanitary workers volunteer to help him with some work. “I brought some of the plants from roadsides in and around the city. I have purchased some rare ones from the forest office. There are plenty of medicinal plants available around us, but we fail to notice them,” Saravanan said. While some plants can be used by diabetic patients, some can be used for treating knee pain. There are plants available to treat poisonous bites. These are treasures identified by forefathers and it is our duty to educate the next generation about their importances, he said. Saravanan is also converting the household waste into manure using a plastic container on the same campus. He is utilizing the manure in the garden. “I also talk about waste segregation. The segregated waste can be used to produce organic manure. People should follow this method at their houses to deal with the waste themselves. This way people can reduce the burden on the civic body,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garden-of-herbal-plants-helps-man-come-out-of-his-grief/articleshow/86592351.cms||V Devanathan

When the boy was using the phone, it accidentally fell down and its screen got damaged,” a police officer said. An agriculture labourer, Vijaya returned home after attending work and found the boy missing and the damaged phone was found in the house. On Monday, the boy’s slippers were found near a well but the police and locals could not find anything since the well was full of water due to heavy rains. Swimmers were also pressed in but they too failed, before the boy’s body was found floating in the well.

After a meeting to take stock of the Covid-19 situation, Stalin said that keeping in mind the upcoming festival season and a possible spike in Covid-19 infections, the state government has decided to extend the Covid-19 lockdown across the state till October 31. “Medical experts, parents, and educationists say students are losing out on learning and are stressed due to the prolonged closure of schools. Hence, all schools are allowed to conduct physical classes for Classes I to VIII from November 1 following Covid-19 safety protocols,” the CM said. He also asked the school education department to make necessary arrangements for the reopening. The government had already allowed physical classes for IX to XII from September 1. While the ban on social, political and cultural events and festivals and consecration ceremonies will continue and places of worship will remain closed from Friday to Sunday, the state has allowed weekly public grievances meeting and monthly grievances meeting for farmers at collectorates.

Following complaints from villagers, a team of health department officials led by Sullia taluk health officer Dr B Nandakumar visited the spot and collected water samples. The lab analysis conducted at the government hospital in Sullia, suggested that the water from the borewell was not fit for human consumption. In fact, in nearly 120 houses in Bettampady, one of the wards of Sullia town panchayat, were using the water from the borewell, which was sunk a few years ago. Sullia town panchayat president Vinayakumar Kandadka told TOI the water samples have been sent for detailed analysis to the College of Fisheries in Mangaluru, to ascertain the reason for the water to smell of kerosene. “Water from the borewell was pumped to a tank located in the nearby area, and it was later supplied to houses. To facilitate minor repair works in the tank, we diverted the water supply directly to the pipeline network four weeks ago. Thereafter, people started complaining of the foul smell, and that they are not able to drink the water. Following this, we immediately brought this to the notice of the health department,” Vinayakumar said. Since the health department has suggested not to use water from the borewell, the town panchayat has made alternative arrangements using the nearby open wells, he said. “I have tasted the water from the borewell and it smelt like kerosene. We are now waiting for the lab analysis, which is expected to arrive within two days. Meanwhile, we have also made arrangements to flush out the water from the borewell. An agency has been assigned to flush out water continuously from the borewell, and we will see how it works after a day or two. People in the village say that there is no possibility of pollution of groundwater ,as there are no chemical factories or storage facilities in the nearby villages. Further, we have not witnessed any oil pilferage issues in the village,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/samples-of-borewell-water-smelling-of-kerosene-sent-for-analysis/articleshow/86590235.cms||---

Senior level officers, every Saturday, visit the gram panchayat to create awareness on government schemes and avail of the same to needy persons. Swayampurna Mitra can be the linked officer between the government department, banks and beneficiaries,” said Sawant.  He urged each branch to connect with the local Swayampurna Mitra so that together they can give more benefits to the people of Goa. “Under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Swayampurna Goa mission we are doing various programmes.

---||Chennai||Special law soon on organised crime in Tamil Nadu, state tells Madras HC||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu will soon have a special law to control organised crime, similar to the ones in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Nudged repeatedly by the Madras high court, the state government told the court that it had decided to table a law, Tamil Nadu Control of Organised Crime Act, in the next assembly session to control organised crimes. The law will be on the lines of (MCOCA) Maharashtra Control of Organized Crimes Act, 1999, and (KCOCA) Karnataka Control of Organized Crimes Act, 2000. ‘No law & order issues if gangs under control’A division bench headed by Justice N Kirubakaran (who retired on August 19, 2021) recorded the submission and welcomed it. “This court feels happy and appreciates the state government for having made ready the draft bill to be presented before the assembly. If such an act is passed, the police will be able to deal with the criminals effectively,” the bench said. Through multiple orders spanning more than three years, the bench kept saying such a special law would enable the state police to deal with and control organized criminals/paid killers effectively. On November 30, 2018, the court while hearing a habeas corpus petition related to the preventive detention of a person involved in a clash between rowdy gangs wondered why Tamil Nadu should not come up with an exclusive legislation to tackle organised crimes. “The case on hand would demonstrate as to how rowdy gangs/paid killers are active in Tamil Nadu, jeopardizing law and order and creating panic in the minds of the common man in Tamil Nadu as well as in the other parts of our country,” the court had said. It further added that the clash between two rowdy gangs have resulted in many killings and also affecting the tranquillity of the State. Only if these gangs and paid killers are brought under control, there will not be any law and order problem. Not sparing political patronage such gangsters enjoyed, the bench went to the extent of remarking: “In Tamil Nadu also, goondas have got proximity with police, political leaders and communal leaders. In fact, almost all the political parties have them as office-bearers and a few of the MLAs and MPs are with criminal background. The happenings in Tamil Nadu, for the past 25 years, would fortify the impression of this court that more rowdy gangs are active and anti-social elements are already very vocal in the State. This is proved by the fact that more number of cases are being registered in Tamil Nadu by the National Investigation Agency and more number of terror activities are carried out in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu tops the list of states where anti-terrorism agencies have unearthed modules of Salafi Jihadi Terrorist Organisation Islamic state (IS).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/spl-law-soon-on-organised-crime-in-tn-state-tells-hc/articleshow/86592395.cms||Sureshkumar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic bodies prepare to pre-empt last week’s EM Bypass-New Town-Salt Lake repeat||KOLKATA: The city received intermittent drizzles till late on Tuesday evening as the “well-marked low-pressure” — that is set to hit Gangetic Bengal and the city, triggering heavy rain — moved slowly over north Bay of Bengal. It started to rain in the evening and the wind speed increased in Kolkata after 7.30pm. At 8.25pm, the maximum speed of the gusty wind reached 50km/hour at the Alipore Met office. The system was predicted to hit between midnight and early Wednesday morning, leading to widespread showers across south Bengal districts, including Kolkata. The city could receive at least one consistent, heavy spell, said weathermen. The system, which had been a cyclonic circulation till Monday night, intensified into a well-marked low pressure area on Tuesday. “It should strike Kolkata by Wednesday morning. The system has been moving slowly but as the wind pattern changes at night, it could gain speed late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday and move faster into Gangetic Bengal. We expect a heavy downpour in Kolkata and consistent rain across Howrah, Hoogly, south and north 24 Parganas, east and west Midnapore and Burdwan,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das.  An overcast city sky on TuesdayKMC geared up with a series of measures to counter the impact of a possible deluge. It has kept portable pumps ready to drain out water from low-lying areas off EM Bypass, Behala (parts), Joka, Garden Reach and parts of the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt. These areas don’t have adequate drainage infrastructure. A building demolition team has been kept ready at the civic headquarters to attend to emergencies while an electrical department team in each borough will swing into action to prevent electrocution in flooded streets.  A joint team of civic personnel and Kolkata police has been prepared to evacuate people from submerged areas that might be flooded after the rain. New Town Development Authority (NKDA) and the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation have opened control rooms to help residents, apprehending a deluge. Sandbags have been placed along Bagjola and its peripheral canals to check overflow of water. Drainage lines have been cleaned, gully pits checked and pumps have been kept ready to drain out water. While 120 pumps are ready to function in Salt Lake, New Town will have 100. Kolkata could be hit by squally wind reaching 30-40 km/hr, gusting to 60 km/hr once the system strikes. The wind could prevail across all south Bengal districts, said the RMC. While Kolkata, Howrah, Hoogly, North 24 Parganas and Jhargram could receive heavy rain (70mm-110mm) on Wednesday, one or two places in east and west Midnapore and South 24 Parganas could receive very heavy showers (70mm-200 mm). “Once the low-pressure reaches Gangetic Bengal, the rain could intensify,” added Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-bodies-prepare-to-pre-empt-last-weeks-em-bypass-new-town-salt-lake-repeat/articleshow/86591219.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

DRI sleuths intercepted a truck loaded with the illegal consignment which was being taken from Andhra Pradesh to the National Capital Region. The operation was conducted on Monday evening after extensive coordination between Lucknow and Varanasi units of DRI following an anonymous tipoff. DRI officials said 972kg of cannabis worth Rs 1.45 crore was seized. The contraband was hidden in a secret cavity in the rear of the truck driver’s seat. “The truck was registered with the West Bengal regional transport office while the accused hail from Bihar. The contraband was dispatched from Sabbavaram, a town well known for being the educational hub of Visakhapatnam district,” said DRI source. He added, “To curb cannabis menace, multiple raids were also being conducted by Andhra Pradesh law and enforcement agencies in their state. There is huge demand for contrabands like cannabis and heroin in NCR and it’s the easiest way to mint cash. Agencies are working to trace where all the cash is being pumped and who all are involved in it. The southern coast state has been a hub for export of cannabis to north India.” Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh CM office has taken cognizance of the DRI Lucknow operation following a tweet by a TOI reporter.

The tiger killed V Chandran, 56, a worker from Devan-I estate in Devarshola area in the Gudalur division, on September 24. A day after the incident, the forest department installed five cages and 15 camera traps in the tea estate to locate and tranquilize it. The tiger has been prowling in the area and killed three cows in the past three days. On Tuesday, the big cat was spotted in the Mayfield estate, two kilometres away from the Devan-I estate. “Though the tiger was sighted at Mayfield estate on Tuesday morning, due to heavy rain, the tiger could not be captured. Again it was sighted in a nearby area in the afternoon, but it was hiding inside thick bushes,” said Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden. As many as 70 forest staff and officials are engaged in the operation. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, an expert team from Wayanad forest division in Kerala joined the operation to catch the prowling tiger. The Kerala forest team comprising 10 officials is headed by Narendra Babu. “The Kerala team is highly trained. The team members have experience in capturing at least seven tigers so far,” said Niraj. According to Niraj, the Kerala forest department has provided a highly standardized cage for the operation. “We never had such cages. We can have better adaptation of their expertise after this operation.” A team of special task force (STF) personnel, which was supposed to join the operation on Tuesday, failed to do so. “We will request the team to join the operation soon,” said Niraj. The operation will continue on Wednesday. It is also believed that the same tiger killed V Kunjikrishnan, 49, a resident of Muduguli village (located in the core area of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve), which is under the relocation process, on July 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/kerala-team-joins-forest-dept-bid-to-trap-tiger-in-gudalur/articleshow/86592416.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan
---||Kolkata||Warm, shallow water makes Bay of Bengal prone to cyclones: Report||KOLKATA: Bay of Bengal has seen nearly five times the number of tropical cyclones than Arabian Sea in the post-monsoon period (September to December), revealed a long-term analysis of cyclones that struck the coasts of India between 1891 and 2018. The analysis was carried out under an ‘Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region’ project and has been included in a report released by the ministry of earth sciences recently. Higher frequency of cyclones in the Bay can be attributed to frequent low pressures created by warm water of the ocean, said the analysis. The Bay is concave or shallow where strong winds push water up, helping in the formation of storm systems. The Bay of Bengal is shaped like a trough that makes it more conducive for storms to gain force. Moreover, the high sea surface temperature makes matters worse, triggering more intense storms, said Ramesh K Vellore of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM-MoES), Pune, and the coordinating lead author of the report. In the last four years, 12 cyclones have formed in the Bay and ravaged the eastern coastal states. Out of every five cyclones that the Indian coastline has witnessed on an average a year in the decade ending 2018, four originated in the Bay and only one in Arabian Sea. Additionally, the Bay gets more rainfall with sluggish winds and warm air currents around it that keep temperatures relatively high all year. The constant inflow of fresh warm water from perennial rivers like Brahmaputra and the Ganges makes it further impossible to mix with the cooler water below. Lack of landmass between the Pacific Ocean and the Bay causes cyclonic winds to move into the coastal areas causing heavy rainfall. The absence of air movements from north-western India towards the Bay in the post-monsoon phase is also another reason for the chances of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. The threshold value for sea surface temperatures for the formation of cyclones is 28°C, but it is 30°C-32°C over the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. The sea surface temperature of the Bay is higher than Arabian Sea. Based on long-period records, more than 60% of Bay cyclones make landfall in various parts of the Indian east coast, 30% experience recurvature and landfall over Bangladesh and Myanmar while 10% dissipate over the oceanic regions. On the other hand, Arabian Sea is calmer as stronger winds help dissipate the heat and lack of constant fresh water helps the warm water to mix with the cool water underneath, reducing the surface temperature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/warm-shallow-water-makes-bay-prone-to-cyclones-report/articleshow/86591246.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In a letter to KRMB on Monday evening, Telangana irrigation department said the AP government had issued a GO permitting a company for construction of Pinnapuram pumped storage hydro-electricity project. The project is based on drawl of Krishna water and as per the AP Reorganisation Act, any such project could be initiated only with the prior approval of the Apex Council. The government said earlier a letter was sent to the Board to prevent AP from taking up any further action on the project, including calling and awarding tenders. However, no correspondence was received so far on the issue. “From a deficit basin i.e., Krishna, diverting water to outside the basin and utilising for hydro power generation is highly objectionable while areas are starving for water,” the Telangana government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stall-new-projects-of-ap-t-to-krmb/articleshow/86592435.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||False ceiling chunk falls off at Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: A 3ft false ceiling chunk made of light-weight gypsum board and an accompanying aluminium cladding beside the entrance to a toilet in the departure terminal of the Kolkata airport came crashing down at 10am on Tuesday, leaving an airline crew startled and another passenger thanking his lucky stars that it did not fall on him and cause an injury. Sources said the terminal false ceiling that is now eight-year old needs to be thoroughly checked and emergency repairs and replacement carried out to prevent a mishap. “As a facility like an airport terminal ages, maintenance will go up. Sections will have to be inspected more frequently and corrective measures taken to ensure both safety and aesthetics. An airport is the first point of contact for anyone who comes to the city and if he or she sees it in a poor condition, it leaves a bad impression,” said a corporate executive who frequently uses the airport and has been noticing the problem area,s including poor maintenance of toilets. Airport authorities said incidents like that happen at times inside the terminal because of possible movement of rodents. However, no such rodent could be spotted on Tuesday. “A very small piece of lightweight material used in false ceiling had fell off near a washroom. But thankfully it didn’t fall on anyone. It was also too light weight to even cause an injury to anyone. But after the incident, we have alerted the agency concerned to run a check on all the ceiling panels and ensure such an incident does not happen again,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director. Cleanliness and maintenance of the toilets and the area surrounding it has come under question on several occasions by flyers who have often raised the issue on social media platforms as well. Aftab A Khan, a Twitter user, wrote on September 19 tagging Airports Authority of India: “Chennai and Kolkata airport toilets are in worse condition. If you can renovate the airport, then do not forget even the rest room is part of the property.” Airport authorities blamed a section of passengers — many of them first-time flyers from economically backward section of the society who wash their feet and drop water in the washroom very often. Flooded by the complaints, airport authorities had deputed dedicated housekeeping personnel at every washroom in the terminal who would periodically wash the floors and clean the washrooms after short intervals and whose presence also deterred a section of flyers to soil the washrooms. But the frequency of cleaning has diminished, claimed frequent flyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/false-ceiling-chunk-falls-off-at-city-airport/articleshow/86591258.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Stray dog vaccination will be done at border talukas — Pernem, Sattari, Bicholim and Canacona,” said Dr Marwin Lopes, nodal officer for rabies control. “We lost many lives when we did not have vaccine for Covid-19 but in the case of Rabies, we are still losing 20,000 lives every year in India even 130 years after the rabies vaccine was developed, which is a shame,” said Dr Murugan, director of education, Mission Rabies. “Goa has been a pioneer in rabies-control and has shown the world that it is possible to control the virus,” he added. An awareness campaign was also flagged off with four mobile awareness vehicles with messages and pictures with public announcement system to go to each and every village in Goa during the static point free vaccination until October 26. World Rabies Day is celebrated as day of rabies awareness and the death anniversary day of scientist Louis Pasteur who developed the rabies vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/static-point-rabies-vaccination-drive-from-monday/articleshow/86592448.cms||---

Meanwhile, a special court on Monday remanded two arrested accused in ATS custody till October 4. “During the probe, we collected some ground level information based on which we summoned around 10 youths from various cities. Their questioning is on. Many of them were already on intelligence agencies’ radar,” said an ATS source. Investigators have also issued a lookout circular at airports against one of the youths suspected to be in touch with a foreign handler. The youth is currently being questioned in Mumbai but hasn’t been arrested yet. Last week, ATS had arrested Zakir Shaikh from Jogeshwari and Rizwan Momin from Mumbra. Shaikh, a class IX dropout, is a taxi driver, while Rizwan is a tuition teacher. On September 17, the ATS had registered an FIR against Shaikh and his alleged foreign handler Anthony alias Anas alias Anwar alias Annu, under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for criminal conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. Police said Anthony contacted the two accused using a Malaysian SIM card. Police said they will now collect voice samples of Shaikh and Momin and send them to Kalina forensic science laboratory for analysis. The duo was sent to judicial custody within two days of their arrest last week. An ATS source on Tuesday said they wanted to collect more information about the group before seeking police custody. The accused in custody and those being quizzed may be brought face to face to verify information. “Shaikh was in touch with several persons in different cities. We are questioning these people about their relationship with him and interactions,” said a source. While scanning Shaikh and Momin’s bank accounts, ATS claimed they found large amount of credits in Momin’s accounts. “We are trying to establish who deposited the money in his accounts. So far, the terror-training angle on a foreign soil has not come to light.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ats-summons-10-in-touch-with-terror-conspiracy-case-accused/articleshow/86593149.cms||Mateen Hafeez

NTFN chairperson Samaresh Das said that a committee comprising residents from the three action areas of New Town will be formed to keep in touch with the MLA and review progress of the plans. “Next, we are planning to meet the chairman of Hidco (minister Firhad Hakim) to discuss this issue,” he said. “We have come to understand while talking to officials of NKDA, irrigation department and PHE that the overflowing Bagjola and other periphery canals caused the waterlogging. A complete overhaul of these canals and removal of silt along side regular maintenance is required,” Das said. Residents suggested if a dedicated canal could be cut out for New Town and Salt Lake to flush out the storm water. There should also be place to install and operate the temporary pumps. “Regular maintenance is required to prevent accumulation of plastic. About 2,000 kg of waste and silt has been scooped out from Bagjola and the periphery canals,” residents said, adding that the encroachments on canal banks and dumping of waste have resulted in silt deposition and chocked drains. “The authorities can also consider setting up a dedicated plastic waste recycling plant,” residents added. “We should take lessons from what has happened this time to improve the smart city infrastructure,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, resident of Elita Garden Vista. MLA Tapas Chatterjee said he will go through all suggestions, talk to stakeholders and hold a review meeting again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-forum-suggests-ways-to-stop-new-town-flooding/articleshow/86591278.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The CWMA gave the direction at its 14th sitting held in Delhi on Monday, after the Tamil Nadu government complained that the Karnataka government did not release the due share of water as per the order of the Supreme Court. The Tamil Nadu government also pointed out that the Karnataka government released 85.8 tmc of water instead of 119.5 tmc till September 26.Expressing its displeasure over Karnataka ignoring the previous order of the CWMA to release the due share of water to Tamil Nadu, a delegation led by the secretary of public works department (PWD) Sandeep Saxena insisted on releasing the remaining quantity of water to save the cultivated crops in the delta districts.Responding to the demand, the CWMA ordered the Karnataka government to release the Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu as per the orders of the Supreme Court and the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal. The authority also scheduled the issue to be discussed in the 15th meeting of CWMA to be held on October 7.Chairman of CWMA, S K Haldar told reporters that it has been ordered to release the water to Tamil Nadu instantly. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government also raised strong objections at the proposed construction of the dam across Cauvery river at Mekedatu in Karnataka, at the meeting. However, citing that interlinking of Cauvery - Vaigai - Gundar and Mekedatu are sub-judice, the Tamil Nadu government opposed to discuss them in the meeting despite the subjects being listed in the minutes of meeting.Haldar also said that since the Mekedatu dam was objected by Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, the subject was not taken up for discussion during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karnataka-directed-to-release-cauvery-water-for-tn-immediately/articleshow/86586648.cms||---

With slogans and candles in their hands, while others hoisting the national flag, several people took part in the ‘Shaheed Smriti March’ organised by the Shaheed Smriti Ayojan Samiti in his memory. The road from Parivartan Chowk till Shaheed Smarak resonated with songs and chanting of slogans by the people. ‘E Bhagat Tu Zinda Hai. Har Ek Lahu Ke Katre Me. Inquilab Ke Naro Me’, was chanted by many who took part in the march. With patriotic songs devoted to the Indian freedom fighter, poems penned by him and his ideas and thoughts aimed at spreading the revolutionary message, people from all walks of life, the young and the old, joined in to discuss the ideology of the revolutionary. Some even remembered excerpts from the letters exchanged by Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. “He and the others were so young when they came forward willingly and sacrificed their lives, without any hesitation or fear. His ideas stand true even after so many years and people should be aware of them. They envisaged a better country, but we are not even close to what they dreamt of,” said Pooja, a participant at the walk. “The best way we can remember him and pay tributes to him is by fighting and standing against communalism, hatred and economic disparity in our society,” said Shreya Rawat, another local. “This is the begining of one of the many programmes that we will continue to line up till March 23, his 90th death anniversary,” said activist Deepak Kabir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/slogans-and-songs-reverberate-on-birth-anniv-of-bhagat-singh/articleshow/86593154.cms||---

Attaching photos of overflowing gutters in front of residential houses, Parshuram Sonurlekar, representing Goa First, said people are forced to live in unhygienic conditions. He said since the complaint has been directly registered in Delhi, the authorities will direct the officials here to take action. “The houses lack a sewage system. Also, construction debris of highway and flyover work finds a way here. Water used for domestic purposes is kept open. Residents are exposed to infectious diseases,” Sonurlekar said. The area, where mostly migrants reside, is full of filth as waste is dumped in the open. “So many activities are carried out by civic bodies as part of Swachh Bharat but here you see the contrast,” he said, adding, “Though Mormugao Municipal Council conducted cleanliness drives, slum areas have been left out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/complaint-filed-against-unhygienic-conditions-of-slum-area-at-baina/articleshow/86592469.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Push for incentive to save Kolkata’s built heritage||KOLKATA: Alapan Bandyopadhyay, the chief advisor to the chief minister, and Heritage Commission chairman Suvaprasanna, on Tuesday argued for heritage-TDR (transfer of development rights) to save city’s built heritage. TDR will enable the heritage property owner to monetise value of the building without demolishing it for real estate development. Bandyopadhyay, who was speaking at a symposium on conservation of the city’s built heritage at Merchants’ Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MCCI), said, “If the draft heritage-TDR can be formulated consensually among all stakeholders, including property owner, developers, heritage activists, architects, town planner, historians and legal experts, the government can process legislation of the draft after vetting it.” Suvaprasanna sought greater public awareness to convince the heritage property owners to accept TDR. He highlighted the challenges with TDR, while underlining its significance. Earlier, Heritage Commission member and conservation architect Partha Ranjan Das explained, “Once it becomes a law, the civic body will issue the heritage property owner TDR right in the form of extra FAR (floor area ratio), calculated on the basis of floor area the heritage property owner could get by demolishing and redeveloping it.” Land owners of heritage properties will be allowed to sell their unutilized FAR to others at a mutually acceptable rate with prior permission from local urban, municipal or panchayat authority. The FAR purchased by the developer can be utilised for extra floors in his new constructions. “This has been an accepted norm internationally to incentivise the heritage property owner, who does not need to sell his property,” said Munish Jhajharia, chairman, Council on Infrastructure & Real Estate, MCCI. Mukul Agarwal, founder trustee, Calcutta Heritage Collective hoped to bring forth a collaborative effort of all stakeholders-owners, developers, planners and the government to ensure that the TDR draft can be brought to fruition. “It is not a difficult task to identify and list the built heritage of roughly 1,500 years since the Pala age. The gradation is important to ascertain the historical, architectural, social significance and value of the property which can be monetised by the property owner,” said Bandyopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/push-for-incentive-to-save-kolkatas-built-heritage/articleshow/86591285.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

On getting information about the two, the police tracked them and rounded them up near Manalmedu on Sunday morning. Police also seized weapons including a machete. On interrogation, the two spilled the beans in their plot to murder Murugan.“The two were conspiring to take revenge for the murder of Murugan before the first death anniversary. The arrest of the two prevented a murder,” Karthikeyan told TOI on Monday.Murugan had been hacked to death by a nine-member gang including two women from the same area on October 26, 2020. His wife M Pushpavalli, 43, was also severely wounded in the attack by the gang. The murder was a fallout of previous enmity between Murugan’s family and his neighbour Parameswarai over trivial issues. The gang surrounded Murugan and Pushpavalli near their house and launched an indiscriminate attack. Murugan died while Pushpavalli survived.The operation had commenced after two revenge murders two weeks back led to the arrest of more than 105 such elements in the city so far. Commissioner Karthikeyan said that though several elements were arrested to prevent them from committing crimes, the Sunday’s arrest was made when another murder for revenge was being planned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/police-stop-revenge-murder-in-planning-stage/articleshow/86586655.cms||---

A speed breaker on Karur Bypass Road, which did not follow the standards of Indian Road Congress (IRC), has been removed by the local body.As per the IRC standards, speed breakers should have a rounded bump of 0.10m in height and 3.7m in width in order to limit the crossing speed of vehicles below 25km/hour. Among the 495 speed breakers officially enumerated in the city, more than 90% of them are not following the IRC norms. The speed breakers did not have the mandatory white stripes too. “We will reduce the height and width of the speed breaker on Karur Bypass Road near Malar Road. Other speed breakers on the same road are not abnormal in size,” a corporation official said.Road safety activists welcomed the move, but they questioned the waste of resources. “Contractors must be educated to lay the speed breaker as per the IRC norms.” P Aiyarappan, president of the Road Users’ Welfare Organisation, said. As Ponmalai zone has several faulty speed breakers, road safety activists urged officials to conduct a safety audit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-starts-resizing-unsafe-speed-breakers-in-city/articleshow/86586658.cms||---

The streams flowing amidst hundreds of trees and rocks but do not have pathways to go upstream for a leisurely dip. Even the signboards for guiding tourists are inadequate, nor are there changing rooms and sanitary complexes. Locals said that a proper road can be developed between Puliyancholai to Arapuleeswarar temple to help the visitors access the Aagaya Gangai falls in the Kolli hills. The connectivity is touted to help remote villagers earn through tourism. “The new 6km road will interconnect unexplored attractions. Improving roads will enable TNSTC to operate more buses from Trichy and Thuraiyur,” Puthanampatti N Saravanan, a social worker from Thuraiyur said.Similarly, the only hill station in the central region, Pachamalai hills situated about 40km from Puliyancholai awaits an opportunity to serve people looking for a break with its four major waterfalls - Managalam falls, Etterumai Pazhi falls, Korayar falls and Mayil Ootru falls. Frequent travellers to the hills said that the waterfalls still require safety measures including handrails, safety barriers and separate changing rooms. For around six months from September, the waterfalls in Pachamalai record copious water flow. Yet, the lack of coordination between the stakeholders including the forest department and tourism department has been a setback in the region to improve tourism. “We have plans to augment the infrastructure and amenities available in Puliyancholai and Pachamalai. We will discuss among the stakeholders to boost tourism,” T Jegatheeswari, district tourism officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/puliyancholai-still-remains-an-untapped-tourist-spot/articleshow/86586662.cms||Deepak Karthik

While the three mass vaccination programmes have helped even the dull performing blocks, the absence of adequate vaccine stock was cited as the reason for four blocks - Thiruverumbur, Marungapuri, Lalgudi and Manachanallur - not being able to cross the 50% coverage.Health officials said that the four blocks that are trailing in the vaccination drive have a higher population than the rest, thus taking time to vaccinate. “The mass vaccination drive and intensive awareness promotion to persuade people to take the jab have improved the overall coverage. There is no vaccination hesitancy among the people. If we get adequate vaccines, we can soon cover 60% of the eligible population in the district,” A Subramani, deputy director of health services, told TOI. The district requires at least 1.50 lakh vaccines per week to sustain the enthusiasm among the people to get the jab, he added. However, Trichy is getting less than the stock required that too once or twice a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shortage-of-doses-hits-brisk-coverage-in-trichy-rural-blocks/articleshow/86586667.cms||Deepak Karthik

Even though the corporation has procured an automatic road sweeper machine under the smart cities mission programme, there is delay in utilising the vehicle for clearing the silt and clean arterial roads.In the past week, the accumulation of silt has gradually increased on Royal road, Thillai Nagar main road, Sastri road and Lawsons road. While cars and other public transport vehicles are not affected, two-wheeler riders and cyclists are vulnerable. Locals have opined that the civic body can clear it daily with the two automatic road sweepers it bought at a cost of over Rs 1 crore, of which one machine arrived a couple of weeks back. The sweeper machine has been parked at the main office of the Trichy Corporation. “The new road sweeper will be launched shortly. Till then, we will clean the silt manually,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/silt-on-roads-poses-threat-to-motorists/articleshow/86586672.cms||---

In the process, they earned Rs 5 crore but landed in jail after two years of a life of crime. The group made replicas of websites of major companies and gave out fake franchisees to people in return for money. Lucknow cyber cell on Tuesday arrested Vivekananda, an alumnus of a private MBA college in Bhopal, Shivendra, a BTech graduate from a Gurgaon private institute and Sachidananda, a science graduate from Magadh University. All three are natives of Bihar. According to police, Vivekananda joined hands with his brother Sachidananda after he lost his Rs 8 lakh per annum job during the pandemic. Techie Shivendra also joined in. They all wanted to retain the lifestyle they were used to. The cybercell nabbed the gang after one Devrat Chaturvedi was duped of Rs 3 lakh in the name of allotting the franchisee of a famous snacks company in Aashiana. While working on the case, the cybercell also got a similar complaint from Jaunpur, where businessman Vinod Gupta was swindled of Rs 2 crore on the pretext of allotting him the franchisee of a US auto company. ACP cybercell Vivek Ranjan Rai said, “Vivekananda and Sachidananda roped in Shivendra who used to design websites akin to original ones and in return, was given a heavy share of the money earned.” To appear genuine, the gang members used to pose as top bosses of the company and talk to people. “The bank accounts in which the gang asked victims to transfer money were all based in Maharashtra, Delhi or metropolises like Bengaluru,” said the ACP. “We will take all three on remand to know more about the case,” he said. The gang had made over Rs 5 crore in the past two years, duping businessmen in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himanchal Pradesh, and Gujarat. Two more members of the gang—Kanhaiya Kumar and Suman Kumar—are on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mba-techie-made-rs-5cr-from-fake-sites/articleshow/86593172.cms||---

However, the accused neither gave any rent nor returned the vehicle to the owner. No arrest has been made in the case so far. In his complaint, Mukesh Kumar of Nayagaon, Mohali alleged that Dinesh Kumar of Sector 29 had taken his Mahindra Bolero jeep saying that he would attach his vehicle with the irrigation department in Panchkula on monthly rent. Mukesh gave his vehicle to the accused in February, 2020. After taking the vehicle, the accused gave a cheque to Mukesh, which bounced. When the complainant made inquiries at the irrigation department, Panchkula, he came to know that they had not hired any Bolero from Dinesh. He called Dinesh and asked him to return his vehicle. When the accused failed to return the vehicle for several months, the complainant filed a complaint at the SSP public window. The SSP marked a complaint with Industrial Area Phase-1 police for further investigation. A case was registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of Trust) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC against the alleged accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-booked-in-cheating-case/articleshow/86591331.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||As crisis looms, high command backs Sudhakaran-Satheesan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It's a season of open discontent in the Kerala unit of the Congress party but those in the know say that it is not likely to extend beyond a lot of sound and some fury. Reason: The Congress high command in Delhi wants the old guard sidelined and rampant factionalism neutralised, and to that purpose it will be willing to put up with KPCC president K Sudhakaran's rather brash and authoritarian style of functioning. From Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala to V M Sudheeran and Mullapally Ramachandran, a formidable lineup of disgruntled leaders have come out against Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan but the high command remains unmoved. This was the reason why even when two senior leaders like Chandy and Chennithala flayed the new leadership openly, the high command asked the state leadership to resolve their issues locally. To Chandy and Chennithala's chagrin, no AICC emissary was despatched to patch up differences. The leaders were contacted only by AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar against whom Chandy and Ramesh have raised serious allegations that he is dancing to the tunes of Sudhakaran and Satheesan. ``There is no question of change of guard in the party again. Sudhakaran is doing well by leading the party. The issues raised by senior leaders are being considered with due importance,’’ Tariq Anwar reacted to recent developments in the party. In fact, the disgruntled leaders' main concern is their access to the high command has been severely restricted. The state leaders are unable to reach out to Rahul Gandhi who, these days, goes with whatever AICC general secretary K C Venugopal advises. The Congress in Kerala is plagued not just by internal problems. The 'narcotic jihad' row (the Pala bishop claiming that Christian youths were getting addicted to drugs as part of a deliberate plan) has put the party in an unenviable situation, since it has to now placate both minority communities -- Muslims and Christians who form its major support base -- simultaneously. Sudhakaran and Sateeshan sought to turn the bishop's controversial remarks into an opportunity by trying to bring religious heads and community leaders together to "sort out differences" but the move yielded no dividends as the Syro Malabar church stuck to its stand while Muslim clerics and leaders wanted nothing less than the bishop to retract. When senior leader P Chidambaram waded in by saying in a newspaper article that the bishop was wrong, Sudhakaran openly said, his frustration clearly showing, that pronouncements on matters happening in Kerala should be left to more capable local hands. In what may be a reflection of changing equations even at the national level, after Sudheeran wrote to the high command listing out the charges against the new state leadership, the high command was uninterested. Sudheeran mentioned his resignation from the PAC and from the AICC in the same letter. Yet only senior leader A K Antony is learnt to have spoken to Sudheeran from the high command to persuade him to reconsider his decision. The high command is well aware that Sudheeran had raised similar allegations even when Chandy and Ramesh were ruling the roost in the party. The only difference now being taking an extreme step of resignation this time. However, the high command seems to have been taken by surprise that leaders like Sudheeran and Mullappally, who don't have any group affiliations in the party but have a close rapport with A K Antony, too have come out openly against the state leadership. The high command might be inclined to placate them and there are reports that these two leaders are likely to be given new portfolios at the national level during the AICC reshuffle. But it is not sure whether a leader like Sudheeran will accept this offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/as-crisis-looms-high-command-backs-sudhakaran-satheesan/articleshow/86592513.cms||Rajiv G

Complainants too have expressed fear of visiting the station due to the impolite behaviour of some officers. This shouldn’t happen. Police must work as their saviours, treat them in a friendly manner and help instead of frightening them,” the home minister said. “Due to the attitude of some policemen, people are scared to visit the station. To check any such behaviour of policemen and to arm the common man to raise voice against such police officers, these telephone lines are being set up. People will also be able to send complaints against officers online,” the home minister stated.Speaking to reporters later, Jnanendra said he would discuss the proposed initiative with senior police officers at the earliest and take necessary steps in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dedicated-lines-to-receive-plaints-against-cops-hm/articleshow/86590362.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: After 3-month canvassing, Huzurabad enters key phase||HYDERABAD: After unrelenting campaigning for Huzurabad by-election for the past three months, the political battle now has entered into the crucial phase with the announcement of election schedule for Huzurabad by the ECI on Tuesday. TRS, BJP and Congress, especially the ruling party, made the election a prestige issue, and took up high-voltage campaigns covering every village and community. Former minister Eatala Rajender had submitted his resignation for the assembly membership and TRS on June 12. After his exit was clear, the pink party plunged into action and ensured that senior party leaders and constituency leaders do not sail away with Rajender. The former minister also undertook padayatra, which was abruptly ended due to his leg injury and surgery. “This is probably for the first time that major parties have been giving top priority for a by-election,” Neelochan Chitrapu, a political analyst said. “The parties held meetings with workers, elected representatives, castes leaders and organizations meetings. That too much before the announcement of the election schedule.” Replicating its successful strategy in Nagarjuna Sagar bye-election, the TRS appointed incharges for each mandal in Huzurabad constituency. Already, the mandal incharages have been touring and coordinating with local leaders. TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao roped in minister T Harish Rao, who has been visiting the constituency almost every day and working out strategy to ensure the party’s victory in the election. The ruling party is also extending support to every community by announcing sops and development works to them. The government has already identified beneficiaries for the Dalit Bandhu scheme and the amount will be deposited into the accounts soon. TRS party sources said the CM addressed a public meeting by launching Dalit Bandhu in the second week of July. The party is also planning to hold another public meeting in Huzurabad after Dasara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-3-month-canvassing-huzurabad-enters-key-phase/articleshow/86592500.cms||Koride Mahesh

During investigations, SIT had found the video clip in one of the two phones of the seer in which he is heard saying exactly what was written in the note recovered from his room. In the video, the Mahant reportedly accused Anand Giri, Adya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari, of subjecting him to mental harassment and forcing him to end his life. The Mahant is heard as saying that he was under extreme mental stress after he was “informed from Haridwar” that Anand Giri was planning to upload his morphed video clip, with a girl or a woman in an objectionable condition, on social media. The CBI will now send both the phones for forensic examination. Senior SIT officials said on the basis of the video clip, which was considered as the ‘dying declaration’ of the Mahant, Anand Giri, Adya Tiwari and Sandeep Tiwari were arrested. Meanwhile, a four-member team of CBI officials reached Naini central jail on Tuesday to take Anand Giri, Adhya Tewari and his son Sandeep on seven-day remand following a court order. The three will be confronted on the basis of evidence gathered by the team and their phones and laptops will be sent for forensic examination. A CBI team is also likely to visit Haridwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbi-takes-giris-phones-in-its-possession/articleshow/86593212.cms||Kapil Dixit

Citizens had no feedback system and a very weak redressal system. Due to this lack of transparency, there were allegations of corruption and various malpractices. In this day and age when a citizen can do most of the things sitting at home, it is surprising how only a manual system of payments was prevailing. The result of all these inefficiencies was delays, red-tapism and harassment of applicants,” he said. He added, “These efforts will surely transform UT estate office into a technology-driven organisation that provides seamless and on-demand services to citizens through highly efficient citizen friendly processes.” The UT estate office has built a website - https://estateoffice.chd.gov.in/ with the help of the NIC, that encompasses all infromation about the services provided by the department, acts, rules and notifications etc. Citizens can also make easy use of online services via quick links provided on the website. The estate office has been offering multiple services to citizens under one roof, like change of ownership, issuance of no objection certificate, sanction of fresh and revised building plan, collection of lease, GST etc, issuance of allotment letter, transfer of ownership, permission for bank mortgage, permission for change of trade etc. With a proper feedback and experience of the staff, it was found that there were certain areas where reform was needed to ensure transparency in governance. The project was conceptualised in August 2020 with the launch of online services. The office will be able to digitise all the data and simplify work flow, allowing citizens to access information with a click. The SMS service has been introduced to keep the applicant in the loop about the status of work done. Internal staff will be able to check all pendencies to resolve matters in minimum time frame.

He had taken the first shot of vaccination and had history of Covid-19. The treating doctors said that he did not have any history of hypertension or other comorbidity, but his troponin levels had shot up and ECG showed that he had a heart attack! As the city and state recorded the worst phase of the pandemic in April-May this year, cardiovascular issues emerged as one of the most prominent aftermath of Covid-19. Dr Sameer Dani, senior interventional cardiologist, said that the patients with no significant risk factors also ended up having blood clots. “In such patients, the arteries were not blocked with cholesterol, but they got heart attack due to thrombosis,” he said. “On the other side of the spectrum, there’s also a sudden jump in elderly population with acute coronary symptoms. We recently performed TAVI for bicuspid valve on a patient in his eighties.” Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve. “Covid infection unmasked many underlying health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, especially among the younger population,” said Dr Jay Shah, a city-based cardiologist. “Those with smoking and tobacco chewing habits are found to be at higher risk. In all, about 20% more patients under 40 years were seen with cardiac issues this year compared to normal trend.” Dr Kamal Sharma, interventional cardiologist, said that they had recently seen a case of MINOCA (Myocardial Infraction with Non-obstructive Coronary Arteries) in a 22-year-old patient. “It was a classic case where the markers were pointing at a heart attack, but the angiography did not show any clogged arteries,” he said. “Those recovered from Covid must undergo check-up and maintain balanced lifestyle.” But not all cases of cardiac issues post Covid may be associated with infection alone, said Dr Sunil Thanvi, an interventional cardiologist. ‘Vaccines safe for cardiac patients’City-based cardiologists said that they are fielding a lot of queries from cardiac patients about Covid vaccination. Dr Jayesh Prajapati, the head of the cardiology department at UNMICRC, said that they tell the patients to assess the pros and cons. “The chances of adverse events are rare. Patients are generally apprehensive about the chances of clotting or even heart attack,” he said. “But we have not seen such cases. Moreover, if they don’t take the vaccine, the chances of developing Covid complications are higher if they have comorbidities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-made-young-hearts-old/articleshow/86591456.cms||Parth Shastri

Among them, eight are Reddys, five SCs, five BCs and one Vysya community candidate. All of them hail from Huzurabad constituency or Karimnagar district. However, former minister Konda Surekha, who is not in the 19-member list, is among the front-runners for the party ticket despite being a non-local. The main factors for the 19 candidates vying for the Huzurabad ticket is that Congress has been polling, on an average, 30% of the total polled votes in this constituency, both in the assembly as well as parliamentary elections in the past 20 years. Local leaders in Huzurabad believe that the party has its traditional vote-bank in Huzurabad, who have been voting for Congress, irrespective of who the candidate is. “The Congress party has the scope for winning the bypoll as a majority of voters are unable to decide between their loyalty to the ruling TRS led by CM KCR or their MLA Eatala Rajender, who is now with the BJP. Even if Congress fails to win, it can still poll 50,000 votes and salvage its prestige, given the fact that this is the first election for A Revanth Reddy after he took over as TPCC chief,” said a local leader in Huzurabad. On the flip side, talk in the political circles is that Congress could have been a force to reckon with in Huzurabad by now had Revanth Reddy held at least one Dalita Girijana Dandora meeting in Huzurabad. But, except the poll-bound constituency, strangely, the party has been organising huge public meetings at other places in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/surekha-front-runner-18-others-vie-for-cong-ticket/articleshow/86592512.cms||Roushan Ali

A meeting was arranged between the protesters led by state president Deepak Kambhoj and principal secretary Hussan Lal, in which the delegation of protesting teachers discussed their demands. However, nothing concrete came out of it. The teachers said that after continuous struggle of more than four and a half years, out of the 6,635 ETT posts, about 2,364 were declared but the government had made amendments to give chance to outsiders. They demanded that only ETT teachers should be recruited on 2,364 ETT teacher posts.

TOI had reported that the ruling councillors had condemned the government and accused the deputy speaker and local MLA Isidore Fernandes of playing “dirty politics” and “sidelining” them for the inauguration. “So many governments have come and gone but this project didn’t materialise. Now I am happy that it has materialised,” said the corporation’s chairman, Dayanand Sopte, adding that council members, barring a few, should have been present. Controversy broke out over the project’s inauguration as the chief officer, deputy chairperson, ward councillor and chairperson of the Canacona Municipal Council were not invited to the event. “We called everyone, including the council, for the inauguration, but it is unfortunate that some of the council members, including the chairperson and vice chairperson didn’t attend the function. Even if there was some misunderstanding among us, they could have overlooked it and attended,” Fernandes said. Sopte added that this was one of the best and major projects along the entire Goa coastline.

Bisalpur dam, which was awaiting good rainfall in its catchment areas, is finally witnessing a rise in its water level. Its current water level stands at 311.83RL/metre against the full capacity of 315 RL/metre. Also, with water continuously reaching the catchment areas, authorities are expecting further elevation in the dam’s level. Even Jawai Dam of Pali, which did not receive water for the past three years, is now 15% filled. The last lap of the monsoon has brought moderate to heavy rainfall in almost every part of the state. Majority of the places are witnessing heavy rainfall due to which all the reservoirs have reached at good water levels. The water level at Kota Barrage (Kota) has reached at 259.52 RL/metre against a full capacity of 260.30 RL/metre. “It is now 96% filled and good rainfall in the Kota division will further elevate its level. Also good rainfall in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has attributed in increasing the water level of the dam,” said an officer with the water resources department.

---||Jaipur||‘Gender gap, poverty pushing Sahariyas behind’||Jaipur: Malnutrition, gender gap, poverty, poor access to healthcare and conservative mindset are among the main reasons behind the socio-economic backwardness of the Sahariyas, an indigenous community from Shahbag and Kishanganj tehsil in the Baran district of Rajasthan. This was revealed by a report recently released by Sanjay Kumar, an assistant professor at the humanities department of MandsaurUniversity. The country has 705 tribal groups, including 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG). The Sahariya group is one among them. Sahariyas have the worst socio-economic indicators among the 12 notified tribes in the state. “ As education does not yield any immediate economic return, the Sahariyas prefer to engage their children in remunerative employment which supplements the family income,” the report mentioned. The tribe hogged the limelight after the deaths of children due to starvation hit the headlines nationally and internationally in2000-01. For granting special focus, the union government had declared the primitive tribes’ in 2011. Other than Sahariyas, Bhil, Damor, Dhanka, Garasia,Kathodi, Kokna, Koli, Meena, Nayaka, Patelia and Bhilala were also declared primary tribes. The report said the literacy rate among the Sahariyas was the lowest among all the 12 notified tribes in the state. The literacy rate among women in both the tribe’s dominated tehsils is less than 45% despite special focus of the state and the central government. Explaining the reason why the tribe is way behind in the basic literacy programme, Ramesh Chandra, head of Sankalp Society based in Baran, said extreme poverty and disbelief in the state had demotivated the tribe’s children from taking education. “The schools in the region are worst in terms of infrastructure and quality of education. It is considered a punishment posting for teachers who are transferred here and they don’t stay for long,” said Chandra. The tribe dominates in 400 villages and as per the government records, they account for 1 lakh families. Commenting on the effects of the pandemic on the fragile community, Piyush Pandya, a tribal rights activist based in Banswara said, “They are landless labourers who are mostly engaged in agriculture fields and construction sites, which have been partial functioning for the past one year. The loss of livelihood has resulted in the mass dropout from schools. The pandemic has wiped off years of effort by the government and civil society of promoting education.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gender-gap-poverty-pushing-sahariyas-behind/articleshow/86592505.cms||---
---||Pune||Lapsed projects can be extended after hearing||Pune: Developers unable to get consent from 51% buyers to seek extension to complete lapsed projects listed by Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) may have an alternative. They can seek a joint hearing with the authority in the presence of the buyers to consider the extension with additional conditions, the latest order says. The authority recently put out a list of 3,371 projects that had expired, and promoters had not applied for extension and not uploaded Form 4, which is the certificate from the architect on completion of the project. MahaRERA has 30,668 registered projects of which 7,214 projects have been completed. In his order, MahaRERA secretary Vasant Prabhu , said developers listed under the lapsed projects should follow the procedure and only then upload their Form 4. The authority is giving builders an opportunity to complete their projects, chairman of the Maharashtra Society Welfare Association (MSWA) Ramesh Prabhu, told TOI. He said the allottees must form an association and approach MahaRERA to take over the lapsed project. The allottees will have possession of the project land by collecting the balance dues or by contributing the necessary amount, and will be able to complete the project. “In case there are unsold flats, those may be sold by the association to realise the required funds to complete the project. If the association needs to spend more than what was agreed, the complaint to recover the excess contribution with interest may be filed before MahaRERA and it is possible to recover such an amount,” Prabhu added. Bombay high court advocate Manjunath Kakkalameli said such an SOP would only work for genuine developers who wish to complete the project and MahaRERA can allow the lapsesd project to be completed by extending the completion period. “The joint hearing is a good move. At least extending the period ensures the interests of both parties and they can act accordingly,” he said. State CREDAI president Sunil Furde said many developers had uploaded information in the the wrong column. “MahaRERA has clarified that if such developers have all the data, it will not be an issue. A genuine developer will complete the project and it is in the interest of the allottees,” he said. The order also said if a promoter does not apply for extension or does not respond, the allottees can apply to the authority under section 7 which will help them, some citizens who have booked in lapsed projects, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lapsed-projects-can-be-extended-after-hearing/articleshow/86591380.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Lucknow||HC junks PIL for probe into Jal Jeevan Mission||Lucknow: A Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has declined to entertain a public interest litigation plea seeking probe by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India or any other independent agency in alleged anomalies of Jal Jeevan Mission scheme of the state government. Dismissing the PIL, the bench of Justice DK Upadhyay and Justice Ajai Kumar Srivastava observed, “Executive director of the state water and sanitation mission on September 10, 2021, relied each and every point to the PIL petitioner and hence we do not find any reason to entertain the petition.” The bench added, “We find that any work of the mission need not be necessarily executed by UP Jal Nigam even if it is a statutory corporation. The state authorities in their wisdom took a policy decision with the concurrence of the cabinet of the state government to get the works executed in Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode by open competitive bidding. Such a policy decision cannot be faulted for the reason that it exclusively lies in the realm of policy.” “We also notice that the selection of the agency for executing the work has been done in terms of the guidelines/rules contained in the procurement manual. The letter dated September 10, 2021, of executive director also categorically states that even the rates which have been approved as quoted by the agencies are lower than the rate of UP Jal Nigam and that the agency for the third party inspection (TPI) work has been chosen by adhering to open competitive bidding process from among the eligible tenderer,” the bench further said. The PIL was filed by a real estate/ construction businessman Aditya Mohan Arora pleading that there were irregularities in work and hence it should be probed. The petitioner also attached AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s tweets on the issue against the state government. Perusing the tweets, the bench observed, “The reliance of the petitioner on the tweets of a political party leader and the queries made under the Right to Information Act relating to the complaints made by the said political figure and also the fact that the petitioner himself is in real estate/construction business do not convince us to arrive at a conclusion that the petition has been filed for bona fide reasons."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-junks-pil-for-probe-into-jal-jeevan-mission/articleshow/86593215.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

It was Alappuzha North Police that issued the notice against the Ramankari native in Alappuzha. The high court had dismissed her anticipatory bail plea and had directed her to surrender before the investigating officer. The court had also directed the police to arrest her if she failed to surrender. Police have now issued the notice as the accused is still absconding. The notice says that the woman has been charged under IPC sections 417, 419, 420, 465, 468 and 471 for practicing in Alappuzha district court as a fake lawyer. The notice asks the public to pass on any information about her to the police officers whose phone numbers are given in the notice. Police had registered a case based on the complaint filed by the secretary of the Bar Association in Alappuzha after the association received an anonymous letter that her enrolment as a lawyer was not true. Since she failed to explain her side of the story, was expelled from the association on July 17 and a police complaint was filed. The accused had contested and won in the bar association elections held in April this year with a huge majority. She was elected as the librarian of the association. She was also appointed as advocate commissioner in a few cases. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lookout-notice-issued-against-fake-lawyer/articleshow/86592533.cms||---

The police said the youth, Dinesh Sahu, admitted to have killed Ummarji because the latter was not paying his dues. Ummarji was found dead with his throat slit with a sharp weapon, when the police checked his flat on September 21 after his wife, who stayed elsewhere, and friends told them that he was not answering their calls for four days. He had taken voluntary retirement from a private logistics firm and was staying alone in the flat, the police said. Senior inspector Satish Mane and his team of investigators from the Chikhali police found that Ummarji had got his flat repainted a fortnight prior to the murder. “When we checked with the workers, we found that Sahu’s cellphone was not reachable. We also found that Sahu was from Bilaspur,” Mane said. A police team led by sub-inspector Vivek Kumatkar was sent to Bilaspur. “The team traced Sahu at his friend’s house and arrested him.

Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra announced that suspension orders have been issued for these employees and if investigation finds them guilty, they will be terminated from the job. Radhey Shyam Meena, a district education officer in Sawai Madhopur, is among those suspended. Apart from Meena, other employees are government teachers posted in Sirohi, Jalore, Barmer, Nagaur, Duganrpur, Rajsamand, Bharatpur and Bundi. Dotasra said, “Police are yet to complete their probe after which we will terminate these employees. It has been a big task to organise REET for more than 16 lakh students in a day and the government had made good arrangements. It was celebrated as Reetotsav by people who helped candidates by distributing food and giving them lodging facilities. Our government will not spare these employees.” Although the government has suspended 14 employees, it was still not considering cases in Dungarpur, Sawai Madhopur as paper leak. The minister had said that it will be decided after investigation is complete and then the government will think about re-examination at this centre. REET is conducted on two levels – Level 1 for recruitment of teachers from classes 1 to 5 and level 2 for recruitment of teachers from classes 6 to 8. Around 31,000 vacancies of government teachers have released by the board this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-suspends-14-edu-staff-for-role-in-reet-cheating/articleshow/86592531.cms||---
---||Lucknow||With technology use, ‘smart anganwadis’ to ensure kids all-round development, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Appreciating the contribution of anganwadi workers, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday distributed smartphones among 1.23 lakh workers and said it would help them complete their work quickly and in a transparent manner. The CM also gave 1.87 lakh newborn growth monitoring devices, or infantometers, to anganwadi centres to measure the level of growth of newborn babies. An official said the device would help track the growth of children and address the problems of malnutrition or any other medical condition. Calling ‘Smart Anganwadis’ the foundation of the allround development of children, the CM said the use of technology and smartphones would make work simpler and keep them organised. “Technology will help them in uploading and accessing data in real time and also in effective implementation of schemes related to nutrition and child care,” he said. “Smartphones will make your work smarter and this smartness should be your identity. Smartphones will provide health-related information of every child, making the daily work easy and transparent,” Yogi said, adding that it was due to the efforts of anganwadi workers that there was a decline of 95% in cases of encephalitis in the state. “After 1977, encephalitis had spread in parts of the state and hospitals in Gorakhpur and Basti had to provide treatment to as many as four children on a single bed. After we came to power, we worked towards eradication of the disease. Anganwadi workers participated wholeheartedly in Dastak campaign (against encephalitis) and made it successful,” he said. The CM said before 2017, anganwadi workers were known for staging protests. “This tarnished the image of the government and people even started doubting the anganwadis,” he said. “Our government worked on the issue and now nutritious food is being prepared in all districts, keeping in mind the nutritional requirements of pregnant or lactating women. Those who were earlier known only for protests are now fully committed towards improving the nutritional levels and development of children,” he said. Giving them credit for the work done by them during the pandemic, the CM said anganwadi workers played a significant role as part of the surveillance committees formed by the government to check the spread of the disease. “Workers went door to door to help identify Covid patients, distribute medicines and make people aware about the vaccine,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-tech-use-smart-anganwadis-to-ensure-kids-all-round-devpt-cm/articleshow/86593229.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Reopening schools in Delhi for all? Call likely today||NEW DELHI: A decision on further reopening of schools for classes under IX is likely to be taken at a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday. A decision on allowing Ramlilas and public celebrations of Dussehra and other festivals may also be taken at this meeting. Almost all economic activities have been allowed in the capital, but DDMA is treading carefully ahead of festivals so that the gains made by the Covid management since the second wave are not lost. All public and private schools and coaching centres in Delhi have been allowed to reopen for the students from classes IX to XII from September 1 with strict Covid-19 norms and with a 50% cap on the number of children. Initially, the government was contemplating reopening of classes VI to VIII from the second week of September, but chose to wait. An official said the feedback of the education department on the functioning of reopened classes would be presented in the meeting so that DDMA could review its progress. DDMA is also likely to seek experts’ opinion during the meeting on reopening of more classes. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and senior Delhi government officials will be among the participants of the meeting. While many parents want the schools to reopen fully so that the children do not lose more time, experts across the world have also suggested that schools are not superspreaders and children are losing valuable time at a critical period in their life. The health and family welfare department will make a presentation on Covid management and related infrastructure. The vaccination programme will also be reviewed. Ramlila, which is due from October 6 to 16, is organised at around 700 places in the capital. While nearly 500 events presenting the Ramayana are organised at a small scale, it is held at a large scale at 60 places. Due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation, the experts have advised that the festivals should be celebrated in a simple way and gatherings should be avoided in Delhi. Last year, the capital witnessed a sudden rise in Covid cases after the festivals. The Ramlila celebrations usually witness mass gatherings where maintaining social distancing and other Covid-19 norms is challenging. Many Ramlila committees of the capital have made advance arrangements and are hoping to get DDMA’s permission. “The basic arrangements have been made. As soon as DDMA gives the nod, we will make final arrangements,” said Arjun Kumar, secretary of Lav Kush Ramlila Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reopening-schools-for-all-call-likely-today/articleshow/86591424.cms||AlokKNMishra
