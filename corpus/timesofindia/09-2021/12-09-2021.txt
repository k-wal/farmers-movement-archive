The former director, who was in-charge of J&K died due to Covid-19 when the second was at its peak. This move has surprised many as the NHIDCL has directed the Apco Shri AmarnathjiTunnelway for “urgent compliance”. The communication to the company issued on Saturday said, “This is to appraise that MD, NHIDCL during his official visit to Z-morh project on August 26, 2021, directed the concessionaire to place a bust of Sanjeev Malik, former ED(II), NHIDCL at Z-morh portal before the visit of road transport and highways minister which is scheduled on September 26, 2021.” Sources said any such direction requires prior permission of the road transport ministry and it was unprecedented to ask a private player to put a bust. “If the government agency wants this, it should have done it on its own. Secondly, the reason for installing such a bust has not been explained. There was a Supreme Court order in 2013, which had banned the installation of statues of public figures and construction of any religious structure along roads,” said a source. The NHIDCL is implementing two crucial tunnel projects in J&K at Zojila and Z-morh. In the case of Zojila tunnel, the NHIDCL had run into a controversy of giving a consultancy contract to a private player. After several complaints, the agency had to suspend the contract and has invited fresh bids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/highway-agency-asks-contractor-to-instal-bust-of-officer-died-due-to-covid/articleshow/86126002.cms||Dipak K Dash

The decomposed body of the NC leader was found under mysterious circumstances in the national capital on Thursday morning. Senior NC leaders, led by provincial president Devender Singh Rana on Saturday said that multiple theories about the death are doing the rounds, and an inquiry by the CBI should be ordered to bring out the truth. The leaders also said that the investigations should be carried out on a fast-track basis. Wazir was a prominent leader of the party and his contribution in different capacities like serving as the president Gurdwara Parbandhak Board has been immense, the statement said. The National Conference leaders are also meeting Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to press for their demand to hold a CBI inquiry into Wazir's death. Earlier in the morning, thousands of people, including former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta and senior vice-president of J&K Congress Raman Bhalla, attended the last rites of Wazir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nc-demands-cbi-inquiry-into-death-of-jk-ex-mlc/articleshow/86126747.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The firm had assured to deliver the furniture within 10 days but allegedly handed them over a month later only after the police intervened. According to Linda George, the complainant, they had paid Rs 40,000 to Logistics Movers and Packers in Ashok Vihar to relocate their furniture to Kerala on July 31. While Rs 37,000 was paid on July 31, the balance amount was to be paid on delivery, according to an agreement. The firm, the complainant said, had assured to deliver in 10 days after pickup but failed to do so even a month later. The damaged furniture was finally delivered to the family after they approached the police. Most of the items were damaged and one, they said, was missing. Police said an FIR has been filed at Sector 5 Gurugram under IPC sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust). “The accused, one Suresh Kumar, is a fraud. During the probe, we have found that whenever his firm would receive a big order, they would shift the location of their company to somewhere else,” said the investigation officer Kiranpal. Kumar, police said, had vacated the Gurugram flat out of which his firm was operating and had also not paid rent for few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/packers-movers-firm-delays-delivery-booked/articleshow/86126900.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The car was ferrying eight passengers and was on its way from Satwari towards Bahadurpur in Arnia. Police sources said the vehicle fell into the canal around 12.10am while crossing a small bridge at Marallian near Miran Sahib. Cops said the canal was flooded due to rains, which hindered rescue operations. The deceased were identified as Surjeet Kumari (52), her husband Kewal Krishan (60), Paranshi (two-months-old) and Manshi (two-years-old). The four family members who survived the accident were identified as Ganesh Kumar, who was driving the vehicle, his wife Kanchana, Menu Kumari and her son Sushant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/infant-minor-among-four-of-family-dead-in-jk-accident/articleshow/86126902.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Though the police denied nabbing the suspect, an auto driver, it is learnt that he was taken into custody from his native village in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district. The police also didn’t disclose the identity of the alleged suspect. The body of the girl, who was missing since 5 pm Thursday, was found in the house of her neighbour after midnight. Autopsy done at Osmania General Hospital revealed that the child was sexually assaulted and strangulated to death. The horrific incident had triggered angry protests from locals on Friday. They staged a sit-in for several hours on Champapet-Sagar Road, demanding immediate and harshest punishment to the guilty. Protesters pelted stones and additional forces had to be rushed in to control the flare-up. The family of the girl lodged a complaint at the Saidabad police station after their extensive search failed to trace her. As the neighbour of the victim was not to be seen, the girl’s mother got suspicious and, along with police, went to his house only to find the body of their daughter wrapped in a bedsheet. The body was in a seminaked condition. When the police were shifting the victim’s body, protesters obstructed them demanding justice for her, besides asking the government to pay compensation to her parents. Police registered a rape and murder case.

---||India||Rahul Gandhi's Kashmiri Pandit connect cold comfort for the exiled community: BJP leader||JAMMU: Reacting sharply to Rahul Gandhi identifying himself as a Kashmiri Pandit during his two-day tour of Jammu, senior BJP leader Ashwani Kumar Chrungoo on Saturday said that the Congress leader's words were nothing more than "cold comfort for Kashmiri Pandits who have been victims of the Congress party's appeasement policy in Jammu & Kashmir." Chrungoo in a press statement said, "First of all it needs to be clarified that Kashmiri Pandits have no surnames like 'Gandhi'. Secondly, the Kashmir policy of Congress under Nehru and Gandhis is recognised as the progenitor of the Kashmir problem right from 1947. Kashmiri Pandits were the worst victims of the Congress party's Kashmir policy." “Genocide, ethnic cleansing and mass exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits took place during 1989-90 when J&K was under a coalition government of the National Conference and the Congress. Congress is equally responsible for what was done to the Kashmiri Pandits in J&K. Even after the forced mass exodus of the community, Congress never came to the rescue of the Pandit community during its struggle in exile," he alleged. He claimed that the RSS, BJP, Shiv Sena and VHP were the ones who helped the cause of the Pandits in exile. Chrungoo said mere rhetoric would not bring any solace to the people of J&K, especially the displaced Kashmiri Pandit community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-gandhis-kashmiri-pandit-connect-cold-comfort-for-the-exiled-community-bjp-leader/articleshow/86126987.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||'Don't focus on hate': World marks 20th anniversary of 9/11||NEW YORK: The world solemnly marked the 20th anniversary of 9/11 on Saturday, remembering the dead, invoking the heroes and taking stock of the aftermath just weeks after the bloody end of the Afghanistan war that was launched in response to the terror attacks. Victims’ relatives and four US presidents paid respects at the sites where hijacked planes killed nearly 3,000 people in the deadliest act of terrorism on American soil. Others gathered for observances from Portland, Maine, to Guam, or for volunteer projects on what has become a day of service in the U.S. Foreign leaders expressed sympathy over an attack that happened in the US but claimed victims from more than 90 countries. “It felt like an evil specter had descended on our world, but it was also a time when many people acted above and beyond the ordinary,” said Mike Low, whose daughter, Sara Low, was a flight attendant on the first plane that crashed. “As we carry these 20 years forward, I find sustenance in a continuing appreciation for all of those who rose to be more than ordinary people,” the father told a ground zero crowd that included President Joe Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The anniversary unfolded under the pall of a pandemic and in the shadow of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, which is now ruled by the same Taliban militant group that gave safe haven to the 9/11 plotters. “It’s hard because you hoped that this would just be a different time and a different world. But sometimes history starts to repeat itself and not in the best of ways,” Thea Trinidad, who lost her father in the attacks, said before reading victims’ names at the ceremony. Bruce Springsteen and Broadway actors Kelli O’Hara and Chris Jackson sang at the commemoration, but by tradition, no politicians spoke there. In a video released Friday night, Biden addressed the continuing pain of loss but also spotlighted what he called the “central lesson” of Sept. 11: “that at our most vulnerable ... unity is our greatest strength.” Biden was also paying respects at the two other sites where the 9/11 conspirators crashed the jets: the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. At the Pennsylvania site — where passengers and crew fought to regain control of a plane believed to have been targeted at the U.S. Capitol or the White House — former President George W. Bush said Sept. 11 showed that Americans can come together despite their differences. “So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear and resentment,” said the president who was in office on 9/11. “On America’s day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab their neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America know.” “It is the truest version of ourselves. It is what we have been and what we can be again.” Calvin Wilson said a polarized country has “missed the message” of the heroism of the flight’s passengers and crew, which included his brother-in-law, LeRoy Homer. “We don’t focus on the damage. We don’t focus on the hate. We don’t focus on retaliation. We don’t focus on revenge,” Wilson said before the ceremony. “We focus on the good that all of our loved ones have done.” Former President Donald Trump visited a New York police station and a firehouse, praising responders’ bravery while criticizing Biden over the pullout from Afghanistan. “It was gross incompetence,” said Trump, who was scheduled to provide commentary at a boxing match in Florida in the evening. The attacks ushered in a new era of fear, war, patriotism and, eventually, polarization. They also redefined security, changing airport checkpoints, police practices and the government’s surveillance powers. A “war on terror” led to invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the longest US war ended last month with a hasty, massive airlift punctuated by a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 American service members and was attributed to a branch of the Islamic State extremist group. The US is now concerned that al-Qaida, the terror network behind 9/11, may regroup in Afghanistan, where the Taliban flag once again flew over the presidential palace on Saturday. Two decades after helping to triage and treat injured colleagues at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, retired Army Col. Malcolm Bruce Westcott is saddened and frustrated by the continued threat of terrorism. “I always felt that my generation, my military cohort, would take care of it — we wouldn’t pass it on to anybody else,” said Westcott, of Greensboro, Georgia. “And we passed it on.” At ground zero, multiple victims’ relatives thanked the troops who fought in Afghanistan, while Melissa Pullis said she was “just happy all the troops are out of Afghanistan.” “We can’t lose any more military. We don’t even know why we’re fighting, and 20 years went down the drain,” said Pullis, who lost her husband, Edward, and whose son Edward Jr. is serving on the USS Ronald Reagan. At this point, many of the relatives reciting victims’ names are too young to have known their lost kin. But the families spoke of lives cut short, milestones missed and a loss that still feels immediate. Several also pleaded for a return of the solidarity that surged for a time after Sept. 11 but soon gave way. Muslim Americans endured suspicion, surveillance and hate crimes. Schisms and resentments grew over the balance between tolerance and vigilance, the meaning of patriotism, the proper way to honor the dead and the scope of a promise to “never forget.” Trinidad was 10 when she overheard her dad, Michael, saying goodbye to her mother by phone from the burning trade center. She remembers the pain but also the fellowship of the days that followed, when all of New York “felt like it was family.” “Now, when I feel like the world is so divided, I just wish that we can go back to that,” said Trinidad, of Orlando, Florida. “I feel like it would have been such a different world if we had just been able to hang on to that feeling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/dont-focus-on-hate-world-marks-20th-anniversary-of-9/11/articleshow/86127500.cms||---

Sarbanand Sonowal, under whom the party had contested the Assam assembly elections, resigned even after an impressive victory to pave the way for the succession of Himanta Biswa Sarma, the incumbent CM of the state. Read AlsoWhy Vijay Rupani may have resigned as Gujarat CM and who could be his successorNEW DELHI: In a sudden and unexpected move, Vijay Rupani resigned as the chief minister of Gujarat on Saturday ahead of assembly elections in the state due late next year. Rupani is the fourth BJP chief minister to be axed this year after BS Yediyurappa (Karnataka), Tirth Singh Rawat (Uttarakhand)There have been varied reasons for the replacement of the four CMs but the exit of Rupani had been doing the rounds in the past few months mainly after the second Covid wave hit the state hard and questions were raised about the government’s handling of the crisis. Sources said it was speculated that an understanding had been reached late last year that Rupani will be replaced as party will go into state polls in December 2022, under the new chief minister.  The exact timeline was not known and it seems likely that the replacement would most likely be from the Patidar community, a decisive vote bank, that has had a few grouses with the state BJP leadership. Senior party leaders including general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh, union minister and state in charge Bhupendra Yadav, health minister Mansukh Mandaviya and minister of fisheries Vijay Rupala are in the state capital where a smooth transition is likely amid possibility of a Patidar leader replacing Rupani.

---||Noida||Guards in most condos in Noida, Ghaziabad not trained to handle untoward situation: Agencies||NOIDA: Most housing societies in Noida and Ghaziabad have guards who have hardly undergone a mandatory training in handling untoward situations, officials of various security agencies have told TOI. This, they said, is because a majority of societies don’t want to spend much on hiring prominent security agencies and end up deploying guards who lack training and are hired mostly on the basis of reference. Officials agreed that the recent incident in Lotus Boulevard in Noida, where a resident was attacked by a group of guards after an argument turned violent, could have been handled in a better way had they been properly trained. Data sourced from various agencies reveal that though Gautam Budh Nagar has around 150 private security agencies, there are only about 20 that provide professional training to their employees. A senior police officer admitted that though every private guard needs to undergo training by a retired serviceman under the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, 2005, most security agencies limit it to a few indoor lectures and sessions. “The issue of training crops up multiple times. But the fact is that most societies resort to cutting costs when it comes to hiring a security agency,” said Sohrab Khan, a field officer with a prominent agency. “A cheap agency means cheap labour. And cheap labour means less experience, lack of training and education,” he added. Agencies that offer security at low rates usually hire guards for anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 12,000 a month — in contrast a professional agency pays Rs 14,000-15,000. Most of the guards hired by these agencies come from faraway villages and small towns to earn a living in the NCR cities. Hiring mostly happens through references. And since there has been a construction boom over the past few years, getting the job of a guard isn’t difficult. A guard working at a condominium in Noida Sector 128 told TOI he was hired by his agency simply because his brother worked there. “There was hardly any training. Just a few lectures and indoor sessions,” he said. Needless to say, these guards hardly enjoy any benefits such as PF or allowances. “Situations like the one in Lotus Boulevard happen rarely. But when they do, guards need to be trained in handling them,” said Swati Aggarwal, a former office-bearer of the AOA in Grand Omaxe society. Ghanshyam Jha, who owns Arania Services Pvt Ltd in Ghaziabad, provides security guards to 22 housing societies across Delhi-NCR. “In our agency, a mandatory 100-hour training is provided to each guard before he or she is inducted. We look for several qualities in them, most important being the ability to handle pressure situations and respond to provocations,” he said. “They could work at the society gate or be given the job of patrolling. But sometimes, our inability in assigning specific jobs goes wrong, leading to incidents like the one in Noida recently,” Jha added. “One takes the job of a guard by compulsion, not by choice,” summed up Rajbala, whose son Dinesh is one of the nine arrested in connection with the Lotus Boulevard incident. Dinesh, who wanted to pursue a BA course, took up the job of a security guard to fund his education, his family said.

The crime took place early on Friday. The 45-year-old accused, a part-time driver from Uttar Pradesh and also a pavement dweller, was tracked to Kurla late on Friday with the help of CCTV cameras and was booked for murder, rape, unnatural offence and sexual harassment. On Saturday, the accused was produced before an Andheri court and was remanded in police custody till September 21. “The woman had suffered severe injuries in her perineal area (the area between the thighs) and some of her organs, including intestines, were spilling out when she was brought to the hospital,” said a doctor. Read AlsoMumbai: Woman raped, left unconscious on road in Saki Naka, one heldA man accused of raping a 30-year-old woman in Mumbai's Saki Naka was arrested by the local police on Friday.The woman, assaulted in a tempo outside Rashid Compound, Saki Naka, was on ventilator support at Rajawadi Hospital for roughly 28 hours before her death around 11.30am on Saturday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray called an urgent meeting of senior IPS officers and said the case would be tried in a fast-track court. He directed police to file a chargesheet within a month’s time. “Police have been asked to be more vigilant and take steps to ensure that Mumbai’s image of a safe city is not tarnished,” said a senior police officer. Around 3.15am on Friday, a security guard at Rashid Compound near Chandivli Studio had called the police control, saying a woman was being assaulted inside a parked tempo. A Saki Naka police team reached the spot within 10 minutes of the call and found the injured woman. The accused had fled by then. Read AlsoCan't be present everywhere: Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Saki Naka rape taking place during GaneshotsavMumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Saturday informed that a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to look into the horrifying Saki Naka rape case.“A police constable and other cops got the tempo’s ignition key from the security guard and drove the victim to the hospital immediately,” said DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. “The motive behind the crime is not yet known and the accused has not revealed the reason. The CCTV footage showed him fleeing but we did not see him carrying any weapon used in the crime. The victim suffered severe injuries and lost her life due to excess bleeding,” said a police officer. Till late Saturday, it was unclear if police had recovered the sharp object used in the assault. She was brought to the hospital in a serious condition and a five-member team of gynaecologists and surgeons operated on her on Friday. She never regained consciousness to be able to talk to the doctors or police. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital, said the woman was brought to the hospital in a critical condition. “We don’t know how the injuries were caused or if she was sexually assaulted. Forensic tests and police investigations should reveal that,” she said. Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said a special investigation team, led by ACP Jyotsana Rasam, was formed. “The investigation will be completed in a month. The case will be fast-tracked. Initially, it was suspected more persons may have been involved but the arrest of the accused has cleared that,” said Nagrale. “There are QR codes placed in the jurisdiction of all police stations and whenever police personnel are deployed on night patrol, they have to scan the code to show they have completed patrolling the locality. As part of the investigation, we will check whether police patrolling was conducted in that locality. But the incident occurred in little time and we have to verify whether the team had patrolled the area before it happened,” he said. Police said the victim, married and separated twice, did odd jobs for a living. She had two daughters from her first marriage and a son from the second. She did not have good relations with her family, said police. She, however, had briefly met her mother and her neighbours around 7pm on Thursday. A close relative told TOI: “I have known her since childhood. She had no bad habits. She was upset ever since her second husband left her. Her daughters live with her physically disabled mother and son with her estranged husband. The person who killed her was never seen in the locality by any of us. Her mother is in shock. Her younger sister has visited the hospital and is completing the formalities.” (With Malathy Iyer & Bhavika Jain)Watch 32-year-old brutally raped with iron rod in Mumbai, dies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/woman-raped-assaulted-in-private-parts-dies-in-mumbai/articleshow/86127811.cms||V Narayan
---||India||Union ministers to visit J&K in govt’s outreach programme||NEW DELHI: In a new initiative, central ministers will be visiting Jammu & Kashmir, which is being seen as a significant outreach by the government close on the heels of many parliamentary panels and dozens of MPs touring the Union Territory along with Ladakh two years after the nullification of Article 370. Sources said while some ministers have been assigned different districts, others have been asked to review ongoing projects. They also said some of the ministers will interact with local beneficiaries of the central schemes. There is also a possibility of some ministers distributing the entitlements to the identified beneficiaries during their stay in the UT. This will send a strong message of how the Centre has a special focus on development across J&K, sources said. Most of the ministers will complete their tours this month. Over 200 MPs from at least 14 parliamentary committees have visited the UTs of J&K and Ladakh in recent months, interacting with masses and receiving a feedback on the problems they face. During their visit, many parliamentarians told TOI that they noted lower levels of tension and a yearning for normalcy and peace. The latest was a visit by the Shashi Tharoor-led parliamentary panel on information technology, which spent three days in J&K soon after the death of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani on September 1. “The lack of response to Geelani’s death, however, shows that it is relatively safe now to move towards an expansion of the political space, and to focus on integrating the hearts and minds of people,” Tharoor told TOI. The Tharoor-led panel also discussed the status of Bharatnet in J&K, apart from visiting the offices of Doordarshan and the Industrial Training Institute in Srinagar. A discussion on the internet shutdowns in J&K, to which an MP said there is “universal revulsion”, however, was not held. Pointing to a high per capita expenditure of development funds, and projects being completed on war footing, BJP MP Zafar Islam said the committee had “specific interactions with some people from different regions of the Valley and we could see a sense of satisfaction and contentment among most of them about ongoing development work in the region”. “Unlike general perception that there is unhappiness in the Valley, we found most people had no complaints about the changes like doing away with the special status to the state,” Islam added. The visits by multiple Parliament panels, seen as a confidence-building measure among the people of the Valley, are also seen as a prelude to the restoration of the assembly and state elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/union-ministers-to-visit-jk-in-govts-outreach-programme/articleshow/86129892.cms||Akhilesh Singh

On August 7, an Air India Express Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operating a Kozhikode-Dubai flight with 184 passengers, including ten infants and six crew members on board, crashed on landing at 7.41 pm. The aircraft landed in tailwind condition, touched down deep into the runway, and overshot the runway end safety area, damaged a navigation aid antenna before plunging about 110 feet down the tabletop runway where it hit the airport perimeter wall. The fuselage broke into three, the engines sheared off the wings. ``The role of systemic failures as a contributory factor cannot be overlooked in this accident. A large number of similar accidents/incidents that have continued to take place, more so in Air India Express, reinforce existing systemic failures within the aviation sector,’’ said the report, released by Capt Surender Singh Chahal, investigator-in-charge. ``These usually occur due to prevailing safety culture that gives rise to errors, mistakes, and violation of routine tasks performed by people operating within the system,’’ it said. The Air India Express B737-800 aircraft (VT-AXH) was operating a quick return flight on sector Kozhikode-Dubai-Kozhikode under ‘Vande Bharat Mission’. The aircraft and crew had an uneventful flight from Kozhikode to Dubai. With the same crew, the aircraft departed from Dubai for Kozhikode at 3.30 pm (IST) as flight AXB 1344. The weather at Kozhikode was poor with heavy rain and strong winds, which had the pilots carry out a missed approach on the first attempt while coming into land on runway 28, said the report. Even as the pilots were preparing for a second attempt to land on runway 28, the pilots of an Air India aircraft, departing for Delhi asked for a take-off on runway 10. The air traffic controller changed the `runway in use’, from runway 28 to runway 10, and flight operations moved in the opposite direction. What was a headwind on runway 28, now turned into a tailwind on runway 10. When the air traffic controller ``suggested runway 10 for landing.. the commander accepted without careful deliberation,’’ said the report. The controller also did not caution the pilots about strong tailwinds. Runway 10 had a tailwind of 29kmph and not 18 kmph as reported to the pilots. Aircraft land and take off in headwind. In a tailwind landing, aircraft consume a longer length of the runway to touch down and come to a halt. Flight 1344 was now making an approach to land on runway 10, in tailwind condition. About five seconds after the autopilot was disengaged, in preparation for the landing, the aircraft deviated off a particular navigation signal that helps a plane track a safe angle of descent to land. With this, the aircraft was now on an ‘unstabilized’ approach to land. An unstabilised approach is simply an unsafe descent to land. The factors that contribute to an unstabilised approach include aircraft’s failure to adhere to the speed limits or descent rate or flight path for approach to land etc. This in turn forces the pilot to make corrections leading to an approach to land that isn’t stable and consistent. The first officer called out the unstabilised approach and the commander initiated a correction but over-corrected in the process, the report said. The pilots should have carried out a `missed approach’__that is abort the landing, climb and return for a fresh attempt at landing. The first officer should have taken over the controls and carried out a `go-around’, the report said. A go-around is a procedure performed when a pilot isn’t entirely sure of a safe landing. The descent is aborted, the aircraft is put in a climb to return for a fresh attempt at approach and landing. With no such action from the first officer and the commander continuing with the `unstabilised approach’, the aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 92 ft, instead of the correct threshold crossing height of 50 ft, the report said. It touched down approximately at 4,438 ft on an 8,858 ft long runway, in light rain with a tailwind component of 15 knots and a ground speed of 165 knots. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway and this ended in a runway overrun. The aircraft exited runway 10 end at a ground speed of 84 knots and then overshot the Runway End Safety Area, breaking a navigation aid antenna and a fence before plummeting down the tabletop runway, the report said. ``The aircraft fell to a depth of approximately 110 ft below the runway elevation and impacted the perimeter road that runs just below the tabletop runway, at a ground speed of 41 knots and then came to an abrupt halt on the airport perimeter road just short of the perimeter wall,’’ it said. There was a fuel leak from both the wing tanks; however, there was no post-crash fire. The factors that led to poor decisions: Before operating the said flight, Air India Express had informed the commander that he had to operate the next day’s flight out of Kozhikode to Doha. ``The actions and decisions of the commander were steered by a misplaced motivation to land back at Kozhikode to operate next day morning flight. The unavailability of a sufficient number of Captains at Kozhikode was the result of faulty Air India Express HR policy,’’ said the report. ``The commander had vast experience of landing at Kozhikode under similar weather conditions. This experience might have led to overconfidence leading to complacency and a state of reduced conscious attention..,’’ the report said. ``The commander was taking multiple un-prescribed anti-diabetic drugs that could have probably caused subtle cognitive deficits..,’’ it added. Another aspect pointed out in the report was that of aircraft maintenance. During the first approach to land in Kozhikode, the cockpit windshield wiper on the commander’s side had stopped working after operating for approximately 27 seconds while at approximately 1881 ft, the report said. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the commander saying: “Wiper is gone...what a day for the wiper to go”. The CVR recordings revealed that the commander had given detailed instructions to the first officer about the wiper pointing to the probability of wiper malfunction instances in the past as well. “You just see that it works....remember put it to high...high speed”, the commander said to the co-pilot referring to the wiper. The final seconds after the aircraft touched down deep into the runway point to confusion in the cockpit. The aircraft, flying at 20 feet over the runway had crossed over 1300 feet of the runway when the commander increased the engine power up to 83 %. ``This burst of additional power kept the aircraft afloat and resulted in a long landing with a touchdown at 4438 ft on the 8858 ft long runway,’’ the report said. The aircraft touched down deep, almost close to the runway midpoint. Before the thrust reversers (used to slow down the aircraft by changing the direction of the engine thrust) could take any effect, they were stowed back. ``While the reversers were being stowed, the aircraft brake pressure was momentarily reduced, decreasing the longitudinal deceleration. Thrust reversers were deployed for the second time 15 seconds after touchdown when the aircraft was at 8200 ft beyond the threshold, the max reverse thrust was commanded and the engine began to spool up,’’ the report said. At no stage, after touchdown, were the thrust levers moved forward at any time on the landing roll. The aircraft did not stop on the runway and this resulted in runway overrun. Capt M Ranganathan, an air safety expert: ``The AAIB has identified it as pilot error. His decision-making was poor, when the wipers were malfunctioning, he should have diverted to the alternate airport. His compulsion to land in Calicut to operate the next day’s flight points to a very serious deficiency in Air India Express safety culture.” Among the recommendations made by the investigation team headed by Capt Chahar for Air India Express was simulator training for pilots in realistic situations. ``Emphasis to be laid to promote assertiveness of the first officer to take over control and initiate a go-around on an unstabilized approach when the commander fails to respond, tailwind landing on wet runway… etc.” Better crew resource management, introduce international best practices for stabilized approaches, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pilot-error-air-india-express-repeated-systemic-failures-probable-cause-of-kozhikode-aug-2020-crash-aaib-report/articleshow/86129930.cms||Manju V

But our economy has recovered strongly,” Modi said at the inauguration of the Sardardham Bhavan in Ahmedabad. The PM said India was in reform mode when big economies were in a defensive mode. “When global supply chains were being disrupted, we were launching PLI (production linked incentive) schemes to turn the tide in India’s favour,” said the PM. He said the recently launched PLI in textiles will hugely benefit cities such as Surat. Latest data showed the economy has continued to recover from the pandemic as curbs have been lifted across the country. The economy grew 20.1% in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal year that ends in March and several key indicators point to a robust recovery in the quarters ahead. Data released on Friday showed that industrial output in July was almost back to pre-Covid levels with an annual rise of 11.5%. The Union cabinet has approved a Rs 10,683 crore PLI scheme for the textile sector and the government hopes to garner significant investments in the sector and create fresh jobs. The PLI scheme which covers 10 sectors, including textiles and automobiles, is aimed at attracting investments, creating jobs and boosting economic growth besides in aiding the economic recovery under way. “We should look upon ourselves as a global economic leader in the 21st century. India does not have a scarcity of opportunities to make it big,” said the PM. Experts say the economy is on course to achieve double digit expansion in 2021-22 and the finance ministry has said that rapidly increasing vaccination coverage and richer experience with pandemic management provide the confidence that the recovery can be continued even in the event of a third wave. The PM said the hostel facility being inaugurated will also help many girls to come forward. He said the state-of-the-art building, girls’ hostel and modern library will empower the youth. The PM said continuous efforts are being made to bring forward those sections of the society who have been left behind. He said that on one hand, work is being done for the rights of Dalits and the socially backward and on the other hand 10% reservation has been given to those who are economically backward. These efforts are creating a new confidence in society, he said. Modi said the National Education Policy will prepare students for the skills demanded in the market. He said the ‘Skill India Mission’ is also a big priority for the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/economic-recovery-faster-than-covid-19-damage-pm-modi/articleshow/86129978.cms||---

A recent study of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stated that a single dose of Covaxin may be enough to protect those who have recovered from the Covid-19 infection from contracting it again, unlike non-infected people who must take two doses to be fully protected. But, the official clarified that as of now, there is no change in the vaccination dosage and no communication had been issued regarding it. “According to the prescribed format, two doses must be taken for full vaccination post-Covid infection. Since there is no change in the protocol, there will not be any change in the Co-WIN app,” the Union health ministry official said. ICMR officials also stated that both vaccine doses would be ideal even for previously infected individuals for full vaccination. Senior epidemiologist of ICMR, Dr Samiran Panda, said, “Full vaccination requires two doses, and this should be followed.” The ICMR conducted a study, “Antibody responses to the BBV152 vaccine in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2: A pilot study”, on 114 healthcare professionals and frontline workers, who took Covaxin shots between February and May, 2021. It found that those infected with Covid-19 and took one dose of Covaxin showed similar immune response as those participants who were never infected by Covid-19 infection and had received both the doses of the vaccine. The study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research stated that the preliminary data suggested that a single dose of BBV152-induced humoral immunity in previously infected individuals was equivalent to two doses of the vaccine in infection-naïve (non-infected) individuals. It pointed out that “participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, after a single vaccine (BBV152) dose, elicited IgG (N) and IgG (S) antibody levels, along with NAb binding inhibition responses levels, that were similar to infection-naïve vaccinated participants who had taken two doses of the vaccine”. According to the ICMR, findings of the study offers evidence in support of public health-oriented and immunologically sustained vaccine strategies that could include recommending a one-dose regimen for those infected by Covid-19. It said these findings must be confirmed with large-size cohort studies. Dr Panda said further studies would be undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-says-two-doses-of-covaxin-must-even-for-covid-cured-people/articleshow/86130014.cms||Nisha Nambiar

According to a finance ministry notification, the base import duty on crude palm oil has been reduced to 2.5% from 10%, while the tax on crude soyaoil and crude sunflower oil has been reduced to 2.5% from 7.5%. With this reduction, the effective duty, which includes agri cess on crude palm oil, crude soyaoil and crude sunflower oil will come down to 24.75% from the earlier 30.25%. In case of refined palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil, the effective duty will be 35.75% from 41.25%, according to a food ministry statement. The fresh round of cuts could bring down the retail prices by Rs 4-5 per litre, said B V Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors Association (SEA). “The current domestic bullishness in edible oils is spearheaded by low arrival of mustard seed. In our meeting with the food secretary on Friday, we had suggested a reduction of import duty on rapeseed oil in line with soya and sunflower oil or even a little lower as it will have desired salutary effect on runaway mustard oil prices. This will also go a long way in cooling all edible oil prices as globally edible oil prices have started showing weakness,” he added. According to SEA, total import of vegetable oils during November 2020 to July 2021 fell by 2% to 96,54,636 tonnes, compared to 98,25,433 tonnes during the corresponding period of the previous oil year (November-October).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-reduces-import-duty-to-rein-in-prices-of-edible-oils/articleshow/86130193.cms||---

Her clothes had been pulled down, her face badly bruised, a tooth broken and her neck had strangulation marks when the body was found. Her family said she had been raped. An FIR, based on their complaint, has been filed. The Dalit woman had represented two big states in north India at national-level events in the past five years, basic education sports officer Arvind Ahlawat said. “My daughter wanted to help the family. So, instead of pursuing her sports career, she trained others,” She was studying physical education at a university and used to work as a sports teacher at a government school here. She lost her job in April because of the pandemic,” said her fatherm who works as a daily wager at a sugar mill. “On Friday, my daughter had gone to a private school for a job interview,” her father said. When she didn’t return for hours, her family was worried. “ Around 3pm, a neighbour said a girl was found lying close to the railway line. We rushed there and saw it was my sister,” her sister said. The area was on a desolate stretch. Used syringes and empty plastic sachets were found near the body. On Saturday, Bijnor SP Dharamvir Singh said the autopsy report didn’t find evidence of any crime other than murder. “Four police teams have been formed to probe the case,” he said. However, the victim’s sister said, “She was raped. The state of her body, with disheveled clothes and injuries, is itself evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/national-level-kho-kho-player-brutalised-left-to-die-in-up/articleshow/86130241.cms||Harveer Dabas

Rupani’s exit came after helming the state for five years and 36 days, and with just over a year to go for the assembly polls. His departure, just like his elevation to CM, was swift and decisive. BJP legislators have been summoned to Gandhinagar to elect a new leader on Sunday. Rupani’s predecessor, Anandiben Patel, the first woman CM of Gujarat, had succeeded Narendra Modi after he became Prime Minister in 2014. She quit on August 1, 2016, following the violent Patidar quota stir and the Dalit agitation that erupted after the lynching of four young men in the coastal town of Una. Unlike Anandiben’s case, Rupani’s exit was without acrimony. However, observers say that his soft-spoken demeanour and feeble hold over bureaucrats resulted in a strong undercurrent of anger among the people during the second Covid-19 wave. Certain decisions taken during the deadly wave earlier this year earned the government the wrath of even the Gujarat high court. Looking to play down the speculation over the possible reasons for his unceremonious removal, Rupani said after handing in his resignation: "I served as CM for five years. That is a long time." He added: "Change in leadership is a natural phenomenon in BJP. I have requested the leadership to give me a role in the party organisation." Read Also5 years as CM: Vijay Rupani’s celebrations turn into farewellIn an abrupt move, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani tendered his resignation on Saturday, becoming the third CM to leave the top post in a BJP-ruled state in fewer than three months. Rupani’s exit came after helming the state for five years and 36 days and with just over a year to go for theWhile the move appeared sudden, political circles had been agog with rumours of the 65-year-old Rupani’s exit for some time. Talk about a change of guard gathered steam after the resignations of B S Yediyurappa in Karnataka and Tirath Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand. The countdown to Rupani’s ouster began on Friday night with BJP national general secretary B L Santhosh visiting the CM’s bungalow in Gandhinagar to convey the party high command’s decision to replace him. On Saturday, BJP’s Gujarat in-charge, Bhupendra Yadav, also arrived and held a string of meetings in the state capital. "I thank PM Narendra Modi for giving a party worker like me an opportunity to serve the state for five years," Rupani told reporters after submitting his resignation to governor Acharya Devvrat. "I have contributed to the development of the state. I will further do whatever is asked by my party," he said. Born in Burma (now Myanmar), the RSS pracharak, who rose from the ranks — from Rajkot mayor to Gujarat CM in his 40-year political career — has the distinction of being the only BJP politician after Modi to have completed a five-year term as chief minister.

Nitin, Mandaviya, Rupala, Zadafia, Praful Patel in race for Gujarat CM postIt may be a coincidence but when CM Vijay Rupani handed over his resignation, merely hours after PM e-inaugurated the high-profile Sardardham Bhavan built by the influential Patidar community, the chatter became louder that a Patidar is set to be the next CM of Gujarat.Rupani was accompanied to Raj Bhavan by deputy CM Nitin Patel, state ministers Pradeepsinh Jadeja and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, and Union ministers Parshottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandaviya. He went to the governor’s residence after attending the inaugural function of Sardardham Bhavan in Ahmedabad, which was e-opened by Modi. Later, Rupani described the situation as a relay race for BJP workers. "One passes on the baton to another," he said. Suspense swirled over the question of Rupani’s successor as several names started doing the rounds after the sudden resignation. Deputy CM Patel, Union ministers Mandaviya and Rupala, state agriculture minister R C Faldu, former Gujarat junior home minister Gordhan Zadafia and Lakshadweep UT administrator Praful Khoda Patel were widely discussed as possible successors (all belong to the powerful Patel community). The name of Gujarat BJP chief C R Patil, who is from Maharashtra, was also doing the rounds. However, Patil was quick to debunk the speculation, saying he was not in the race. In all likelihood, the new CM will be a Patel as BJP looks to pacify its politically significant vote bank ahead of the crucial assembly polls next year.

Having taken over in the aftermath of the Patidar and Dalit uprisings, Rupani led BJP to some spectacular performances in successive elections to local bodies, the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha polls and bypolls. BJP, which had a close shave with anti-incumbency in the 2017 polls, doesn’t want to take any chances, especially when the threat of a third Covid wave looms large. Moreover, farmer anger could be stoked by deficient rains. Just one short of the 100-seat mark in 2017, BJP later engineered an influx of Congress MLAs, giving a few of them coveted ministerial berths. Congress has alleged that Rupani was removed as CM because the state government failed to perform during Covid and provide relief to the public. Bharatsinh Solanki, former Union minister, said, "We demand that Nitin Patel should also be removed as he has also failed to work in the interest of the people." "With time, the responsibilities of karyakartas change.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka to relocate 400 tribal families from Nagarahole with afforestation fund||BENGALURU: After 23 long years, the Karnataka government is set to relocate and resettle around 400 tribal families from Nagarahole tiger reserve, utilising funds earmarked for developing green cover in the state. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has directed the state to expedite the process — a first for Karnataka. Each family is expected to get facilities and benefits worth Rs 15 lakh as the state government dips into the corpus of the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). The development comes in the background of a petition submitted to Union minister for environment Bhupender Yadav recently by Siddharth Goenka, a member of the Karnataka State Wildlife Board. “We have directed the state forest authorities to submit a proposal to make use of CAMPA funds for relocation of tribal families,” SP Yadav, additional director general of forests (Project Tiger) and NTCA member secretary, said in a letter to Goenka. The voluntary resettlement of tribals in Nagarahole tiger reserve started in 1998 but so far, only 812 families have been relocated, minus the benefits they were promised. The major tribal groups within the national park are Jenukurubas, Bettakurubas, Yeravas and Soligas. PK Ramu, a tribal leader from Hunsur, said more than 3,400 tribal families voluntarily relocated from core areas of reserve forests in Mysuru and Kodagu districts after the introduction of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972. Though they were promised houses, agricultural land and other facilities, successive governments failed to deliver, due to lack of funds, he said.  “Now that NTCA has asked the state to make use of CAMPA funds, there is a silver lining in sight.” Goenka said the central government has transferred around Rs 1,300 crore from the CAMPA Fund to Karnataka for the relocation of people from the protected areas but the fund had not been utilised yet. Five other tiger reserves — Male Mahadeshwara, Bandipur and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) in Chamarajanagar district; Bhadra in Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga and Dandeli in Uttara Kannada — are in the process of submitting proposals to rehabilitate 3,000 families settled in core areas. “This effort will be a landmark achievement in delivering social justice to tribal people marooned inside tiger reserves and protected areas as they are considered a threat to wildlife because of increasing man-animal conflict, while ensuring consolidation of critical wildlife habitats,” Goenka said. Latest data shows that 153 deaths due to man-animal conflicts were reported in the state in the past four years while 581 people were injured. Thirteen people suffered permanent disability. The number of such instances was the highest in Kodagu and Hassan, and most of the victims were tribals. Between 2011 and 2020, successive governments constructed 150 houses in Shettihalli, 130 in Hebbale, 70 in Mastigudi and 280 houses in Nagapura to resettle tribals but there were not many takers due to poor facilities and benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-to-relocate-400-tribal-families-from-nagarahole-with-afforestation-fund/articleshow/86126117.cms||Manu Aiyappa

The deceased, Amit Patel (17), Mohit Sharma (18) and Abhya Sharma (19), who were from Ashoka Nagar locality in Bhopal, had gone for a picnic to the spot, which is around 30 km from the district headquarters, Kararia police station inspector Aruna Singh told PTI.

In a first for the country, drones commenced the delivery of life-saving medical supplies, including Covid-19 vaccines, beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) range, that is over a distance of 500 metres, in the district. ‘Medicine from the Sky’ is a joint initiative of the Telangana government, World Economic Forum, NITI Aayog, and HealthNet Global (Apollo Hospitals), as part of which eight consortia have been selected to undertake BVLOS flights for delivery of medical essentials to remote areas. On Saturday, Bluedart Med Express Consortium, Hepicopter Consortium, and CurisFly Consortium demonstrated drone flights. Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, Telangana IT & industries minister KT Rama Rao and Telangana education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy were part of the audience. Scindia pointed out that as part of the Digital Sky platform, drone players would be able to avail single window clearance at the click of a button. The platform will have interactive maps that will sport green (free to fly for drones), yellow (require permission) and red (prohibited) zones making it easier for drone players to chart out their trajectory. The Union minister also said that the learnings from the ‘Medicine from the Sky’ project will pave the way for drone delivery of life saving medicines and jabs in far-flung regions of the country. “In 16 green zones, drones will be flown as part of the project and the data generated will be analysed in three months to create a model for the entire country,” he said. Prem Kumar Vislawath, founder, Marut Drones, which is part of Hepicopter consortium, said the drone tech player has deployed two drones. “Hepicopter platform, with the current class of drones, can support vaccination in remote areas by transporting about 2,000-5,000 doses of vaccines at 2-8 degrees Celsius in one trip over a straight-line distance of 20-40 km,” he said, adding that a pair of drones can fly around 10 trips every day. Vikram Singh Meena, CEO & founder, TechEagle (part of CurisFly Consortium) said that its drone carried 4 kg payload and 200 doses of Covid vaccine, maintaining 2.4 degree Celsius temperature throughout the flight that covered 6.6 km in 15 mins.

Later in the day, police arrested three persons, including the victim’s adopted daughter, in the murder case. On Thursday, Cyberabad police received a complaint that Marie Christine, 68, a founder of Marica School at Dargah Khalij Khan in Gandipet, went missing on Wednesday night. During the examination of suspects based on the information given by her family members, police picked up the victim’s 24-year-old adopted daughter, Roma. On questioning her, police found that Marie was already murdered and her body was dumped in bushes at Himayatsagar. Later, police announced the arrest of Vikram Sriramulu and Rahul Gowtham along with Roma. DCP (Shamshabad) N Prakash Reddy said Marie was looking for an alliance for Roma and she even uploaded her details on a matrimonial portal. Two months ago, they came across Vikram’s profile on the portal. Without the knowledge of the victim, Roma started to stay with Vikram at Kondapur, police said. Marie did not like Vikram. When she came to know that Roma was staying with him and wanted to marry him, the victim rejected the proposal. “Roma decided to eliminate Marie and she conspired with Vikram and his friend Rahul. On the day of the murder, Roma visited the residence of Marie. Later, the victim dropped Roma at their school in Tolichowki in their car and returned to her house at Khalij Khan. By this time, the other two accused were already waiting for the victim as per plan,’’ Prakash Reddy said. Vikram and Rahul scaled the wall and got into the house and strangulated Marie to death. They stuffed the body in her car, drove it up to Himayatsagar and dumped it in a bush. They returned to her house and parked the car, police said. The accused also stole her phone and a laptop and transferred Rs 2 lakh from the victim’s account to Roma’s account. The French woman has been living in Hyderabad for the last three decades and set up a few schools in city. She also gave shelter to several orphans. Marie had two biological daughters — Marie Solange, who resides in Hyderabad, and Rebecca, who stays in Puducherry. When Roma was a month old, Marie had adopted her as she was an orphan. Her biological daughters suspected Roma’s role in the murder as she has been staying away from their mother following a dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/french-woman-killed-adopted-daughter-held/articleshow/86130711.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Judicial probe ordered into August 28 Karnal episode, farmers call off sit-in||KARNAL: The stalemate between farmer groups sitting on an indefinite dharna at the Karnal mini-secretariat and the Haryana government ended on Saturday morning after the state ordered a judicial probe into last month’s clash between protesting farmers and police, promised government jobs to two family members of a deceased farmer and sent the IAS officer at the centre of the row on leave. The farmers had started the sit-in on September 7, seeking suspension of Ayush Sinha — then Karnal SDM who had ordered the cops to hit the protesting farmers on their heads on August 28 — and a job for the kin of a farmer killed due to the lathicharge, among other demands. Ten protesters were hurt in the clash with police in Karnal on that day when they tried to march towards the site of a BJP meeting. Sinha was caught on tape purportedly telling policemen to “break the heads” of farmers if they cross the line. Announcing the agreement at a press meet, Haryana additional chief secretary (ACS) Devender Singh said the state government will set up an inquiry committee of retired high court judges to probe the entire August 28 lathicharge episode. Singh, who was assigned by the Haryana government to resolve the issue, also stated that the controversial SDM would proceed on leave for next one month. Apart from this, two family members of deceased farmer Sushil Kajal, who the farmers claimed died due to police lathicharge, “will be given government jobs on the sanctioned posts on DC rate”. Senior Haryana farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, who was present during the joint briefing on the agreement, later announced the end of the farmers’ indefinite sit-in. Charuni said, “After discussions, we have collectively decided to end our protest at the entrance of Karnal mini-secretariat. The government has accepted most of our demands. Our protest against the three contentious farm laws and BJP-JJP leaders will continue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/judicial-probe-ordered-into-august-28-karnal-episode-farmers-call-off-sit-in/articleshow/86130753.cms||---

He had just turned 80, and completed cycling 4,500kms all the way from Thrissur to the rarefied heights of Ladakh. What better way for a man who is a plumber by profession and a cyclist by passion to celebrate his birthday. Josettan, as he is fondly called by his friends, is from Athani in Thrissur. He told TOI over phone from Leh that he had cycled to a spot just 34 kms from Khardung La, which is located at 17,600 feet above sea level and is the highest motorable point allowed for civilians. He could not proceed further on Saturday from there because of unexpected snowfall. In this cycle expedition, christened ‘Wheel of Life’, Jose is accompanied by Gokul P R from Ayyanthole in Thrissur, who, incidentally, had undertaken a cycling trip from Thrissur to Khardung La in 2013 via Manali. Gokul’s wife Dr Lekha Lakshmi and their 14-year old daughter joined them from Ladakh after reaching there by flight. Jose, who retired from the Thrissur Medical College Hospital as a plumber, said he has had no major health issues during his cycling trip. “I encountered an oxygen problem when I reached Leh about nine days ago, but my fellow cyclists supported me by providing artificial supply of oxygen,” he said. “Oxygen shortage is a problem commonly encountered by all, including military personnel, on reaching Leh,” Dr Lakshmi said. Jose said he started cycling when he in class V. “Cycling is my passion, and I used to cycle for long distances in the past. But this one is obviously the longest cycling trip I’ve undertaken,” he said. He is also a regular participant in swimming and marathon competitions. Jose has won accolades for excelling in triathlon competitions as well. Wheel of Life, which was flagged off by former Kerala education minister Prof C Raveendranath from Thrissur on July 15, is being supported by all the cycle clubs of Kerala, as well SAI, Thrissur district sports council, Thrissur district Olympic Association, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangatan and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Jose’s wife and three children are ecstatic about his achievement but also a little worried for his safety. Gokul’s cousin, Ajayan, is a brigadier in the Indian Army, and through him they got extensive support from the military to pass through high security areas and tough terrains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-cycles-4500km-from-kerala-to-ladakh-to-celebrate-80th-birthday/articleshow/86131017.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Bhubaneswar||At 98.5%, Odisha’s Covid recovery rate better than national average||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha’s total recoveries went beyond 10 lakh (10,00,548) with 689 more people being cured of Covid on Saturday, pushing up the recovery percentage to 98.5, higher than national average of 97.45. The state so far has accumulated 10,15,713 cases. The recovery of Covid patients has been considerably faster than the initial phase of the second wave primarily because of two reasons. Experts said it was sluggish because of the huge caseload in the three months after the second wave announced its arrival. This apart, the new mutant variant acted as a hindrance in patients’ recovery. Earlier, the recoveries used to be far less than the daily fresh infections. Of late, it has either been equal or more than the fresh infection cunt. This, in turn, has helped bring down the total active cases in the state. Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) said, “The rate of hospitalisation of Covid patients has dropped drastically in past two months, irrespective of the number of new cases. No new mutant variant has been detected in the state. The severity of Covid-hit patients has also reduced leading to quicker recovery. This is a positive sign. But we need to stay protected as we still have a significant number of cases being reported from two coastal districts, Khurda and Cuttack. The number of cases daily has come down and we can be optimistic that recovery will be a bit faster, he observed. The state reported 630 new cases from 63817 samples registering 0.98 per cent of test positivity rate (TPR). Except Subarnapur, all the districts reported new infections with Khurda adding the highest 221. With 159244 (highest among 30 districts) people getting recovered and 1474 succumbing to the virus in Khurda has 2755 active cases now. Nuapada and Kandhamal districts have active cases in single digit, eight each. While TPR of Khurda and Cuttack went beyond 3 per cent, Sundargarhs TPR was a little over one per cent. The states overall TPR (in first and second wave together) so far remained at 5.42 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/at-98-5-states-cov-recovery-rate-better-than-national-avg/articleshow/86121543.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

"There are no victims in the attack carried out by two armed drones," said the statement. The airport, which is also the base for a coalition force of anti-jihadist troops, suffered no damage, according to its director, Ahmed Hochiar. An AFP correspondent heard two loud blasts and saw black smoke rising up into the sky and heard sirens around the US consulate. Security forces sealed off access to the airport zone, said witnesses. Attacks of this kind, normally targeting US troops or US interests in Iraq, have become common in recent months. Although no one claims responsibility for them, Washington blames pro-Iranian forces in Iraq. The use of weaponised drones is a more recent development that poses a fresh challenge to coalition forces and the US-installed C-Ram anti-missile defence systems. Booby-trapped drones were launched against Arbil international airport in July although they did not cause casualties or material damage that time, either. A few weeks earlier, three drones targeted the airport in Baghdad, where US troops are also deployed. Both Iran and the United States have a military presence and allies in Iraq. There are 2,500 American troops stationed there. This latest attack comes on the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Arbil is the capital of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, led by Kurdish President Nechirvan Barzani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/armed-drone-attack-on-arbil-airport-iraq/articleshow/86131290.cms||---

Experts at Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), which is sponsoring the whole project, expect the weathercock, which originally weighed around 100kg, to be back at its original position by the end of this month. The groundwork of setting up the scaffolding, taking measurements and arranging a chain pulley has already been done. “We are in the process of giving finishing touches to the weathercock. Work on taking it atop the spire might resume in the third week of this month,” said G M Kapur of Intach. A conservationist has been working on restoring the iconic black weathercock synonymous with the 205-year-old church since May last month in a workshop inside the church. “The cyclonic winds dislodged the weathercock and it was broken into several pieces. Only a few of them could be retrieved, which have been used to restore the weathercock,” said an official of St Andrew’s Church. The weathercock, which was black in colour, is as old as the church that was built in 1815. St Andrew’s Church has survived two world wars, the Spanish flu, several cyclones and partition of the country. “Intach is sponsoring the entire project. We have tried to restore the bird from the bits and pieces available from the neighbourhoods after the cyclone blew away the weathercock,” said Kapur. The estimated cost could be over Rs 10 lakh. The restoration work slowed down after the second Covid wave when several restrictions were imposed. Scaffoldings were set up a few months ago but the challenge was to access the original position on the top and take the measurements. “But all that work is complete now and we are waiting for the green signal from the person restoring the bird. He is in the process of giving finishing touches,” said Kapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-problem-how-to-put-restored-weathercock-back-atop-st-andrews-steeple/articleshow/86126160.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Officials of the Patna Metro Rail Corporation (PMRC) have cited various reasons for slow pace of work, including delay in land acquisition, non-availability of funds and the Covid-19 pandemic. The construction work on the first phase of the project was initiated in September last year. The 6.6-km long elevated metro line (priority corridor) will have five stations from Malahi Pakri to Patliputra ISBT via Khemni Chak and Zero Mile. It also includes a viaduct leading to the ISBT metro rail depot, as well as a small rake-interchange viaduct at Khemni Chak to connect Corridor I. The piling work is on in this priority corridor to install pillars in order to lay tracks. It is likely to be ready by 2023. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 553 crore. The total length of Corridor II is 14.5km, including an underground stretch of 7.9km from Patna Junction to Rajendra Nagar. A PMRC official said all the hurdles would end if they get the required land, 76 acres in total, for construction of ISBT depot at Ranipur and Pahadi area and also for metro stations and tracks at other places. “We will get funds from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) once we get the land for depot and other infrastructure. The JICA will contribute 60% of the total cost of the metro rail project as a loan while 20% of its cost will be borne by Centre and the state each,” the official added. The state government has sanctioned around Rs 1,000 crore to the Patna district administration to acquire land for the metro depot. District land acquisition officer Pramod Kumar said assessment report of the plot has been sent to the state government. “Once it is cleared, notification for land acquisition will be issued. It will take around 90 days to complete the procedure,” he said. According to the officials, work on construction of metro tunnel, tracks and stations has not started yet due to unavailability of funds. “The Covid pandemic has also impacted the progress,” they added. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, the technical consultant for the PMRC project, has been awarded the work for construction of twin tunnels, underground ramp and six underground stations as part of Corridor II, but the work has not started yet. Around Rs 1,958 crore is required for the underground stations and it will be ready in 42 months after the commencement of work. The Corridor I will be 17.9-km-long from Danapur to Khemnichack via Meethapur – 7.3km elevated and 10.5km underground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/land-acquisition-still-a-major-hurdle-for-metro-rail-project/articleshow/86124478.cms||Faryal Rumi

The minister told TOI that 395 children suffering from flu have so far been admitted to different government health facilities in the state this month and 13 of them have died. “While 295 children have recovered, 87 are still undergoing treatment. None of these children has so far been tested positive for Covid-19,” he added. The minister said though the cases were increasing in the first week of this month, they started decreasing from September 7 onwards. “I had visited the paediatric ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital and interacted with the paediatricians. According to them, this flu is common among children in August and September because of humid weather conditions,” Pandey told TOI over the phone. Advising parents not to get panicky, Pandey said most children recover in five days. “Chief minister Nitish Kumar also enquired about flu cases at a meeting on Saturday. Even though the cases are decreasing, the CM has instructed the health officials to remain alert. Hospitals have been asked to keep medicines ready in sufficient quantity,” Pandey said. State health department additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit said all the district magistrates have been asked to prepare a daily report about such cases and monitor the situation properly. Swine flu cases worry health dept: At a time when viral fever cases among children are on the rise in the state, emergence of swine flu cases has further worried the health department. Three swine flu cases have so far been detected at a private hospital in the city. Two of the patients have already recovered and discharged from the hospital. The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Asif Rahman, said while the two cases were detected last month, the third patient, who is from Samastipur, was admitted to the facility earlier this week. He said no patient has so far died at the hospital due to swine flu. “A patient had died due to influenza A. He also had underlying conditions. Influenza A, B and swine flu are different diseases with similar symptoms,” Dr Rahman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/87-children-with-viral-fever-being-treated-in-state-minister/articleshow/86124447.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The indefinite strike, which entered the fifth day on Saturday, was launched by the municipal workers in support of their multiple demands, including regularisation of service and pay parity. The Bihar Local Bodies Employees Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha, an association of fourth-grade employees of ULBs, has been leading the agitation. President of the association, Chandra Prakash Singh, and other representatives met principal secretary of UDHD Anand Kishor, special secretary Satish Kumar Singh and Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Himanshu Sharma. Kishor said he has appealed to the union leaders to call off the strike without any delay. “On the request of the union leaders, a three-member committee has been constituted to resolve the issue. Special secretary-cum- director of municipal administration Satish Kumar Singh, PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma and deputy director Buddha Prakash are members of the committee. Talks with the union leaders will be held on Sunday as well,” he said. Chandra, also the president of PMC Staff Union, said the officials requested the workers to return to work and promised that their demands would be fulfilled in 10 days. “However, we will not call off the strike this based on the officials’ words. We need a written assurance. We had informed the government about the strike 15 days beforehand, but nothing was done,” Chandra added. He said Kishor agreed to accept some of the association’s demands but remained non-committal on regularisation of service and pay parity. “Kishor told us that only the finance department can take a call on these two issues and that the UDHD will send it a proposal in this regard soon,” Chandra said. Major parts of the city were in a mess due to the strike. Animal carcases and heap of garbage could be found lying on the roads in almost all localities amid Covid fears. Ranjeet Kumar, a resident of Dargah Road, said garbage was not being lifted from the locality for the last six days. “Foul smell is emanating in the locality as people have started burning the garbage. The state government should do something to end the mess,” he said. Deepak Kumar from Adarsh Nagar locality said he has complained about the pathetic situation to the officials concerned, but to no avail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ulb-workers-continue-stir-as-talks-fail/articleshow/86124642.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Ahmedabad||Patidar playbook: Entrepreneurial spirit, support to kin to survive and flourish in foreign lands||AHMEDABAD: While outward migration is common in many states, Patidars from Gujarat and Jats from Punjab made a distinct mark with large and sustained migration across the globe, notably to the UK, the US, Canada and Australia. What factors drove these two agrarian communities to migration? What are the similarities and differences between their life as immigrants? These questions formed the crux of studies carried out by Prof Gurpreet Bal from Guru Nanak Dev University. “We find that they share similar traits – both communities are land-holders, socially and economically influential. Historic reasons have forced or motivated them to migrate to other countries across the globe,” she said. What made them successful immigrants? The study highlights entrepreneurial spirit as the first and foremost condition. ‘…the Patidars have shown tremendous business acumen. They are best known for their entrepreneurship. In the US, the Gujaratis have dominated in the motel business in particular. In New York they have captured the newspaper stand business. We do not come across any Gujarati Patidars who have started farming in the US, but Jat Sikhs in Yuba City are mainly farmers’, mentions the study. “We find that the close family ties also played a major role in their success. We observed several instances where Patels help family and friends in acquiring new motels financially. While it’s a factor in all immigration stories, it was more so for Patidars, many of them leaving Africa for the UK or the US,” she said. What makes the two communities more successful is also the willingness of the entire families to work. “It’s not uncommon for the women of these communities to help their families to stay afloat and start working on the second day of their arrival,” said Prof Bal. “Of course, like all other immigrants, the stories are not the same for the subsequent generations – now youth from both communities are highly educated and prefer professions.” The immigration trends are changing for the past two decades as the new immigrants are skilled professionals. The lure of foreign shores is still intact, said experts, as the youths take the foreign university route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patidar-playbook-entrepreneurial-spirit-support-to-kin-to-survive-and-flourish-in-foreign-lands/articleshow/86128580.cms||Parth Shastri

He has also urged the CM to declare birth and death anniversaries of the two leaders as state functions. The letter, written on September 10, was uploaded to Tejashwi’s social media account on Saturday. Tejashwi also reminded Nitish of the letters which Raghuvansh had written to him (Nitish) just before his death raising certain demands. “I have faith that you will initiate the process to fulfil his demands. It will be the right way to pay tribute to him,” the letter read. Tejashwi said Ram Vilas Paswan had always worked for social justice and upliftment of the poor. Raghuvansh had written three letters to Nitish just before his death demanding an ordinance for amendment of MGNREGA, hoisting of the national flag on the occasion of Republic Day at Vaishali Garh and bringing back ‘bhiksha patra (alms bowl)’ of Lord Buddha from Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/install-life-size-statues-of-raghuvansh-rvp-tejashwi/articleshow/86124465.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The students will be promoted on the basis of internal assessment and their previous year marks. The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by the science and technology minister Sumit Kumar Singh. Singh said students studying in first semester will be promoted based on their performances in internal assessment. “A 100% weightage will be given to internal performance of first-semester students of polytechnic. Fifty per cent weightage will be given to the internal assessment of students of other semesters, while the remaining 50% will be based on the marks secured by them in their previous year examinations,” he added. The minister said students having compartment or backlog (failed) in any subject of the earlier semester will have to clear that paper in the future, whenever the physical examination will be conducted by the SBTE. “If a student wants to improve his/her grade, he/she will be given an opportunity. A special examination will be conducted in the next semester,” Singh said. The state government runs three-year diploma courses in technical education through a number affiliated polytechnics. There are 44 affiliated polytechnics in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/polytechnic-diploma-courses-semester-exams-cancelled-amid-pandemic/articleshow/86124360.cms||Faryal Rumi

Singh added PM Narendra Modi was working hard for all-round development of the country with “sabka saath, sabaka Vikash” slogan. “However, some vested interests are trying to divide the society and the country,” he said. Singh said opposition parties like the RJD and Congress talk about Hindu-Muslim only to secure votes. “The BJP is the only party which is implementing flagship schemes for employment for boys and girls of the minority community,” he said Tufail Ahamad Qadari, state president of BJP’s minority wing, said the PM was working for prosperity and well-being of all segments of the society “The Muslim community is keen to be equal partner in the making of new India,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/owaisi-a-virus-trying-to-divide-country-bjp-neta/articleshow/86124547.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

The outgoing CM solved the city’s two biggest problems — water scarcity and traffic snarls — with work on eight overbridges and underpasses going on currently. He provided Narmada water under the SAUNI scheme freehandedly. “It was his standing instruction that there should not be a water crisis in the city. Whenever we have demanded we get water. This is a tough year and now we fear the water crisis in peak summer,” a senior officer of RMC told TOI. The business and industry community is, however, still processing the shock of his sudden exit. For the entire community — from businessmen, to industrialists or professionals and BJP workers — ‘Vijaybhai’ as he was popularly addressed as, was just a phone call away. According to the senior officials of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) and Rajkot Urban Development Corporation (RUDA), all files got cleared within just 24 hours. All town planning schemes of RMC and RUDA which were pending since 1995 got cleared and currently there is no backlog in the TP schemes. Of the major developments was the construction of eight flyovers and underpasses aimed at clearing the traffic bottlenecks that made commuting a huge hassle in the city. The biggest traffic headache points included civil hospital bridge, KKV double decker bridge, A G chowk, Ramapir chokdi, Nana Mauva chowk bridges are under construction by RMC. Laximnagar underpass is being constructed by the railways while Madhapar chokdi is under construction by the state government. Rupani had inaugurated Amrapali and Railnagar underbridges during his tenure. Almost 50% work on the second Ring Road has been completed under Rupani’s tenure which will help remove a major chunk of the city’s traffic problem. The new Racecourse on Ring Road-2 and deepening of the Atal Sarovar was Rupani’s idea. He also approved two satellite GSRTC bus depots in principle — one at Madhapar and other on Bhavnagar road — looking at the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/vijaybhai-returned-rajkots-love-with-growth/articleshow/86127249.cms||---

The doctor attributed the slow pace of liver transplantation at the IGIMS to its high cost (Rs 10 lakh) and a lack of donors. He, however, pointed out that the cost was almost double at private health facilities in the country. Data shared by the IGIMS stated that at least 200 people of Bihar needed immediate liver transplantation, but they could not afford to pay Rs 10 lakh to the hospital authorities. “If the state government comes forward and bears the expenses, a large number of lives will be saved,” Dr Mandal suggested. According to sources, only a part of a donor’s liver is surgically removed during transplantation. As a result, his/her health remains unaffected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-now-has-liver-transplantation-opd/articleshow/86124674.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Hubballi||BJP reaching out to Independents to bag deputy mayor’s post||Hubballi: The BJP, set to stake claim to power in the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council for the third time in a row, is facing a strange predicament this year – the saffron party does not have a woman corporator from the Scheduled Caste (SC) community to occupy the deputy mayor’s post. The BJP has been in power in the HDMC Council since 2007, and in the recently concluded polls to the twin cities’ civic body, the saffron party, while emerged as the single largest party, failed to obtain a clear majority in the 82-member body. The BJP secured 39 seats, with the Congress securing 33. The party needs to secure the support of three other corporators to cross the halfway mark, and reach the magic number, which is 42. The BJP, however, is not overly worried about returning to power in the council, since the party boasts three MLAs, two MLCs and one MP, all of whom can vote in the mayoral polls, and ensure the saffron party bags the top post. While the government has reserved the mayor’s post in the HDMC Council for a candidate from backward class ‘A’ category, the deputy mayor’s post has been reserved for a SC woman. Although the BJP has two to three corporators from OBC ‘A’ category vying for the mayor’s post, the party does not have an eligible candidate for the deputy mayor’s post. The local BJP leaders are wooing two Independent who triumphed in the polls, and fit the bill for the deputy mayor’s post – Chandrika Mestri, a Congress rebel who won the election to ward 56, and Durgamma Bijawad, a BJP rebel elected from ward 69. BJP sources said that the party leadership in the twin cities are trying to convince Durgamma to extend support to the BJP, and occupy the deputy mayor’s post. Karnataka BJP general secretary Mahesh Tenginkai told TOI, “With the support of MLAs, MLCs and MP, we have crossed the halfway mark to come to power in the HDMC Council. Although we do not have women SC corporators, one can rest assured that the BJP will come to power and occupy both the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts.” MLC Pradeep Shettar said that the party would finalise its candidates for the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts soon. “We are talking to Independent candidates to seek their support to secure the deputy mayor’s post,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-reaching-out-to-independents-to-bag-deputy-mayors-post/articleshow/86124327.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

The man in the viral video was identified as Akbar Basha. According to Basha, one Tirupal Reddy had grabbed his 1.5 acres of land. When Basha tried to lodge a complaint with Mydukuru police, the inspector Konda Reddy allegedly threatened and abused him. “I have two daughters and have no other way of livelihood. If the chief minister doesn’t do justice to me within two days, I have no option but to commit suicide along with my family members,” Basha said in the video. The chief minister’s office took cognisance of the video and ordered the district SP to visit Basha’s house and ensure protection is granted.

The deceased was identified as Mekala Venkaiah (37). According to Dachepalli police, the incident came to light in the morning when villagers noticed his body on the field. Upon information, police reached the spot and examined the scene. Police said they found an insecticide bottle next to Venkaiah’s body. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Venkaiah had accumulated several lakhs in debt over the last couple of years. Owing to pressure from moneylenders and poor crop yield, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, Venkaiah was unable to pay back the amount he had borrowed. The body was sent to Guntur Government General Hospital for postmortem. A case under section 174 of CrPC was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/debt-ridden-tenant-farmer-ends-life/articleshow/86124112.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar: Several netas, others to attend first death anniversary of Ram Vilas today||PATNA: All eyes are set on the first death anniversary of former Union minister and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan being organised by his son and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan here on Sunday. The event assumed significance in the wake of tussle in the LJP to prove the political heir of the Dalit stalwart. Chirag’s uncle and Union food processing industries minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, who had earlier led the coup in the LJP, said he would certainly be present on the occasion. Paras reached Patna from Delhi on Saturday evening and held a brief meeting with the functionaries of the Dalit Sena at the party office here. According to sources in the party, Paras will leave for the S K Puri residence of late Paswan around 1pm to pay tributes to the departed leader. Though Chirag had mentioned the names of his three cousins – Krishna Raj, Prince Raj (both sons of late Ram Chandra Paswan) and Yash Raj (son of Paras) – in the invitation card, it is still not clear whether the trio will attend the event or not. Prince Raj, the MP from Samastipur, is also the state chief of the LJP’s Paras faction. Chirag’s family members, including Reena Paswan, reached Patna from Delhi on Tuesday. It would be the first time when all members of senior Paswan’s extended family will gather in Patna after the coup in the party. Sanjay Paswan, a close aide of Chirag, said, “All the guests whom Chirag Paswanji has invited have given their consent to attend the event.” Another leader said Paras would receive the guests on behalf of the Paswans. Political observers feel that Chirag would try to give a message of reunion of the Paswans at the event. Even Paras had said it was a family affair and everybody in the Paswan family is supposed to be present. Paras, however, said he would organize another event on October 8 to mark the first death anniversary of Ram Vilas. “This is an indication that the three cousins of Chirag will also attend the function,” a political observer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-paswan-set-to-welcome-guests-at-dads-1st-death-anniv-today/articleshow/86124406.cms||Ramashankar
---||Ahmedabad||5 years as CM: Vijay Rupani’s celebrations turn into farewell||GANDHINAGAR: In an abrupt move, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani tendered his resignation on Saturday, becoming the third CM to leave the top post in a BJP-ruled state in fewer than three months. Rupani’s exit came after helming the state for five years and 36 days and with just over a year to go for the assembly polls. Rupani’s departure — just like his elevation as the CM — was both swift and decisive. BJP legislators have been summoned to Gandhinagar to elect a new leader on Sunday. Rupani’s predecessor Anandiben Patel, the first woman CM of Gujarat, had succeeded Narendra Modi after he became the Prime Minister in 2014. She quit on August 1, 2016, and her exit followed the violent Patidar quota stir and the Dalit agitation that erupted after the lynching of four young men in the coastal town of Una. Unlike Anandiben’s case, Rupani’s exit was without any acrimony. However, observers say that his soft-spoken demeanor and feeble sway over bureaucrats resulted in a strong undercurrent of anger among people during the second Covid-19 wave. Certain decisions taken during the deadly wave earlier this year earned the government the wrath of even the Gujarat high court. Looking to play down the speculation over the possible reasons for his rather unceremonious removal, Rupani said after his resignation: “I served as a CM for five years. That is a long time.” He went on to say: “Change in leadership is a natural phenomenon in the BJP. I have requested the leadership to give me a role in the party organization.” While the move appeared sudden, political circles had been agog with rumours of the 65-year-old Rupani’s exit for some time. The talk about ‘change of guard’ gathered further steam after the resignations of B S Yediyurappa in Karnataka and T S Rawat in Uttarakhand. The countdown to Rupani’s ouster began on Friday night with BJP national general secretary B L Santhosh visiting CM bungalow in Gandhinagar to convey the party high command’s decision to replace him. On Saturday, BJP Gujarat in-charge Bhupendra Yadav also arrived and held a string of meetings in the state capital. “I thank PM Narendra Modi for giving a party worker like me an opportunity to serve the state for five years,” Rupani told reporters after submitting his resignation to governor Acharya Devvrat. Rupani then said: “I have contributed to the development of the state. I will further do whatever is asked by my party.” The Burma-born RSS pracharak, who rose from the ranks — from Rajkot mayor to Gujarat CM in his 40-year political career — has the distinction of being the only BJP leader after Modi to have completed a five-year term as the CM. Rupani was accompanied by deputy CM Nitin Patel, state ministers Pradeepsinh Jadeja and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, and Union ministers Parshottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandaviya to Raj Bhavan. Rupani went to the governor’s residence after attending the inaugural function of Sardardham Bhavan in Ahmedabad which was e-opened by Modi. Later, Rupani described the situation as a relay race for BJP workers. “One passes on the baton to another,” he said. Suspense swirled over the question of Rupani’s successor as several names started doing the rounds after the sudden resignation. The names of deputy CM Patel, Union ministers Mandaviya and Rupala, former Gujarat minister of state for home Gordhan Zadafia, Lakshadweep UT administrator Praful Patel and state agriculture minister R C Faldu were widely discussed as possible successors – all belong to the powerful Patel community. In all likelihood, the new chief minister will be a Patel, as the BJP looks to pacify its politically significant votebank ahead of the crucial assembly polls next year. The name of Gujarat BJP chief C R Paatil, who is of Maharashtra origin, was also doing the rounds. However, Patil was quick to debunk the speculation, saying he was not in the race. While Rupani’s government came under fire from the high court over its handling of the Covid-19 crisis, his stint as the CM was largely peaceful, unmarred by any major controversy. Having taken over in the aftermath of the Patidar and Dalit uprisings, Rupani led the BJP to some spectacular performances in successive elections to local bodies, the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and bypolls. The BJP, which had a close shave with anti-incumbency in the 2017 polls, doesn’t want to take any chances, especially when the threat of the third Covid wave looms large. Moreover, farmers’ anger could be stoked by deficient rains. Just one short of the 100-seat mark then, the BJP later engineered an influx of Congress MLAs, giving a few of them coveted ministerial berths. The Congress has alleged that Rupani was removed because the state government failed to perform during Covid pandemic and provide relief to the public. Bharatsinh Solanki, former Union minister and Congress leader, said, “Rupani failed to provide relief during Covid and we demand Nitin Patel should also be removed as he has also failed to work in the interest of the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5-years-as-cm-vijay-rupanis-celebrations-turn-into-farewell/articleshow/86128495.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Vadodara city getting closer to 100% 1st dose coverage||VADODARA: If the official records are an indication, the city is nearing 100% coverage of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. But the data seems to be far away from the number of adults in the city if one were to consider the voters’ lists. Sources in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that according to the official estimates handed over to them by the state government for vaccination before the process started, 13,15,477 persons were eligible for the jab. But the latest data of voters for the civic polls reveals that there are 14,46,212 voters for the VMC polls. Going by the official data, 97.62% of the eligible population has been vaccinated with one dose and 50.33% has got both the shots. But according to voters’ lists, 88.79% persons have taken the first jab and 45.78% have taken both the shots. These figures, however, are being seen as estimates and not exact numbers by the officials. Sources said that the electoral rolls and the data of persons eligible for vaccine were drawn at different times. They further said that in areas that were added to VMC limits just before the polls, there were many who took vaccines at the Primary Health Centres (PHC) of the district panchayat. Their data was not included in the VMC numbers even if they were now municipal corporation voters. With a person allowed to take vaccines at any centre, many staying within the VMC limits took vaccines at the district panchayat PHCs as the rush there was less. At the  other end, since the PHCs were not giving vaccines to persons between 18-44 years of age, many rural residents from this age group came to VMC Health Centres to get vaccinated. VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said that it was difficult to arrive at an exact number of eligible persons. “Some differences will remain, but it is a fact that vaccination has been progressing well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-city-getting-closer-to-100-1st-dose-coverage/articleshow/86126395.cms||---

Around 9.30am, two BEML-make rakes were mounted on the tracks for the two-day tests to check signalling features like separation of trains, parallel train runs and high and slow speed movement. East-West Metro now runs truncated 7km services between Sector V and Phoolbagan. The first trial run covering another 2.3km — from Phoolbagan to Sealdah station — was conducted on July 31, followed by many such single-train tests over the last one month. On Saturday, two trains were run for the first time, as part of the integrated trials that are a prerequisite for getting mandatory clearance from the Independent Safety Assessor (ISA), after which Metro Railway can apply to the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) for its safety nod. Train movement in East-West Metro is guided by a signalling system that uses telecommunication, which is capable of running trains at two-and-ahalf minute intervals. This is different from the north-south line where the signalling is controlled manually and trains run at five-minute frequencies. The minimum distance between two trains in East-West Metro should be 40m. If a train gets stuck, the one behind it stops automatically, guided by the monitoring mechanism from the operations control centre (OCC) at Salt Lake’s City Centre depot. “The trains pick up the signal from the track. As the previous train moves, the track behind it becomes available for the next one to move, keeping a safe distance (40m) between the two. All these features are being checked now,” explained an engineer. Metro Railway is currently chasing a year-end commissioning deadline to connect Sealdah. It’s only with this addition that Kolkata’s Line 2 will become meaningful, making use of the Sealdah suburban railway hub that would register 8 to 10 lakh daily commuter count in normal times. “In the post-Covid scenario, at least 40,000 people should avail this corridor because they would be ferried all the way to Sector V from Sealdah,” a Metro official said. In fact, Sealdah station is the only among the seven operational East-West stations to boast a double-discharge platform. Considering the heavy passenger load, there are eight staircases, 30 ticket counters, 18 escalators, five lifts, four platforms and five non-public access points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/multiple-train-trials-for-e-w-sealdah-stretch/articleshow/86126009.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Most victims are from Vizianagaram district and remote areas. In most cases, farmers are victims. The tribal and rural pockets are home to poisonous snakes such as cobra, king cobra, Russell’s viper, saw-scaled viper, common krait and banded krait. Doctors say that the region reports more than 400 snakebite deaths and over 2,000 bite cases in a year. Absence of hospitals in the vicinity, poor road connectivity and the lack of anti-venom at some locations are the major reasons for the increase in casualties. However, the medical and health department has said primary health care centres in the region are equipped with anti-snake venom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/snake-bites-rise-in-north-ap-most-victims-farmers/articleshow/86123960.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||PIL challenges sale of AP govt’s stake in Gannavaram port||VIJAYAWADA: A PIL has been filed before the AP high court challenging the state government’s stake sale in Gangavaram port and the approval given for acquisition of majority stake in Krishnapatnam port by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) Limited. Satya Bhupal Reddy Vaiza and Bontha Poorna Chandra Reddy from Prakasam district moved the PIL alleging that the state government did not follow due procedure in selling its minority stake in Gangavaram port. They also contended the approval given by the government for acquisition of controlling stake and merger of Krishnapatnam port in APSEZ. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, advocate Gudapati Venkateswara Rao told the HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the state government did not follow competitive bidding process in selling its 10 per cent stake in Gangavaram port. He said there was no information available in public domain as to how the stake sale process took place between the state government and the APSEZ other than a regulatory filing done by the latter, regarding the acquisition of the state government’s stake in Gangavaram port. He further argued that the sale of valuable public property was not done according to the norms, as it is mandatory to get the approval of AP Maritime Board before the transfer of shares between the two parties. It is also not known as to how the price was derived for the government stake as it is too low when compared to the market value of the lands and when compared to the amount spent on land acquisition by the government, he said. The petitioners said the value of the 10 per cent government stake would be around Rs 9,000 crore if the present market value of the land is taken into account, but the same is being sold at Rs 640 crore only, which would be a huge loss to the public exchequer. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said the two transactions with regard to Gangavaram and Krishnapatnam ports are different and are not connected with each other. He said the state government has constituted a high-level committee after taking a decision to disinvest its stake in Gangavaram port. The entire transaction was done according to norms, he added, and sought time to submit all records to the court. Considering the request, the high court posted the matter for further hearing to September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-challenges-sale-of-govts-stake-in-gannavaram-port/articleshow/86124015.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Lotus leaf carry bags save costs, environment||VIJAYAWADA: While civic associations are taking up large-scale efforts to prohibit the use of plastic, rural areas of Krishna district are focusing on alternatives. Sellers in rural areas have stopped the use of plastic carry bags and replaced them with lotus leaves, an initiative that saves expenses and is environment-friendly. The popularity of single use plastic in replacing more traditional packing materials such as dried leaves can be attributed to their easy availability and durability. But recent campaigns up by panchayat and district administrations have shown positive results. After explaining the harmful impact of plastic bags on the environment and on heath, residents of rural areas were motivated to take up healthier alternatives. “We used to sell meat in black plastic bags. They are convenient to carry and also tougher in nature. With the directions of local authorities we stopped using plastic bags and started using lotus leaves. The public initially resisted carrying meat in lotus leaves. After explaining the harmful impact of plastic bags, they now prefer lotus leaves. We are happy that we are a part of this change,” said Md Gousuddin, a meat trader from Mudinepalli of Krishna district. Eateries, right from tiffin centres to restaurants, are now widely using the more affordable lotus leaves to serve food. Meanwhile, making bags of lotus leaves is also creating employment. Around 200 families in the eastern Krishna region depend on plucking lotus leaves. Jali Srinu, who was plucking lotus leaves by a pond at Pedapalaparru near Gudivada, said, “Ponds are filled with lotus leaves and there is a huge demand for them. I used to work as an agricultural labourer but have now started plucking lotus leaves and selling them at markets in Kaikaluru, Gudivada, Vuyyuru and Mudinepalli. I’m earning around Rs 600 per day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lotus-leaf-carry-bags-save-costs-environment/articleshow/86124824.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Kolkata||JU to hire profs in chem, geology, Bengali depts||Kolkata: Jadavpur University is going to fill up vacancies for professors in many departments, the notification for which has already been issued. Officials said that this will help the university improve its faculty-student ratio, a key parameter for NIRF ranking in which it slid from the fifth position last year to eighth position this year. The departments in which the university is hiring are chemistry, geology and Bengali along with assistant controller of examinations and micro-analyst. The university is going to hire one person in the position of professor in chemistry department and three persons in geological sciences. There are six posts of associate professor in chemistry and five posts in geological sciences. Nine posts of assistant professors in chemistry and four in geological sciences. In the Bengali department, too, there are multiple posts of professor, associate professor and assistant professor. Post of assistant controller of examinations will also be filled up. “This will improve the teacher-student ratio in the university to a large extent. In many departments there are vacant posts of professors. In major national rankings this ratio is very important,” said a professor of the university. The university has scored 15.74 out of 30 on faculty student ratio this year compared to 19.11 last year. On the other hand, Calcutta University has scored 24.21 and made it to number four in the NIRF rankings this year. Similarly, JU has scored 12.57 for faculty with PhD (or equivalent) and experience this year compared to 16.02 scored by Calcutta University. The university wanted to fill up the vacant posts in several departments earlier this year but had to postpone due to the assembly elections in the state. In January this year central government held back a big chunk of a Rs 100 crore grant under Rashtra Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) and one of the reasons given was that several teaching posts were lying vacant. The university was forced to put on hold several projects related to research, scholarships and stipends due to funds crunch. The university has however scored very well on peer perception, scoring 67.31 which is almost 20 points over Calcutta University’s score. “In any national ranking involving top institutes the teacher-student ratio is very important,” said a senior official of the university.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-to-hire-profs-in-chem-geology-bengali-depts/articleshow/86126123.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara launched the initiative, which is being carried out jointly by the Aram Foundation Charitable Trust and Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited. Social workers would contact students and parents over phone to get their responses on how the pandemic changed their lives and difficulties they face, and suggest suitable solutions. “We want to understand how children’s lives have changed in the last one and a half years. There is a possibility of child labour, child marriage, loss of interest in education due to economic reasons apart from behavioural and mental health issues. We want to contact all corporation school students to learn how to help them and how to handle children during the pandemic,” the commissioner said. The initiative will also help 10,000 school students of 30 selected government schools, said Latha Sundaram, managing trustee of Aram Foundation. “The survey will be completed in another one month and a report would be submitted to the commissioner,” she said. “We have avoided direct questions as students and parents may not be willing to share private information. Social workers have been trained to collect information to get the real picture.” “Children who face challenges will get individual attention from resource persons. The resource team will consist of psychologists, psychiatrists, motivators, doctors, counsellors, guides and career counsellors. The main objective of the exercise is to improve confidence of children and to prevent them from dropping out of schools,” Latha said. “Issues identified would be solved. If a child could not concentrate on studies due to financial issues like job loss of parents, employment will be arranged. Similarly, if children could not attend online classes due to unavailability of gadgets, we will come up with a solution to address it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mental-health-wellness-drive-for-corpn-school-students/articleshow/86128236.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dharmesh Kumar, a resident of Niranjanpur, told TOI, “The potholes have turned into craters but are still not being repaired. The heavy rainfall in the past few days and the consequent inundation of these potholes have made commuters more vulnerable to accidents.” Echoing a similar sentiment, a commuter at ISBT said, “The pathetic condition of roads at ISBT is pretty evident but the officials are probably waiting for a major mishappening before repairing it. Not just bikers, even car owners fear the potholes on the stretch.” On Thursday night, a car with two persons on board fell into a Rispana drain in the Kargi area as debris came on the road at Thano after incessant rainfall. Pradeep Rana, station in-charge of Prem Nagar police station, told TOI that the driver lost control over the vehicle and the car fell into the river. An Aamwala resident, Naman Pratap, lost his life in the accident. Meanwhile, Dehradun district magistrate, R Rajesh Kumar, has instructed Smart City officials and other civic bodies to make sure that the potholes are not left open as the rainwater accumulated in them can become a breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rainfall-causes-havoc-in-several-parts-of-dehradun/articleshow/86124467.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Skyroot Aerospace has, therefore, become the first Indian startup to formally enter into an agreement with Isro for using its assets since the announcement of the new policy decision of the Modi government in May last year when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened up the space sector and Isro facilities for private players. Read AlsoFirefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket explodes during debut launchWASHINGTON: Texas-based Firefly Aerospace's first Alpha rocket exploded mid-air after a successful launch, media reports said. Firefly's Alpha rocket launched on the company's first-ever orbital test flight on September 2, lifting off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 9.59 p.m. EDT.Isro’s scientific secretary and chairman of interim IN-SPACe committee R Umamaheswaran, who represented DoS, and Skyroot Aerospace CEO Pawan Chandana signed a framework MoU on Saturday. During the signing of the MoU, Skyroot representatives met Isro chairman K Sivan and presented the status of their space activities. Sivan assured all support to the Skyroot team for successfully realising its launch vehicle programme. Talking to TOI, the Isro chairman said, “Two companies — Agnikul and Skyroot Aerospace — are working on small rockets and have therefore approached us for using our facilities for launching their vehicles. We have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), first with Agnikul and then Skyroot Aerospace. NDA is signed before we expose our facilities and technical expertise to a company. Once an NDA is signed, then only we can allow a company to visit our facilities. Once the company has visited our facilities and interacted with Isro officials, we then sign a framework MoU with it. Skyroot is, therefore, the first company with whom we have signed the MoU. Agnikul is also expected to sign the MoU very soon.” The MoU will enable Skyroot to undertake multiple tests and access facilities of various Isro centres and help it avail of technical expertise of the space agency for testing and qualifying their space launch vehicle systems and subsystems, an Isro statement said. Skyroot Aerospace has been developing its first launch vehicle Vikram-I, which is on track for an expected launch next year. In August 2020, the company came to the limelight when it test-fired the Raman-I hypergolic-fuel upper stage (named after C V Raman). This solid-fuel upper stage is a component of Vikram-I and Skyroot Aerospace was the first desi private entity to test such a stage. On December 22, 2020, Skyroot Aerospace tested the solid-fuel rocket engine Kalam-5, the first of five planned carbon-composite Kalam rocket motors that are expected to power its launch vehicles. Skyroot Aerospace was formed in January 2017 by former Isro scientists Pawan Kumar Chandana, Naga Bharath Daka and Vasudevan Gnanagandhi as well as a small group of entrepreneurs, including CureFit founders Mukesh Bansal and Ankit Nagor. The company has raised $11 million in its series A round of funding. This is nearly 10 times the $1.5 million the rocket building entrepreneurs, Chandana and Daka, had raised in 2018. Recently, Daka, co-founder and COO of Skyroot Aerospace, said, “We intend to raise $40 million more to fund our aggressive growth plans over the next few years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/space-tech-firm-skyroot-inks-pact-to-use-isro-facilities/articleshow/86129915.cms||Surendra Singh
---||Coimbatore||Avinashi Rd hit-and-run case: Kalapatti resident detained||Coimbatore: A 36-year-old man was detained on Saturday night in connection with a hit and run case in which an elderly woman, who was crossing Avinashi Road near Chinniyampalayam, was killed in the early hours of September 6. Earlier, CCTV footage of the woman’s dead body, which was run over by a few vehicles, had gone viral on social media. While police have traced the car involved in the incident after five days of intensive investigation, they are yet to trace the identity of the deceased woman. Police identified the secured person as Faizal, 36, son of Mohammed Ismail, of Indira Nagar 2nd Street near Nehru Nagar at Kalapatti in the city. Faizal’s mother, police said, was residing in Trichy city. A police officer said, “On September 5, Faizal, his wife and elder brother Sheik Mujibur Rahman had gone to Trichy to meet his mother in a multipurpose vehicle (MPV). While returning home on September 6, an elderly woman suddenly crossed the road when they neared a tyre shop at Chinniampalayam. The MPV hit the elderly woman, killing her on the spot. While her sari was caught in the vehicle, the body was detached from the MPV soon.” Faizal, the officer said, had told them that he had checked the car when his wife and elder brother asked him to stop the vehicle after hitting the woman. “He told us that he hadn’t seen anything. Later, he left the car in a mechanic shop at Pattanam near Sulur, where the mechanic found the sari that was rolled near the car’s wheel. We have seized the car and the sari.” It is to be noted that Faizal hadn’t approached police after the mechanic recovered the sari from his vehicle.

In a statement on Saturday, Mira Bhattacharjee said Ira was born in an ‘aristocratic family and was educated and talented’. “She has been a teacher at Kharda Priyanath Girls’ School and has her own house at Salt Lake, She has no financial constraints and can return to her home if she wishes. She has been living on the streets for some unknown reason. Any adult, I believe, has the right to do it. She has never listened to anyone in the family and has lived according to her own wishes.

The district administration has asked malls, theatres, Tasmac outlets and recreation places to seek vaccination details of visitors from September 13. Health officials said this was aimed at encouraging people to get inoculated. While the lockdown norms were relaxed a couple of months ago after the dip in daily Covid-19 cases, the district administration had again started imposing fresh restrictions following the recent spike in caseload. Speaking to TOI, P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said the risk of Covid-19 spread was high in the places of mass gathering. “Initially we will make complete vaccination mandatory for people to visit shopping malls, big textile outlets, theatres, air-conditioned gyms and private hotels. It will be gradually made mandatory for Tasmac outlets, markets and other places.”TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/unvaccinated-people-to-be-barred-from-public-places/articleshow/86128293.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Report questions logic of corp hiring extra trucks||Thiruvananthapuram: The urban affairs directorate in its report to principal secretary, LSGD, has stated the illogical way the city corporation hired 21 vehicles on rent to transport 28 loads of waste after Attukal pongala. The report was submitted by the urban affairs directorate in the wake of allegations of corruption in hiring of vehicles for waste management related to Attukal pongala. Renu Raj, director of urban affairs, in the report submitted has also recommended issuing stringent instructions to the city corporation to avoid such practices in the future. “Hiring more vehicles than that is needed for the actual purpose would invite allegations of financial fraud and would malign the repute of the civic body. It is proper that the civic body may be given stringent instructions to desist from such practices,” the report says. The inquiry was done based on a complaint received at the Chief Minister’s grievance redressal cell. The report has taken note of the reports filed by the secretary of the city corporation and regional joint director (RJD) (Kollam), urban affairs, regarding the same issue. Urban affairs director has upheld the remark of the RJD that it was unnecessary to hire such a large number of vehicles, especially when it was known that the pongala festival would be limited to houses. Both the reports filed by the RJD and director of urban affairs, however, have ratified the corporation’s contention that the civic body hired only 21 vehicles this year while usually 40-45 vehicles were used in previous years. Further, the corporation pointed out that the vehicles were used to clear garbage heaps accumulated in other parts of the city. In the report filed by the corporation secretary, it was mentioned that the decision on pongala being confined to the main hearth came only later and the vehicles hired by civic body were used to clear waste heaps from Chalai drainage road and it was disposed of at Anayara world market. Utility certificates issued by officials of respective health circles were also furnished along with the report. With the urban affairs department putting on record the impropriety in hiring more vehicles, the ruling council is likely to face heat from the opposition. In June, the BJP’s demand for vigilance probe was rejected through voting during the special council. About 54 councillors opted against the vigilance probe while 33 councillors of the BJP were in favour and 13 UDF councillors did not take part in voting .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/report-questions-logic-of-corp-hiring-extra-trucks/articleshow/86126239.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Autograph Collectors’ Club of India (eastern zone) is organising this exhibition of rare and historical autographs on paper and different memorabilia at Rotary Sadan that ends on Sunday. The exhibition features over 200 autographs collected by philographers, some of whom started collecting since they were in school. While some of the autographs evoke nostalgia there are others that can surprise. The oldest autograph in the exhibition is that of Adolf Hitler, an original and illegible scrawl, that G D Agarwal, who is the president of the club, got from an autograph book. There are also signed letters by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, written to Agarwal’s father, who was associated with the Indian Railways in pre-independent India. “Whenever they would travel by rail they would write to my grandfather about their experience. I have over120 such letters,” said Agarwal. The exhibition also has handwritings of Satyajit Ray, painter MF Husain and Kishore Kumar. “A person collects autographs in three ways. Some take autograph personally, some exchange with other collectors and some get them as gifts,” said Santosh Kumar Lahoti, founder president of the club, who was gifted an autograph of Gandhi by his neighbour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/maradona-gandhi-hitler-under-one-roof-in-city/articleshow/86126200.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The bhoomi puja for the work will be held soon, said mayor Premanand Shetty. He said that the project will be taken up on PPP mode through a Mangaluru-based company, at an estimated cost of Rs 95 crore. “We will fix a date for the bhoomi puja, based on Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel’s schedule. Since it is a PPP mode, there is no burden on the government, as it will be completed by the concessionaire as per conditions,” the mayor said. The MLCP facility at Hampankatta, the busy commercial hub, is expected to reduce traffic and parking woes in the area. It will be developed on the vacant site of the old bus stand in the city, over 1.55 acres, he said, adding the project will be taken up through the Mangaluru Smart City Ltd (MSCL). MSCL general manager Arun Prabha said the facility will be constructed on design-build-finance-operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis, as per which the concessionaire will design, finance, construct, maintain and operate it. “The construction will have to be completed in 36 months. Once the work is completed, the MLCP facility can accommodate 400 vehicles. Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has already signed the concessionaire agreement for the project,” he added. In fact, MLCP was initially planned to be implemented through Mangaluru Urban Development Authority (Muda). At a council meeting in 2014, MCC had decided to implement the project on its own (through PPP), but after Mangaluru city was selected under the Smart City Mission of the central government, the MLCP project was included in Smart City projects, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/work-on-multi-level-car-park-to-begin-soon/articleshow/86124483.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Abysmal faculty-student ratio pulls down varsities’ rankings||VISAKHAPATNAM: The poor faculty-student ratio in the state universities of Andhra Pradesh is affecting their NIRF (national institutional ranking framework) rankings. The Union ministry of education has devised a methodology for the NIRF rankings of universities and colleges based on various parameters such as teaching, learning and resources (TLR), research productivity, graduation outcome, outreach and inclusivity, and perception. Faculty-student ratio with emphasis on permanent faculty is one of the key components under TLR category. For instance, as many as 105 professors of Andhra University retired in the last one year itself, bringing the permanent faculty of the varsity from 356 in 2020 to 241 now. The existing faculty is only some one-fourth of the rationalised 900 faculty positions. Due to the same, Andhra University has further slid in its ranking - from 16 in 2019 to 19 in 2020 to 24 in 2021. This is despite an improvement in other ranking parameters such as perception and outreach on the part of university. The state universities have been plagued with a severe faculty crunch as there has not been any recruitment in at least the last one decade. Several departments have no single permanent faculty to head the Board of Studies for the campus colleges as well as for the affiliated colleges. Only Andhra University (48) and Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati (92) could make it to the list of top-100 institutions in the country from the public universities of the state. When it comes to the universities’ category, Andhra University (24), KL University (35), Sri Venkateswara University (54), Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (67), Vignan’s Foundation for Science, Technology and Research (97) have found place in the top-100 list. Andhra University Vice-Chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy said that the contract and guest faculty, who compensate for the regular faculty, do not count in the rankings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/abysmal-faculty-student-ratio-pulls-down-varsities-rankings/articleshow/86124499.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to sources, the mahapanchayat will be organised under the banner of Hind Majdoor Kisan Samiti on the same venue on September 26. Gathwala khap chief Rajendra Malik said, “They (SKM) had organised kisan mahapanchayat, but didn't discuss farmers’ issues in the right manner. We are going to address the issues of the farmers in the right manner and will put these problems before the CM and PM.” Notably, the motorcade of Budhana’s BJP MLA Umesh Malik, who belongs to Gathwala khap, had been attacked in Sisauli village, the stronghold of BKU’s Tikaits. This had led to a war of words between BKU and BJP leaders, in which the Rajinder Singh faction of Gathwala khap threw its lot with Malik. Though Naresh Tikait tried to bridge the difference and appealed to all khaps to attend the September 5 mahapanchayat, Rajindra Malik remained absent from the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/now-disgruntled-khap-chief-announces-mahapanchayat-to-counter-earlier-one/articleshow/86119810.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Around 6.8 crore vaccine doses have been given in the state since January 16, with 38.9% of the eligible population in Maharashtra having taken at least one shot. Health officials said they are hopeful of getting more stocks from the Centre this week, which should allow a large number of people to be vaccinated in a single day. On September 8, the state managed to vaccinate nearly 15.2 lakh people—the highest-ever number in a single day. In Mumbai, the BMC vaccine update showed 1.04 crore doses had been disbursed so far while the Union government’s CoWin portal put the number at 1.09 crore. On Saturday, 65,061 people got vaccinated at public centres, while the rest (54,746) were vaccinated at private centres on Friday and Saturday. “We have adequate doses to vaccinate a good number of people in the next few days,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.

---||Kolkata||Afghan youth asks IIEST to let him join campus here||Kolkata: An e-mail appeal has reached the authorities of IIEST Shibpur from an Afghan youth, who has cleared the screening process for BTech here, to allow him to come and study on campus. The university has not yet decided whether to allow him on campus yet or not and has written to ICCR, the liaising body between the institute and the student. While the Afghan youth seems desperate to leave his country, a Bengali professor teaching international relations at Kardan University in Kabul has rushed back to Kolkata from the strife-torn country, despite examinations being on there. He has resumed work from here and started grading. Sarbajeet Mukherjee hopes peace would return in Afghanistan, where, ironically, he taught strategic studies and defence economics as part of IR. The e-mail from Shafi Sediqi said he had cracked the admission process for foreign students and also bagged the ICCR scholarship. He said he looked forward to joining the programme on the Indian campus. He has sought “help” from the institute authorities so that he can come and start his lessons here. In his appeal, he has reiterated that other universities—not clear if they are also in India—have already informed students and started lessons. Confirming receipt of the e-mail, the institute authorities said Sediqi had been selected for a BTech programme but classes had not yet started. Sediqi’s expenses will be borne by ICCR, which will also be the youth’s guardian in this country. “We have written to the ICCR about the appeal and have requested it to respond to the boy. We are not in a position to answer now,” said a senior official at IIEST, unwilling to comment on the issue. Mukherjee said he had started grading his PG students who had written their examinations online. He remains a faculty of the Kabul university, where he joined in 2020. Though in praise of the education system there, he said he could not risk staying back as the situation had turned turbulent. Mukherjee pointed out that the teaching system followed in Afghanistan, especially at Kardan University, the first private university of that country, was excellent. “It’s a very advanced system. Online plagiarism checkers are used by each student before final submissions. Once they check and upload their papers from the university MIS, tutors and lecturers once again check for plagiarism. Anything above 20% is considered cancelled,” Mukherjee shared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/afghan-youth-asks-iiest-to-let-him-join-campus-here/articleshow/86126241.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

A hyper-casual game is one which is easy to develop and play, like the soap cutting game, Johnny Trigger, Ice Cream Inc and Sand Balls, among others Sridhar Muppidi, founder and chairman, PurpleTalk, pointed out that hyper-casual games have become a huge business opportunity for young gaming entrepreneurs as the game development cycle is quick and can range anywhere between a week to a month to test the viability and a few more months to production. “Because of the higher demand for such games, many global studios are looking at having a base in the city as the cost of developing such games is much lower here given the easy availability of talent at the entry level due to the existing ecosystem,” he said. Global leaders in the space such as Crazy Labs and Voodoo are already working with local developers and other big publishers are in talks to set up shop in the city soon, he said. This month, Israeli game publisher CrazyLabs announced the setting up of its second gaming accelerator in India after Mumbai in Hyderabad. The company has lined up investments to the tune of $500,000 and plans to have around 20 teams (of two to three people each) in its accelerator in the first batch. “We have got three to four times more relevant applications than we received in Mumbai,” said Surojit Roy, co-founder Firescore Interactive, which was acquired by CrazyLabs last month. He added that the retention of talent is also better in Hyderabad compared to other cities, making it a preferable location for companies like CrazyLabs that are investing in building these skills. The new hub in Hyderabad will offer its members office space, professional training in the field of hyper-casual gaming and their games will be published by Crazylabs, Roy added. Meanwhile, VK Samhith, founder, BornMonkie, pointed out that the annual India Game Developer Conference that takes place in the city every year has also created a lot of buzz, attracting young talent to the gaming industry fold. Besides, the IMAGE Tower (Innovation in Multimedia, Animation, Gaming & Entertainment) that is being set up at Raidurgam near HiTec City will also boost the overall ecosystem, he added. QUOTE BOX “Hyper-casual games are easy to develop and are primarily monetised using video ads. The business model is heavily dependent on the low cost of player acquisition. These games are easy to pick up, easy to play but hard to master, allowing more ads to pop up at higher frequency whenever the user fails to complete a task or clear a stage,” Sridhar Muppidi, founder & chairman, PurpleTalk.

In his complaint, Gopalkrishna Bhat said he received a friend request on Facebook from Natalie Jeran on March 25 this year. After accepting the request, Bhat exchanged messages on the social media platform with Jeran, and also shared his Gmail account details. Soon, he started receiving mails from two people — Jeran and Mark David — who assured Bhat of making him a business partner. Bhat claimed that he was cheated of Rs 24.9 lakh after they convinced him to transfer money to their accounts in instalments. When they refused to return the money, Bhat filed a complaint at Puttur Rural police station. A case has been booked under sections 417, 419 and 420 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/man-loses-rs-24l-to-fb-friend/articleshow/86124548.cms||---

GS Tompe College of Arts, Commerce & Science at Chandur Bazar in Amravati district has made it happen. Sarang Dhote, assistant professor with the chemistry department at JD Sangludkar Mahavidyalaya, Daryapur, and Pravin Ingle, assistant professor with the geology department at GS Tompe College, have developed ‘Talking Rock’, an android application that has made it possible. The project was commissioned at the college museum by Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University pro-VC R Jaipurkar on September 4. Ingle said, “The app is available on the Google Play Store. One has to download it after scanning the QR code or by selecting the number which is assigned to each rock specimen. We have worked on 40 rock specimens stored in the app. We plan to include another 60.” “It is not just information but beyond that. The rock tells about its common name, chemical composition, hardness, state, luster, and occurrence. The app is currently working in English language. It will be useful for students to enhance their knowledge. We were working on this app for the last one year,” says Dhote. For example, if the user scans the QR code of a rock specimen called Agate, the specimen will tell everything about it. Dhote claimed, “This is the first app about talking rocks in the country. We have applied the app for copyright.” Earlier, Dhote has developed a talking tree app for Melghat Tiger Reserve at Chikhaldara in Amravati. The project has included 200 trees. Last week, a similar app developed by Dhote was launched by the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) at Balasaheb Thackeray Gorewada International Zoo in the city. GO ROCKING Step I: Go to Google Play Store and search the talking rock app Step II: After installing, click on the start button Step III: After this, the app will ask your name. You can write your name or you can speak Step IV: Now, scan the QR code which is available on rock specimen or select the number which is tagged on the rock specimen. Now, rock itself talks with us through a mobile app. And the rock also asks us for selfies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/can-rocks-talk-this-app-now-makes-it-possible/articleshow/86126298.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The Collector had served a notice to the women’s hostel being run by the district Mahila cooperative society citing that it had incurred dues on the lease amount of the puramboke land where the hostel is functioning. Following this, the hostel authorities had filed a petition to the land revenue commissioner seeking a stay order on the Collector’s proceedings. Commissioner later issued a stay order. But the Collector, neglecting the commissioner's order, affixed a notice stating that there were only two genuine inmates at the hostel and the rest of the residents would be evicted. However, Bindhu Krishna said there were 20 women staying in the hostel. "The Collector has functioned beyond his official capacity and powers," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-cpm-stop-hostel-eviction/articleshow/86126324.cms||---

Officials said the proposed design has been inspired from the obelisk of Washington monument. The plaza will have several obelisks made of steel and glass creating a hi-tech surrealistic ambience that will appeal to the young tech crowd of Sector V. A dazzling illumination scheme has been planned to create a vibrant atmosphere with supporting audio and visual effects. The existing blacktop road surface, pavement and street lights on the 50-metre stretch will be removed and the stretch will be redeveloped with sculptures, artwork, graffiti, signage and illuminative towers with no motor vehicles to be allowed to enter. Officials said that there will be provisions to work from the seats in the plaza with solar powered charging stations and wi-fi zones. An interactive light sculpture has also been planned along with automatic retractable boom barriers that will be placed to keep away traffic and to only allow service vehicles like fire tenders. NDITA officials said that the stretch which has been identified for transforming into a pedestrian plaza is one of the most happening zones of Sector V, lined with multiplex movie theatre, restaurants, bars, cafes and sweet shops. “The plan is to turn the 50 meter stretch into a complete pedestrian zone where vehicles will not be allowed to enter. The makeover has been planned to be done in six phases,” said an NDITA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/design-push-for-pedestrian-plaza-project-at-sec-v/articleshow/86126284.cms||Suman Chakraborti

While the prosecution claimed one accused, Ramshiromani Pandey (55), was arrested in Sakinaka with the drugs, he repeatedly contended he was arrested from his house in Nalasopara. The defence produced CCTV footage to corroborate the accused’s version. The court said that from images in CCTV footage, it is clear that the witness and accused were seen in Nalasopara. “...I have come to the conclusion that, PW-4 (prosecution witness) appears to have made false statement before the court, having knowledge that if his evidence is accepted he will be helping the prosecution in proving its case,” the court said. It said it found to be “expedient in the interest of justice” to at least initiate an enquiry in the matter by issuing a show-cause notice to him and find out if he is really responsible for committing perjury. “The show cause notice issued to Abdul Rauf Shaikh, as directed above, shall be made returnable on September 30,” the court said. “In recent times, there has been tendency of making false statement before the court and therefore, cases of perjury are increasing and unless action is taken by the court , this tendency cannot be controlled or checked,” the court said. The court said the defence showed circumstances to prove possibility of implication of accused in the case cannot be ruled out. “…therefore, doubt is created in the truthfulness of the prosecution story,” the court said. Acquitting Pandey, businessman Santosh Kumar Singh (34) and estate agent Vidyaprasad Tiwari (45), the court said, “I find thatx the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the seizure in the case...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-let-off-in-drugs-case-perjury-charge-slapped-on-witness/articleshow/86129947.cms||Rebecca Samervel

September 15 is celebrated as Engineers’ Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Sir M Visversvarya. Union minister Nitin Gadkari would be the chief guest while Shekhar Mande, director general, Council of Scientifice and Industrial Research (CSIR) would be the guest of honour. The degrees would be conferred among doctorate of philosophy, master of technology, master of science, bachelor of technology in various engineering disciplines and bachelor of architecture students. Highest 634 degrees belong to BTech courses. Addressing a press conference, VNIT director Pramod Padole said the institute has now started a new interdisciplinary MTech course on engineering applied to medical sciences (EAMS) has been introduced this year. “MTech in biomedical engineering is taught in association with AIIMS Nagpur and well-known doctors including Dr Satish Deopujari,” he said. Padole said the premier institute would be receiving Rs2 crore from Indian Space Research Organization (Isro) for its incubation centre on the campus. Siemens Centre of Excellence would be named after former VNIT chairman Vishram Jamdar, who passed away last year. The centre has been established in the domain of industry 4.0 and digitalization with thrust on biomedical engineering, robotics, smart manufacturing, consisting 12 major labs with high-end machines, he said. Padole said VNIT has already started construction of a big swimming pool as per international standards through the alumni association’s sponsorship. Taking a lesson from the pandemic, Padole said VNIT would have a 20-bed hospital for its staff and students, beside an oxygen plant. The plant would cater to citizens if needed, he said. Padole said the old auditorium has been upgraded with a complete makeover. A few years ago, Gadkari had expressed disappointment during IIM-N’s convocation at the auditorium over its flawed structural design. Padole said, “It was a concern that VNIT is such a big institution and it should have a better auditorium. The renovated hall would have a capacity of 1,300. It will be fully air-conditioned and have all amenities.” In numbers 49 | Phd 333 | MTech 60 | MSc 634 | Btech 59 | BArch 46 | Medals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vnit-to-confer-over-1-1k-degrees-46-medals-at-13th-convocation-on-sept-15/articleshow/86126345.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Lake regulars raise alarm after dead fish in water||Kolkata: Dead fish found floating on Rabindra Sarobar lake on Saturday morning left morning walkers worried about the condition of the water. Many fear this might have been caused by construction debris that were hurled into the water by clubs along the fringes of the Lake, some of which have recently extended their premises. Morning walkers raised an alarm and informed the security personnel manning the area. N C Jana, a morning walker and an expert on water bodies, first saw dead fish floating on the surface. “The water quality must be checked periodically and be made public to ascertain that fish were not dying because of pollution.” The regular visitors felt clubs in the Lake area must exercise caution and be careful of the environmental impact of their activities. “The clubs indeed have increased their floor areas. They often dump untreated sewage in the Lake. I have seen construction debris in the Lake water adjacent to their premises. All these must stop and KMDA must be more vigilant,” said Prabir Sarkar, an octogenarian, who has been regular to Sarobar for the last four decades. Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is the custodian of the lake, considered to be the lung of south Kolkata. Many of the morning walkers alleged that the Lake had been encroached upon by the clubs during Covid restriction period. “I can see new concrete structures erected in the Lake, which were not there before the 2020 lockdown,” said Pankaj Saha, another morning walker. Sarama Mukherjee, a retired school teacher and a regular at the Lake, said, “The clubs must be more careful while carrying out repair work or refurbishing their own premises. They must plant more trees and ensure that polluters are not spared.” Bidyut Poddar, a former marine engineer, said, “I am proud of the Lake, but it is also our duty to ensure that it is not polluted. I have seen all kinds of wastes like leftover food from kitchens to untreated sewage being dumped in water. We must be aware that the water body is cohabited by numerous birds, insects, flora and fauna. Any of our irresponsible act will endanger their lives.” KMDA on the other hand decided to re-assess the activities of the club and check whether they are complying to statutory regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lake-regulars-raise-alarm-after-dead-fish-in-water/articleshow/86126340.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The minister who visited the park on Saturday said over one lakh palm tree seedlings can be taken from there. He also assured that the seedlings will be grown across Alangudi constituency from where he was elected. The park with such a large number of trees was created in 1984 by a group of people led by M Thiruppathi, 72, with a vision to dedicate a healthy environment to the younger generation.The minister said planting of the palm trees on 20 acres of government land nearly 37 years ago has made the villagers pioneers as the DMK government has launched a “palmyra development mission” at an outlay of Rs 3 crore. The state government project is aimed at distributing 76 lakh palmyra seed nuts and one lakh seedlings to farmers in 30 districts with full subsidy this year. Under the mission, the government plans to protect and increase palmyra trees besides promoting value-added products from them. Moved by the recognition given by the minister, Thiruppathi said palm trees have benefited the people of the village a lot in more than three decades in the form of padhaneer, palm candy, palm jaggery etc., besides protecting water table in the area. “Palm tree doesn’t require much water but its benefits are plenty. Realising the need for creating such an environment, we created the palm tree park,” said Thiruppathi. In order to make the park accessible, the minister said that a road will be laid to it at a cost of Rs 7 lakh and steps taken to popularise it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/min-promises-to-develop-palm-tree-park/articleshow/86128392.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Speeding at 140kmph, biker thrown off bridge||KOLKATA: A 23-year-old lighting contractor, who loved speed died after a high-octane ride on a superbike, spun out of control and hit a flyover guard wall, catapulting him across the barrier. Sudip Mondal, who fell 40ft from the flyover to the road below, was killed in the impact. The incident took place on Sampriti flyover that connects Jinjirabazar to Batanagar on Friday night. Police said the bike, priced around Rs 1.6 lakh, was travelling at 140 km per hour. “Mondal probably lost control over the bike and hit the guard wall. He was flung across it and landed on the ground below. The extent of damage the bike suffered showed the speed at which it was travelling,” said Subhendu Sarkar, IC, Maheshtala police station. Locals said Mondal died immediately after the fall. “I was on my way home after shutting my shop in Chandannagar area and saw some locals standing around a body on the road. I found the youth lying unconscious. I immediately called some traders from the locality and took him to ESI Hospital. I found his driving licence and mobile. I called whatever numbers I found to contact his family members,” said Shyamal Karmakar, a stationery shop owner. Bapi Naskar, Mondal’s brother-in-law, said, “Sudip was a school dropout who started working as an electrician and then, ventured into lighting supply business. He was obsessed with high-speed bikes and had bought this motorcycle a few months ago. On Friday, he left home in the afternoon. He went to Budge Budge to attend Ganesh puja at a friend’s house. He returned to his neighbourhood in Parnashree but did not go home. At night, he was again headed to Budge Budge, when the accident took place.” There have been a number of similar deaths in the past, leading to a ban on two-wheelers on most flyovers in the city after 10pm. While the Garden Reach flyover has had several such deaths, an accident on Maa flyover had left everyone in shock. The fall of a motorcyclist from the flyover was captured on a CCTV camera.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/speeding-at-140kmph-biker-thrown-off-bridge/articleshow/86126358.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

Aurangabad district guardian minister Subhash Desai has promised all possible support to the proposed route, which is a part of a larger route linking Aurangabad to Pune via Ahmednagar. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray himself has ordered the necessary follow-up with the railway ministry for connecting Aurangabad and Ahmednagar with a new rail line. The state government is committed to the new line and will ensure all possible support,” Desai said at the latest review meeting. There exists no direct rail connectivity between Aurangabad and Ahmednagar at present, with trains reaching both the destinations using a longer route via Manmad. Earlier, in February, railway officials had carried out a field survey for the proposed 120-km line between both the cities by reaching out to different state government authorities, stakeholders, and possible beneficiaries. The proposed rail route — to which the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development had given favourable remarks after executing a viability assessment in November 2020 — is expected to further augment development associated with the upcoming Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC). Desai, meanwhile, also batted for offering effective air-connectivity between Aurangabad and the temple town of Shirdi. “Both the tourist destinations will soon have good road connectivity because of the Samruddhi expressway. The chief minister is further keen on offering air-connectivity between the towns for the benefit of tourists and pilgrims,” he said. Desai, who is also Maharashtra industries minister, has promised speedy execution of different ongoing and proposed development works in Aurangabad, besides the smooth rollout of the government’s decision to regularise gunthewari properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-ahmednagar-rail-route-to-get-on-track/articleshow/86122982.cms||---
---||Trichy||No chance of LTTE revival: SL Tamil MP||Trichy: Sri Lankan member of parliament V S Radhakrishnan has dismissed theories about Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rearing its head again in his country. “Any chance of revival of LTTE in Sri Lanka is remote because the government is rehabilitating Sri Lankan Tamils,” he told reporters in Trichy on Saturday after calling on Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) national president K M Kader Mohideen.“On the other hand, Sri Lankan Tamils face no threat to their safety and security under the government led by President Gotapaya Rajapaksa, though their wishes such as freedom of movement were not fulfilled. There is a sense of frustration among the people including Sinhalese towards the government,” he said.The Sri Lankan Tamil MP appreciated the DMK government led by M K Stalin for rechristening the refugee camps as Sri Lankan Tamil rehabilitation camps and taking steps to provide better infrastructure to their people here. In this regard, Radhakrishnan also recalled the help rendered by the previous AIADMK government to Sri Lankan Tamils back home.While insisting on dual citizenship for Sri lankan Tamil refugees in India, Radhakrishnan said refugees in Tamil Nadu willing to return are welcome as the SL government will be providing all facilities to them. He described the BJP-led central government as friendly towards the Sri Lankan government but that some actions of the then Congress government in India were reasons for oppressing protesters in Sri Lanka during the final wars in 2009. Radhakrishnan said his party had voted against the bill on the China-backed Port City. The MP linked the shortage of food in his country to the economic impact of Covid-19. “Sri Lankan economy is fully dependant on tourism. Our economy will revive in a matter of six months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-chance-of-ltte-revival-sl-tamil-mp/articleshow/86128405.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mix-and-match trial of Covaxin jab, its nasal dose starts in city||Nagpur: In the near future, you might get the first dose of nasal Covaxin for instant protection from Covid-19 with the second being the conventional injectable one for developing a sustainable shield. The final trial of mix-and-match of two different forms of Covaxin has started in Nagpur, which is one of the four centres for this one-of-its-kind trial initiated by Bharat Biotech Ltd, makers of the vaccine. If successful, the nasal + vascular vaccine formula can be a game changer ahead of the projected third wave. Covaxin is currently being administered in the country. Phase I clinical trials data of the adenoviral intranasal vaccine was submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation in June. The data is ‘very promising’, said sources. Dr Chandrashekhar Gillurkar, who was the principal investigator for many trials of Bharat Biotech vaccines in the city, is heading the recent mix-and-match trial too. “DCGI has approved a study to examine the efficacy of mixing Covaxin. We have shortlisted 50 participants for this project,” said Dr Gillurkar. The participants will be divided into four groups — two of 12 members each and 2 of 13 members each. Group A will be given both doses of traditional vaccine. Group B will get the first dose of traditional injectable vaccine while the second will be of nasal vaccine. Group C will get first dose of nasal and second dose of injectable vaccine, while Group D will get both doses of nasal vaccines. “We will conduct a comparative study of the level of antibodies in all four groups. This study will let us know which mix brings better type and amount of antibodies in people,” said Dr Gillurkar. According to him, the results of the nasal vaccine made by Bharat Biotech are astonishing. “We have noticed that nasal form of Covaxin brings instant protection and good amount of antibodies right in the nasal cavity, where the virus attacks first. This can stop the virus right at its entry point of human body. If the second dose is intravascular, it may bring sustainable protection,” he said. This means that ahead of the projected third wave, people may get early protection through nasal vaccine and make it sustainable for long period by getting the injectable vaccine after 4-6 weeks. Apart from Nagpur, the trials are being conducted in Lucknow, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mix-and-match-trial-of-covaxin-jab-its-nasal-dose-starts-in-city/articleshow/86128415.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said they have come across incidents in which people have used fake stickers. “The special drive to stop this trend. Traffic wing cops identified as many as 90 vehicles including two-wheelers and four-wheelers with unauthorised stickers on Friday. The drive will continue for some more days,” he added. During the special drive, 42 vehicles were found to be sporting fake police sticker, 37 with press sticker, six with MLA sticker, two with MP sticker, two with defence sticker and one with MLC sticker, the police said. “We asked them to remove the stickers on the spot. We will register cases and also impose hefty fines if they repeat the offence,” said ADCP (Traffic) Ch Adinarayana. Media and police are engaged in essential services and we don’t generally check their credentials. Some people who are neither in police department nor in media organisations are taking advantage of this. However, it is time to see that people don’t misuse this exemption,” he added. Meanwhile, the police have also launched a drive against number plate violations. A majority of the high-end bikers are said to be violating this norm. On Friday alone, the police booked 624 motorists for violations. Police said most of the violators are youngsters. Some sport the number plate on either side of the bike. Some tamper with the number plates by writing names and quotes, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vehicles-with-fake-logos-on-cops-radar/articleshow/86124624.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Nagpur||Those empowered by Cong backstabbed it: Patole||Nagpur: A day after NCP supremo Sharad Pawar flayed Congress and equated it with old Uttar Pradesh’ zamindars (landlords) who still live in the past glory, the grand old party’s Maharashtra chief Nana Patole launched a counterattack against him. The former Union agriculture minister had taken a jibe against Congress leaders stating that they were like landlords who used to have thousands of acres of property but after the Land Ceiling Act, it was reduced to a few acres. “They now have only havelis (mansion) left. When they wake in the morning and see that huge chunk of land, they remain under the illusion that it still belongs to them. In reality, they do not have the capability to even maintain and repair their havelis,” Pawar had said. Countering him, Patole, who was in the city, told the media that Congress had given its land to many persons in the capacity of caretakers, but they either stole it property or committed a dacoity. “Since Pawar is very senior to us in politics, we avoid talking to him. In democracy, everyone has the liberty to express their thoughts. However, if he thinks that Congress’s condition is not good, let me tell him that after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, there will be a Prime Minister from our party,” he said. Adding that he was junior to NCP chief in politics, Patole advised the former to avoid talking about leadership of other parties as it did not suit his personality. “Congress never did any zamindari and was never a party of landlords. Those who were empowered by our party are the ones who backstabbed it. Today, the country’s general public is with Congress. Often, attempts are made to defame the party’s leadership, but no one takes them seriously. Congress leadership would head the country in 2024.” On whether he is indicating that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi would be the party’s PM face, the Sakoli MLA said only their party could provide an alternative to the BJP in India. “People are fed up with PM Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s ruling, which is bent on selling the country. There’s deep anguish and resentment among them against the Centre’s wrong policies and they too know that only Congress can replace the BJP.” State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who was also in the city, refused to comment on Pawar’s jibe, stating that MPCC chief Patole had already made the party’s position clear. This is not the first time Patole had flayed the senior NCP leader. The former BJP MP from Bhandara had accused the former of being a “remote control” of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He also added that the Congress would fight the 2024 assembly polls independently. Pawar also responded to Patole’s comments stating that he would not like to react to a “small man”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/those-empowered-by-cong-backstabbed-it-patole/articleshow/86126383.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The dates have not been finalized. I have been told that once my tickets are purchased after 30-45 days, I should approach them to check if the second dose can be administered,” he said. On August 26, Nusrat had given birth to son Yishaan. The actor-politician has embraced motherhood while choosing not to name the father of her baby. The KMC visit again triggered various speculations that also include talks over the Basirhat MP approaching KMC to know the formalities for getting her son’s birth certificate. Surprised with these rumours, she said, “Since we never said a word, people came up with weird stories about the birth certificate of my baby. We just went to KMC to get jabbed. I didn’t get vaccinated earlier because I didn’t want to take that risk during pregnancy. Yash also preferred to wait and take it with me.” She also wondered why there is so much curiosity regarding Yishaan’s birth certificate. “Every child has a birth certificate. It is a normal thing. Both parents don’t need to be physically present to get it done. My son is a normal child. I don’t think both my parents had to go to KMC to get my birth certificate done. It’s the same with Yash, too,” she said. What surprises her is the speculation regarding her son. “We don’t prefer talking to media and standing and looking into the camera and giving quotes unlike other people. But that doesn’t mean we are not keeping any secrets,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-the-curiosity-over-my-sons-birth-cert-asks-nusrat/articleshow/86126370.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Despite the restrictions on passenger movements, exporters recently shipped a tonne of garments to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia through Trichy international airport. So far, most of the exports from the airport were perishable commodities such as vegetables and fruits. The export of a tonne of garments has rejuvenated the hopes of agents and aviation enthusiasts here. So far, the textile manufacturers in the state in Karur and Salem districts were exporting garments through Chennai or Bengaluru international airports, and at times through the harbours. While Trichy was restricted as a hub to export vegetable produce, the shipping of garments has set a short route to southeast Asia for the exporters in the central Tamil Nadu. “Sarees and fabric materials have been witnessing a huge demand in Malaysia among the Indian diaspora. As low cost and reliable quality are pushing the demand up, we may export 40 tonnes of garment this Diwali season,” A Moorthy, clearing and forwarding agent, exports, said. The MSMEs into food production is equally capitalising on the demand for snacks in the gulf countries. “We have planned to visit textile units in Perambalur, Karur and Namakkal to utilise the opportunity to export garments from Trichy airport,” H Ubaidullah, independent civil aviation analyst, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/textile-sector-eyes-export-via-trichy/articleshow/86128436.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Thane||Thane: Investors cry foul, jewellery chain’s three officials booked||KALYAN: Three top officials of a jewellery firm have been booked after a few investors accused them of cheating. The accused have been identified as VG Nair, managing director of VGN Jewellers; his wife Vatsala and their son Govind who are also directors of the company have been booked by the Economic Offences Wing. Four people from a family have accused them of cheating them of Rs 67 lakh. Sources said the Nair family runs several branches of VGN Jewellery stores in Thane and Navi Mumbai and have also floated various investment schemes that offer good returns on investment. So, officials said that more people are likely to come forward and the amount could be much higher. The complainant, Shalini Patil from Kalyan, has in her complaint alleged that she and three of her family members had invested Rs 67 lakh in schemes and the deposits matured last year. She however said that since last year, she has been doing the rounds of the jewellery store but officials of the company had not returned her money. Patil told TOI, “It is not only my own savings which I have put in, but even my family members who trusted me put in their hard-earned money. Now I wanted to marry off my daughter but since a year, the company has failed to return my invested money.” Patil added that whenever she meet the owners of the jewellery firm, they tell her that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they have incurred heavy losses and promised to pay the money, but despite several assurances over the months, the money has not been returned, she claimed. “I had no choice but to file the FIR,” she said. The sources said that last year since pandemic started, VGN Jewellers stopped returning money of investors. Six months ago, investors along with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers from Thane held a morcha at shop during which the owner, VG Nair, assured that he would return investors’ money once the pandemic ends xand his business looks up again. A police official, who spoke strictly on the condition of anonymity said, “So far, four investors have come forward. We expect mxore investors to approach us to file a case... Quite possible that the amount runs into crores.” It may be recalled that the owner of Goodwin Jewellers who had luanch similar investment schemes was arrested after he stopped giving returns to investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-investors-cry-foul-jewellery-chains-3-officials-booked/articleshow/86129965.cms||Pradeep Gupta

No one was injured and even the nearby shanties were spared but the blaze affected the traffic flow in the area, as extensive diversions were required to facilitate the dousing. The fire was reported around 10am and the flames spread fast due to the strong winds from the Hooghly and the inflammable objects in the warehouse. Twenty-three fire engines were deployed and though the blaze was largely contained by 7pm, firemen continued to find small pockets of flames. Cooling exercise is expected to continue till next morning. KopT said it was a leased property and the onus lay with them to instal a fire-fighting system. A large police team arrived and vacated the place to avert any loss of life or injury. “First, ten fire engines arrived, followed by 13 more,” said a port division cop. The West Port police will probe the reason. “Traffic was suspended from Asbestos crossing. We diverted heavy vehicles to Oil Installation Road and then, Sick Lane or Hyde Road,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fire-breaks-out-at-port-trust-warehouse-traffic-affected/articleshow/86126403.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Reenu Paul, president of the Rajpur Community Initiative, a citizen’s group, told TOI, “Heavy JCB machines are being used inside the reserve forest causing damage to the local flora and disturbing the wildlife.All construction activities that disturb the soil must not be undertaken inside the reserve forest area and the road construction work must be stopped immediately.” Mussoorie divisional forest officer (DFO) Kahkashan Naseem, when contacted, said that only the existing path was being levelled and no construction work would be done.  “We are merely levelling the existing track which leads to Sura Devi temple, which we do periodically. Even the levelling of track is being done without using any cement. A JCB machine was used only to remove large boulders that had come down on the track.” The DFO added that the track can be used by devotees to the temple, by cyclists or by pedestrians interested in bird watching or in spending some time in natural environs. Residents meanwhile have demanded a probe in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rajpur-residents-oppose-development-of-cycle-track-inside-reserve-forest/articleshow/86124690.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Puducherry||Girl, 10, dies after having chicken at Tamil Nadu eatery||TIRUVANNAMALAI: A 10-year-old girl died after consuming chicken dishes and biryani at an eatery in Arni in Tiruvannamalai district on Friday. More than 20 others, including three of her family members, who complained of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been admitted in Arni Government General Hospital. Officials suspect that the eatery workers could have used stale and contaminated chicken to prepare the food. A Lokshani of Lakshmi Nagar in Arni, who underwent treatment at a private hospital was referred to Arni GH for further treatment. However, doctors at the GH said she was ‘brought dead’. The eatery owner and cook have been arrested. Police said some people, who consumed chicken tandoori, chilli chicken and biryani at Seven Star Biryani Hotel in Arni on Wednesday night, complained of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea the next day. They were admitted to private hospitals and the Arni government GH. Lokshani’s parents and brother were among those undergoing treatment at the GH after having similar health complaints. The girl’s death sparked tension in the town.A team of revenue and police officials led by RDO Kavitha and Arni DSP N Kottieswaran visited the eatery and conducted preliminary inquiries. A team led by A Ramakrishnan, district designated officer (food safety), inspected the eatery and took samples of rice, water, oil and chicken meat. “We could not find samples of the food items served on Wednesday. Hence, we took samples of raw materials such as rice, water, oil and the meat available on Friday. The cold storage system in the eatery does not maintain the temperature required to preserve meat. The licence of the eatery was suspended and it was sealed,” said Ramakrishnan. Food safety officials said the test results of the samples, which will be available in a day or two, would reveal more information on bacterial contamination if any. “The meat used to prepare the food could have been stale. We need to consider several factors (regarding the girl’s death). We need to check the bacterial contamination and how far the virulence had set in. There are other factors such as the immunity of the consumers and the time taken by them to seek medical attention. The doctors at the GH have obtained the stool culture of the patients. The girl was brought dead to the GH. Her post-mortem report and stool culture of the patients undergoing treatment will give more insights,” said Ramakrishnan. The Arni town police booked eatery proprietor Amjad Basha and cook Muniyandi under Sections 284 (negligent conduct with respect to poisonous substance), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC and arrested them. Tiruvannamalai collector B Murugesh directed the food safety officials to launch a series of drives to check the quality of food served at all eateries and restaurants in the town. “Based on the collector’s direction, we formed six teams and will inspect all the hotels in Arni municipality. We inspected 12 hotels on Saturday and seized 15kg of stale and contaminated meat from a hotel and destroyed it. We will cover hotels in other municipalities, including Vandavasi and Tiruvannamalai, in the next few days. The collector has asked us to submit weekly and daily reports on the inspection,” said Ramakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/girl-10-dies-after-having-chicken-at-tn-eatery/articleshow/86126436.cms||Bosco Dominique

However, the appointment of primary teachers is getting delayed as students who have completed their 18-month-long Diploma in Elementary Education (D. El. Ed) through regular mode are against the appointment of those who have completed their graduation through distance mode. The regular mode graduates complain that there are already less seats up for grabs and the preference should be given to the regular mode students. Notably, the central government had announced last year that the open learning graduates can also be included in the appointment process but graduates from regular mode, who are waiting for their appointment for the past few years, believe that their inclusion will hamper their chances as well. Meanwhile, according to TOI sources, the government is likely to take a call on the issue by next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/primary-teachers-appointment-on-hold-in-ukhand/articleshow/86124707.cms||Mohammad Anab

The National Students Union of India (NSUI) under its city chief Ashish Mandpe staged demonstrations for the same demands in front of the Mahametro office on the same day. “I would be storming the MahaMetro office for its failure on this serious issue. They must follow the norms by recruiting backward class candidates as per their quota. I already had a talk with its managing director Brjesh Dixit. I am planning to invite him to Mantralaya for a detailed talk on the issue,” he told the media. The minister warned MahaMetro that if reserved category candidates were not recruited, he would lodge a complaint with the state assembly panel working for backward class rights. On Supreme Court’s order to conduct local body polls, he said the government would abide by it, although the decision was taken at an all-party meeting to postpone the polls by four months or till the OBC reservation is restored. Speaking on the losses suffered by the farmers due to incessant rains, flash floods and cloud burst, the Bramhapuri MLA said as per the government’s initial estimates, crops spread over 17 lakh hectares were damaged. “It’s a record of sorts as far as damage is concerned, but the government is taking steps to compensate farmers. I had a video conference with collectors from affected areas of Marathwada, Konkan and some parts of North Maharashtra and Vidarbha. I have told them to complete the initial panchnama on crop damage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-meet-mahametro-md-on-reserved-post-minister/articleshow/86126432.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Most household moortis are immersed after one-and-a-half days of festivity. According to BMC data, 29,044 idols were immersed—28,794 household moortis and 232 from mandals—till 9pm. Of the 29,044 visarjans, more than half—16,571—were in artificial ponds, including 16,391 household Ganeshas. The remaining 12,473 idols were deposited at BMC collection points for immersion in the sea. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap inaugurated an artificial pond set up by Maharashtra Mandal at Siddharth Nagar in Goregaon (W). “The need of the hour is to immerse Ganesha idols in an eco-friendly manner. The BMC has already launched an initiative to immerse idols in artificial ponds. The number of people utilising these sites are slowly increasing,” Jagtap said. Over in Juhu, corporator Renu Hansraj and MLA Ameet Satam joined BMC officials at the artificial pond at the coastal garden opposite Novotel Hotel. Hansraj said, “Twenty-six immersions took place here within three hours, a manifold increase over the past three years since this tank was built. Once the idols made of mud and clay dissolve, we drain the water into the garden.” The BMC has increased the number of artificial ponds to 173 this year as compared to 167 in 2020.

The special investigation team (SIT) has still not finished the probe into the role of Dr Lalchandani Labs, another major path lab which was named in the FIR along with Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Laboratories in June. Besides, 22 labs were hired for conducting Covid testing in the Kumbh Mela by the mela and district health department whose role is yet to be investigated. Police registered an FIR in the scam in June and first arrest was made in July 22 in which Ashish Vashishta, owner of Bhiwani, Haryana-based Delphia lab, was held by the SIT while main accused of the scam Sharat and Mallika Pant owners of Max Corporate Services who got the assignment for Covid-19 testing during the Kumbh Mela on behalf of Nalwa laboratories, Hisar, and Dr Dr Lalchandani Labs Delhi are still at large. Meanwhile, police got the NBW against Sharat, Mallika Pant and Dr Navtej Nalwa of Nalwa laboratories but failed to trace them. On the other hand, SIT did not complete its investigation into the role of Dr Lalchandani Labs which conducted around 13,000 Covid tests in the Kumbh mela. CO city Abhay Singh in-charge of SIT told TOI, “We are trying to nab the main accused and, soon, police are going to attach their property. As far as the role of other labs are concerned, our investigation is going on and action will be taken after finding their roles.

---||Nagpur||Foundation of 400-year-old Shiva lingam crumbles||Chandrapur: A part of the foundation of a grand Shiva lingam at the historical heritage site of Apurna Devalaya in the city crumbled after heavy rains. The premises of Apurna Devalaya (incomplete temple) have a 400-year-old cluster of grand idols of different gods and goddesses, built during the reign of Gond king Dhundya Ramshah (1597-1622 AD). NGO Eco-Pro president Bandu Dhotre, who rushed to the site upon learning about the crumbling, said weeklong incessant rains had loosened the rocks in the foundation of the Shiva lingam. The stones in its foundation had been collapsing one after the other for the last few days, he added. “Our team has covered the crumbled portion with tarpaulin,” Dhotre said. Dhotre informed Archaeological Survey of India officials in Nagpur about the incident and assistant archaeologist Prashant Shinde was sent to the site for inspection. Shinde along with his team inspected the crumbled foundation on Saturday and took measurements to prepare a proposal for its conservation. Senior historian Ashoksingh Thakur said Apurna Devalaya has a cluster of 15 grand idols. “During the reign of Ramshah, a businessman Rayyapa Vaishaya had started building a grand temple. All the tall idols were carved at the site to be installed in the temple. However, Vaishaya died while the work was still underway. His heirs abandoned the work and the temple remained unfinished,” Thakur stated. Thakur claimed that the Shiva lingam whose foundation has crumbled is eight-feet-high and unique in itself. “Usually there is a Nandi sitting in front of a Shiva lingam. But here, an elephant is kneeling. It has such an arrangement that the water or milk falling from the Shiva lingam would fall on the elephant’s back and flow down through a narrow groove on the back, via its tail,” he explained. Thakur also demanded immediate restoration of the idol and conservation of all the 15 idols at the historic site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/foundation-of-400-year-old-shiva-lingam-crumbles/articleshow/86126460.cms||Mazhar Ali

There was stiff opposition from locals after Adani Group took over the management of the Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) and replaced the existing name boards with with new ones that said Adani Airports. Activists headed by Dilraj Alva had joined hands, demanding that the Mangaluru International Airport name board be restored, and Adani Airports be dropped. Bowing to the pressure, Adani Group has now replaced the name boards, said Dilraj. Addressing the media here on Saturday, Dilraj said that last year, after the Adani Group won the contract for operation and management of MIA, they had replaced the old boards. “Violating contract rules, as part of branding, they mentioned that the airport is maintained by Adani Airports. We were not happy, as the name Mangaluru was put in a corner on the name boards, and it would be a threat to tourism in the long run. During the RTI query, it was revealed that Adani has no right to change any branding, and the same was restored to the previous name boards on Friday. A legal notice was served in March 2021 to the Airports Authority of India and the MIA airport director, questioning the branding of Mangaluru International Airport as Adani Airports,” said Dilraj. Dilraj added that the changes have also been made on the MIA’s official Twitter and Facebook accounts as well.

Though the minister has been saying that the dates will be announced soon, he clarified on Saturday that preliminary measures for the election are being delayed due to the recent upgradation of several urban local bodies. “Communal rotation process is getting delayed as 30 new municipalities and six new municipal corporations were formed. However, the preliminary process is being undertaken by our officials. Delimitation of wards will be carried out and we will soon announce the dates,” the minister said. The delimitation of urban wards is to be carried out ensuring proportionate distribution of the urban population. People will get 100 to 130 days for raising objections if any to the exercise. The state election commission may soon announce the dates for the pending rural local body election in nine districts, he said.Stating that no village panchayat was forced to merge with the urban local body for the proposed expansion plan, Nehru said the elected representatives of the rural local bodies will continue and complete their tenure. “Densely populated and high revenue generating panchayats can get the infrastructure development projects only if they merge with the nearest urban local bodies,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/urban-civic-election-after-delimitation-says-nehru/articleshow/86128476.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Crash severity of city higher than Mumbai, says Gadkari||Nagpur: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said the crash severity index of Nagpur is almost four times more than Mumbai. According to Gadkari, city roads are witnessing eight deaths against one lakh population in road accidents every year. Sharing traffic accident analysis of Nagpur city, Gadkari said in 2018, the crash severity index was 21.22%, 24.83% in 2019 and rose to 70.17% in 2020. “Road accidents in 2020 declined in other cities, while Nagpur city witnessed a steep increase,” the transport minister said and admitted that it’s a matter of shame for him as well. “On an average, 1,500 road accidents took place every year, which claimed the lives of 250 persons,” he said. “During investigation of any road accidents, the police easily blame the driver but never try to find out the exact cause which may include fault in road design,” Gadkari pointed out. He further expressed anguish against officials from Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Nagpur Improvement Trust and police department over lack of coordination to curb accidents. As a result, the improved road infrastructure has become accident prone spots, said Gadkari at the launch of iRASTE, an artificial intelligence (AI) system for preventing road accidents and identifying black spots. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation in association with CSIR-CRRI, Mahindra and Mahindra, INAI, IIT-H and Intel have joined hands to make city’s roads safer for motorists. Gadkari also advocated giving 25% of the fine amount as commission to the person who informs authorities of traffic violations, especially parking of vehicles on roads and in no-parking areas. According to Gadkari, this move will ease the workload of police personnel. Highlighting achievements of NHAI, Gadkari said the national road agency has constructed 20 roads across the country which can also be used as airstrips for landing planes. “Besides, 450 helipads will be constructed as amenities alongside national highways. This facility will help in reaching timely medical help by using air-ambulances across the country,” he said. Under this iRasta project, Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fleet of vehicles will be equipped with collision avoidance technology that can reduce accidents and near misses by up to 60%. Sensors in this technology will also help map the dynamic risk of the entire road network (grey spot map) for the first time. Road maintenance agencies can use such information to prevent accident-prone zones (black spots) before they claim lives. Project iRASTE will conduct a detailed study to recommend engineering fixes for existing black spots and implement an AI-powered system for continuous monitoring of road infrastructure quality. “Project iRASTE uniquely leverages the expertise and capabilities of all the partners,” said director general of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Dr Shekhar Mande. Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India and vice president, Intel Foundry Services and Prof P J Narayanan, Director, IIIT-Hyderabad also addressed the audience. Gadkari, however, said that the cost of the artificial intelligence unit (Rs 35,000) is not much affordable for agencies like NMC, MSRTC etc. Price of technology should be reachable for common citizens too, he said. The AI system has been installed in 30 Aapli Buses of Hansa Travels Group Nagpur as a pilot project. “We have installed 30 units in our Hingna depot buses and data generated by the software is very helpful for drivers and authorities to identify heat zones (high traffic time and spots ) and black spots and precautionary alarm and training to drivers will help in accident reduction thereby saving many lives,” said Adit Chhajed of Hansa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/crash-severity-of-city-higher-than-mumbai-says-gadkari/articleshow/86128480.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The PM Svanidhi Yojna is a dedicated loan scheme for street vendors. Only those street vendors who have taken a loan of Rs 10,000 under the PM Svanidhi Yojna scheme of the Central government, will be eligible. The Government of India has engaged PayTM as digital payment aggregator (DPA) for Chandigarh under this initiative. The civic body authority has planned a comprehensive training and education programme for street vendors falling under the PM Svanidhi Yojna. According to records of the civic body authority, which they shared with the Government of India, Chandigarh has disbursed loan of Rs 2.64 crore to 2,653 vendors so far under the PM Svanidhi Yojna and 2,880 applications have been sanctioned. Also, 4,466 applications of street vendors have been mobilised for loans after completion of specified processes and norms. Since banks play a vital role in the exercise to disburse the loan amount, they have worked closely with the municipal corporation for collation of data, verification of vendors, their category etc. Through this scheme, the MC has also conducted socio-economic profiling of all PM Svanidhi Yojna beneficiaries. This exercise is aimed at collecting data of beneficiaries and their family members, so that their involvement can later be secured in other schemes initiated by the Government of India. Minute details of the beneficiaries and their family members is being recorded in this socio-economic survey. Since the loan amount is just Rs 10,000 initially, it was very difficult for the MC to convince street vendors. As the civic body had the exact data and location of the vendors, employees camped at street vending sites and informed vendors about the benefits of the PM Svanidhi Yojna. The forms were filled and the processes completed on the spot. The MC works as a bridge between vendors and banks. The monthly exemption of Rs 500 vending fee drew more vendors to sign up for the scheme. Training from Sept 15MC commissioner Anindita Mitra said, “Since PayTM is the aggregator selected by the Government of India, we had a talk with their local manager and are going to start training of vendors from September 15 to bring them on digital board. Out of 10,930 registered street vendors of the city, 2,394 are already using the digital platform, but there is a large gap, which has to be filled. We are trying to reach each and every vendor in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-all-set-to-bring-street-vendors-on-digital-platform-under-goi-scheme/articleshow/86126456.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Aurangabad||Two suspects booked for duping man of Rs 2.5 lakh in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad city police has registered a case of cheating against two suspects, who allegedly duped a man to the tune of Rs2.5 lakh. According to the complaint, the suspects Shaikh Nadeem, residing behind Seema Doodh Dairy, and Khaled Khan, a resident of Al Tamash Colony, allegedly collected an advance from 38-year old Subhan Khan, a milkman by profession, by agreeing to sell a plot to him. However, the suspects sold off the same plot to another person and later refused to repay the advance payment to the complainant. Based on the complaint lodged by Subhan Khan, the City Chowk police station has registered a case. Police inspector Ashok Giri, citing the previous criminal record of Nadeem, said that the accused has faced inquiries and even cheating offences for allegedly duping people on the pretext of selling them properties. In this particular case, the suspects had agreed to sell off the plot, measuring 600 square feet and situated in Harsul area’s survey number 207/P, for a total of Rs8 lakh. The transaction was carried out around February 15. At the time, the complainant had agreed to pay the remaining amount, Rs5.50 lakh, to the suspects on March 30, this year. However, after he reached out to the suspects on the given date, the complainant discovered that the said plot had already been sold to someone else. Khan started seeking back his money, but the suspects continued to evade him. Left with no option, he reached out to the police and lodged a complaint against the two men, following which the police carried out a preliminary inquiry and finally registered the offence on Friday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/two-suspects-booked-for-duping-man-of-rs-2-5l/articleshow/86123206.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Clear encroachments from gauchar land: SC||AHMEDABAD: The Supreme Court has ordered the state government to remove all encroachments from the gauchar land in Mehsana district’s Bhandu village with observation that gauchar land can be used only for which it is permitted to be used. There were 72 encroachers on the land, including the brother of petitioner Ramesh Chaudhari. The constructions include a Hanumanji temple, a gram panchayat-run anganwadi and a dairy run by the village’s cooperative society. The apex court has directed “to bring the land in conformity with its use by the state government taking appropriate action within maximum period of three months” and asked the government to submit a report to court’s registry. The SC was moved through advocate Sejal Mandavia after the Gujarat high court dismissed Chaudhari’s PIL for removal of encroachment. In 2019, the HC dismissed the petition after the authorities submitted that all the people occupying the grazing land unauthorizedly were from low-income group and residing there for years together. After perusal of documents, the SC came to conclusion that only three persons were eligible for rehabilitation. It said, “It is trite to say that gauchar land can be used only for purposes for which it is permitted to be used. If there is a user contrary to the permissible user, whether by the state or by any third party, the same cannot go on. Rehabilitation of persons is really not required in the present case as only three persons are entitled to an alternative site as per rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/clear-encroachments-from-gauchar-land-sc/articleshow/86126496.cms||---
---||Nashik||Over 3k face power cuts in Nashik’s commercial hub||Nashik: Over 3,000 consumers of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), who either reside in the Wakil Wadi, Ashok Stambh, and MG Road areas of Nashik city or have commercial establishments there, are have been facing erratic power supply for the past 10-12 days. The consumers in these areas are vexed with the frequent power cuts — ranging from one to five times a day — and prolonged power outages that range from two to eight hours during the night. “There is no particular time when the power supply goes off. It could be early in the morning, at noon, or even in the middle of the night. It affects our daily work, including business and schooling,” said Raghunandan Mujumdar, a resident of Wakil Wadi, said. On Friday, the power supply went off at 11pm and returned only at 7am on Saturday. While small shops and establishments have battery back-ups, many residential consumers don’t have such facilities. Nashik superintendent engineer D H Padalkar admitted that the problem has aggravated over the past few days, but pinned the blame on the digging work being carried out by the Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation to lay roads. The road works have apparently damaged the underground cables, which the MSEDCL staff must repair. “The contractors cut and dig the space, and snap the power lines that need repairs. This takes not less than two hours. If it is raining, the duration automatically increases. Also, at other times, they ask for power outages ranging from two to four hours for their work. We have asked the authorities to plan a way out in favour of the consumers,” Padalkar said. Chief executive officer of the corporation Sumant More, in turn, said there have been some issues that need to be fixed. “There are issues of the Nashik Municipal Corporation and the MSEDCL as well, whose underground utilities criss-cross the region where the smart city projects are being implemented. We have now decided to meet on the second Tuesday of every month to iron out the issues for the smooth execution of the work,” More added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-3k-face-power-cuts-in-nashiks-commercial-hub/articleshow/86123174.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three PF staff loot Rs 2.7 crore, pay needy persons Rs 10,000 to use their docus||MUMBAI: CBI registered a fraud case against three officials of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) for allegedly fraudulently withdrawing Rs 2.71 crore in bogus members’ names. Recently, the EPFO received an email from an sunknown person who alleged that one Sangeeta Raghuvanshi of Ghaziabad was committing a fraud by withdrawing EPF amounts of closed companies and one example was Mumbai-based B Vijay Kumar Jewellers which had closed its business in 2009. The email sender claimed that Sangeeta obtained Aadhar Card, Pan card and bank passbooks of needy persons by paying each Rs 10,000. These documents were allegedly used to show them as staff of closed firms in EPF records and withdraw money in their name. The internal vigilance department of EPFO found that three EPFO officials — Chandan Sinha, senior social security assistant at regional office in Kandivali; Uttam Tagaray (assistant provident fund commissioner) regional office Coimbatore and Vijay Jarpe (assistant provident fund commissioner) office Tambaram in Chennai were involved in the fraud. It also found that Chandan Sinha’s salary account was credited with Rs 30 lakh, although the salary receipt was Rs 13 lakh during the one-year period when the fraud was committed. It led them to suspect that Sinha earned remaining money fraudulently. The vigilance wing submitted a complaint with its report to CBI for action. It is alleged that the three officials, along with some unknown accused persons, manipulated the internal system of EPF and withdrew money by submitting bogus claims after showing them as employees of closed companies between March 2020 and July 2021. The accused officials would create member ID on name of bogus members with zero balance. Afterwards they misused the exceptional provision of automated EPF accounting software, Appendix F, which is a special functionality provided in the software to rectify accounting problem. The accused would use this provision to log in the software and then reflect between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3.5 lakh against the name of each bogus account. Afterwards, physical EPF claim has been submitted to EPFO office for these bogus members after opening bank accounts in their name at different places including Mumbai, Gorakhpur, Nashik, Deolali, Patna, Ghaziabad and Mathura. Sinha, with help of other two officials, got those claims cleared and they allegedly shared the money along with other unknown accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-pf-staff-loot-rs-2-7cr-pay-needy-persons-rs-10k-to-use-their-docus/articleshow/86129989.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Can’t compare Uttar Pradesh, Kerala police, D Raja doesn’t know, says Kanam Rajendran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran has aired open criticism against the party national general secretary D Raja for passing comments that endorsed the statements made by Annie Raja against Kerala police. “No parallels can be drawn between UP and Kerala police. D Raja doesn’t know that,” Kanam said, adding that nobody is above criticism in the Communist party. Addressing a news conference after the CPI state council meeting, Kanam here on Saturday said that there was nothing wrong in criticizing individuals in Communist party. “The statements of Annie Raja were rejected by the national executive. Nothing stops one from criticizing the party general secretary. Be it the national secretary or chairman, all are supposed to fall in the party line,” Kanam said. UP and Kerala police are different. If at all there were some minor lapses on the part of Kerala police, the same have been addressed effectively, he added. “The reaction of D Raja on Annie Raja’s statement was not based on the opinion of the national executive,” Kanam said. Soon after the national executive meeting, Raja had said that the failure of police should be criticized irrespective of whether it happens in UP or in Kerala. The CPI state executive and the council have witnessed strong criticism against the comments passed by party general secretary D Raja and his wife and general secretary of national forum for Indian women. Kanam had apprised the central leadership about the state unit’s displeasure over Annie Raja’s observation that an RSS gang was working furtively in Kerala Police, while accusing the state police of not doing enough for the protection of the rights and safety of women and children. “CPI is a party where even the party chairman Dange was subjected to criticism. The common spirit of the deliberations in the state council and executive would be conveyed to D Raja. A national secretariat member has been entrusted with that task,” Kanam said. The state executive has asked Binoy Viswom to convey the state unit’s feelings to the national general secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cant-compare-up-kerala-police-d-raja-doesnt-know-kanam/articleshow/86128667.cms||---

This was the scene in November last year when Maharashtra state education department and Unicef India launched the Firtey granthalaya (roaming library) and Goshtincha Shanivaar (Storytelling Saturday) in remote villages of districts like Gadchiroli, Palghar etc. The deadly second wave and the monsoon did put a brake on the initiative, but it still continued in a handful of places in Gadchiroli. Teachers or some NGO volunteers would pick a book from their bicycle library and start reading out to kids in villages. Speaking to TOI recently, Rajeshwari Chandrasekar, chief of field office in Unicef Maharashtra said this initiative received a good response. Vinit Padmawar, a zilla parishad school teacher, said, “It’s a wonderful initiative and we have taken it a step further. Students are asked to pick up books and start reading. We have these reading sessions for at least an hour to help them gain confidence and become familiar with words and texts.” Seeing a library on bicycle is quite an attraction for kids, said Padmawar. “Small fairs in villages often have sellers loading their wares on a cycle. So, the balloons would be tied to a cycle or a basket of snacks would be tied to the carrier. So, the cycle and anything carried on it immediately attracts the attention of students,” said Padmawar. While TOI had earlier covered the success of Goshtincha Shanivaar, the roaming library part of the project did not get as much limelight as it deserved. During lockdown, students in remote villages were on the verge of dropping out of the schooling ecosystem and it was worse for the smaller kids who had just about started getting exposure of formal education. Padmawar said, “For young kids of Std I-IV, it’s important to keep them engaged in a creative way. Reading will be fun for them if the content is interesting, and nothing better than stories. We would read these fun stories to them and every single child would be engrossed in the process.” In rural areas schools have reopened for Std VIII-XII and this initiative is now a part of their daily routine. A school teacher from Gadchiroli said, “After the morning assembly or the first period, we ask them to take books from the library and then talk about it with their friends. If they read, they will be more connected to school and, thus, have a better chance of succeeding in life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/library-on-bicycle-attracts-tribal-kids-to-world-of-books/articleshow/86128602.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man who hurled iron flute at judge gets 5 years in jail||MUMBAI: A 60-year-old man, brother of a murder victim, who arrived in Dindoshi sessions court dressed like a lawyer, screamed out ‘Lord Krishna.. aaj Krishna ka janam hua hai” and flung an iron flute at a jugde, hurting a stenographer in the bargain, has been sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment after he pleaded guilty. The accused, Omkarnath Pandey, an Andheri resident, claimed that he was stressed about his younger brother’s murder, the trial of which was on in court. He has been in jail since the incident in January, 2020. The sessions court refused to grant him “extra leniency” despite the guilty plea, observing that it will be failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has been committed not only against the individual victim but also against society. “The punishment to be awarded for a crime must not be irrelevant but it should conform to and be consistent with the atrocity and brutality with which the crime has been perpetrated, the enormity of the crime warranting public abhorrence and it should “respond to the society’s cry for justice against the criminal,” the court said. The accused was found guilty of offences relating to using criminal force and voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty. Maximum term for the offences is five years imprisonment. Pandey was also found guilty of cheating by impersonation for which he was also awarded the maximum sentence of three years in jail. “Iron flute... be sent to district magistrate for disposal by following due process of law after the appeal period is over. Black coloured coat and white band, being worthless, be destroyed after the appeal period is over,” the court said. The incident took place on January 2, 2020. It was alleged that around 11.15 am, wearing an advocate’s black coat and white band around his neck, Pandey entered courtroom 10 and uttered the words aloud. The flute he threw at the judge sitting on the dais hit stenographer Shreya Vichare on the back and she sustained minor injuries. An FIR was lodged at Kurar police station and Pandey was arrested the same day. Earlier this month, the matter had been posted for framing of charges. However, he sent word to the court from jail that he wanted to plead guilty. On September 4, Pandey was produced via video-conference. He iterated that he wanted to plead guilty to the charges. When an accused pleads guilty he forfeits his right to a trial. The court said it was clear that Pandey had committed the offence with an intention and knowledge to assault the judge by throwing the iron flute towards him to deter and prevent him from discharging his duty as a public servant. Pandey was also fined Rs 8,000 of which Rs 5,000 will be given to Vichare as compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-who-hurled-iron-flute-at-judge-gets-5-years-in-jail/articleshow/86130007.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The village once contributed about 40% of the total paddy cultivated in Trivandrum was once known as the ‘Krishigramam of Poovachal panchayath’. People from different places used to come to the village to buy crops. Over the years paddy gave way to bananas and other vegetables. Now, an organisation called Nanma (nature affectionate noblest movement and association) is at the helm of reviving paddy cultivation in the village. Pradeep, a member of Nanma, along with six other farmers have started paddy cultivation in the village, and are planning to cultivate traditional Kerala paddy ‘chennellu’. Earlier, the land for paddy farming was used to cultivate vegetables and banana plants. Marking the beginning of the revival the field was ploughed on September 6 to turn it into land suitable for paddy cultivation. Biju Kumar Pottayil, the landowner where now the paddy is being cultivated, has promised that he will continue to give the land for paddy cultivation only. “There are many paddy fields in Kerala, but no one is farming the traditional varieties. I am trying to reclaim our legacy. We hope that paddy farming will be spread to all parts of Kerala. Let the coming generations witness our rich heritage,'' said Pradeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/krishigramam-to-re-claim-paddy-farming/articleshow/86126610.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Four booked for selling fake TDR in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Aurangabad city police have registered a case of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against four suspects for allegedly moving a proposal seeking Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation. Later, they used the same documents to sell this TDR to a businessman. The alleged cheating took place between October 2016 and August 2019. It is said to be one of the many fraudulent transactions related to TDR that have allegedly been committed in the past few years. City chowk inspector Ashok Giri told TOI, “The suspect moved the proposal seeking TDR against a piece of land that had never been acquired by the civic body.” The offence against the suspects has been registered on the complaint lodged by 35-year-old Afroz Khan, a resident of Sharif Colony, Roshan Gate area of the city. The suspects, citing that the TDR for acquired land was pending before the civic body authorities, sold it for Rs 15 lakh to Khan. The incident came to light after Khan reached out to the authorities for getting the TDR transferred to his property he intended to develop.

Police said the offence has been registered after carrying out a preliminary probe into the case. “We are in the process of arresting the suspects, who appear to have hatched criminal conspiracy in forging of TDR documents and duping this person,” said Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/four-booked-for-selling-fake-tdr-in-aurangabad/articleshow/86123273.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Selvamuthu of Jibin Bhavan at Kandamthitta is the deceased. Police have taken his wife Sumalatha into custody on suspicion of committing the crime. The police said they suspect the murder might have happened around 3 am. It was the wife who contacted close relatives and informed them about his death. There were two deep lacerated wounds on the neck of the deceased, apparently caused by being hacked repeatedly. The only other persons in the house were the couple's two sons, an autistic 16-year-old and a 10-year-old. The couple's elder son was pursuing a course in nursing in Bangalore. Police said Sumalatha was known to be someone with mental ailments. Though the police tried to record her statements, she gave random and incoherent replies to their questions. Hence, they have decided to seek the service of a psychologist to extract information from her. Until then, she would be kept under police surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-found-hacked-to-death/articleshow/86126674.cms||---

In the recent past, Congress promoted several leaders, but they ditched us,” he said, in a veiled reference to Pawar’s exit from the Congress. “I can only say that in the 2024 general elections, Congress will emerge as a largest party and form the government.” Patole said despite Pawar’s comment, there is no threat to the tripartite MVA government. “Pawar was instrumental in formation of the front. In fact, he has emerged a remote control of the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-will-form-govt-in-24-patole-on-pawars-zamindar-comment/articleshow/86130017.cms||---

She accused them of harassing her for dowry over the past 11 years. In her complaint, she said that she had married a computer software engineer in November 2009. “As my father abandoned us soon after my birth, my relatives pooled in money to conduct the marriage. I moved to the house in Ghatlodia and my in-laws began harassing me for not getting dowry from the second day of my marriage,” she told police. The complaint stated that they sent her back to her mother’s house in Vadodara merely 20 days after the wedding to get dowry. She told police, “My mother sold her gold ornaments and gave Rs 2 lakh in cash, a television, refrigerator and other items as dowry. However, the harassment resumed a few days later. In 2011, I was forced to go back to Vadodara. Later, though, my in-laws came there and we worked out a compromise.” She added, “The harassment, however, did not cease. In 2016, I consumed phenyl but survived. My husband and I began living separately in a house he purchased in Sola. Later, he transferred it to his mother’s name.” She said that two months ago, she underwent an operation at a hospital in Bopal but her in-laws refused to pay the amount of Rs 40,000. “My mother paid the money. When I returned home, my in-laws began harassing me again and threw me out of the house. Meanwhile, my husband moved in with his parents. Following this, I approached the police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sola-woman-harassed-for-dowry-files-plaint/articleshow/86126672.cms||---

The deceased is Basanagouda Shivalli, 35. The incident happened when he was riding to cheer his cyclist-friends who were part of a 200km endurance ride. Anand Baid, former chairman of Hubballi Bicycle Club (HBC) and the Hubballi representative for Audax Club Parisien (ACP, Paris), told STOI that 29 cyclists had registered for the endurance ride with the route being Hubballi-Shiggaon-Kittur-Hubballi. “Though Shivalli had not registered for the Saturday’s ride, he rode with his friends to cheer them,” he said, adding Shivalli had been the member of HBC for six years. He had done 50km in two hours, after which he developed chest pain. He was rushed to a primary health centre (PHC) in Shiggoan, where he breathed his last after 15 minutes, despite the doctors’ best attempts to save him. After doctors claimed that he died of cardiac arrest, his body was handed over to his family members. Baid also made it clear that they will not allow non-registered cyclists to take part in the event. “Shivalli came on his own just to cheer other participants. Organisers have nothing to do with this incident as they take an undertaking from registered cyclists about the risks involved. On their part, the participants ride by taking necessary precautions,” Baid explained. Sandeep Harapanahalli, architect and a close friend of Shivalli, recalled the latter’s association with Round Table India. “Being its members, were rode 1,500km in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa in December 2016 to raise funds for girls’ education,” he said, adding: “Though Shivalli had suffered pain in his left hand, he had not been diagnosed with any cardiac issue. He would been alerted by a pulse-rate monitoring device had been equipped with that during today’s ride.” Shivalli, who owned two shops of gifting articles in Hubbali, is survived by wife Asha, twin daughters aged six, and parents. To mark the Centenary 200 Bevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux (BRM), ACP had organised the endurance ride in association with affiliated clubs spread across India, including HBC in Hubballi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/hubballi-cyclist-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-while-riding-in-shiggaon/articleshow/86124729.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Surat||‘Surat major contender for MTP’||SURAT: Giving positive signals for the development of a Mega Textile Park (MTP) near the city, textile secretary, U P Singh on Saturday hinted that Surat has higher chances of getting the park. Speaking at the inaugural function of Weave Knitt exhibition organised by Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) in the city at Sarsana, Singh called it a challenge for any state government to develop a MTP. Weave Knitt initiative is aimed to provide a platform to weavers, knitters, technical textile and fabric manufacturer. Union minister of state for Textile and Railways, Darshana Jardosh, inaugurated the event, which was attended by Roop Rashi, textile commissioner and August Saptono, counsel general of Indonesia in Mumbai. The event was addressed by Abdul Matlub Ahmad, president of India Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bangladesh, through video conference. “MTP is a challenge for state governments to prove what they can do to set up a park and based on this it will be allotted. Surat is a major contender for MTP and requirement of 1,000 acre is one of the basic criteria,” said Singh, adding that the textile ministry will be discussing the MTP development with cabinet by the end of this month. Earlier, Ashish Gujarati, president of SGCCI, gave overview of Surat’s textile industry and presented demands to the textile minister and officials. “I am sure that with this visit the ministry will be convinced about the eligibility of Surat textile cluster,” said Gujarati. He also expressed need of Common Facility Centre (CFC) in Surat which should be developed as a centre of excellence for textile in the country. The event is being participated by 125 exhibitors while visitors have thronged from different parts of the country. Among attractions Tencel Luxe filament yarn which is being promoted as vegan silk was first time presented at the event. “It is interesting to see the vegan variety of silk and we should try branding it as Indian brand and someone suggested Ahinsa name for it,” said Jardosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-major-contender-for-mtp/articleshow/86127123.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Patna||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar not to attend INLD rally: JD(U)||PATNA: The JD(U) on Saturday said chief minister Nitish Kumar would not attend the rally of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) to be held in Haryana’s Jind on September 25 to mark the birth anniversary of former deputy PM and popular farmer leader Chaudhary Devi Lal. JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, however, said party’s national secretary general, K C Tyagi, would attend the rally. The rally, for which many top opposition leaders and regional satraps have been invited and some of them have already confirmed their presence, is being touted as the precursor to the formation of a non-BJP and non-Congress “third front” ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Speculations regarding Nitish attending the opposition’s anti-BJP political congregation at Jind were rife since Tuesday after INLD leader Abhay Chautala told mediapersons in Delhi that the Bihar CM, Samajwadi Party (SP) patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, former PM H D Deve Gowda and SAD supremo Parkash Singh Badal have confirmed their presence at the rally. Abhay had also said that NCP leader Sharad Pawar, TMC president and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and RLD leader Jayant Chowdhury have been invited for the Jind rally. Earlier, former Haryana CM and INLD patriarch Om Prakash Chautala had announced that he would contact opposition leaders across the country to forge a “third front” at the national level. The INLD patriarch had also said that before September 25, the birth anniversary of his father Chaudhary Devi Lal, he would try to meet opposition leaders and urge them to come on one platform. Putting all speculations to rest, Lalan on Saturday said though Nitish had a cordial relation with Devi Lal, he would not be able to attend the INLD’s Jind rally. “Nitishji had earlier attended many programmes to commemorate the works of Devi Lal, but this time he would not be able to go outside Bihar as he is engaged in making necessary preparations to fight the likely third wave of Covid pandemic, floods in north Bihar and viral fever among the children,” Lalan said. Lalan said the JD(U) had already informed Chautala that Nitish would not be able to join the rally. On August 1 this year, Nitish and Tyagi had called on Chautala at his residence in Gurugram, a month after the former Haryana CM’s release from Delhi’s Tihar Jail on July 2. The former CM of Haryana had been serving a 10-year sentence in connection with a recruitment scam. “There is no political agenda for my meeting with Om Prakash Chautala. I have respect for him. We have longstanding ties and I had said to meet him once I will be in Delhi. There isn't any political agenda for this meeting,” Nitish had then told the media after his meeting with the former CM of Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-not-to-attend-inld-rally-jdu/articleshow/86124830.cms||Madan Kumar

With this, all the four accused in the case have been arrested. Those arrested on Saturday are Shuhaib Kalady (39) of Chemanjery, Kozhikode and Lijas Shalimar (34) of Atholy. Their arrest was recorded by DSP K Sudrashan, the investigation officer. The duo had switched off their mobiles and had gone into hiding after reports about the rape became public. Police soon launched a manhunt for them and received information about their presence at a forest area at Thalayad in Kakkayam. “The location was in a valley amidst a hilly terrain. Police surrounded the location in the early hours of Saturday. However, the accused attacked the policemen and tried to escape further into the forest. They were chased down and overpowered by police,” said police adding that reasonable force had to be used to take them into custody. The accused were brought to the apartment where the crime happened later in the day for evidence collection. Police had to struggle to get them to safety after a violent mob, mostly activists of political outfits staging protests, tried to attack them. Meanwhile, police are also investigating the functioning of the apartment complex where the crime happened. Details of those who booked rooms here are also being analysed, sources said. The accused had gang raped the woman after giving her alcohol and drugs at the flat. The other two accused, Atholi residents Ajnas KA (36) and Fahad NP (36), were arrested on Friday. According to police, Ajnas got close to the woman after meeting her on TikTok. On the pretext of a romantic relationship, he lured her to come to Kozhikode and the woman arrived in Kozhikode by train on Wednesday night. Later, Ajnas, along with Fahad, took her to the flat in Fahad’s car. According to police, Ajnas sexually assaulted the women and later called in the other accused who were waiting in the adjacent room. They raped her after forcibly giving her alcohol and drugs. The accused also filmed the act on a mobile phone. Police said that the accused brutally assaulted the woman.

---||Mumbai||Trial in Saki Naka rape-murder to be fast-tracked, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: Condemning the brutal rape and murder of a woman at Saki Naka, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced a fast-track trial in the case while directing Mumbai police to expedite the investigation and ensure that chargesheet in the case is filed within a month. Deeming the incident a “disgrace to humanity”, Thackeray called for an urgent meeting of senior IPS officers from Mumbai on Saturday evening. The CM said Mumbai’s image of a safe city should not get tarnished. “Special prosecutors should be appointed for the case from tomorrow itself, without waiting for the case to be admitted in court. The harshest punishment should be sought for the culprits. We have to present a classic example of speedy justice, so that no one will dare to do such a thing again,” said Thackeray. The CM said all evidence, including forensic and electronic, should be properly submitted in court and there should be no lapses which will make the case weak. To make the city safer for women, Thackeray has directed setting up of ‘Nirbhaya’ squads with participation of women police officers even in police stations and they should patrol vulnerable areas of the city. Help should be taken from NGOs and homeless and alone women should be shifted to safer areas and police should keep a watch on these places, said Thackeray, adding a strict vigil must be maintained over sex predators and history-sheeters. Also, considering that CCTVs play an important part in watching over the city, the second phase of installing CCTVs in the city should be started soon to cover areas left out so far. Meanwhile, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said cases of crimes against women are being reported more frequently in the state. He demanded speedy trial in the cases and death penalty for the culprits. The CM should meet the Chief Justice of Bombay high court and demand a special fast-track court for this case, he said. “Although, it is for the court to decide the punishment, we demand that the culprits should be hanged,” said Fadnavis. He further said police morale is low due to controversies in their department. “When a disciplined police force is misused by the government to serve political and commercial interests, it dilutes the institution and impacts law and order,” he said.

With the demand for artificial and fashion jewellery growing, jewellers are now pinning hopes on women to fill the gap in labour supply. Over the past few months, Sitapura Gems and Jewellery Industries Association has trained and absorbed over 250 women in the core manufacturing process. The target is to skill and employ 2000but the Covid protocol of working at reduced capacity has slowed down training and deployment. Gaurav Jain, president of Sitapura Gems and Jewellery Association said, “Earlier, women were working as operators or designers. Now, we are preparing them in all the processes of manufacturing, including craftsmanship which was dominated by men.” He said in other countries like in Europe and China, a lot of women are engaged in the sector in all kinds of jobs roles. “They are highly skilled and as good as men, and sometimes better. We cannot always demand on workers from West Bengal because it has a limitation. That’s why the new women labour pool is very important for us.” Traditionally, security, systems and processes were major issues why women were not preferred in the core manufacturing. But companies have devised ways to mitigate the challenges. “Because we never focused on women, the infrastructure, systems and processes were not there. Since we cannot allow them with their traditional attire, the factories are giving dresses and created changing room facilities. Secondly, the focus is to have women from nearby areas so that they do not have to spend much time on traveling, given they are required to do other household jobs,” added Jain. Currently, 150-200 women are under the training process. The number of factories showing interest to hire women are growing. Most women labourers or crafts persons are engaged in artificial and fashion jewellery segment because the sector is growing fast and order pipeline is growing robust. “The system is working out well. More and more companies are willing to hire women for the core manufacturing jobs because the fashion jewellery segment requires more labour and the demand for products is also increasing. We do not have large training facilities but by the end of December this year, the factories would have hired 500 trained women,” added Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gender-bender-women-enter-jewellery-making/articleshow/86128790.cms||---

The child suffered injuries to her knees and elbows and was rescued by a passerby who also informed her parents. Finding the cabbie guilty, special Pocso Judge Jayshri R Pulate said, “In the present case, ‘M’ was11 years old at the time of the incident and while she was returning from school, the acccused committed the act of inappropriately touching her thighs. Such an act created fear in M’s mind and she had no other option but to jump from the running taxi. Hence, I do not find that the accused is entitled to much leniency.” The cabbie was also fined Rs 10,000. “Out of the fine, Rs 5,000 be given to the victim, as compensation, after the appeal period is over,” the court said. The accused said he was falsely implicated. He said he was sick that day and was at home. He claimed that because of his age, he was caught by the police from the hospital. Among the five witnesses cited by special public prosecutor Sanjana Sharma to seek conviction were the minor, the man who helped her, the school nurse who tended to her injuries and the police. The child told the court she jumped out of the cab in front of one her school gates. A man immediately came to her rescue. The accused has been in jail since his arrest in 2016.

The missing five are being presumed drowned. The Vindhyachal police arrested the boatman and photographers for putting pressure on the family from Ranchi for a boat ride. Mirzapur SP Ajay Kumar said, “The boatman Gautam and photographer Pradeep Nishad of Tiwaripur area were arrested by Vindhyachal police from Amrawati crossing on Saturday morning.

On September 8, Rajesh Tiwari from Ghuraha, Ranchi, in Jharkhand and his relative Vikas Kumar Ojha of Buxar had reached Vindhyachal with their 10 family members and a driver to offer prayers at the shrine. Before going to the temple, they went to Akhada Ghat to bathe in the holy Ganga when Gautam and Pradeep convinced them to take a boat ride to the opposite bank.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Students should learn all concepts, ideologies, says Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has supported the inclusion of books by VD Savarkar and MS Golwarkar in the syllabus of Kannur University. There should be opportunities for children to study different ideologies, said the governor who is also the chancellor of the university. “The beauty of Indian culture is its diversity. The students should have every opportunity to learn and understand all concepts and ideologies. This would only benefit the students in developing their knowledge skills. This is helping students to improve their thought process which can help in contributing to the development of the country. This is a recognised fact in society,” said the governor while speaking to the media here on Saturday. He was reacting to the controversy over the alleged saffronisation in the syllabus of Kannur University. “Only those who have the capacity to come with innovative ideas can progress in the world. People who feel uncomfortable with the study of diverse views are causing loss to themselves,” he said. The governor said that intolerance is being expressed by those who are unwilling to learn different perspectives and the right way is to express disagreement after understanding things. “Every ideology should be studied to develop more creative thoughts. Apart from opposing something blindly, the people should study the facts,” he said. There has been widespread protests against the decision of Kannur University in including the books of the RSS ideologues in the postgraduate course. Hence, an expert panel has been constituted to review the controversial syllabus. The chief minister had also expressed strong reservations over the inclusion of these texts. He had said that the government was not ready to glorify the people who had no role in the freedom struggle of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/students-should-learn-all-concepts-ideologies-guv/articleshow/86128851.cms||---

This has been proved true by Sitaram Srivastava, a retired official of Provident Fund Department, aged 84. His wish to pursue LLB has been approved by Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University. He had completed his BA course in 1962. When Srivastava expressed his desire to study law it was quickly approved by Vice Chancellor, Professor Vinay Pathak. Srivastava would now be taking admission in city’s VSSD Degree college to pursue LLB. A resident of Nawabganj in Kanpur, Srivastava retired in 1995. He lost his wife in 1998 and blamed SGPGI in Lucknow for her death. He said that it was due to the negligence of SGPGI that he lost his wife. To seek justice, Srivastava filed a case in this regard in the Consumer Court. It took him 20 years to win the case as Supreme Court ruled in his favour, Srivastava said. “From Consumer Forum to Supreme Court, my fight for justice continued for 20 years. It finally ended in 2018 when I won the case against the hospital in Supreme Court. It is in these 20 years, my interest in law developed and now I finally decided to pursue LLB”, said Sitaram Srivastava. Prof Pathak said that he was extremely delighted to see the commitment in Sitaram Ji that he wanted to study even at this age. “Age is just a number. When Sitaram Ji told me that he wanted to pursue LLB, I immediately agreed to it, keeping in mind his eagerness, commitment and passion towards it.” Sitaram said that it was better for him to study as he was free for whole day long. “Instead of sitting ideal at home, it would be better for me to do something. So I chose to study”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/84-yr-old-retired-official-to-pursue-llb-from-csjm-university/articleshow/86128845.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Pratap Nagar SHO Balveer Singh said six students of MBBS of RUHS (Rajasthan University of Health Sciences), two students of a veterinary college and two kingpins were part of a 10 member gang held from a hotel in Haldi Ghati area. Sikar police seized N95 masks stitched with mics connected with wireless earpieces from an 11-member gang involved in cheating NEET aspirants by promising to field dummy candidates. Police said the accused had used N95 masks hoping that no one was going to check masks at examination centres. The NEET-UG is scheduled for Sunday. SP Kunwar Rashtradeep said police had received information about a gang that was preying on NEET aspirants. A special team was constituted that arrested the 11 identified as Dinesh Bajiya, Ramesh Kumar, Naresh Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Virendra Choudhary, Om Prakash, Harish Kumar, Anoop Choudhary, Rajendra Sharma, Venkatesh Prasad and Dinesh Kumar. Sikar police discovered that the accused had purchased several N95 masks and cleverly stitched advanced communication devices inside the masks which could be used to attend calls. “These were stiffed in N95 masks. The gang hid a small battery-operated speaking device in one of the mask’s layers. We also recovered micro earpieces which could not be easily spotted from afar because they fit deep into ears,” Rashtradeep said. According to SP, the gang had purchased devices from an online shopping website. “The small device fitted into the mask has a nano sim and a battery and works as a receptor. The device can attend an incoming call with the press of a button,” Rashtradeep said.

The woman told police that the accused thrashed her and even tried to strangle her when she put up strong resistance. They escaped after dumping her on the highway from the moving car. The woman reached the nearby Jajmau police out-post with the help of locals, but the in-charge allegedly refused to lodge her complaint. Talking to reporters, the woman said that the cops at the Jajmau police outpost refused to go to Chamanganj police station instead. “I roamed around the whole night in search of justice,” she added. Chakeri police station in-charge Madhur Mishra, however, told mediapersons that he has not yet received any complaint of this nature. “Action will certainly be taken after lodging a case on the complaint from the victim,” said Mishra. The woman told reporters that she is a native of Lucknow and works in a private firm in the city. She lives on rent in Nawabganj. She said that a few months ago she had met a youth, who hails from Chamanganj area of the city, through a common friend and they started meeting each other often gradually. “A few days ago, I found that he was in a relationship with another woman also and stopped talking to him,” she said. On Friday night, a friend of the youth called her and said he was coming in a car to meet her in Nawabganj. As soon as she sat in the car, the youth locked the car door. She then found her ex-lover, and his one more friend sitting in the car. Then one of them turned off the lights of the car and increased the volume of music, the woman alleged in her complaint. “I pleaded with them to let me go, but in vain. Then I started screaming loudly following which one of them tried to strangle me and assaulted me. Then they tried to rape me in the moving car. When they failed to assault me, they threw me out of the moving car on the highway near Jajmau check post and fled,” she alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-resists-rape-bid-thrown-out-of-moving-car/articleshow/86128875.cms||---

The incident took place on Saturday at 10pm when the girl and her friends, all Ulhasnagar residents, had returned from Shirdi and were using the skywalk to reach their homes. A senior official from Kalyan said, “After the accused allowed the girl to leave in the morning, she first approached Hill Line police station and then Vithalwadi police station where she was instructed that since the crime had occurred in our jurisdiction, she should go to our Kalyan GRP station.” Valmik Shardul, senior police inspector of Kalyan GRP, said, “We have arrested the accused for rape, assault and Pocso Act sections.” The arrested accused has multiple body offences-related cases against him. This is the second case of rape within three months in an isolated railways area. In July, a 27-year-old speech-and-hearing-impaired woman was allegedly raped in the railway quarters at Kalyan.

Nitin, Mandaviya, Rupala, Zadafia, Praful Patel in race for Gujarat CM post||It may be a coincidence but when CM Vijay Rupani handed over his resignation, merely hours after PM e-inaugurated the high-profile Sardardham Bhavan built by the influential Patidar community, the chatter became louder that a Patidar is set to be the next CM of Gujarat. It may be another coincidence that all the names of frontrunners to replace Rupani are Patel leaders. These include outgoing deputy CM Nitin Patel, Union ministers Mansukh Mandaviya and Parshottam Rupala, state agriculture minister R C Faldu, ex-MoS home Gordhan Zadafia and administrator of Lakshadweep UT Praful Patel. BJP state president C R Paatil, a non-Patidar, was also named to be in the fray but he sent out a video message late on Saturday saying he was not in the reckoning.

"But it is impossible to say who will be the chief minister as the decision will be taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi," a party leader said. "Party leadership can always spring a surprise," the leader added. Read AlsoVijay Rupani quitting as CM of Gujarat part of BJP’s image ‘makeover’BJP continues with its strategy of image “makeover” with surprise decisions as Vijay Rupani, who resigned as Gujarat chief minister on Saturday, being the fourth CM to quit office after BS Yeddyurappa (Karnataka) and Trivendra Singh Rawat (Uttarakhand) resigned in the past few months.Like in August 2016, when Anandiben Patel resigned as chief minister, there was talk that Nitin Patel would succeed her, but in a last-minute decision, Rupani was picked for the top post. The demand to make Nitin Patel chief minister began to trend on social media immediately after Rupani’s resignation. There were many who felt that the party should reward Patel for his unflinching, loyal stint with the party wherein he sportingly suffered the setback of being relegated to No. 2 after his candidature was almost final in 2016. Read AlsoWhy Vijay Rupani may have resigned as Gujarat CM and who could be his successorNEW DELHI: In a sudden and unexpected move, Vijay Rupani resigned as the chief minister of Gujarat on Saturday ahead of assembly elections in the state due late next year. Rupani is the fourth BJP chief minister to be axed this year after BS Yediyurappa (Karnataka), Tirth Singh Rawat (Uttarakhand)For the past many months now, pressure is being built on BJP leadership to name a Patidar CM. Given the focus of state party leadership to win 150-plus seats out of 182 assembly seats, the party is likely to accede as the Patidar quota stir is a thing of past and it wants Patels — constituting 13% of the state population and its most-trusted vote bank — firmly on its side when the state goes to polls in 2022. Union health minister Mandaviya, who like Patel belongs to the influential Patidar community, is also considered a front-runner. A man of few words, this 49-year-old native of temple town Palitana in Bhavnagar, is trusted by both PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. A Leuva Patel, Mandaviya is also a young face and acceptable to the community. Former state BJP president and Union minister Parshottam Rupala hails from Saurashtra and has been one of the tallest Patidar leaders of the state. Former MoS home Gordhan Zadafia had briefly quit the BJP but is back and now a vice-president in state BJP. R C Faldu, another prominent Patidar leader from Saurashtra, is former state party president and current agriculture minister. Former MoS home Praful Khoda Patel is now administrator of the UTs of Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abki-baar-a-patidar/articleshow/86130049.cms||---

The serving system will also be changed so that they don’t have to wait in queue for food, plates in hand. The project has begun in Guna, the bastion of BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia. Here, 20 schools have already built dining tables. The target is to have the facility in 100 schools in 80 panchayats of the district, say sources. Minister for panchayat and rural development Mahendra Singh Sisodiya inaugurated the scheme on September 8 and said it would be extended across the state. So far, government school students used to have food on mats on the floor. Now, cement benches and tables are being built in schools under MGNREGA. These would double as study tables. It has cost Rs 7 lakh to build such tables in 20 schools, which means the Guna project is expected to cost Rs 35 lakh, said officials. Students are also being taught ‘table manners’. “Wherever children have to sit on the floor to have their meals, we will build tables. The scheme will be implemented in all the panchayats in the state,” the minister said. In Guna, the panchayats that already have dining tables in school include Berkhedi, Kishanpura, Suhaya, Baneh, Lodera and Kushopur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/midday-meals-in-mp-to-be-served-on-dining-tables/articleshow/86131500.cms||---

The drive was taken up following a high court order directing the civic body to ensure that all illegal encroachments are removed and file affidavits explaining steps taken on the matter. Alleging that they were not given any notice or informed about the proceedings, Mohammad Raees, a mobile shop owner in Nawab Sahab Kunta said, “They did not give us any notice or prior information about the drive. I took this shop for rent and set it up four years ago. No one raised any objection in all these years and now they have demolished everything even before we opened the shutters in the morning.” Adbul Moiz, a mechanic shop owner at Mehdipatnam said, “Almost half of my shop has been razed. They did not show any mercy even after I begged them to give me some time.” Many also questioned the officials about footpath encroachments by GHMC and other government departments across the city. “What about the public toilets and bus stops that GHMC has set up on footpaths across the city? Did they demolish those structures as well? Before targeting small vendors like us, they should set an example by removing their own encroachments that are causing inconvenience to thousands of people in the city,” said Parmesh Singh, a paan shop owner at Tolichowli. On the other hand, despite issuing identity cards to over 1.50 lakh small time vendors under the Prime Minister Street Vendors’ AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) and completing demarcation of 138 vending zones, no data is available on how many vendors have been shifted to the vending zones identified by GHMC. However, sources say that all these vendors do not come under the vending zone policy, which is reserved for hawkers alone. While agreeing that they did not give any prior notice to the vendors, MK Ali, GHMC deputy commissioner (Mehdipatnam) said, “The drive to remove these footpath encroachments has been going on for a while. We act as and when we receive orders from the town planning wing which has the exact details of the road dimensions. There is no need to give any notice to these occupants because they have set up these structures illegally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-starts-drive-to-raze-footpath-shops-in-old-city/articleshow/86128884.cms||---

Keesara police said that N Raji Reddy lodged a complaint on September 3 claiming that when he was being taken for a land transaction at Shamirpet by one Azam, three persons including a man wearing a police uniform, stopped the car. The searched the vehicle and found Raji Reddy in possession of Rs 5 lakh cash. They threatened to take action against him, accusing him of carrying unaccounted money. He was then made to get down from the car which they fled in along with Azam. Azam and his accomplice Bhagya Laxmi had assured Raji Reddy that they would get his money back but later changed their numbers and became inaccessible. “During investigation, we suspected that the complainant was not giving correct details. When we questioned him, he disclosed that he wanted to exchange his accounted money with black money,” Keesara inspector Narender Goud told TOI. The victim was told by Bhagya Lakshmi that for every Rs 1 lakh of his accounted money, they will give Rs 5 lakh of unaccounted money in Rs 2,000 denominations. Seeing a way to earn easy money, the victim withdrew Rs 5 lakh cash from his account. The accused got Rs 1 crore fake notes in Rs 2,000 denominations printed in Yousufguda.

---||Goa||AFC Champions League setback is now behind me: Noguera||Panaji: At FC Goa, everyone says there’s so much to like about Alberto Noguera, both on and off the field. For the staff, he’s among the nicest guys in the team. For players, he’s a top professional. So when FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando was forced to leave the midfielder out of his team for the all-important AFC Champions League last season, there was disappointment all around. It was tough for Noguera. After all, he had just won the award for the highest assists in Indian Super League (ISL) and always put his best foot forward, despite not being a regular. The Spanish midfielder, though, took the setback in his stride, and having been the first foreign player to join the team this season, is looking ahead. “I am not thinking of the past, only thinking of this season,” Noguera told TOI on Sunday. “The expectations are the same. I am here to help the team and give my hundred percent every time the coach and the team needs me.” Ferrando needed him for the Durand Cup opener against Army Green and he promptly delivered with a goal and an authoritative performance. With Noguera, whatever the field, it’s always hundred percent. “He was keenest to join pre-season, having never been out of football action for such a long time. He said rather than playing golf at home and running in parks, he would prefer to train with his teammates in Goa,” said Ravi Puskur, the club’s director of football. No wonder Noguera took the first flight out of Spain when he got his visa. “We have a good team. It’s good that we have retained foreign players. To have known teammates is good for us. We will face the new season with confidence,” said Noguera. Among the new faces at the club this season is Muhammed Nemil, a 19-year-old who plays in Noguera’s position and is making heads turn with his performances. The teenager debuted for Goa in the Durand Cup opener and his second-half performance made many take notice. Noguera had noticed the spark early in Nemil, who played in Spain’s lower divisions for the last two years. “He speaks Spanish, so that makes it very easy for us,” said Noguera. “I am trying to help him because I think he has a great future in India. He is improving with every training session that we do. He is giving his best and I am sure he will be an important player, if he continues this way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/afc-champions-league-setback-is-now-behind-me-noguera/articleshow/86150409.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The ATM breakers ran into the second barricade too only to realize it was put up by a road construction company to indicate undergoing work. The ATM breakers had met with an accident as their car got heavily damaged which helped the chasing MIDC police team of sub-inspector Rajesh Thakur to nab them.While Pathan was caught from the spot, his two accomplices managed to flee. Later in the day, Wadi police team under senior inspector Pradip Suryavanshi and detection branch incharge sub-inspector Sajid Ahmed managed to nab Pathan’s accomplice Shaikh, while another is yet to be netted.The drama unfolded after Wadi police beat Marshalls, constables Dilip Ade and Shrikant Kanojiya, spotted some suspicious movement near some shops and an ATM at Wardhaman Nagar chowk. The cops were returning after scanning their QR codes on patrolling mobile app when they spotted the suspects.As the suspects fled at top speed seeing the advancing cops, it was learnt that they nearly broke a front panel of an ATM near Wadhhamna chowk.The beat marshalls, whose alert intervention prevented the ATM theft, managed to notedown the registration number of the suspects’ car and informed the police control room.MIDC police’s night duty team had realized that the ATM breakers were likely to have fled towards their jurisdiction and soon spread out for a search operation. It’s learnt the fleeing ATM breakers first dashed a police vehicle before ramming into their barricade in an attempt to evade arrest.Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan said the suspects have been arrested by Wadi police and are being quizzed now.Police said Pathan had an offence of assault while Shaikh too had crime records at Khaparkheda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/atm-breakers-nabbed-after-a-dramatic-chase/articleshow/86124959.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nashik||Nashik murder convict, who jumped parole 23 years ago, held||NASHIK: The city police on Friday arrested a murder case convict, who had jumped parole 23 years ago, following a chance tip-off about the man living in Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district with a fictitious name and surviving as a “vada pav” vendor. Ravindra Pande (62) was one of the five persons of the “Birju Gij and Ravindra Pande” gang convicted for the kidnap, assault and murder of Vaibhav Katyare (16) for ransom on September 15, 1992. An offence was registered with the Nashik Road police under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and also the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (TADA) Act for the kidnap and murder of a minor. A court had subsequently found five persons, including Pande, guilty of the offence and awarded them life imprisonment. The police said the Supreme Court had also approved of their life imprisonment. Pande, who was serving his sentence at the Nashik Road Central Prison, had gone on a 14-day parole leave on February 18, 1998. However, he had not returned to the jail since then. An offence under Section 224 (resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension) was accordingly registered at the Deolali Camp police station. The Nashik city police recently received information that Pande was in Ahmedabad and staying there with a fictitious name. Acting on the information, a four-member team, led by inspector Ananda Wagh of the crime branch (Unit II) left for Ahmedabad. Wagh said the team spent two days in search of Pande in different talukas of Ahmedabad district. Tracing Pande had also become difficult, as he was staying there with a changed name. The police finally traced Pande to Kuha village in Daskroi taluka of Ahmedabad district. When the police team approached Pande, he identified himself as Rajubhai Jadhav, alias Fauji. He also told the police that he had no connection with the murder. The police said following interrogation, he finally admitted that he was Pande. On September 15, 1992, Vaibhav, the grandson of Kantilal Katyare, a trader by profession, was kidnapped by the gang of “Birju Gij and Ravindra Pande”. The kidnappers had called up the boy’s parents and demanded a ransom of Rs2 lakh. But the following day, Vaibhav’s body was recovered from a farmhouse in Deolali Camp. Over the next few months, the police arrested five persons in the case. The accused were found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1994.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-minors-murder-convict-who-jumped-parole-arrested-after-23-yrs/articleshow/86123463.cms||Santosh Sonawane

However, due to lack of coordination among these agencies, many city roads have become accident-prone spots, found a study by NGO Janakrosh.In a letter to Member of Parliament Road Safety Committee, the NGO has urged to appoint a nodal agency for seamless coordination between these agencies to ensure better road infrastructure in Nagpur, Janakrosh vice-president Ashok Karandikar told TOI.Many other authorities for utilities like electricity, water, drainage, telecommunications, internet services need to use roads and roadside land. Even others like horticulture and state transport departments have a claim on road land.Each organization appears to be working within its four walls with little knowledge about how their work overlaps and affects the roads and road users in Nagpur, the study found.“Therefore, road users see a spate of problems like new roads being laid at a level higher than surrounding areas, causing unlimited approach and drainage problems during rains,” Karandikar said.The NGO found that at intersections — the four roads are owned by more than one organization, each is at independent level — there is great driving discomfort and risk in addition to water accumulation problem during rains.Citing an example of Shankar Nagar Square, Karandikar said WHC Road is being maintained by NMC while North Ambazari road by the state PWD.There are many more such services causing inconvenience to the users due to lack of coordination between different authorities/agencies and absence of a nodal authority.“As far as the citizens are concerned, they need good, smooth, strong roads with full safety features throughout the year for many years. They are not concerned as to which government organization has built or authorized its planning, design, construction and maintenance and from where the funds came,” the NGO stated.“Legally speaking, the responsibility and power to make roads is that of the municipality. Therefore, NMC cannot shake off its responsibility to give citizens good roads by citing presence of other organizations in the field,” it said.NMC must realize and accept the role of other organizations as similar to that of guest artists who will come and go, but it has to remain in Nagpur and be always accountable to citizens.As far as the state administration is concerned, it has to authorize, enable and empower NMC by building capacity within it to act as a nodal body to supervise and take responsibility of all road infrastructure in its jurisdiction, the NGO added.Study’s findingsUnfinished works on road carriageways, traffic islands, dividers Accumulation of debris on and along roadsMissing lane/stop marking, pedestrian safety markings and facilitiesMissing or non-operating signals and timersMissing road signs and specified speed breakersNew roads being dug up againUnfinished rainwater drain workUncleaned/clogged roadside drainsObstruction by old electric poles, and electrical structuresIncomplete footpaths and roadside furniturePotholes and cracks within a year and poor/hurried repairsTrees that are choked to death||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/beware-many-city-roads-accident-prone-spots-ngo/articleshow/86124948.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, animal welfare activists in the state are upset at the inclusion of some of the members in the board. The 20-member committee, headed by minister for animal husbandry & dairy development J Chinjurani, has MP A M Arif and former agriculture minister V S Sunilkumar representing the legislatures. The ex-officio members include officials from home, forests, local self-government, transport, animal husbandry departments, Thiruvananthapuram district collector and Kerala state veterinary council president. While Geetha Nazir represents the district panchayats, Honey Benjamin represents the municipal corporation. Three members from the field of animal welfare include G Krishna Prasad - president of the Kerala elephant owners association, K T Augustine – secretary, Thrissur canine club and E C Satheesan of Kozhikode. “The very purpose of the SAWB is animal welfare. If you bring in persons who do not know anything about animal welfare or cannot differentiate between welfare and cruelty, what is the message you are giving? You need people who know what is happening around and will speak against cruelty and take a stance. During the last SAWB, the board met only three to four times. The purpose of bringing in members representing animal welfare is that they should call for meetings and put subjects of concern for discussion. There is no point having a board that will just meet when the government wants to get something cleared,” said V K Venkitachalam, secretary - heritage animal task force. Activists are upset that in the wake of so many incidents of cruelty against animals, the state government has not given due thought on who should be members. The state does not lack in organisations that are genuinely working for animal welfare and who are bringing the attention of the courts also to the violations. “It is really sad that the newly reconstituted SAWB does not have a single member associated with an animal welfare organisation or with expertise or even any association with animal welfare. It is ironic that they have been nominated as members in the animal welfare category. It is not that there is a dearth of people or experts who have been associated with animal welfare activities in the state,“ said Sally Varma, honorary animal welfare officer, AWBI. “Most of the members are from the CPI. That is the general commonality among all the non-officio members. It is high time that the rule be amended to bring in organisations working for animal welfare rather than random individuals,” said a senior animal welfare activist. The newly constituted SAWB has to ensure that all pet shops are registered under the newly notified Pet shop rules under the Prevention of cruelty to Animals 2018. The Kerala High court is hearing a suo motu public interest litigation in the wake of the recent gruesome killing of a dog named Bruno on the Adimalathura beach on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/activists-upset-with-new-sawb-team/articleshow/86128914.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Chandigarh||Chikka’s odyssey from Tokyo caddie to Panchkula victory||PANCHKULA: As a child, S Chikka Rangappa earned a few rupees daily as a ball spotter and caddie at the Eagleton Golf Resort, Bengaluru. Such was his talent that he rose to eminence from his humble origins and turned a professional golfer bagging 13 wins on the Indian tour and two international victories. But he missed a berth at the Tokyo Olympics by a whisker. Olympian Anirban Lahiri stepped in and generously offered Chikka the opportunity to caddie for him at Tokyo. That gave Chikka a golden opportunity to watch up and real close the world’s very best players. The Tokyo exposure stood him in good stead and Chikka shot a stunning 7-under-par 65 under difficult conditions on Saturday to win the Rs 50 lakh Tata Steel PGTI Players’ Championship presented by the Haryana government and Panchkula Golf Club (PGC). Chikka publicly thanked “elder brother” Lahiri for granting him the opportunity to caddie at Tokyo because that Olympics exposure helped him tide over the neck-to-neck battle at the PGC with powerful hitter and overnight leader, Veer Ahlawat, and win by two strokes. After being presented the trophy and the winner’s cheque of Rs 8.08 lakh by DS Dhesi, chief principal secretary to the Haryana CM, Chikka narrated how his Tokyo stint had helped him get over the disappointment of missing a chance to once again don the India jacket and had put him in a strong frame of mind during Saturday’s closely-fought battle with Army brat, Ahlawat. It was Chikka’s 14th win on the India tour and he rose to second position on the 2020-2021 Order of Merit with total earnings of Rs 41.83 lakh. “I watched the world’s elite players at Tokyo and observed that they keep the game very simple. They display great humility and are unmoved whether they shoot a very low round or have a bad day. Discipline and focus are the key to the game of the greatest players. I used to focus a lot on technique before my Tokyo experience, but I learnt not to complicate things and decluttered my mind and swing after that. It really helped me on Saturday, for example, after I dropped a double-bogey on the 8th hole, I kept very calm and put it behind me and used the mental formula of the Olympic greats to carry on without faltering. In earlier days, there was a good chance I would have got flustered and choked during the climax holes,” Chikka told the TOI.  As an amateur player, Chikka donned the India colours at the Eisenhower Trophy and Nomura Cup in 2011 and 2012, respectively. A keen wildlifer and devoted to the welfare of his parents, Chikka bested young Ahlawat on Saturday, the latter finishing at 18-under-pr after playing a round of 70. The leader after three rounds, Ahlawat paid the price for playing a somewhat defensive game as Chikka went on the charge on Saturday morning. Trailing three shots behind Ahlawat when play commenced, Chikka fired five birdies in the first seven holes against Ahlawat’s brace of birdies to draw level at 18-under-par for the championship.  While Ahlawat’s birdie bag remained quite empty after that, Chikka moved into high gear under mounting pressure and played some of his best shots as the climax neared. Of particular note was Chikka’s short game over the last six holes. He did not miss a single up-and-down from off the greens and holed two great putts for birdies at the 15th and 16th holes to move two strokes ahead of Ahlawat, a cushion he held onto successfully till the last putt was drained on the 18th green. The quality of Chikka's short game is reflected in the fact that he took just 24 putts for the round, including just 10 for the front nine. Tricity's Yuvraj S Sandhu finished third, with Ranjit Singh coming in at 5th and Karandeep Kochhar at tied-6th.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chikkas-odyssey-from-tokyo-caddie-to-panchkula-victory/articleshow/86126868.cms||Vikram Jit Singh

NMC officials said that the model is similar to the one adopted by the civic bodies in Mumbai, Pune and Thane during the second wave of the pandemic. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said that management of the Covid facility will be outsourced and it will be the agency’s responsibility to provide quality treatment to Covid patients. NMC has already floated a tender, inviting bids from interested parties about the project. “The biggest advantage is that the NMC will not have to frantically search for doctors to treat Covid-19 patients. During the last two waves, we had faced a tough time in getting doctors despite inviting applications umpteen times. The onus will be on the private party to engage qualified doctors and other health workers,” said an official from the civic body. Moreover, the civic official added, that the NMC would be monitoring the services rendered at the Ambad DCHC and in case of lapses it will be pulled up. During the last two waves of the pandemic, the civic body’s requirement for doctors on contract at its Covid facilities that it had set up at Thakkar Dome and other places was around 2,500-3,000 but only 1,100 joined. Some of the doctors left after a few days of joining the team. Officials from the civic body made it clear that its other Covid facilities would not be outsourced and healthcare workers, including doctors, would be deployed there. NMC officials said that the agency has to deploy doctors and nurses round-the-clock and as per the norms set up by the government under which one specialised doctor is required for every 15 patients on oxygen support and one nurse is required for every six patients on oxygen support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-follow-model-adopted-by-mumbai/articleshow/86123458.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Kochi||Burial ground for unclaimed bodies in Kochi running out of space||KOCHI: A burial ground for unclaimed bodies in Kochi city is fast filling up. Now, when workers dig pits to bury new bodies, remnants of old bodies surface, forcing them to dig a small pit rather than a deep one. The burial ground, spread on four cents of land, is in the compound of ‘Sangamodhyanam’, a crematorium owned by Kochi corporation, at Pullepady. Since this is the only space in the city for burying unclaimed bodies, workers have been forced either to dig a pit not so deep or dig another one near to it to bury the body. Every month, five to six unclaimed bodies are buried here. “Most of the bodies are brought from Ernakulam General Hospital, medical college in Kalamassery and from the railways. The ground has already filled up. A pit should be around six feet deep to bury a body. Since remnants, skull and bones of old bodies surface while digging the pit, workers are now forced to dig pits not so deep or dig new ones near to bury bodies,” says Selvan, caretaker of the crematorium. Moreover, the area where the body was buried should not be disturbed for a few days as the body will have to be exhumed if it is identified by relatives after a few days. Recently, police had reached the burial ground for exhuming a body after relatives identified the deceased. Copy of papers containing details of the deceased was also buried after wrapping in a plastic cover along with the body in the pit. The carcass of a dog was buried here around one-anda-half months ago after collecting Rs 3,000 from the pet owner as the latter wanted to give a decent burial to his dog. “We cannot cremate bodies as relatives may turn up after a few days for claiming the body. This is the only burial ground for burying unclaimed bodies in the corporation limit. Authorities have to find a solution to the issue,” said the worker on condition of anonymity. He said if the corporation fills up the land to a certain height, bodies can be buried here again without the issue of remnants of old ones surfacing while digging pits. A former health inspector had told Selvan about setting up a concrete vault to bury unclaimed bodies as a permanent solution to the shrinking space. P R Renish, the councillor who is in charge of Gandhinagar division, said the area where the burial ground is situated was a paddy field. “The immediate solution is to fill up the land with earth. But we have to clear the compound of the crematorium as weeds and grass grow wildly there,” Renish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/burial-ground-for-unclaimed-bodies-running-out-of-space/articleshow/86124988.cms||T C Sreemol

The acquisition will take place phase-wise. In the first phase, the notification has been issued for acquiring land to construct a 22.5 km-long bypass between Mandhana and Sachendi. The land will be acquired from 79 villages of Kanpur Dehat and Kanpur Nagar district. As per the procedure, the district magistrate will soon nominate an officer as a prescribed authority who will issue notification to prohibit sale of the land to be acquired by the government. The district administration felt the need of constructing an Outer Ring Road to control traffic jams on roads. The Ring Road, to begin from Mandhana (situated on GT Road) will pass through Sachendi and connect with the Kanpur-Etawah highway. Turning to Ramaipur from this point, it will cross Kanpur-Sagar highway and Kanpur-Prayagraj highway at Ruma. From Ruma, the Ring Road will turn to Kanpur-Lucknow highway and then pass through Atta in Unnao district and culminate at Mandhana. Project director, Pankaj Mishra said, “The Ring Road will be constructed in four phases. The first phase will reduce traffic pressure on city roads because from Mandhana a road up to Chandra Shekhar Azad Agriculture University connects Lucknow highway”. As the first phase would connect Kanpur-Etawah highway, the traffic for Lucknow and Prayagraj would be diverted to the other side, Mishra said. The notification of land acquisition for the first phase has already been issued and notifications for land acquisition for the remaining three phases would be issued soon, he said. In all, land from 271 villages would be acquired for the Ring Road, he added.

---||Nagpur||Friends kill youngster over Rs10, bury body in trench||Nagpur: A dispute with friends over Rs10 led to murder of a 22-year-old man whose body was disposed of in a trench dug up in a forest for cable laying work. The victim, Gyana Shende, was bludgeoned to death at Mangalwaripeth slum at Umred in Nagpur district on September 5. The cops suspected involvement of his two close friends, Surjit Mandle (30) and Sukdu Kartule (22) but had no clue to zero in on them. Umred police of Nagpur rural cracked the case on Friday after getting a tip-off about a small painted patch at the residence of Mandle. Superintendent of police (SP) Rakesh Ola said that Kartule and Mandle spilled the beans during interrogation and admitted to painting the wall to cover the blood stains splattered on the wall during the murder. They were arrested on Friday and a case of murder was registered against them. Police said that Shende, Mandle and Kartule were petty thieves. The trio had collected Rs160 after selling some stolen scrap. Kartule and Shende took Rs50 each as their share while Mandle got Rs60. This triggered a dispute which snowballed into a fight after consuming liquor at Mandle’s house. Mandle then hit Shende with an iron rod, leading to the latter’s death, said cops. Senior inspector Yeshwant Solse, who investigated the case under SP Rakesh Ola and addl SP Rahul Maknikar, said that Mandle and Kartule then packed the body in a sack and took it to Amrai forest on a bicycle. “There they bumped the body in a trench dug up by some utility agency and covered it with mud,” said Solse.Police said that Shende had left the house on September 5 without informing the family where he was going. “When he did not return, the Shendes lodged a missing complaint on September 6. Shende did not have a mobile phone and so there was no question of tracing its location,” said Solse. The senior inspector said they had to depend on manual intelligence, last seen theories and such techniques. “We were quizzing Mandle and Kartule but the breakthrough came when one of our informers alerted us about the painted patch at Mandle’s house,” said Solse.SP Ola along with SDPO Bhimrao Tele and Maknikar visited the spot at Amrai forest where the body was buried. “The body was exhumed in presence of sub-divisional magistrate,” said Ola.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/friends-kill-youngster-over-rs10-bury-body-in-trench/articleshow/86124995.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Ahmedabad||Solution to 9/11-like horrors lie in humanity: PM Narendra Modi||Describing the 9/11 terrorist attacks as an assault on humanity, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said the world is realizing that a lasting solution to such tragedies can only be found through humanitarian values. Invoking the message of Swami Vivekananda, the PM said it was on this day that swamiji had introduced the world to human values of India during his famous speech in Chicago in 1893. The PM said that these values can help the world prevent horrors such as 9/11. Modi said this in his address after e-inaugurating Sardardham Bhavan in Ahmedabad. It will provide residential and other facilities to students and job aspirants. The PM also performed the ‘bhoomi pujan’ of Sardardham Phase-II Kanya Chhatralaya, a girls’ hostel. The two projects, as their names suggest, are dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the Iron Man of India. The PM’s statements come on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. PM, Rupani laud PatidarsM Narendra Modi said the inspiration and energy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that forced the British to bow down now stands in the form of the world’s tallest ‘Statue of Unity’ dedicated to him. "Who can forget that when the idea of ‘Statue of Unity’ was proposed by Gujarat, the entire country became a part of the effort. The PM wished Sardardham will not only contribute to building India’s future but also enthuse youth with the Sardar’s ideals. "We have a tradition of worshipping Ganesha before undertaking any auspicious work. And fortunately, the inauguration of Sardardham Bhavan is happening on the occasion of the holy festival of Ganesh Puja," the PM said. "I wish you all a very happy Ganesh Chaturthi and Ganeshotsav." On the occasion of Rishi Panchami on Saturday, the PM said that India is a country of sages, and our identity is based on the knowledge, science and philosophy of the sages. "Let us carry forward that legacy," he said. "We observe the day of forgiveness by saying ‘Michchhami Dukkadam’ after Paryushan in the Jain tradition. I offer Michchhami Dukkadam to all the citizens of the country." Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel also attended the event. Rupani in his address said that the Patidar community has made valuable contributions to Gujarat’s march to progress.

The board had approved reduction in reserve price and change in the computation method. For instance, the reserve price of a corner booth in Sector 61, Kajheri, has been reduced from Rs 1.14 crore to Rs 56.19 lakh, a decrease of 50.71%. Similarly, the reserve price of a corner booth in Manimajra has dropped from Rs 97.99 lakh to Rs 46.72 lakh, a reduction of 52.32%. The board had recently ordered e-tender of 163 leasehold properties, including commercial and residential ones, and 28 residential freehold units. Board’s chief executive officer (CEO) Yashpal Garg said while calculating reserve prices, the officials changed the computation method for corner shops with both side veranda. After calculation, the effective reduction was Rs 40 lakh to Rs 60 lakh, which was more than 50%, he said. The minutes of the September 8 board meeting, which were approved by UT adviser Dharam Pal who is also CHB chairman, read, “The board decided to discontinue the practice of inclusion of cost for both sides of veranda while fixing the reserve price of corner commercial units. The reserve price of such units will be computed like other units and thereafter it may be increased with a factor of 20% for the locational advantages.” In the wake of poor response to e-tenders of commercial and residential properties on leasehold, the CHB decided to reduce the reserve price of vacant properties in its board of directors meeting. It was decided to reduce the reserve price of leasehold units: commercial by 20% and residential by 10%. Properties that have been put on e-tender include 28 residential units on freehold, 31 residential units on leasehold and 132 commercial units on leasehold. The eligible bidders can submit their bids from 10am on September 15 to 10am on October 8. Bids for 191 properties will be opened at 10.15am on October 8. The board did not get a good response in its recent auction for commercial and residential properties on leasehold. It had invited e-tenders for the sale of 149 commercial and 33 residential units on leasehold. Of 149 commercial units, it could only sell two. The reserve price of the two commercial units was Rs 1.06 crore and they were sold for Rs 1.09 crore. Out of 33 residential units, only two could be sold. The reserve price of these units was Rs 89.83 lakh and the highest bids received was Rs 90.85 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chb-lowers-reserve-price-of-14-commercial-units-by-over-50/articleshow/86126910.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The initiative is under ‘Udbodh’, a project by CNS in association with local bodies, which aims to create a dementia-friendly Kochi city. The project also aims to create awareness on the rising cases of dementia among the population. “The dementia care centre will be operated by Sai Trust on the land and building given by Kochi corporation. Our initiative is to help households where caregivers could get a break to relax when they can leave the dementia persons at the centre,” said Dr Baby Chakrapani, head of CNS, Cusat. The centre is likely to be inaugurated on September 21. He said that they would train employees of the care centre. “We had created a public platform called ‘Prajna’ to help people understand various degenerative diseases of brain, he added. Recent trends have shown that there is a drastic increase in neuro-degenerative conditions and people pay less attention to have a healthy life. “As we are a research centre with special focus on neuro-degeneration and allied brain health conditions, CNS has a great responsibility for building awareness in the society. We use ‘Prajna’ to disseminate information that has been limited to academic circles. We hve developed an app, a simple questionnaire to check the incidence of Alzheimer’s and dementia. It was shared among small groups in many local bodies. On an average of 500 persons who had filled the questionnaire, we found symptoms in around 150 people and detected dementia in 12-15 persons. This was just a sample survey, but we realized that people didn’t know where to go, if identified with dementia,” Dr Chakrapani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/free-dementia-care-centre-to-come-up-in-fort-kochi/articleshow/86125017.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Baby boom for Olive ridley turtles along Konkan beaches in Covid time||MUMBAI: Nature heals itself provided human interferences are lesser. A recent survey has found that during Covid lockdown months of 2020-21, the Konkan beaches, which received very few tourists, have seen a major rise in the number of Olive ridley turtle eggs and their hatchlings over the previous years. Of course, the hard work of NGOs, residents and volunteers who have been working relentlessly for years to save hatchlings and protect eggs before releasing baby turtles into the sea is paying rich dividends, making beaches in Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg districts a more rich and diverse ecosystem, say forest department officials overseeing turtle conservation. In 2018-19 there were only 23,131 eggs that were procured, this year the number is around 50,800, a jump of more than 100%. Similarly, the hatchlings in 2020-21 were 23,706 as against 12,601 in 2018-19, again a more than 100% rise. Interestingly, forest department sources said, the hatchling success rate has also improved in 2020-21 over the previous 2019-20. According to officials, the increase in number of eggs, hatchlings or nests though not constant, it has shown a remarkable rise during 2020-21 over previous 2018-19 and 2019-20 which is an encouraging factor for volunteers who have been trying to protect and nourish them. Volunteers and residents not only collect eggs and protect them in hatcheries, but also protect nests from stray animals. Turtles faced a threat from hunters and animals like dogs who would damage eggs and nests. To save depleting turtles, the state forest department with help of NGOs such as Sahyadri Nisarg Mitra and locals has been conserving them and releasing them into the sea every year for over a decade now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-baby-boom-for-olive-ridley-turtles-along-state-beaches-in-covid-time/articleshow/86130055.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

According to the report, an unidentified person sent the copies of two videos in a pen drive via post to the police officials mentioning that as a concerned citizen he was deeply disturbed with the recordings that showed a police official molesting the child. The report said that the video could be of a five-star hotel in Pushkar. The child welfare committee is closely monitoring the investigation and the child in the video is currently with his family.

Our child welfare committee is keeping tabs on the ongoing. We have not spoken to the child as yet and he is with his family.” The purported video showed RPS officer Heeralal Saini and a woman constable in a semi-nude condition indulging in sexual activities, even as the minor boy, reported to be the constable’s son, was present in the same pool. According to the SOG report, the person who sent the pen drive wrote that he did not wish to reveal his identity as the video showed police officials though he hoped that action would be taken against them. The report further said that while the investigation was underway, it was found that the video was circulated in an organised and planned manner. Also, the act of the accused in the video was sexual assault of the minor, hence the case has been registered under relevant legal sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sog-sends-report-to-child-panel-about-pocso-case/articleshow/86128920.cms||---

---||Pune||Only 9 doctors register with RTO to issue certificates to licence seekers||PUNE: Only nine doctors have registered with the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad regional transport offices (RTO) to provide medical certificates to people for renewal of driving licences. The new rule allowing only RTO-certified doctors to upload medical certificates on the transport ministry’s Sarathi portal comes into effect from October 1. According to an official, a total of six doctors have registered with the Pune RTO and three with the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO. “Until at least 30-40 doctors register, there will be a problem for those intending to renew their licences. We are trying to convince the doctors to register and have contacted all government hospitals as well as public health centres. The transport department is being apprised of the situation,” said the Pune RTO official. As per the new rules, doctors have to visit the RTO office for authentication after which they will be given a user ID and password to access the Sarathi portal. Verified doctors can then upload an applicant’s medical certificate on the portal. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association, Pune, said that in the feedback on the new rules, most members said they will not visit the RTO office or submit their medical licences for verification. “RTO officials should hold a meeting to understand our issues and modify the regulations,” said Patil. Indicating that some suggestions may be taken on board, another RTO official said doctors will not have to submit their original medical licences. “We can refer to the IMA website for verification. It is important that they visit the RTO office for the Sarathi portal credentials, but we can make some arrangement for that as well,” said the official. The RTO, however, is firm on having doctors upload the applicants’ medical certificates as the aim is to eliminate middlemen and fake medical professionals from the process. “We will hold talks with them soon and explain the importance of the regulation,” the official said. The Pune RTO gets around 150-200 applications every day for various types of licence renewal. The deadlock has worried several applicants. “My licence expires next month. The whole process will become tedious and time consuming. Why can’t regulations be simpler for common people,” said Bavdhan resident Abhinav Bhosle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-9-doctors-register-with-rto-to-issue-certificates-to-licence-seekers/articleshow/86126903.cms||Joy Sengupta

Developed by Krishna Khairnar, scientist and head at environmental virology cell at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri), the technique allows collection of RT-PCR samples through the method of gargling. Neeri has also prepared a special buffer medium in which the collected sample is mixed for releasing viral RNA. The transfer of SOP and knowhow of the technology to the MSME unit was held on Saturday in the presence of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. According to Neeri officials, the MSME unit of Amravati is doing the scale-up of the technology. This move is expected to improve the testing rate and efficiency in rural and tribal areas. “Considering the probable third wave of Covid-19, Neeri has fast-tracked the knowhow transfer process to potential licensees for its wider dissemination across the nation. The knowhow transfer is on a non-exclusive basis so that it can be commercialized to all parties interested, including private, government and various rural development schemes and departments subject to proven capabilities,” added the officials. The MSME unit will also be manufacturing the unique RNA-release buffer solution. “The saline gargle method offers a bunch of attractive benefits, and all rolled into one. It is simple, fast, cost-effective, patient-friendly and comfortable; it also provides instant results and is well-suited for rural and tribal areas, given minimal infrastructure requirements,” stated a release.

The Union minister on Saturday met chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at the Pragathi Bhavan. KCR requested support from the Centre in development of airports in Telangana as the state is becoming a centre for economic growth and a hub for various sectors. KCR brought to the notice of Scindia that passenger traffic has increased at the international airport in the past few years. “Direct connectivity should be increased, especially with cities in south-east Asia, Europe, US,” KCR said. Scindia assured Centre will provide help in developing Hyderabad as an international city. The minister said that immediate measures will be taken to start ATR operations at the proposed Mamnur airport in Warangal, among the six proposed airports in the state.

---||Kochi||Kerala must discuss concerns raised by Pala bishop, says KCBC||KOCHI/KOTTAYAM: The Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC) has thrown its weight behind Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt in connection with his controversial remarks on ‘narcotic jihad’. The council issued a statement on Saturday saying that the statements of the bishop in which he expressed his anxiousness over certain organizations indulging in extremist activities in the state should be discussed responsibly instead of being made controversial. KCBC said in the statement that it was a truth that Kerala was facing certain serious social crises and important among them were the rise in abuse of narcotic substances and the presence of terrorist organizations. The statement said that the United Nations itself has said in reports that the money acquired through dealings in narcotic substances were being used to fund terrorism. “Against this backdrop, bishop Joseph Kallarangatt gave a warning to the youths and expressed his apprehension about certain organizations conducting terrorist activities in the state. His words should be discussed responsibly instead of being made a controversy,” said the statement. “Even as the mainstream media is not giving these issues the importance it deserves; these facts are clear through the news reports that come out every day. Various investigative agencies have warned about the presence of organizations like ISIS in the state. Drugs worth crores of rupees have been seized in the state. Still, there is no knowledge about any proper investigation done to find the roots of these gangs,” Fr Jacob G Palackappilly, deputy secretary general and spokesperson of KCBC, said in the statement. The statement said that the government should come forward to conduct proper investigations by understanding the concerns of the general public and should take action accordingly. “Talking openly about such severe concerns faced by the state is not an allegation against any particular community. The prejudicial stand that such statements are done with communal intent is not right. Instead, leaders of communities should take the responsibility to rectify these issues to ensure communal harmony. Catholic Church only aims at communal unity and coexistence and not religious polarization,” the statement added. Meanwhile, Mar Jacob Muricken, auxiliary bishop of Pala diocese, issued a statement saying that bishop Kallarangatt had cautioned about the dangerous tendencies in the society which are becoming visible. “This is not against any religion. It is a common situation which affects all human beings,” he said. “He was reminding that all religions should see the action of a small section of the society that are resorting to anti-social activities and intense fundamentalism using the name of religion and its symbols,” Muricken said. He also said that the bishop was prophetic about the dangers that the society will face in the future if we don’t correct this. Bishop Kallarangatt, while delivering a message at Kuravilangad church in Kottayam on Wednesday, had said that ‘jihadi terrorists’ in the state are resorting to not just ‘love jihad’ but ‘narcotic jihad’ as well to trap Christian youth. The bishop cited media reports about women from Kerala travelling to Afghanistan to fight for IS and said it has to be examined how such girls ended up in terrorist training camps. He urged parents to be cautious and quoted former state police chief Loknath Behera who had said recently that Kerala is becoming the recruitment centre for terrorists. Speaking about ‘narcotic jihad’, the bishop said jihadi terrorists use it as a strategy to turn non-Muslim youngsters into drug addicts. Meanwhile, Deepika daily came up with an editorial in support of the bishop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-must-discuss-concerns-raised-by-pala-bishop-kcbc/articleshow/86129000.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Voice grows over relief for flood-hit||Aurangabad: Different political parties have started raising their voice seeking immediate help to flood-affected population from Marathwada. The region has witnessed at least 31 rain-related deaths and incurred damage to kharif crops due to rainy fury in September. Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Rajan Kshirsagar said each family affected due to rain-related death must get compensation of Rs 25 lakh. “For agricultural damage, the government must offer compensation of Rs 38,000 per hectare to affected farmer during the current natural calamity. The government should also waive off crop loan for kharif season 2020 and 2021. They must issue fresh loan ahead of Rabi season without wasting much time,” he said. Kshirsagar blamed the water resource department for alleged mismanagement of different reservoirs from the region and sought criminal action. “We will launch an agitation from September 15 if the government does not fulfil our demands,” he said. The NCP has demanded the release of compensation to farmers by carrying out blanket panchanamas of crops from all revenue circles that received heavy showers (more than 65 mm). BJP took a swipe at MVA government over ongoing natural calamity in Marathwada by alleging that ruling party leaders and government authorities were “missing” during the current crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/voice-grows-over-relief-for-flood-hit/articleshow/86123497.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘As predicted, Rupani made scapegoat for BJP failures’||As soon as chief minister Vijay Rupani tendered his resignation to governor Acharya Devvrat on Saturday, the Congress was quick to reiterate that its leaders had predicted that Rupani would be made the scapegoat to hide the failures of the BJP government. President of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, Amit Chavda, said, "By changing the chief minister, the government’s failure will not remain hidden. ... Vijaybhai has been made a scapegoat to hide the BJP government’s failure." Chavda re-tweeted his post of August 1, in which he questioned the celebrations announced to mark completion of Rupani’s five years in chief minister’s office. The Congress party’s working president Hardik Patel said, "This is a decision to misguide the people of Gujarat. With chief minister Vijay Rupani’s resignation, it has become clear that the BJP has failed completely to run the government." Former Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said this resignation was predicted much earlier, as the assembly elections are scheduled in 2022. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also termed the resignation as the BJP taking away Rupani’s position over its own failures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/as-predicted-rupani-made-scapegoat-for-bjp-failures/articleshow/86130060.cms||---

---||Goa||Ferrando calls for better show against Sudeva||Panaji: Juan Ferrando is pleased with FC Goa’s performance in their opening game of the Durand Cup. Goa opted to field only Alberto Noguera from their four foreign players as they secured a 2-0 win over Army Green. And the chief coach knows they must improve ahead of their next match against Sudeva Delhi FC at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Monday. “We have one squad. We are not thinking about whether all the foreign players participate or local players. For me it is very important to prepare the team last week against Army Green. Now we are thinking about Sudeva, and of course if we field Alberto, Edu (Bedia) or Ivan (Gonzalez), the most important thing is to help the team and also help the young players,” Ferrando told TOI in an online interaction on Sunday. Goa are favourites to win Asia’s oldest tournament with a strong squad at their disposal. The tournament also gives a good opportunity for the youngsters ahead of the Indian Super League (ISL) season. Goa handed debuts to defender Papuia, midfielder Christy Davis and later introduced Muhammed Nemil who had a stint in Spain and was impressive. Goa made a shaky start in their first competitive game this season but grew in confidence as the game progressed. “We are completely happy. It is normal and we can improve a lot. Players like Christy, Nemil, Papuia, they are working with experienced players and they learn a lot. The tournament is good for us because young players can participate,” said Ferrando. Sudeva will be a far more difficult side as the I-League outfit will look to bounce back in the tournament after suffering a solitary goal defeat against Jamshedpur FC. Ferrando knows the threat by the opposition and is focusing on improving his side. “We hope the next game will be better than the last game because we need to improve a lot of points. Also, it is a very good moment because the players step by step are in better condition, and in this case, it is easier to prepare the team,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ferrando-calls-for-better-show-against-sudeva/articleshow/86150546.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Vijay Rupani’s tenure mixed bag of achievements, uncertainties||AHMEDABAD: Despite being the only BJP CM other than Narendra Modi to have completed over five years in office, Vijay Rupani’s tenure as a chief minister has been a mixed bag of achievements, facing flak for mismanagements during Covid-19 pandemic and continuing at the helm of affairs under a cloud of uncertainty. Rupani may have been a soft-spoken as chief minister, but he was instrumental in passing a tough anti-conversion law against interfaith marriages, against those involved in cow slaughter and a few more tough laws during his second stint at the helm of the state. Despite proving himself to be an able administrator, Rupani’s stint in power was interspersed with instances of speculation and rumours of him being replaced. Over the past couple of years, there were multiple instances of rumours of a change in leadership growing loud, only to be quelled by the leadership. Apart from keeping factionalism in check, Rupani was particularly successful in successive elections after the 2017 assembly polls, when the party was reduced to double digit figures. In the Lok Sabha polls that followed in 2019, the BJP grabbed all 26 seats, won all assembly byelections, comfortably won all the Rajya Sabha seats where candidates were fielded, and then regained control of all local bodies – municipal corporations, municipalities, taluka panchayats and district panchayats. Before he became the CM for the first time in 2016, Rupani worked mostly in the party organization in Gujarat, and fought his first assembly election in 2014, winning a bypoll from Rajkot West. Rupani, a low-profile RSS man, was back in the chief minister's chair in 2017 after having survived the incumbency factor. The recent Covid-19 pandemic proved a massive challenge for Rupani administration and his government received a lot of flak and public anger for 'mismanagement' of the pandemic especially during the second wave when people died desperately looking for oxygen and beds. Deaths in Covid-19 designated hospitals shocked the national and judiciary alike when the Gujarat HC and even the Supreme Court came down heavily on the Rupani government going easy on hospitals sans BU and fire safety permissions. On the surface, all was well after Covid wave subsided. In fact, on August 15 state BJP president C R Paatil put any and all rumours of Rupani being replaced when he categorically stated that BJP will fight the 2022 state assembly elections in Gujarat under Rupani's able leadership. Less than a month later, when Rupani resigned on Saturday, the big question in common people's mind was — what was the trigger behind the sudden resignation now? People close to Rupani say the leader is aggrieved at being handed the mandate to leave office. His detractors say the high command was upset after getting many complaints against him and his style of functioning. It was also time to set the state electoral math right by naming a fresh candidate from a politically more influential community to turn any possible anti-incumbency into `pro-incumbency', as the BJP likes to put it in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rupanis-tenure-mixed-bag-of-achievements-uncertainties/articleshow/86130080.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Women have natural tendency to provide justice, says President Ram Nath Kovind||PRAYAGRAJ: President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday emphasized the need for women’s empowerment in judiciary and hoped that more women would be given representation in the Allahabad high court. While laying the foundation stone of National Law University at Prayagraj, a new building complex at Allahabad high court and advocates’ chambers, the President said that the increased participation of women in the justice system would achieve the inclusive ideals of our constitution. The President said that the women have a natural tendency of providing justice and have the capacity to provide justice to all. "Hence, a society full of justice will be established only when the role of women in the judicial system increases," he said, adding that at present the representation of women in judiciary was less than 12%, hence, it should be increased. Giving an example of the Supreme Court, he said that for the first time in history, there are four women judges out of 33 in the apex court. He also said that efforts should be made to make the justice system less expensive. "Everyone has expectations from the judiciary, yet, people hesitate in taking the help of courts. This situation needs to be changed in order to further increase the confidence of the people in the judiciary," he said while addressing a function at the high court campus here on Saturday. The President praised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for strengthening the system of rule of law in the state. He said that it should be our responsibility that everyone gets justice in time and the decisions should be in the language understood by the common man. “This would be possible only when all stakeholders associated with the judicial system bring necessary changes in their thinking and work culture, and become sensitive,” he added. He said that a world class education system should be adopted at the National Law University, which is going to be set up at Prayagraj, adding that good legal education is necessary for strengthening the rule of law. Union law minister Kiren Rijiju emphasized the need for arbitration and mediation, adding that a bill regarding Mediation would be introduced in the coming session of Parliament. He also said that he wanted India to become the destination of ‘International arbitration’, so that the entire world would look at our judicial system. He said that the effort of the government was to lessen the gap between common man and justice so that the justice be provided at the earliest, adding that the government of India is working closely in this direction. UP governor Anandiben Patel lauded the effort made to enhance the infrastructure for judiciary, adding that the government was committed to doing it further.

The outgoing CM solved the city’s two biggest problems — water scarcity and traffic snarls — with work on eight overbridges and underpasses going on currently. He provided Narmada water under the SAUNI scheme with a free hand. "It was his standing instruction that there should not be a water crisis in the city. Whenever we have demanded we get water. This is a tough year and now we fear the water crisis in peak summer," a senior officer of RMC told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rupani-returned-rajkots-love-with-development/articleshow/86130083.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Call for file with phone-tapping nods, ex-intel chief Rashmi Shukla urges Bombay high court||MUMBAI: Former state intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla has requested the Bombay high court to call for the file which would contain former additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte’s permissions, that were granted on her “multiple requests”, to put the phone numbers of “brokers and politicians” under surveillance following suspicion of corruption in police transfers and postings. She also denied that Kunte was “misguided” as mentioned by him in a report on March 25, 2021. Shukla, on September 8, submitted an affidavit in a rejoinder to HC stating that she “never sought withdrawal” of her August 26, 2020, phone-tapping report, as mentioned by Kunte, and claimed there’s “terrifying malice and prejudice on part of the investigation officers”. Denying the state’s claim that the grounds cited in her quashing petition against the cyber police’s FIR are an “admission” that she had “leaked the report and transcripts in public domain”, Shukla claimed to be a “whistle-blower” in “exposing the corrupt nexus prevalent in securing police transfers”. The state, Shukla said, relied on Kunte’s report which said that since no police transfers took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020—the surveillance period—there was no need to take action on her report. She said the state presented “this time period” only to “attempt to misdirect the court from the fact that transfers were initiated within a week of submission of the report and many several secured precisely the same posting that they were bargaining for... This is another attempt to downplay the scandal unearthed in her report”. Shukla said, “The transcripts, the leakage of which is being investigated, disclose grave crimes by the highest political functionaries and guardians of law and order in the state... The CBI is...entitled to investigate whether the ‘leak’ FIR is a bona fide attempt to investigate a crime or an attempt to prosecute an upright officer doing her duty,…” Her rejoinder said that though the state has questioned the maintainability of her quashing petition on the grounds that the FIR over ‘the report leak’ does not name her as accused, its “bias” is displayed in its counsel informing the HC earlier in another matter, that the case is against her. She refuted the state contention about her plea not being maintainable. Kunte, in his March 25 report, a day before the FIR was registered against unknown persons, “specifically and unjustifiably accuses” her of leaking the phonetapping report, she said, adding that he had said, “…it creates a doubt that the copy…has been leaked from Shukla only”. Shukla said that in 2020, the then DGP Subodh Jaiswal fhad received information that a network of brokers, with assistance of politicians, were executing transactions in police transfers. She said that “during preliminary investigations, the DGP observed that there was no written proof/document pertaining to the illegal transactions. Therefore, he directed me to seek permission from the competent authority to put the phones of these individual/brokers/ politicians under surveillance to unearth the modus operandi”. She said she then sought permissions from Kunte on several occasions. The state had said Shukla had marked the report ‘Top Secret’ justifying invoking the Official Secrets Act, but she argued that it does not automatically attract the stringent law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/call-for-file-with-phone-tapping-nods-ex-intel-chief-urges-hc/articleshow/86130084.cms||Swati Deshpande

He urged the followers of both the religious not to fall in what he called a trap set by Sangh Parivar. Satheesan told reporters in Kochi on Saturday that such a propaganda was being done using fake accounts on social media. “Most of such accounts are being managed by Sangh Parivar,” he said. “Some people took out march to the bishop’s house to protest the statement made by him. This also should be objected to. Provocations, marches and protests against each sect should be avoided. Communal harmony should prevail in Kerala. Mainstream political parties and leaders should take special efforts to see that the issue doesn’t get worsened,” Satheesan added. If any issue raised by the bishop requires consideration, the state government should inspect such issues and find a solution to them, the opposition leader said. Media should uphold secular values: Speaker Speaker M B Rajesh said that the media should try to uphold secular values. While inaugurating the website of global Malayali Press Club in Kochi on Saturday, Rajesh said that the media should keep vigil not to cause any damage to secularism.

The structure collapsed due to the heavy rains a few days ago. Rajanna Sirciclla district collector Anuraag Jayanti issued the show-cause notice to A Kishan Rao, executive engineer for his ‘gross negligence in his legitimate duties’. The centring work that had been done for the second bridge collapsed due to the heavy rains on September 6 and 7. The show-cause notice was issued to him on September 9 giving him seven days to explain why suitable necessary actions are not initiated against the collapse of the structure of the under-construction bridge. The district administration has also issued a show-cause notice to the executive engineer of Telangana State Medical Services & Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMSIDC) following the collapse of a compound wall of an ITI building at Madepalli village in Thangallapally mandal due to the rains. To facilitate a better approach to the Sri Raja Rajeshwara Temple at Vemulawada, two bridges were planned at Mulavaagu. However, despite it being six years since the work was taken up, the bridge has not been completed. One of the bridges was completed two years ago. An amount of Rs 12 cr was specifically allocated for the construction of the two bridges. These two bridges were to come up on either side of the existing old bridge. However, work on the East side bridge has been going on only at a snail’s pace. In the past too when there was heavy rain, the centring of the under-construction bridge swayed. On September 20, 2019, the centring of the bridge collapsed due to the heavy rains. Even though the work was taken up once again, the heavy rains on the last few days collapsed the centring work for the bridge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rb-official-served-notice-over-sircilla-bridge-collapse/articleshow/86127053.cms||---

The child suffered injuries to her knees and elbows and was rescued by a passerby who also informed her parents. Finding Mohammed Mirza guilty, special Pocso judge Jayshri R Pulate said, “In the present case, ‘M’ was 11 years old at the time of incident and while she was returning from school, the accused committed the act of inappropriately touching her thighs. Such an act created fear in M’s mind and she had no other option but to jump from the running taxi. Hence, I do not find that accused is entitled for much leniency.” Mirza was also fined Rs 10,000. “Out of the fine, Rs 5,000 be given to the victim, as compensation, after the appeal period is over,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/girl-11-ensures-molester-cabbie-is-sent-to-jail/articleshow/86131537.cms||---

He said BJP’s target is to come to power in Telangana in the next assembly elections by winning the confidence of the people. BJP’s strength has been growing in the past three years, he said. “When the 2018 assembly elections were held, BJP could get only get one seat and, within six months in the Lok Sabha elections in April 2019, the party won four seats in Telangana. Even in GHMC elections of the 100 seats BJP fought, nearly 50% seats were secured by the party. The same was the case with Nizamabad corporation elections,” the Union minister said at a press conference here on Saturday. Responding to his participation in ‘medicine from the sky’ initiative at Vikarabad and later meeting KCR, the Union minister said the medicine from the sky programme, which was started in 16 corridors in various parts of the country, was cleared by the Centre’s home, defence and civil aviation ministries and he took part on the invitation from the state government. He said the Centre’s aim was to develop more small airports in the country, which he termed as ‘democratisation of air sector’ not privatisation of airports. “We are not privatising the airports, they are being given on lease for a certain period that too on annual rental. After the lease period, the Centre would take over them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-and-trs-ties-for-federal-spirit-scindia/articleshow/86127086.cms||Koride Mahesh

The campaign, which is aimed at winning all 1.6lakh booths in the state, also witnessed appointment of ‘panna pramukhs’. Nadda emphasised that the party needs to work harder at booths, where it has a weak presence. Nadda highlighted the work done by PM Narendra Modi at the Centre and the Yogi government in UP and said Uttar Pradesh was on the road to development under their leadership. “UP has done exceedingly well in implementing 44 development schemes. Let BSP, SP and Congress have an open debate with our booth-level workers on development done by their regimes in 60 years and four years of Yogi government. Law and order has improved dramatically and criminals are fleeing the state. There is a huge dip in incidence of loot, dacoity and murder,” he said. “There was a time when it was impossible to chant Lord Ram’s name in the state with Congress openly refuting the existence of Ram. Now, after a wait of 500 years, construction of the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi is in progress because of PM’s efforts,” he said. Kumbh in Prayagraj, Deepotsav in Ayodhya, Krishnotsav in Mathura, Dev Deepawali in Varanasi and expansion of Kashi Vishwanath temple and construction of Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan in Ghaziabad was possible only under Yogi , he added. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya participated virtually from different locations in Prayagraj, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma logged in from Ghaziabad and Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey from Ghazipur. Nadda said, the CM has set a target of making UP a trillion-dollar economy and the state has already become the most preferred destination for investors. “Investments of more than Rs 3.5 lakh crore have taken place in UP and the state’s economy is worth Rs 22lakh crores,” he said. “A Rs 5.1lakh-crore budget, biggest in the state’s history, was presented by the Yogi government and UP bagged second position in ease of doing business. The per capita income of UP is Rs 94,495 instead of Rs 47,116 earlier,” he said. BJP workers committed to making campaign successful: UP BJP chiefUP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh on Saturday said every party worker is committed to making the ‘Booth Vijay Abhiyan’ successful. He said the BJP was the only party which had hardworking and honest leaders. “Modi jiis working for the welfare of poor through schemes like PM Awas Yojana, Ayushman card for free treatment, free gas connection, toilets, bank accounts for the poor because he know what poverty means,” he said. “BJP workers support the slogans of Jai Shri Ram, Bharat Mata Ki Jaiand Vande Matram,” he said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Foundation helps first-time offenders with cash for bail and rehabilitation||MUMBAI: Last year 20-year old Nihal Aslam Shaikh, an Andheri resident, received a bike from a friend. He rode the bike for a few days before the cops came knocking at his door. He was accused of being part of the gang which had stolen the vehicle. Shaikh was arrested and sent to Taloja Jail. His mother Qamar Jahan, a widow, had lost her job as a maid due to the lockdown and had no money to hire a lawyer and get him, her only child, released on bail. Then city-based NGO Global Care Foundation intervened and got him released on cash bail for Rs 15,000. Now he works as a security guard at a Metro station and stitches clothes at night on a sewing machine the foundation donated to him. Shaikh is among 200 inmates from five jails—Arthur Road, Thane, Taloja, Byculla and Kalyan—which the Foundation has helped release since 2019. These inmates were imprisoned for petty or ‘less than serious crimes.’ Working closely with Prayas, a field action project of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), the Foundation reaches out to the detenus who are first-time offenders and desperately need money for bail. “These are not habitual offenders or hardcore criminals. They fall in bad company, do drugs and, since they are poor and uneducated, pickpockets, snatch chains, sometimes even fight among themselves and end up in prisons. Many languish in jails for want of bail amount as low as Rs 5000,” say the Foundation’s managing trustee Abid Ahmed Kundalam. Before initiating the process for bail, the volunteers visit the inmates’ homes and verify their background with the families. The Foundation also helps rehabilitate the released inmates. Kurla couple Mujahid Shaikh and Shamshad spent seven months in separate jails before the Foundation helped them secure bail. “My neighbour filed a false case against my husband who was released on parole during the first lockdown and then he had a fight with a man who would tease me in my husband’s absence. My 10-yearold daughter would beg and feed my three other children while we languished in jail,” says Shamshad. “The Foundation established a small shop for us which we have rented.” Muslims, says Kundalam, are disproportionately represented in jails. “Muslim population in Maharashtra is 11.54% (2011 census), but Muslim convicts in the state are 23. 24%, more than double their population. This demands urgent steps,” says Kundalam. Vijay Raghvan, professor at Centre for Criminology and Justice at TISS and director of Prayas, says 85% of total jail inmates in India comprise SCs, STs, OBCs and Muslims. Socio-economic backwardness of these sections is the main reason for their high representation in prisons. And police bias? “Yes, the bias of the police cannot be denied but that also happens because of the kind of society we have. Poor first time offenders languish in jails longer than the rich for the same crime because they don't get cash for bail or surety,” explains Raghav. “We closely work with prisons and Global Care Foundation for release and post-release rehabilitation.” To create awareness and prevent youths from committing crime, the Foundation has tied up with Commissioner of Police, Railways (Mumbai) Quaiser Khalid, to present The Pledge, a video series. “We need to counsel youths in easy language. Poor socio-economic background and lack of guidance lead many youths to activities like stunts on bikes, running trains. Since they don’t know the laws but want to show off their talents, they end up breaking laws. The Pledge series is an attempt to prevent them from committing crimes and help them become responsible citizens,” explains Khalid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-foundation-helps-1st-time-offenders-with-cash-for-bail-and-rehabilitation/articleshow/86130086.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: It’s a concerted attack on the bishop, says V Muraleedharan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Union minister V Muraleedharan on Saturday said those who criticise the Pala bishop for speaking about the dangers posed by ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’ to the Christian community were trying to silence the bishop for speaking up unpleasant truths. The critics of the bishop should clarify whether they support the jihadi elements, against whom the bishop had spoken ill of, he said. “What I understand is that the bishop did not criticize any religion. He was speaking up against a small section of people in a religion. It has to be noted that he was not making an extempore statement. The bishop was reading out from a written text. It means that he spoke on the basis of staunch conviction, not emotion. Since that be the case, it’s ridiculous to attack him for sharing his genuine concerns with the members of his church,” he said. The bishop was speaking against the jihadi elements. The concerns he expressed are not foreign to the Christian and Hindu communities, he said. “If anybody thought of silencing the bishop by frightening him, I would like to remind that the times have changed. The time when the palm of Joseph master was chopped off has really passed,” he said. The Union minister said the term narcotic jihad was not a newly-coined usage as believed by leaders of ruling and opposition parties in Kerala. “Proceeds from narcotic sale is the major source of funding of terror groups. It is the responsibility of the bishop to clarify the content of his speech. Being a responsible political party, BJP needs to clarify its stand against the coordinated attack against bishop Joseph Kallarangattu. We are speaking against that intolerance of political leaders and religious groups,” Muraleedharan said. He said there was a misinformation campaign running in the press as if the Union government had said there was no ‘love jihad’ in the country. “What the government said in Parliament was that the very term ‘love jihad’ was not defined under law. It doesn’t mean that the government had said that there is no ‘love jihad’ at all,” Muraleedharan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/its-a-concerted-attack-on-the-bishop-says-muraleedharan/articleshow/86129250.cms||---

The court said the fact that the key eyewitness happened to be a colleague who came forward to help her and caught the molester didn’t mean he was not an independent witness. The woman said despite her screams, no passerby came to her rescue. “The incident took place on May 12 at around 1.45pm and though there were many passersby, the informant (woman) has specifically said no one came to rescue her. In such circumstances, it’s tough for the investigating officer to ascertain who was present near the place of incident at the time of the incident,” the court said. It refused to let the accused get off on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act. “Offences against women are on the rise and giving him benefit of Probation of Offenders Act may send wrong signals in the society,” metropolitan magistrate Hemant U Joshi said. The trial began on August 3 and the court pronounced the verdict on September 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-sentences-molester-to-1-yr-ri-after-32-day-trial/articleshow/86131538.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||South Delhi civic body issues 104 fines for not paying toll via RFID||NEW DELHI: Taking strict action against vehicle owners crossing entry points without paying toll via RFID system or not getting them recharged properly, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) issued notices to 672 vehicles last week. It has issued challans to over 100 of them in the past two days. The concessionaire hired for collecting toll tax at 124 plazas only through the RFID system was also slapped with a fine of Rs 10 lakh for violating norms and continuing to collect tax in cash. “We have imposed the fine on the concessionaire for non-compliance with an order issued by the Supreme Court,” said a south corporation official. All the 672 notices were given to the vehicle owners on spot in hard copy. SMSes were also forwarded on the registered mobile numbers of 572 vehicle owners, warning them to face strict action if lapses continued. “But these warnings didn’t serve much purpose which is why we approached the transport department officials of Delhi and neighbouring states for help. We requested them to cancel the permits of 524 vehicles that failed to pay toll tax/ECC through the RFID system despite reminders,” said the official. The enforcement teams have now started imposing a penalty of Rs 500 on all such erring vehicles. “In the past two days, we have penalised 104 vehicles. Since the whole system is being implemented on the direction of the apex court and EPCA had earlier given a nod for imposing challan of Rs 500, we are acting as per the court norms only. Unless we will impose challan and take strict action, it would be difficult to get the desired results,” the official stated. SDMC had implemented the RFID system on the Supreme Court’s order for collecting toll tax and environment compensation cess from specified commercial vehicles while entering the national capital. After repeated warnings to get the RFID tag issued and get them recharged properly, the toll tax department stopped entry of specified commercial vehicles not following the norms on August 31. “At seven toll points, collection is either done in cash or not happening due to farmers’ rally and missing power connection. We have asked the concessionaire to implement the RFID system at the remaining 117 toll plazas,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/104-fines-issued-for-not-paying-toll-via-rfid/articleshow/86129166.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Hit-run kills woman on Iskcon flyover||AHMEDABAD: The body of an unidentified woman was found on the Iskcon flyover in the wee hours on Saturday, ostensibly killed in a hit-and-run accident. It appears as if the woman was walking on the bridge when the accident took place. SG Road II traffic police station registered a case under IPC Sections 279 (rash driving), 337 & 338 (causing hurt by rash act as to endanger human life) and 304 (A) (causing death by negligence). Police inspector A M Rathod said, “The victim was walking on the flyover when she was hit by a speeding car. We have found traces of the car. As there are no CCTV cameras on the bridge, it is difficult to identify the vehicle.” He said the incident occurred before 5.20am, when a passerby informed police about her body. He said a postmortem has been performed. Photos of the deceased woman have been circulated to match with missing persons. A senior officer said that from her dress, the woman seems to be from a disadvantaged socio-economic class, and it is not clear why she went on to the flyover as she could have walked beside the road below the flyover. Police are scanning footage to find out when she got on to the flyover. According to the complaint, the vehicle that hit her would have come from the direction of Pakwan Crossroads. The complaint lodged by unarmed head constable Dilip Gandalal states that the woman had died from head injuries suffered in the collision. It adds that she had severe injuries on both legs. The complaint states that the person who informed the control room, said that vehicles on the bridges were running over the body. Police found broken pieces of vehicle parts such as headlights and a bumper, from the scene of the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hit-run-kills-woman-on-iskcon-flyover/articleshow/86127174.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man aged 50 acquitted in six-year-old JJ Hospital assault case||MUMBAI: Six years after a now 50-year-old man was booked for assaulting a resident doctor at JJ Hospital for delay in providing a bed to his relative, a sessions court this week acquitted him. The court said the doctor was not a public servant and hence the charge of deterring him from performing his duty was not applicable. The accused, Dongri resident Madhusudan Aamre, is out on bail. The court said the informant, Dr Mohmmed Wafi Ansari, in his cross examination, had submitted that he was not appointed by the state government as a permanent doctor in the hospital at the time. The court also found that the resident doctor could not say what abusive words were used by the accused. The prosecution said the resident doctor was pursuing his post-graduation in ophthalmology at the time of the incident. On July 6, 2015 there were 90 male cataract patients in the ward. The doctor told the court that the number of patients was more than the number of available beds. His superior directed him to first distribute food and thereafter arrange for beds. Beds were being allotted to patients one by one after preparing files. The doctor said that around 1.30 pm, the accused allegedly abused him for giving preference to VIPs and those from Latur. He said that when he told him not to use profanities, the accused caught hold of his collar. The staff present on the spot rescued him from the accused. It was alleged that the accused then tore the patient file which was in the doctor’s hand. The police arrived and took the accused in custody, and an FIR was lodged. Seven witnesses, including the then dean of the hospital, Dr TP Lahane, deposed during the trial. “The oral evidence of the prosecution is not sufficient to hold the accused guilty as it does not give the exact account of the words used by the accused to the informant,” the court said, adding that Dr Lahane had not seen the incident in person. It also mentioned the absence of evidence, including the torn file. The court said the investigation officer had not seized anything from the spot. “The informant stated that the accused tore the file prepared for his patient. The investigation officer during the course of investigation did not seize any pieces of torn file. This could have been a piece of evidence to be used against the accused,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-aged-50-acquitted-in-6-year-old-jj-assault-case/articleshow/86130096.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The state government is planning to launch ODOP products in international market and plans are afoot to showcase the products in the Dubai Expo 2020. “There will be a big pavilion for ODOP in Dubai Expo to showcase our traditional crafts and products in the foreign market. Efforts are being made not only to improve their visibility but also their marketability in foreign markets,” said additional chief secretary, MSME, Navneet Sehgal. “ODOP has come out as an effective way of self-employment which the Yogi government promoted considering well that the traditional crafts have immense potential and the artisans needed hand holding though a slew of measures taken by the government,” he said. He said the objective of the ODOP scheme was to encourage local craft and local craftsmen and revive the local craft while improving the chances of livelihoods and employment. “Over the world, this is a known phenomenon but to improve the industry, particularly micro and smaller industry, the best way is to create clusters and then work on it, create infrastructure, to improve productivity, quality, packaging and marketability,” he said. The department is training almost 20,000 craftsmen each year out of the 75 districts in their existing trade so that they can be informed about the latest technologies. “We have signed MoUs, agreements with the national and international organisations to provide support. We signed an agreement with the Indian Institute of Packaging to help improve packaging skills,” Sehgal said. To ease the hardships of these artisans in selling produce, the department has signed MoUs with Amazon and Flipkart to help them to market their products. “We have also created our own e-marketplace, ODOP e-Mart, where these artisans are being onboarded to sell their products through e-commerce portal,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/odop-products-crafts-going-places-to-be-showcased-in-dubai/articleshow/86129145.cms||---

The man allegedly bore a grudge after he had been physically abused by the son in yet another episode of father-son argument over dinner. According to Vadodara rural police, Kanu Parmar, the accused has been detained and have been quarantined until his Covid-19 test report arrives. Police said that after dinner, the family was asleep, when Parmar’s wife Kailash woke up around midnight after hearing a thud. She looked around the room to locate the noise and was shocked to see her husband hitting their 25-year-old son, Rakesh, with an axe. Kailash screamed out of fear, but the accused kept hitting his son four to five times before leaving the house and asking his wife to go back to sleep.

---||Hubballi||BJP corporators lobbying for mayor’s post||Dharwad: The BJP is set to stake claim to power in the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council, and the corporators of the saffron party are now lobbying for the mayor’s post. The mayor’s post has been reserved for a candidate from OBC ‘A’ category this year. However, the saffron party does not have an eligible candidate for the deputy mayor’s post, which has been reserved for a woman from a Scheduled Caste (SC) community. Consequently, the saffron party has been wooing Independents who fit the bill for the post. The BJP bagged 39 seats in the 82-member house, and despite falling short of the halfway mark – 42 – the saffron party, with three MLAs, two MLCs and an MP, all of whom have voting rights in the mayoral polls, is comfortably placed to bag the top post. The BJP is also likely to have the support of three rebels, and the solitary JD(S) corporator in the house. The Congress, on the other hand, appears to have given up hope of coming to power in the HDMC Council. The Congress won 33 seats, in addition to which the party has one MLA and an MLC who can vote in the mayoral election. And even if the party succeeds in securing the support of the three AIMIM corporators and six Independents, the party will not be able to match the BJP’s strength. Of the 82 corporators elected to the HDMC council, 67 have won the poll for the first time. Shivu Hiremath, Veeranna Savadi and Tippanna Majjagi’s wife Ashwini are among the former mayors elected to the HDMC Council. In the BJP, Satish Hanagal, Umeshgouda Koujageri and Rajanna Koravi who have been re-elected, and are hoping the party’s leadership to appoint them to the mayor’s post. Of the 39 mayors that the HDMC Council has had till date, most have been from Hubballi, much to the chagrin of the leaders and residents of Dharwad city. This has bred much resentment among the Dharwad residents, who feel that Hubballi has been unfairly favoured in terms of the development projects undertaken in the twin cities. Under such circumstances, the BJP is likely to opt for a Dharwad corporator for the mayor’s post. Iresh Anchatageri and Vijayanand Shetty are the two BJP corporators from Dharwad who are eligible to be nominated for the mayor’s post this year, and they will fancy their chances of getting the party leadership’s nod for the top position in the HDMC Council. The State Election Commission is expected to notify the names of the newly-elected corporators, following which the government will issue a notification for the mayoral polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-corporators-lobbying-for-mayors-post/articleshow/86124451.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

When the mandate is in favour of secular parties, why can’t the Congress come to power with an alliance?” “I have spoken to JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda regarding the people’s mandate against the BJP in the Kalaburagi civic body polls. We will see what happens,” he told the media in Mangaluru on Saturday. On plans of offering the mayor’s post to the JD(S), in an attempt to keep the BJP at bay, Kharge said that a decision will be taken by the party leaders in Kalaburagi. To a query on possibilities of an alliance between the Congress and the JD(S), he said, “Everything lies on trust and confidence in society.” He added that in the 55-member council of the KCC, the Congress has bagged the largest number of seats, by winning in 27 wards, while the BJP has managed to bag only 23. “The JD(S) has also won in four wards, and one seat was bagged by an independent. This is an indication that secular forces are against the BJP. Of the 55 seats, secular forces have bagged 32 seats, while the BJP could bag only 23 seats,” Kharge said. He was in Mangaluru to visit former Union minister and Rajya Sabha member Oscar Fernandes, who is being treated at a private hospital since July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kburagi-mayoral-polls-signal-victory-for-secular-forces-says-kharge/articleshow/86124059.cms||---

While speaking at the inaugural function of the Weave Knitt exhibition on Saturday Jardosh told SGCCI president Ashish Gujarati not to make demands at public platform after inviting ministers or dignitaries. On August 19, Jardosh had criticised SGCCI for taking credit for every government decision during a function organized by CREDAI Surat. “I need to make corrections in the habits of Ashishbhai (SGCCI president). You are doing good work, you invite someone and then submit a list of demands. It has been the chamber’s habit. I feel that some changes should be made. I know Ashishbhai will do it.” She went on to say, “People sitting here are not interested in listening to demands. We will sit at a table in the minister‘s office, secretary’s office. Media is also not interested. They wanted good photos of textile products.” “There is no need to present your demands on a public platform. The glass is not half empty but it is half or more full now. We should work on how Surat gets maximum benefit from government schemes,” Jardosh added. Last month, Jardosh during a public function had said, “Removal of anti-dumping duty on viscose yarn was taken in 24 hours after me and C R Paatil raised the issue. Do you see any minister who does this? But the chamber jumped in and claimed that they did it. We don’t know if being elected leaders we do anything or not.” Jardosh had criticized SGCCI during her first visit to the city after becoming a minister and a day before a felicitation function by SGCCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/minister-takes-a-jibe-at-sgcci-for-pushing-demands/articleshow/86127152.cms||---

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Mathura liquor, meat ban only on sale, not consumption||AGRA: The ban on liquor and meat in Mathura district is applicable only to their sale and not their consumption. And instead of a complete shutdown, the liquor vends and meat outlets will be relocated outside the 22 wards of the Mathura-Vrindavan Municipal Corporation where the ban has been notified. “Only sale is banned. There is no prohibition on consumption. Licensed vends and meat shops will be relocated,” said a district official on condition of anonymity. Mohammad Riazuddin Raju, a social worker and president of Sankalp Welfare Society, an NGO, said, “Muslim meat sellers have decided to approach the high court against the ban. They will seek permission to carry on their business on the streets of Muslim-majority localities. Over 1 lakh Muslims live in the 22 wards where the ban has been announced. They can’t change their food habits. We are afraid that if meat is carried even for personal consumption, there may be attacks.” The area where the ban came into effect on Friday night, a 10-sq km area from the Krishna Janmasthan Temple complex, has about 45 liquor shops and 18 meat outlets, including restaurants where non-vegetarian food is served, district authorities said. “Implementation of the ban will be strictly ensured by police in restricted areas,” Mathura-Vrindavan Municipal Corporation commissioner Anunay Jha said. The notification for the meat ban was immediately shared with outlets. All 18 were shut on Saturday. “Meat sellers have two options — relocate or start another business,” Dr Gauri Shankar, designated officer of food and drug administration, said. The liquor ban is yet to be enforced. District excise officer Prabhat Chandra said data about liquor vends is being collected and their relocation will be planned soon. Mathura DM Navneet Singh Chahal said the government will help and train those willing to change their line of business. “There are many government schemes with which they could be accommodated and helped to start new businesses,” he added. Those in the trade, however, said neither seems like a practical option. “I have already paid this fiscal’s licence fee. The government should have implemented this from the next financial year, if it had to. Also, I have been running my store for three years, with sales of almost Rs 1 lakh a day. Would I get the same after relocation?” said Sunil Kumar, who runs a wine shop in Mathura. Mohammad Shahid, who runs a chicken shop in Jaisinghpura, likewise, said relocation would be a problem. “Customers will not commute to faroff places to buy meat. It will mean losses. My shop, where I’d make Rs 700 a day, has been shut. Some of us local dealers are planning on taking this to the high court."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-liquor-meat-ban-only-on-sale-not-consumption/articleshow/86120174.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The kids had injury marks on their neck which were inflicted by a sharp-edged weapon. Eyewitnesses informed the police about the suspicious movement of some people in the area who reached there in a four-wheeler and were carrying bags with them.

---||Ahmedabad||September-October saw five handovers of power in Gujarat||It’s not just the resignation of incumbent CM Vijay Rupani – the only fourth CM of Gujarat to complete five years in office – as the monsoon season gives way to autumn, the months of September and October have seen many political upheavals in the state. The change of hands started right with the first CM of Gujarat – Dr Jivraj Mehta resigned in September 1963 after three years, 141 days, paving the way for Balwantrai Mehta. Mehta’s untimely demise during the 1965 war also came in September, when Hitendra Desai took charge. In 1996, before Suresh Mehta could complete a year in office, the split in BJP forced his resignation in September. For 27 days, President’s Rule was imposed before Shakersinh Vaghela was sworn in as 9th CM of Gujarat. His tenure ended after just one year and four days, in October next year as Dilip Parikh got into the seat in 1997. Narendra Modi’s first term as CM also came in October 2001 after Keshubhai Patel’s resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sept-oct-saw-five-handovers-of-power-in-gujarat/articleshow/86130149.cms||---

Sample this: Of the 56 active cases reported in Jabalpur in the past 11 days, only two are kids, going by the official data. Bhopal which reported as many as 22 active cases this month, has not a single Covid positive kid. Experts however fear that it could be due to lack of testing or reporting of active cases in minors. As on Saturday, the state has as many as 136 active patients. In the major towns, Jabalpur has the maximum active cases at 56, followed by Bhopal which reported 22 actice cases while Gwalior reported only two active cases this month. Other districts do not have any minor Covid patients, going by the official data. “As on September 10 in Jabalpur, one of the minor Covid patient is a five-year-old girl while the other patient is 17 years old girl,” chief medical and health officer, Jabalpur, Dr Ratnesh Kuraria, told TOI. “Pediatric age group is being rigorously monitored for Covid-19. Currently there are no cases of RT-PCR positive cases for the pediatric age group,” said Hamidia hospital superintendent, Dr Lokendra Dave. In Gwalior district, there has been decline in the new Covid-19 cases in the recent times. Chief medical and health officer, Gwalior, Dr Manish Sharma said, “We only have two active cases and in recent times, no children have been tested positive. And interestingly both the patients who are active now are fully vaccinated, i.e., they have received both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and are having no trouble, symptom or issues, they are in home isolation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/active-cases-rising-in-mp-but-kids-safe/articleshow/86127232.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Mar Aprem, the metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East in India, declined to endorse or refute the statement of the bishop saying that he was not aware of the situation in Pala which caused the bishop to make such a statement. “In Thrissur, we are not facing threats like ‘love jihad’ or ‘narcotic jihad’. That is why I did not consider it a serious issue. But I’m not familiar with the situation in Pala,” Mar Aprem said while responding to questions from media. He, however, said he did not think that the Pala bishop had made the statement to trigger a communal cleavage in the society. “The bishop was only speaking to his own community members, and not to the public,” Mar Aprem added. Meanwhile, Irinjalakuda bishop Mar Pauly Kannookadan endorsed the observations of the Pala bishop. “The parents and the society as a whole should maintain utmost alertness against ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’ which will lead the society to a grave situation,” the bishop said in his address during the holy mass held on the 44th formation day of the Irinjalakuda diocese on Saturday. The bishop also expressed concern over the dip in childbirth rates, and reminded the faithful of the institution of Pro Life Charitable Trust which supports couples who have four children. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mixed-reaction-to-bishops-comments-in-thrissur/articleshow/86129282.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||2 held in Rs 1crore cops’ salary scam||CHANDIGARH: The UT crime branch, on Friday, arrested a junior assistant, who was earlier in-charge of the police department’s salary branch, and a home guard volunteer conduit in Rs 1.1-crore salary scam. Police said two more people would be arrested soon. The case under the sections of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered at Sector 3 police station on February 25, 2020. Police said the arrested are junior assistant Balwinder Kumar and home guard volunteer Surjit Singh. During investigation, the crime branch found that around 161 cops got extra amount in their accounts. Most of them informed the accounts department and returned it. However, 64 police personnel, in connivance with the clerks of the accounts branch, kept quiet. The clerks took share of extra salary credited to their accounts. This led to a fraud of over Rs 1 crore between 2016 and 2019. The incident came to light when the police department received an anonymous complaint and an internal investigation was conducted. The crime branch constituted a SIT to inquire the case. On the request of the police department, a special audit team checked the accounts department books. The audit was completed 10 days ago and its report stated Rs 1.1 crore extra was credited to the accounts of constables and head constables from 2016 to 2019. Now, the police department plans to conduct an audit of the accounts department from 2013 to 2015, too. Balwinder dealt with the salaries of constables and head constables of the UT police and was deployed in the accounts branch in 2013. Crime branch SP Manoj Meena said during the probe, the department started recovering the extra money disbursed and almost 100% of it has been reclaimed. The salaries of cops as well as of other employees of UT departments are generated through E-sevarth software created by NIC. The police officials had raised the flaws of the software with the NIC officials and indicated that the scam could be happening in other departments as well. Both the accused were produced before a local court, which sent Balwinder to three days’ and Surjit Singh to one-day police remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-held-in-rs-1crore-cops-salary-scam/articleshow/86127228.cms||Pawan Tiwari

---||Mumbai||Preserving heirlooms in uncertain times, keeping memories alive||MUMBAI: The antics of Holi in a century old work of fine miniature art was the focal point of Mrinal Bhargava’s house in Ahmedabad that sat almost like a household god in his living room after he inherited it from his grandfather. Naturally, it was hard for him to leave his precious heirloom behind when he moved to Mumbai six years ago. But it was his best chance at keeping it safe. “I could neither bring the painting nor old manuscripts handed down to me by my forefathers just because of the weather,” he said, while adding: “Bringing them to Mumbai would be of great joy. It’s a reminder of people, times and places that have sentimental value but the risk of fungus is terrifying.”  The uncertainties that the pandemic unleashed have been a time of reckoning for the use-and-throw era with people trying to ferret out old belongings — a grandmother’s shawl or antique jewellery, a trunkful of old letters and photographs — in an attempt to reconnect with their past.  To help all those struggling to hold on to a lifetime of treasured keepsakes passed down over many generations — textile, jewellery, objets d’art, photographs, paintings, books, certificates, ceramics, clocks and furniture — a virtual workshop organised last week by the Khaki Heritage Foundation with Anupam Sah, head of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya’s (CSMVS) conservation unit, came as reprieve.  It was the first of its kind move to get the layman to think more like museum conservators and treat their household heritage — decaying unobserved — with the highest level of archival care, regardless of its provenance and value.  “A letter from a grandfather to a child could be of deep significance within the family, while the same letter would never figure in a list of potential acquisitions for a museum. The significance of a family heirloom lies in its intangible values such as memory, regard, pride, legacy, tradition and family heritage,” said Sah stressing on the responsibility of art and heritage conservators.  For instance, Poornima Balakrishnan was anxious about a metal artefact from the Queen’s coronation in 1953 that carried memories of her grandfather being invited. “It’s in Chennai but the metal work has corroded and some of the horses have lost their legs,” she said, while pulling out a vintage silk sari from the 60s.  Even if one has not mishandled their family heirlooms, the elements — light, heat, humidity — as well as pests and age-related issues can still be damaging. The saving grace? One need not look much further than their wardrobe, kitchen or study to ensure that their cherished items can withstand the test of time.  “It’s in your own home that you’ll find the safest, time-tested items that can preserve artefacts and heirlooms,” revealed Sah, his short list of must-haves ranging from tooth powder or nail polish remover to clean tarnished silver and keeping it shiny. “Do you ever wonder why babies bundled up in rolls of cotton never get sick even as they’re taken from air-conditioned cars, out into the road and then into a mall yet they don’t get sick?” he asked. “They’re the ultimate storage solution. Like babies, paintings, art objects or jewellery cushioned with good old cotton dhotis and saris and placed inside acid-free clam shell boxes procured from the local mithaiwalla could guard against fluctuating humidity, temperatures and light and keep them safe for three generations,” explained Sah.  It brought relief to Juzer Tambawalla whose fears of “waking up to the horror” of his century-old Islamic lithographs — collected during his travels across the world — being washed away, pushed him to give them up to a storage organization. “Living in a Bombay house with no attic to store or much room to display with killer monsoons dampening your home, it was my only way to keep them safe for my grandkids,” said the art collector from Mazgaon, hopeful that such learnings from professional conservators — now with CSMVS keen on helping more people with information and special workshops to secure the longevity of their personal artefacts — will reunite families with their past and shed new light on their history or craftsmanship. BOX: Tips to arrest the decay of family artifacts:Decorative metal: Display in a glass case, or store by wrapping each piece individually in cotton cloth. Avoid keeping silver with woolen shawls or silk fabrics as they cause formation of a dark tarnish on the metal’s surface. Textiles: The risk to a sari or shawl is in its folds. Textiles fragment at the creases. Instead of folding, fill a stocking with soft polyfill and fold the textile around it so that creases do not form Paper documents, letters and books: Keep them wrapped in starch-free clean cotton cloth. Many place a few dry neem leaves in such boxes to good effect. Photographs: Keep in album sleeves made of Mylar, a polyester film Paintings: Keep paintings on paper away from sunlight, and do not keep any painting directly under air conditioners Clocks and musical boxes: Never wind a musical box before storing it. Same with clocks and cameras. Let them be released of all the potential energy and tension before being stored away (As advised by Anupam Sah, head of CSMVS’s conservation unit)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/preserving-heirlooms-in-uncertain-times-keeping-memories-alive/articleshow/86130110.cms||Mohua Das

---||Pune||MahaMetro gets railway nod to cross tracks at Khadki, install girders||PUNE: MahaMetro has received the approval of the Central Railways to install girders at Khadki to cross the railway tracks and the work has been scheduled for this month. The preliminary installation of steel girders from both sides of the tracks has already begun and a railway block will be planned to install the girders above the railway tracks. The Metro viaduct will cross the railway tracks at two locations — Khadki and Sangam Bridge. At Khadki, the Metro’s Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-Swargate line will cross the tracks, while the Vanaz-Ramwadi line will proceed from Sangam Bridge. MahaMetro officials said they were following up on the proposal with the railways since the past few months. “All the required details and drawings were submitted to the railway administration. We have received approval. The Metro viaduct will cross the tracks after the Khadki station towards Shivajinagar. The location of the crossing has been finalised,” an official said. The official said that adequate distance will be maintained above the overhead traction of the railway track while constructing the viaduct. A steel girder will be installed instead of a cement concrete viaduct, which will save the time and work. Also, it is not possible to construct a cement concrete span of more than 50-metres in length. MahaMetro has started assembling the steel girders and the process of lifting the structure will begin once the railway block is finalised. “We will ensue minimum disruption to the movement of trains,” officials said. Pillars on both sides of the tracks are ready. After crossing the railway line, the Metro will enter Range Hills and proceed towards Agriculture College depot from where it will enter the underground tunnel. The work at the Sangam Bridge railway crossing is yet to begin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-gets-railway-nod-to-cross-tracks-at-khadki-install-girders/articleshow/86129280.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Ahmedabad||Fire NOCs: Society moves Gujarat HC against ‘illegal’ shops||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has sought a reply from the civic authorities, Godrej Properties Ltd and 21 shopowners, after members of a cooperative housing society in Godrej Garden City asserted that the allegedly illegally constructed shops on hollow plinths of three residential blocks do not have adequate NOCs. The chairman and secretary of Pinecrest Cooperative Housing Service Society Ltd filed a petition in the HC and sought directions to the authorities to seal the 21 shops and return control of these parts of the residential blocks, which are prone to fire, because fire NOCs were never sought for the shops. The petitioners challenged the BU permission granted to the buildings claiming that the shops were illegally built on the ground floor in violation of GDCR rules and the safety of 252 families living in three blocks has been put at risk. They submitted that the fire NOCs issued to the buildings since 2016 do not cover the shops on the ground floor. The fire NOC obtained for the buildings does not explicitly mention ‘commercial/retail’ or ‘mixed occupancy’ and it only mentions ‘residential’ for the use of the buildings. The petitioners further submitted that the fire NOCs issued since 2016 are with respect to ‘residential’ and are not for ‘commercial/retail’ purpose. Through ‘Building Use’ permission was issued for the building, the shops do not have fire safety certificates. They alleged that the certificates were issued by the authorities in a dishonest manner, by not adhering the Fire Safety regulations. The high court has scheduled a further hearing on the issue for Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fire-nocs-society-moves-hc-against-illegal-shops/articleshow/86127262.cms||---

An extensive field survey preceded the report during which police came across a woman identified as one Manju Mishra (65), a native of Benaras in Uttar Pradesh. She told cops that she taught music in private schools before her husband died. Police found that she came to Jaipur after her husband’s death and has been living on the streets for the past several years now. She told cops that she was willing to work and eke out a living. Shyam Lal (70) has been living in Jaipur for the past 16 years. A graduate of commerce, he was abandoned by his family. “He was a skilled tailor and said he was willing to work if help was provided to him,” an official said. ACP Narendra Dayma, who conducted a survey across the city, said that many people ended up living a life of destitution because of a host of reasons including mental and physical problems, drug addictions, unemployment and in many cases family problems. Police identified as many as 2,500 beggars who have been living off alms in the city. There were around 50 such persons who had completed schooling while around 11 were graduates. Survey teams also identified a 52-year-old resident from Kota who received awards during his youth but ended up on the streets after he was laid off from the job. Officials said the presence of educated beggars was shocking to them. Some of the beggars told cops that they wanted to find some work and live a respectable life but had difficulty in finding work due to some physical disabilities. Police said they now have an database of all beggars and all of them will be rehabilitated. They will be given skill training and required treatment so that they could find a sustainable job.

---||Nashik||Heavy rainfall starts in Nashik on Saturday night||NASHIK: The spell of intermittent showers that had been lashing parts of the Nashik city and district since Thursday became heavy and steady after 8pm on Saturday. In the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on Friday, the district had received 6mm average rainfall. In the 24 hours ending on Saturday morning, it received an average of 9 mm. Thereafter, throughout the day on Saturday, the district received roughly 6mm — before the heavy rain started at night. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has also warned of further rainfall in and around Nashik. Nashik district has, so far, received 79% of its annual rainfall. Nashik city, however, has only got 45% percent of its annual quota of 695mm rain yet. The rainfall has damaged the surface of many roads that are now riddled with a large number of potholes. The Nashik Municipal Corporation officials have started filling these potholes with the murrum, as they cannot use tar under the current circumstances. The city fire brigade received a call about a huge tree falling near the MICO circle in the evening. No one was injured in the incident, said the fire brigade officials. They added that the traffic in the areas was disrupted for half an hour. The talukas of Igatpuri, Peth and Trimbakeshwar have received good rainfall, while other talukas have received very less rain over the past two days. “The slow and intermittent showers are helping the crops grow. But at the same time, the overcast conditions can lead to spreading of disease in the crops. Rain is much needed,” said Keshav Dhage, a farmer in Nashik. Only three of the 15 talukas have received at least 100% of their annual average rainfall and all three are in the dry areas of the district. The talukas that are known for heavy rainfall and have major and medium dams to store the water for Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, and Jalgaon districts, have received only up to 85% of their annual averages, so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-rainfall-starts-in-nashik-on-saturday-night/articleshow/86123778.cms||---
---||Kochi||Jose K Mani remains mum, Kappan backs Pala bishop||Kottayam: Though Kerala Congress (M) chairman Jose K Mani continued his silence over the controversial remark by Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt that there is an organized ‘narcotic jihad’ against non-Muslims, Pala MLA Mani C Kappan came up with a statement in support of the bishop on Saturday. Kappan said the bishop did not speak against any religion in his speech and that he was only hitting out against those who are misusing religion. He also alleged that some people are trying to make a controversy out of nothing. The bishop’s speech was exclusively meant for the members of the diocese. He was cautioning the members of the church, especially children, against getting involved with people who have narcotics links. He also said that the government, leaders of various political parties and administrators need to come together and support those speaking against narcotics. Meanwhile, KC(M) general secretary Stephen George did not give any clear-cut answer to questions about his party’s stand over the issue. While addressing a press conference, George said the chairman of the party Jose K Mani will give an explanation after a detailed discussion within the party. He, however, said that the party will not stop its members from taking part in the marches held in support of the diocese. Nirmala Jimmy, president of women’s wing of the Kerala Congress (M) and the district panchayat president met the bishop and extended her support to him. She said that what he said was true and that the state and the Centre should investigate the issues raised by the bishop. Ever since the bishop’s remarks sparked a controversy, the Pala-based political outfit KC (M) has been under pressure to make its stand clear. However, being part of the LDF, the party will find it difficult to openly support the bishop’s statements since CPM and LDF have taken a totally different stand on the issue. But the leaders of KC(M) have given the go ahead to its local leaders to extend their support to the church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/jose-k-mani-remains-mum-kappan-backs-pala-bishop/articleshow/86129352.cms||---

---||Pune||Tackling pandemic with tech, care & compassion||PUNE: When the number of Covid-19 cases at the F Residences in Wadgaonsheri surpassed 60-mark in late-April this year, with one resident event succumbing to the infection, the society’s team handling the response to coronavirus sprang into action, embracing technology to care, coordinate and communicate among members and those in need. “The death of the fellow resident from Covid-19 shook us all. We expanded our team to around 40 people to provide for any medical emergency and support the ones quarantined at home. We started initiatives like delivering home-cooked food to patients or shopping groceries for them, or coordinating with hospitals,” said Piyush Srivastava, one of the members of the team. During the weeks of crisis, the team regularly met online, created multiple groups on messaging services to coordinate for food, medicine, or create awareness messages for the residents. The society relied on technology all this while to track the active patients, for which they used Google Sheets and Analytics. A few doctors were also in the team. “On May 27, we finally recorded zero new cases in our society, which came as a huge relief. For vaccines too, we have conducted two drives, where society residents paid for their own vaccinations, but those were sponsored for house helps and security and housekeeping staff,” said Komalkirti Apte, a doctor who was part of the team. A few miles away, at Rohan Mithila-III, off the Symbiosis Road in Vimannagar, the society’s dedicated Covid-19 management team had another issue to deal with — a huge student population, and not all of them could head back to their native places to be with their families. “During the first and second waves, we took care of the students residing in the society as most of them had little idea about cooking. Residents volunteered to cook meals for them, and checked on them regularly whether they needed groceries, which we got for them if they could not go out,” Smruti Shelke, a society resident, recalled. The society prepared a pass system for residents to go out and buy groceries a couple of times per week. It also stopped almost all entry into the society. Besides, the residents also brought the market into their society to minimize the risk of people heading out to crowded places. “We contacted farmers to sell their produce directly in our society, and we also tied up with a supermarket chain for them to set up periodical markets at our gym. To reduce crowding, the residents were invited to shop building-by-building. Some complained that they were not getting fresh produce, so we altered the order in which we called residents,” Shelke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tackling-pandemic-with-tech-care-compassion/articleshow/86127353.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||No change in Covaxin dosages for Covid cured||PUNE: A person would have to take two doses of Covaxin even after recovering from Covid-19 for being considered as a fully vaccinated individual, a Union health ministry official said on Saturday. A recent study of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stated that a single dose of Covaxin might be enough to protect those infected by Covid-19 prior to taking the shot. But the official clarified that as of now, there was no change in the vaccination dosage and no communication had been issued regarding it. “According to the prescribed format, the two doses have to be taken for full vaccination post-Covid infection. Since there is no change in the protocol, there would not be any change made in the Co-WIN app,” the Union health ministry official said. ICMR officials also stated that both vaccine doses would be ideal even for previously infected individuals for full vaccination. Senior epidemiologist of ICMR Dr Samiran Panda said, “Full vaccination requires two doses, and this should be followed.” “Antibody responses to the BBV152 vaccine in individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2: A pilot study” of ICMR was conducted on 114 healthcare professionals and frontline workers taking Covaxin shots from February to May 2021. It found that those infected with Covid-19 and took one dose of Covaxin showed similar immune response as Covid-19 infection-naïve participants who received both the doses of the vaccine. The study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research stated that the preliminary data suggested that a single dose of BBV152-induced humoral immunity in previously infected individuals was equivalent to two doses of the vaccine in infection-naïve individuals. It pointed out that “participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, after a single vaccine (BBV152) dose elicited IgG (N) and IgG (S) antibody levels, along with NAb binding inhibition responses levels, that were similar to infection-naïve vaccinated participants who had taken two doses of the vaccine”. According to ICMR, the findings of the study offers evidence in support of public health-oriented and immunologically sustained vaccine strategies that could include recommending a one-dose regimen for those infected by Covid-19. It said these findings would need to be confirmed with large-size cohort studies. Dr Panda said further studies would be undertaken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-change-in-covaxin-dosages-for-covid-cured/articleshow/86127326.cms||Nisha Nambiar

As per the FIR registered at Jawahar Nagar police station, the builder claimed that he received a WhatsApp call on Tuesday. The caller claimed himself to be Bishnoi and asked for Rs 1 crore. He threatened the builder to arrange for the money in two days otherwise he had shooters ready. The businessman claimed he received a message also from the same number. He then stopped attending WhatsApp calls from unknown phone numbers. Additional DCP (East) Rajarshi Raj Varma said that police were investigating the case. "We are examining who made the call to the complainant," he said. Police have not ruled out the possibility of some mischief behind the alleged extortion call. Investigators are also looking at the possibility of some rival trying to intimidate the businessman. Sources said that the dreaded gangster has been in the jail for past several months. "Bishnoi’s gang has no major stronghold in Jaipur yet. But we are investigating the matter and probing all angles to see how he made the call. Technical investigation will reveal a lot of things," an official informed TOI on the condition of anonymity. The businessman told cops that he was sacred because he lived with his family in the city and the caller had specifically warned him that he should not involve cops in the case. "All major gangsters who operate in the city have either gone dormant or are in different jails. While we are investigating the case, it has to be determined if the caller indeed wanted extortion money or was just trying to scare the complainant," the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bizman-gets-extortion-call-from-jailed-gangster/articleshow/86129373.cms||---

Two months back, the commission had run a short campaign in Jaipur though the results of the same were not as per the expectations. “After the initial campaign, we decided to prepare a SOP regarding the specific roles of the agencies involved and recently we sent it to the CM with a request that he should instruct the departments to follow the same so that we can collectively stop children from begging on the streets”, said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR). The SOP was drafted after the initial campaign did not give the expected results and it was found that more coordination was required between states and while children were being rescued successfully, their rehabilitation continued to be irregular which would also be an area of focus in the coming days. One of the steps for eradication would be to that employment would be provided by surveying the beggars by linking them with skill training programmes which would solve economic problems and help in eradicating begging. Various NGOs are also involved in the campaign to raise awareness about the same. The campaign is following the concept of exhortation followed by rescue and rehabilitation in case required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sop-drafted-for-campaign-against-child-begging-in-raj/articleshow/86129359.cms||---

Rajendra Talekar, a farmer in Nandgaon taluka, said that the rainfall has made things miserable for the farmers. He has lost his maize crop. “Many farmers have completely lost their crops. The rainwater is stagnant in the fields and will cause the crops to decay. The houses of many farmers were severely damaged. Roads to some villages in the taluka were washed away,” he claimed. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, who visited some of the affected talukas in Nashik and Jalgaon on Saturday, assured the farmers that the state government will render help. He interacted with them and gave a patient hearing to their woes. “The respective district administrations have been directed to send detailed reports to the state on the damage of crops, houses etc. The state government will study the reports and take appropriate decisions,” he added.

The project will provide aesthetic relief to the otherwise entirely concretized stretch, which till date has been deprived of any major beautification programmes.The Rs 81.41-crore project had initially planned to beautify a stretch of 3.1km along the river bank, which include parks with walkways, lighting arrangements and other public amenities. However, three years down the line, the final appearance was far from the original plans, where it seems that there is no room for trees to provide shade.However, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, who inspected the work accompanied by Madurai Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan, said that they would try to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the project through the best possible means, and will set up two ‘Sangam parks’ in two places on the river bank -- one behind the Government Rajaji Hospital at Alwarpuram and Keelpalam.Venkatesan said that Madurai’s beauty has been encapsulated in many songs in the Sangam literature, and nine songs in ‘Paripaadal’ and Madurai Kanchi describe the scenic beauty of the city and the river Vaigai. Now, it would be planned in such a manner, that most of these songs would be brought in art form in the two Sangam parks to be established on the river bank. They would also have open air gyms to help local youth who still use the river banks for their fitness schedules, he said.He said that they would plan to establish 3D structures, painting and sculptures related to the Sangam literature in all available places. Pedestrian pathways and other public amenities will be set up. These plans are to be discussed in the upcoming Smart City planning programme scheduled to be held on September 17, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-sangam-poongas-to-come-up-along-vaigai/articleshow/86129436.cms||---

Though the poll date is yet to be announced, ruling BJP seems to have started the preparations and the CM’s visit is also being seen in the same direction. Earlier this year, former Congress minister and sitting party MLA Brajendra Singh Rathore passed away due to Covid-19 that has necessitated the bypoll. Situated in the farthest end of Bundelkhand, Niwari is the latest district created by the BJP-government three years ago. Famous for Orchha’s Ram Raja temple, it borders the district of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. The chief minister is scheduled to address rallies in Mohangarh town, considered as BJP’s stronghold and Prithvipur. Though BJP is yet to announce its candidate, the party faces a choice of plenty. There are a number of claimants for the party ticket, including the cousin of Sunil Nayak, a former BJP MLA from the region. The sitting MLA from Tikamgarh, Rakesh Giri, is also raising voice for his wife, who is also the president of Tikamgarh nagar panchayat. Congress is almost certain to field Nitendra Singh Rathore, the son of the deceased MLA. He is already busy meeting people and seeking support. The district collector and other administrative officials have started preparing for the CM’s visit and inspected the grounds where rallies would be held. A senior party leader said that CM Chouhan is also likely to make announcements for development works in the district, especially in Prithvipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-to-sound-poll-bugle-for-prithvipur/articleshow/86127362.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Congress demands CBI probe into tribal’s death in custody||BHOPAL: Former minister Dr Vijayalaxmi Sadho on Saturday submitted Congress party’s probe report on the custody death of a tribal youth, allegedly after police excess, to PCC chief Kamal Nath. After the death of the tribal youth, identified as Bisen, a resident of Khairkundi village in Khargone district – former chief minister Nath constituted a five-member panel to probe the incident. Sadho was made the head of the probe committee. Speaking to the media at the PCC office, Sadho alleged, “Bisen was summoned by the Bishtan police station on August 31, for an investigation. The victim has no prior background of crime and no cases were registered against him. But when he reached the police station, the youth was beaten mercilessly.” Congress demanded an impartial investigation into the case by CBI, a compensation package of Rs1 crore to the Bisen’s family, which includes his five children, wife and parents. Sadho said that policemen responsible for his death should be charged with murder. State Congress also announced that the party will pay a financial assistance of Rs5 lakh to deceased’s family. The victim’s son Mithun told the Congress probe team that he took food for his father, who was locked in the police station, but cops would not let Bisen eat. “The son told us that his father was starving for four days. In front of the son, the father was beaten with belts and pipes in four separate rooms of the police station. The village sarpanch told us that police atrocities resulted in Bisen’s death,” Sadho said. Congress MLAs who were members of the probe committee, including Panchilal Medha and Ravi Joshi, said that the victim was beaten mercilessly. “There is a series of incidents taking place across Madhya Pradesh targeting tribals and Dalits,” Sadho said. “Whether it is the Nemawar incident where five of a family were killed and buried in a 10-feet deep trench or the murder of a girl student in Balaghat district, atrocities against Dalits and tribals are occurring relentlessly across the state. What wrong did a tribal youth do when he went looking for his wife and child, that he was tied to a pick-up truck and dragged to death?” she asked. Sadho further alleged, “The present BJP government has no connection with the common man. They are oblivious to the rising crimes against Scheduled Castes and tribals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-demands-cbi-probe-into-tribals-death-in-custody/articleshow/86127393.cms||---

---||Delhi||Don’t aspire for posts or tickets, work for country: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to AAP workers||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday advised Aam Aadmi Party workers not to aspire for posts or tickets to contest elections. Party workers and leaders should prove their worth by working for the society and the country so that it motivates the party to offer them posts or tickets, he said. Kejriwal was addressing the party functionaries and workers at the 10th national council meeting of AAP. It was held digitally due to Covid pandemic. Desire of posts or tickets triggers selfishness and hinders service to society, said Kejriwal, who is the national convener of AAP. “I don’t want people to ever say that AAP has become like BJP, Congress and other political parties,” he asserted. The CM said AAP had come to change the politics of ‘power through money and money through power’. “When you join Aam Aadmi Party, do not come here with the expectation of getting any position or getting a ticket for the elections. We must work for the society and the country with complete dedication and honesty. Your work should be of such quality that the position comes to you and you don’t have to go to the position,” Kejriwal stated. “We see what transpires in other parties. Dozens of people fight for one seat, parties breakaway, factions are formed. We don’t want that to happen with our party,” he further said. Elections for the party’s national executive committee were also held on Saturday and 34 members, including Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, were unanimously elected. Party functionaries from Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh found space in the national executive with these states going to polls in near future. Kejriwal welcomed the new executive council members. The CM said that every AAP functionary must maintain a very righteous demeanour. “Today, the entire country looks up to AAP. When someone talks of honesty, they think of AAP. AAP is bringing forth new principles in this society, so please never let greed take over you,” he stated. Kejriwal also underlined the contributions AAP workers in different states made in fighting the pandemic. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that the real mission behind establishing AAP was to work on the issues that had been systematically left behind or deliberately left undone, owing to various political reasons. “Education, health and employment are some of the most important dimensions, however, nation building is one of the prime purposes of AAP,” said Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-aspire-for-posts-or-tickets-work-for-country-kejriwal-to-aap-workers/articleshow/86129479.cms||AlokKNMishra

In a statement, the association said that sanitary workers have been left unpaid for more than one-and-a-half years and that the state and district administration must immediately resolve the issue. The situation is the same for sanitary workers employed on the same basis in all government primary, middle, high and higher secondary schools across the state. The workers alleged that despite repeatedly going to officials, they were turned away and asked to wait. Despite non-payment of salaries, the workers have been engaged in cleaning the school campuses while putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 especially with now schools reopening for Classes IX to XII.The association had already reached out to the Madurai district collector and local body officials. However, despite promising to resolve the issue, no payment has reached the workers so far. “The sanitary workers have also not been given a permanent position. The salary paid is also only Rs 3,000. Especially with everyone struggling amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it is cruel to leave them unpaid for months.

The district administered more doses than Mumbai on Saturday, recording the highest vaccination in Maharashtra. According to the Co-WIN dashboard data till 8.30 pm, Pune had administered 1.56 lakh vaccine doses on Saturday, as against Mumbai’s around 96,000 jabs on the day. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have been stressing on the fact that if the availability of vaccine doses is unrestricted to Pune, the district has the potential to administer the highest jabs in the state. High vaccination numbers are being achieved by roping in more government institutes into the drive now. Nearly 503 government sites and 237 private sites were live on Saturday. Government healthcare sub-centres have also started vaccination in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) recently. These centres are now giving access to vaccines to a population of nearly 5,000-7,000 people in their vicinity.” Similar measures have been taken in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. Apart from large government hospitals, sessions are now being conducted at urban primary health centres (UPHCs) as well as urban community health centres (UCHCs) there. “These smaller centres are located near slums and other urban pockets. These have reduced the travel time of citizens, who earlier had to go to faraway centres for the jabs,” said Dr Deshmukh, adding that the government vaccination sites were increased after the district was assured of increased dose supplies in September. He said the next lot of vaccine doses were likely to come to Pune by Tuesday. District immunisation officer Dr Sachin Edake told TOI, “Medical officers at PHCs have been given instructions to create an increased demand for vaccination in rural areas through focused information, education, and communication (IEC) campaigns, which would help reduce vaccine hesitancy.” Dr Edake said achieving 100% vaccination in Pune district would only be possible if the vaccination drive was started at the health sub-centre level in each village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-56l-doses-administered-in-pune-third-highest-in-a-day/articleshow/86127453.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Delhi||Shot in the arm: 1.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses given in Delhi so far||NEW DELHI: The total number of vaccine doses against Covid-19 administered in Delhi breached the 1.5 crore-mark on Saturday, exactly six weeks since the 1 crore-mark was crossed. Till 10 pm on Saturday, total 1,50,10,777 doses were administered, including 1,06,32,489 first doses and 43,78,288 second doses. With the number of beneficiaries eligible for the vaccine in Delhi being around 1.5 crore, this means that two-third of Delhi’s eligible population has received at least one dose of vaccine and nearly 30% have been fully vaccinated. Out of the total doses administered, almost 60% have been received by those in the 18 to 44 years age category—87,05,522. The number of doses administered to those in the 45 to 59 years age category is 41,00,394, which is 27.3% of the total doses administered and those aged 60 years and above have received 22,04,861 doses, which is 14.7% of the total number. The vaccination drive started on January 16 this year with the priority groups of healthcare and frontline workers, followed by those aged 60 years and above and those with comorbidities. Those aged between 45 and 59 years of age became eligible for the vaccine from April 1, followed by those in the 18 to 44 years age bracket from May. While it took the total number of vaccine doses administered in Delhi to cross the 1 crore-mark from January 16 to July 31, it has taken exactly a month and a half for more than 50 lakh more vaccine doses to be administered. This is due to the fast pace of the vaccination drive in the months of August and September. Till 10 pm on Saturday, the number of vaccine doses administered in the first 11 days of September stood at 14,90,491, with nearly 1.5 lakh vaccine doses being administered every day (excluding Sunday). On September 1, a total of 1.1 lakh vaccine doses were administered, and the number jumped to 1.5 lakh the next day. It was on September 7 that the number of vaccine doses administered reached a high of 1,72,852 doses. The numbers have slightly dipped since then, but the average is still close to 1.5 lakh doses a day. Till Friday, more than 43 lakh people had been fully vaccinated. The North West district has administered the highest number of both first (12,96,423) and second doses (5,04,312) of vaccine among all the revenue districts of the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shot-in-the-arm-1-5cr-vax-doses-given-in-delhi-so-far/articleshow/86129513.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The agency says it is voluminous 9TB data which cannot be shared with the accused without segregation, and that itself is a Herculean task. On other hand the Bhopal court is trying to conclude the trial at the earliest to meet Supreme Court’s deadline. The SC had ordered last month that the trial be completed and the verdict pronounced within 12 months. The apex court dismissed a special leave petition for bail filed by one of the accused, who had been in jail for the last two years. Order was issued last month. A breach in the e-tender process led to the alleged Rs 3,000 crore scam, forcing the government to revoke nine of its major tenders. In 2018, EOW approached CERT-In to pay a visit to MP State Electronics Development Corporation (MPSEDC) to get a mirror image of the data related to the case. CERT-In is yet to share its inputs on the retrieved data. EOW has been sending reminders to the central agency for this so that it can wrap up the investigation Officers also say that it is not feasible to share the entire data with the accused as it may have an adverse impact on pending cases. The trial court has asked EOW to hand over the digital evidence in compliance with the SC ruling to conclude its trial at the earliest. The SC order goes thus: “We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned judgment passed by the high court. Consequently, the special leave petition is dismissed. However, the trial court is directed to conclude the trial and pronounce the judgment within a year from the date of receipt of the copy of this order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/e-tender-scam-probe-eow-in-a-spot-over-accuseds-proof-copy-demand/articleshow/86127490.cms||P Naveen

Her clothes had been pulled down, her face badly bruised, a tooth broken and her neck had strangulation marks when the body was found. Her family said she had been raped. An FIR, based on their complaint, has been filed. The dalit woman had represented two big states in north India at national-level events in the past five years, basic education sports officer Arvind Ahlawat said. “But my daughter wanted to help the family. So, instead of pursuing her sports career, she trained others. She was studying physical education at a university and used to work as a sports teacher at a government school here. She lost her job in April because of the pandemic,” said her father, who works as a daily wager at a sugar mill. “On Friday, she had gone to a private school for a job interview.” When she didn’t return for hours, her family was worried. “We started looking for her. Around 3pm, a neighbour said a girl — they thought she was unconscious — was found lying close to the railway line amid cement sleepers. We rushed there and saw it was my younger sister,” her sister said. The area was on a desolate stretch. Used syringes and empty plastic sachets were found near the body. The family alleged that police refused to file the FIR saying that the area where the crime took place was not under their jurisdiction. It was, instead, something the Government Railway Police (GRP) had to look into, they said. The closest GRP station was about 40km away in Najibabad, where the FIR was eventually lodged after local BSP leaders intervened. Unidentified persons were booked under sections 302 (murder) and 376 (rape) of the IPC. On Saturday, Bijnor SP Dharamvir Singh, however, said the autopsy report did not find evidence of any crime other than murder.  “According to the postmortem report, strangulation has been ascertained as the cause of death. No other crime was perpetrated upon her, the report says … Four police teams have been set up to investigate the case,” he added. The woman’s family said the postmortem report was “misleading”. Her sister said, “She was raped. There is no doubt about it. The state of her body, with disheveled clothes and injuries, is itself evidence. One can see the pictures of the state in which she was found. And there must have been more than one person. She was a sportsperson. It would not have been easy to overpower her.” SHO of the GRP station at Najibabad, Sarvez Khan, said a decision on whether the rape charges will be dropped or not will depend on the investigation. “I have not seen the postmortem report yet,” he added.

The Chakan police said the entrepreneur, Dhananjay Baburao Reddy (30), was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his residence on September 4. The police found a suicide note, purportedly written by Reddy. The police said he mentioned the names of the moneylender and his accomplice for troubling him. The police said Reddy had borrowed some money from the moneylender a year ago. When he failed to repay the sum, the moneylender started threatening and abusing him. The moneylender’s accomplice also made phone calls to Reddy and demanded money from him.

In the joint drive by the traffic police and regional transport office, action was taken against 1,301 drivers for violating norms on third day of the drive on Saturday. “There are several complaints against autorickshaw drivers, such as refusal to ply, charging excess fare, misbehaving. We will understand the problems faced by autorickshaw drivers and passengers before arriving to any conclusion,” Gupta told TOI. The police commissioner said an elaborate exercise has been started for creating profiles of autorickshaw driver across Pune police jurisdiction. “There are 82,000 autorickshaw drivers and 42,000 of them are enrolled with the RTO,” he said, adding, “The traffic police personnel will visit each and every auto stand to secure details like name, age, address, photo, area of operation, working hours etc of the autorickshaw drivers. “The idea is to ensure that they have this feeling of being constantly under watch,” the police commissioner said. Nitin Pawar, convenor of Pune autorickshaw panchayat, said,“The drive launched against the autorickshaw drivers is not justified because the state government has given time till September 30 to renew permits and clear their outstanding dues. Nearly 90% of the autorickshaw drivers maintain discipline and follow traffic norms. There are public complaints against 10% drivers because they have rented their vehicles to miscreants/criminal elements involved in crimes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drive-against-auto-drivers-to-go-on-till-passengers-issues-are-solved-cp/articleshow/86127534.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Delhi||‘Mumbai of 1970s had amazing spirit, the sense that anything can happen’||Long before 1991, when India was imbued with a sense that anyone can make it, Mumbai of the 1970s was full of people who came from nothing and did spectacular things, said Vir Sanghvi, journalist and author of the memoir A Rude Life, in a session of the Times LitFest. The examples of this can-do spirit he cited were Dhirubhai Ambani, who went from petrol pump attendant to tycoon, and Amitabh Bachchan. “Amitabh was a business executive in Calcutta who worked for a company called Bird and Company. He gave it all up, came to Bombay to become an actor and had tough times – one night, he slept on a bench in Marine Drive – but he made it. There was that sense about Bombay, which I think the rest of India has perhaps caught up with, that anything can happen.” During the session, Sanghvi discussed his experiences – personal and political alike – spanning decades. For instance, he detailed the disillusionment that was felt with Indira Gandhi as Sanjay Gandhi was thrust into the spotlight out of the blue. “People had vaguely heard about him. We knew one of her sons was a quiet pilot who didn’t want to get involved in politics and the other was a motor mechanic of some description and he used to hang out with characters who could charitably be called thugs.” This, he added, was the real beginning of dynasty politics. In his book, he recounts Benazir Bhutto telling him that the ISI had persuaded Osama Bin Laden to stick around in South Asia, even after the first Afghan war. Did this mean that the ISI must have known about 9/11? “The ISI had very close links with the Taliban which sheltered Osama. The plot was hatched in Kandahar and parts of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban, with the assistance of the ISI. It’s hard to believe that an international plot of this magnitude could happen without some ISI guys being involved.” The evolution of Indian media also came up for discussion. “The language they have adopted on television is not the language people used to adopt in debates, it’s the language of Twitter. Political spokespeople have effectively become troll farms with their lips moving,” he says, comparing debates to WWF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mumbai-of-1970s-had-amazing-spirit-the-sense-that-anything-can-happen/articleshow/86129589.cms||---

She was “enraged” at the violation of Covid protocol. Police have recorded the students’ statements and the school will initiate an inquiry. The two Class X students were from different sections. One had come into the other’s classroom during lunch break. The teacher in charge, Amita Rastogi, lost her cool. “She used derogatory terms, said we were in a relationship and that we must be seeing each other outside school,” one of the girls said. On Saturday, the girls’ parents and relatives reached the school, demanding action. Police were also called. “We were informed and a police team went to the school. A teacher had allegedly thrashed two students,” Atar Singh, SHO of Lal Kurti police station, said. No FIR has been lodged. Police recorded statements of both the girls. “Later, the principal promised a departmental inquiry into the case. No need was felt from either side to file a police complaint.” The principal confirmed that an inquiry would be initiated. “I have reported the case to the management and they will investigate the matter once the teacher is back in school,” principal Rajni Shankhdhar told TOI. She said, however, that she did not know what had happened. “I am not even aware of what happened. Neither the students nor the parents came to me with a complaint the day this allegedly happened. It was only on Saturday that they barged into the school, creating a ruckus,” she added. “I cannot speak with the teacher right now because she is very sick and on the verge of getting an IV line because of acute diarrhea."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/teacher-spots-2-kids-having-lunch-calls-them-lesbians-thrashes-them/articleshow/86123950.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Delhi||Western concept of secularism under challenge: Holland||Drawing parallels between Turkish President Erdogan’s decision to turn the iconic Hagia Sophia museum into a mosque and PM Narendra Modi laying the foundation stone for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, award-winning historian Tom Holland said that both events stirred a debate on the concept of the secular, as defined by the West. In a conversation with TOI’s Vikas Singh at the Times LitFest, Holland pointed out that the word had its roots in Christianity, and had been repackaged and exported to the world. Holland, who has recently penned ‘Dominion: The Making of the Western Mind’ that traces Christianity’s emergence and legacy, also underlined the significance of religion. “The power of religion to provide meaning to people and a sense of identity is far greater today than the immediate post-war years,” he said. But the question of following a religion or belief is not without its challenges, like the idea of transhumanism or the debate on climate change. “The extreme fringes of the environment movement believe that humanity is the problem, that global warming is due to humans and humans need to be extinct,” he said. Holland, who has earlier written Gothic horror and historic fiction, is not surprised by the popularity of historical shows on OTT platforms. “People study history because it is interesting, and it tells a great story. Medieval history offers someone in the 21st century something akin to the pleasure of science fiction, there are elements that are familiar and some that are incredibly alien and it is the conjunction of the two that makes for a thrilling story,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/western-concept-of-secularism-under-challenge-holland/articleshow/86129634.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Most Kolkata private hospitals see mild infections, admission numbers stay stable||KOLKATA: Even though the number of Covid patients has been slowly spiralling across the state, the number of admissions, however, remains stable — and far lower than September, 2020 — at Kolkata’s private hospitals, indicating that the vaccine has reduced the virulence of the virus. The city had recorded five deaths on September 10 but there was no casualty in Kolkata on Saturday. The number of admissions has been stable at 25-50 at private hospitals over the last three weeks despite a swell in pre-puja crowd and life returning to near-normalcy, pointed out hospital authorities and experts. At Peerless Hospital, for instance, the number of Covid patients has varied between 21 and 25 so far this month. It had shot up to 90 this time last year, prior to the pujas, which saw the peak of the first wave. “Vaccination has definitely reduced the virulence of Covid attacks, drastically cutting down hospitalizations. So, while the number of affected has risen, few have required hospitalization, which is hopefully a sign that the pandemic is waning,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. While Peerless had 22 admitted at the Covid ITU last September-beginning, the number is just seven now. AMRI Hospitals have seen a drastic drop in admissions compared to September, 2020. While it had around 325 Covid patients across its three units during the second week of September last year, it now has just 25 admitted. “The number of RT-PCR tests, too, has slid sharply from 700 a day a year ago to around 150 now,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. The number of fresh cases in Bengal jumped from 601 on September 7 to 752 on September 11. Reduction in hospitalization is a direct fall-out of vaccination, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Transmission will continue but immunization has thwarted the severity of the disease. Now, we don’t need to worry about numbers for it will rise with the third wave but these will be mild infections, treatable at home. Unlike the first or the second waves, we won’t see a rush for hospital beds and more importantly, deaths will be negligible,” Sarkar said. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has 15 Covid patients now, while it had 98 on September 11-12 last year. “We have just five critical care patients now compared to 24 last year,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. The number of Covid admissions has slid below 10 this month at Belle Vue Clinic. On September 10, 2020, the hospital had 123 Covid patients, including 56 in ITU. “It had started rising marginally last month but has dropped appreciably over the last three weeks. Vaccination must have played a part,” said CEO P Tondon. Belle Vue internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain sees the trend continuing but warns that if the number of infected turns too large, hospitalization, too, will rise. “While most infections are now mild, thanks to vaccines, transmission needs to be checked. If the number of infected swells, the number of serious patients will rise proportionally, filling up hospitals,” warned Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-pvt-hosps-see-mild-infections-admission-numbers-stay-stable/articleshow/86125677.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Delhi||Dharma isn’t just dos and don’ts, it’s about consequences: Amish||The dharma of a warrior is to win a war in the right way. But what happens when one has to break the rules to win?” Amish, author of ‘Dharma: Decoding the Epics for a Meaningful Life’, raised this and other such questions about dharmas and their conflicts with each other in conversation with author-diplomat Pavan K Varma during a session of the Times LitFest. Amish, whose new release is co-authored with his sister Bhavna Roy, said that at every step people were faced with choices. “What does a person who follows Jainism do when he sees a woman being attacked? Does his swadharma (non-violence) come in conflict with apadadharma (to protect)? Or is a person at fault when he is taking one apple from a rich man’s house to feed his hungry child? However, even if there is a justification, there is no escape from the consequences,” he said. He went on to explain that dharma was complex and nuanced. It goes beyond a list of dos and don’ts. “It shows the nature of the universe. We analyse it and make the choices. It gives us perspective and it is about finding an ideal balance. No action is either right or wrong. There are both extremes. That’s where conscience comes into the picture. We know that Lord Krishna was dharmic and Shakuni was not. It is essentially about the role,” he pointed out. Roy said it was also about how we negotiate life. “It lies in the intentions of the heart and the mind. Are truths and facts synonymous? Facts are data and truths depend on the intentions. Our real intention lies in our unconscious mind,” she said. Amish added that most people know their morality or conscience, but find it difficult to stick with it. “The greatest miscalculations happen when people try to appear moral when they are not. People do a lot of things on social media to appear right and gain virtual likes, but it pushes them away from their morality,” said the author of the Shiva Trilogy. The book follows a conversation format. “Even in our dharmic books, be it the Upanishads or the Bhagavad Gita, a conversation format is followed. There is no final commandment, and the purpose is to show a deeper understanding,” explained Amish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/amish-dharma-isnt-just-dos-and-donts-its-about-consequences/articleshow/86129687.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid test plan for shoppers in 46 wards to check case rise in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The chief municipal health officer who leads Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s Covid-19 strategy in the city has suggested rapid antigen tests at malls and markets located in wards that have witnessed a spurt in Covid cases in the past fortnight to check the spread of infection during the pre-Puja shopping spree. The civic health department has identified 46 wards in nine boroughs that have recorded 10 or more Covid cases in the past 14 days. All except three wards are in south Kolkata. Charting out a containment plan, CMHO Subrata Roy Chowdhury has called for rapid tests on shoppers before entry into closed shopping spaces to reduce the risk of infection during the shopping season. “Conducting tests on all shoppers will be challenging. But we are seriously considering it along with crowd management at malls, market places, departmental stores and shops,” said a civic official. Though containment zones have not been declared, the plan does not rule out bringing in such curbs if Covid cases rise abnormally. For now, the measures lined up include deploying more health workers to conduct regular surveys in the affected zones and contact tracing, allotment of more vaccines to expedite vaccination in these localities and carry out extensive awareness campaigns to ensure that people use masks and abide by Covid protocols. If needed, institutional quarantine and safe home services will be re-introduced in these areas. However, civic health officials have been asked to wait till the completion of the byelection in Bhowanipore on October 30 before such actions are taken. “The stress will be on vaccination. Allotment of vaccines to the affected wards will be doubled. Unvaccinated persons will be located and vaccinated,” said a civic health official. An analysis of the Covid situation will be carried out every Sunday. Roy Chowdhury has also suggested punitive measures on bus operators who do not adhere to the 50% occupancy rule and allow crowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-test-plan-for-shoppers-in-46-wards-to-check-case-rise/articleshow/86125690.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Hyderabad||SC panel to quiz top cop who investigated Disha encounter||Hyderabad: Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat will depose before the Justice VS Sirpurkar Commission of Inquiry, probing the alleged encounter killing of four accused named in the Disha gang-rape and murder case, during the next hearing scheduled to begin from Monday. Incidentally, Bhagwat headed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the state government to probe the December 6, 2019, alleged encounter in which the four accused —Mohammed Arif, J Shiva, C Chennakeshavulu, J Naveen, accused in the gang-rape and murder of veterinary doctor Disha — were killed during scene reconstruction at Chatanpally near Shadnagar. In simple words, the man who probed the encounter will now face queries from the panel. On November 27, 2019, 26-year-old Disha was gang-raped and murdered allegedly by the four near a toll plaza at Shamshabad. A few hours later, they burnt her body at an underpass at Chatanpally. The four were killed in an alleged encounter near the underpass on December 6, 2019. SIT has already submitted its report to the Supreme Court (SC)-appointed commission and on the basis of this report the commission would question Bhagwat. The commission would resume its hearing from September 13 and continue till September 17. Investigation officer (IO) of the encounter case J Surrender Reddy, Rachakonda additional deputy commissioner of police, earlier in his deposition before the commission, had said that they could not lift fingerprints from the weapons, allegedly snatched by the two accused to open fire at police personnel in their attempt to escape, since the surface of the arms was rough in nature. In the second session, several discrepancies in the encounter case came to light. Addl DCP Surrender Reddy informed the commission that CCTVs at the Shadnagar police station, where the accused were kept first, were not functioning. However, the commission pointed out the Telangana additional director-general of police (Law & Order) stated in a letter that “CCTVs were not existing” at the police station. “One of the two panch witnesses told the commission that he did not see who opened fire at whom since it all happened in a fraction of seconds,” advocate Krishna Murthy, who impleaded before the commission to be an independent counsel for the families of the four deceased, told TOI. When asked about the medical reports of two police personnel injured during the alleged encounter, J Surrender Reddy told the panel that a private hospital refused to provide the documents. However, an affidavit submitted by the hospital stated that a sub-inspector of police-rank officer from the Rachakonda commissionerate took the medical records. As per NHRC)guidelines, it is mandatory for a judicial magistrate to conduct the inquest following any encounter. However, in the Chatanpally encounter case, an executive magistrate had conducted the inquiry. The investigation officer defended this decision, claiming a large number of people had gathered at the spot. However, after seeing the video clippings of the inquest, the panel observed that the crowd was not as big as the IO claimed. In the FIR, it was mentioned that the judicial magistrate was informed in the morning about the incident, but the judicial officer informed the commission that she received information at 4.30pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sc-panel-to-quiz-top-cop-who-investigated-disha-encounter/articleshow/86127700.cms||---
---||Pune||Drop in H1N1 cases continues in 2021 after hitting 4-year low in 2020||PUNE: The drop in the number of seasonal influenza (H1N1) cases in India, including Maharashtra, continued in 2021 (till July), after hitting a four-year low in Covid-19 year 2020, data from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has shown. Top virologists have attributed the trend to increased masking, sanitization and social distancing, besides lower H1N1 surveillance, since March last year.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();  As many as 2,752 cases and 44 deaths due to H1N1 were reported in the country in 2020. These included 121 cases and three fatalities from the disease in Maharashtra, the data showed. From January to July this year, only 65 H1N1 cases and no deaths were reported in the country, including 34 infections from Maharashtra. .  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Seasonal influenza is caused by a number of circulating influenza viruses such as influenza A H1N1, H3N2, influenza B, among others. H1N1 is also one of several flu virus strains that can cause the seasonal flu. A senior NCDC official told TOI, “Covid burden on infrastructure has affected testing for seasonal influenza (H1N1). We have been reminding the states regularly during the flu seasons to take care of testing numbers and preparedness pertaining to seasonal influenza. The increased masking and sanitization in the country since March last year may have also played a role in bringing seasonal influenza cases down because these measures have an impact on all respiratory diseases.” Dr Sanjay Pujari from the ICMR National Task Force on Clinical Research for Covid-19, who is also the director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases, Pune, told TOI, “SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than influenza. The R0 or reproduction number for influenza is 1.3 and that for SARS-CoV-2 is 2-3. Also, H1N1 spreads through cough and sneeze droplets. Sars-CoV-2 virus transmission is via airborne aerosols, which being lighter than droplets, can travel longer distances.” Dr Pujari said the severity of illness is more in Covid as compared to H1N1. “The overwhelming Covid pandemic may have pushed out other illnesses like H1N1 as access to healthcare became difficult during the two Covid waves. For some reason, in the last two waves, not only seasonal influenza, but there seemed to be a drop in patient admissions pertaining to conditions like strokes and heart attacks at hospitals too. That may have been a result of less access to care with Covid dominating,” he said. He said two to three viruses of seasonal influenza are usually in circulation, but H1N1 is the predominant virus in India among those causing seasonal influenza. According to Dr Pujari, another concept is viral interference where CoV-2 competes with other respiratory viruses, including H1N1 in respiratory tract reducing its incidence during the Covid-19 pandemic. Giridhara Babu, member, epidemiology, surveillance and research group constituted by ICMR National Task Force for Covid-19, told TOI, “Effective functioning of the surveillance system on reporting flu cases needs to be first assessed to come to a conclusion about the drop in H1N1 cases. It needs to be seen that states reporting flu cases well earlier are still maintaining that level of reporting.” The NCDC data pertained to cases and deaths due to influenza A (H1N1) and is based on the reports sent by states/UTs to Central Surveillance Unit, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, NCDC, New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drop-in-h1n1-cases-continues-in-2021-after-hitting-4-year-low-in-2020/articleshow/86127694.cms||Neha Madaan

They also threatened her to remain quiet or "face consequences". The crime was reported from the Izzatnagar area on September 2 when the student of class 5, a Dalit, was dragged to an abandoned place by one of the men. He took off her clothes and assaulted her. His friend, all this while, shot the video. The accused later showed the purported video to others in the village, police said. The traumatised girl told her mother everything on Friday and the family decided to lodge a police complaint. Police have detained one of the accused. The main accused is a school dropout, often seen roaming in the area with his friend, police added. Several members of a right-wing outfit also staged a protest in front of the local police station and demanded strict action against the accused. The accused belong to another faith and police are looking at all angles as they proceed with the case. The girl’s statement was recorded and she was sent for medico-legal examination. Her statement under section 164 CrPC will be recorded in front of a magistrate. Izzatnagar SHO Satish Kumar Yadav told TOI, “We have conducted an initial investigation and found evidence against both the accused. One of them, aged 18, who attempted to rape the girl, has been arrested." The SHO further said, "The other accused, who shot the girl’s video in his phone, is still at large. His age is not clear yet. We will also add the SC/ST Act in the FIR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/young-man-tries-to-rape-class-5-student-his-friend-films-assault/articleshow/86119503.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Police said that complainant Vijay Sharma had actually shown readiness to buy the mortgaged property from accused Pritesh Parmar and had even assured Parmar of clearing off the loan amount. Between July and August last year, Sharma paid Rs 42.5 lakh, following which Parmar gave him a bill of sale on which the co-accused Jayesh Parmar had signed as witness. Around three months ago, Sharma learnt that Parmar had already sold the same plots to another buyer Bhimji Katudiya in 2018 for which he was also given bill of sale. As Katudiya had also felt cheated, he filed a suit against the two accused and Sharma in a civil court in June. Based on Sharma’s complaint, a case of cheating was filed at Vadodara Taluka police station on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/trader-resold-mortgaged-sold-plots-in-vadodara/articleshow/86126586.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Over 500 dengue cases confirmed in Firozabad||AGRA: Firozabad district continues to grapple with a severe dengue outbreak with six more deaths reported in 24 hours, taking the toll to 110 till Saturday afternoon. Out of these, 84 were children. Significantly, at least 578 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad district in the past one month. Two-third of them are children. Health department officials suggest the outbreak of DENV-2 serotype. Among children, dengue hemorrhagic fever is the major cause of fatality, health officials said, blaming the lack of sanitation and hygiene for its spread. Senior health officials further claimed that people going to quacks in the initial stage of illness also proved to be fatal for many. Unqualified doctors are administering steroids to patients resulting in high fever, they said. The state government has now ordered strict action against such quacks. Confirming the 578 dengue cases, additional director of the health department, AK Singh, said, “Lack of sanitation and hygiene is the main reason behind the dengue outbreak in Firozabad district. The worst-affected areas are near unclean drains and places affected by waterlogging. To put a tab on the breeding of the mosquitoes, we have discharged 25,000 'gambusia' or mosquito larvae eating fish in stagnant water. Anti-larvae spraying is also being done along with a massive cleaning drive.” “During investigation, it was found that initial treatment by quacks in slum and rural areas was a major reason for the sudden increase in the number of cases. Patients suffering from fever were administered steroids. This provided short-term relief, but multiplied the rate of falling platelets. Vomiting blood was common in such cases." Singh added, "In coordination with the local administration, the health department has launched a campaign to take action against the quacks. Private hospitals have also been directed to provide details of patients under treatment.” Lack of beds in government hospitals made matters worse for many. A local resident Ashok Kumar said, “My 10-year-old daughter was suffering from high fever for two days. Her condition deteriorated on Saturday. I took her to the Firozabad medical college, but there was no vacant bed. My child died on the way to a hospital in Agra.” There are 64 active camps in the district and 4,800 people, including those with fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said, “Round the clock monitoring of Firozabad and its adjoining districts is being done from the headquarters. In order to ensure time-bound treatment at government centres, we are diverting senior doctors and paramedical staff to the district. Medicines and other required resources have been made available. Senior officials are camping in the district to control the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-500-active-dengue-cases-in-firozabad-death-toll-reaches-110/articleshow/86124070.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||UG berths fill up fast at top colleges in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Some of the top colleges in Kolkata have reported an encouraging number of admissions in the undergraduate courses, with some of them filling up a majority of the seats within 11 days of starting the admission process. Some principals said they were prepared for a few cancellations at a later stage and were keeping a “Plan B” ready for those students lower on the general merit list who are serious about taking admission. Some of these colleges already have between 55% and 75% seats filled with 19 days left before first-semester UG classes start. In St Xavier’s College, there is no vacancy in any of the courses. In Goenka College, almost 86% seats are filled. In some other colleges, however, vacancies in courses like Sanskrit, Urdu, philosophy and Bengali honours are dragging down their aggregate performance in filling up the seats despite quick admissions in other courses. “We do not have a single seat left in any of the courses this year. I am feeling bad because so many students with very good marks are mailing us with requests to admit them, but we are helpless. There is no seat left in any of the undergraduate courses this year,” said Reverend Father Dominic Savio, principal, St Xavier’s College. In Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration, only 72 out of 549 seats are vacant after three rounds of admission. “We think seats will fill up in the current round,” said a professor who is a part of the admissi-ons committee. In Maulana Azad College, 805 seats out of 1,032 are taken. In most courses, the vacancies are less than 15. After three rounds of admissions, 331 seats out of 619 have been taken in Lady Brabourne College. The maximum vacancies are in subjects like Bengali, Urdu and mathematics. “The trend is encouraging, but there might be some cancellations,” said principal Siuli Sarkar. In Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, there are seven vacant seats in computer science, eight in economics, eight in English, four in history, three in microbiology, three in philosophy and nine in zoology. In Bethune College, 302 seats out of 557 are taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ug-berths-fill-up-fast-at-top-colleges-in-kolkata/articleshow/86125713.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Pollution season: DPCC to focus on ‘bad fuel’||NEW DELHI: As Delhi’s air quality is expected to deteriorate from next month, Delhi Pollution Control Committee will be cracking down on use of non-cleaner fuels in the industries, burning of tyres, DG sets with no emission control device and flouting guidelines of C&D waste. DPCC will focus on these four areas in addition to their winter plan to minimise air pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to DPCC officials, a special drive will begin from mid-October to act against industries using non-cleaner fuels and causing emissions. Over 1,600 industrial units switched to PNG after pipelines were placed in their industrial area. “However, industrial areas that do not have pipelines are required to use other forms of cleaner fuels. We will act against those units that are found using non-cleaner fuels,” said an official. Some people in unorganised sectors burn tyres to extract oil, which causes air pollution. DPCC will be cracking down against people indulging in such illegal activities. Similarly, DPCC in July this year directed all users of diesel generator sets with a capacity of 125 kVA and above to install an emission control device to control the pollution level. If the users could not install emission control devices, they were directed to shift to gas-based generators. “Any user of such a DG set with a capacity of 125 kVA is found without an emission control device would attract action as per the provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of pollution) Act 1981,” said an official. To abate dust and related air pollution from the construction and demolition activities, Delhi government had issued guidelines last year. Among the dust mitigation measures set by the government are using 10 metres thick metal sheets and nets at the site to prevent dust from blowing out, covering debris and construction material with tarpaulin, sprinkling of water to keep the area dust free during operational conditions and using anti-smog guns at over 20,000 sqm sites and covering vehicles carrying construction material and washing their wheels regularly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pollution-season-focus-on-bad-fuel/articleshow/86125735.cms||---

The accused has been booked under sections of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offenses (Pocso) Act, police said. The teacher was picked up by local police after a complaint by the girl's father and a case was registered at Civil Lines police station. He was also suspended by the school authority. In the purported video clip, the teacher can also be heard saying, “Kaun bachayega? aaya koi? [Who will save you? Did anyone come?]." Rampur additional superintendent of police (ASP), Sansar Singh, said, “Our investigation found that the incident occurred on Teachers' Day [September 5]. The occasion was being celebrated at a coaching centre run by the accused teacher in the Civil Lines area.” The ASP added, “Taking cognizance of the purported video and complaint filed by girl’s father, an FIR has been registered against the accused, Alok Saxena, under IPC section 354 [assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty] and sections of the Pocso Act.” Police said the accused, a resident of Krishna Vihar, was produced before the court following which he was arrested and sent to jail on Saturday. Meanwhile, the school principal said, “The incident didn’t take place on the school premises. It occurred on the occasion of Teachers' Day at a coaching centre operated by the teacher. We have taken cognizance of the video and initiated necessary legal action against him.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-school-teacher-forcibly-puts-cake-on-minor-girls-face-booked-under-pocso-act/articleshow/86121970.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Roads waterlogged as AAP govt failed to clear drains, says BJP||NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri hit out at the AAP government over waterlogging as downpour on Saturday led to massive waterlogging at various locations causing traffic jams and throwing life out of gear. Bidhuri said the waterlogging was caused because the drains were not cleaned by the government and added that no one in the AAP government was ready to take responsibility. In a statement, the BJP functionary said it was unfortunate that despite roads being flooded, underpasses being inundated and normal life in capital coming to a standstill due to rains, not a single official or minister of the Delhi government was seen on the roads carrying out relief or doing inspections to reassure the citizens. “The PWD and the flood and irrigation department did not make any effort to clear the drains before monsoon. CM Arvind Kejriwal did not take advance review and was not seen on roads inspecting the affected areas. Most of the underpasses, main roads and many colonies are facing the wrath of the rain due to failure of the government. Only thing people hear from the government is that it is preparing a scheme to deal with the situation, but unfortunately nothing concrete takes place on the ground,” claimed Bidhuri. Despite attempts, no reaction was available from AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/roads-waterlogged-as-govt-failed-to-clear-drains-bjp/articleshow/86125745.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Samithi urges govt to appeal against HC order on PoP idols||Hyderabad: The Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi (BGUS) on Saturday urged the Telangana government to file a review petition in the high court against its recent ruling that banned the immersion of Plaster of Paris (PoP) idols in Hussainsagar Lake. Referring to official reports filed in the past, before and after immersion, Samithi members claimed that all findings conclude that PoP idols do not add to the pollution levels of the water body. They appealed to the state to collate these reports and table them before the high court so that immersions can be carried out without any hindrance this year. Immersion of most Ganpati idols will be held on September 19. “The Hussainsagar water is largely being polluted with sewage flowing into it regularly. Also, reports of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB), which collects water samples before and after idol immersion, show that the pollution load of the lake has in fact reduced in recent years with immersions being spread out to multiple parts of Hussainsagar, as opposed to one point,” said Bhagwant Rao, general secretary, BGUS, urging the government to show the court the results compiled by PCB. Quoting another report by the Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI), he said that PoP idols are harmless. The report reads, “As per the experiments conducted at EPTRI lab that clay idols (category-I) break open when immersed in water and PoP made idols (category-II) are not affected even after 60 days of contact with water as even after lab scale immersion in mild acid water, they were found intact, in other words, large idols can be safely withdrawn from the lake after immersion.” Rao argued that the high court, while hearing writ petitions on the issue of immersions, has referred to this report in the past that states: “...category-I (clay) idols increase the alkalinity of water and adds carbonates, bicarbonates and sulphur each year whereas the category-II (PoP) idols do not show serious solubility potential in water, they many not contribute any direct chemical load to the water.” Apart from producing these reports in the high court, the samithi also appealed to the state government to approach the Supreme Court over the issue. When asked about the samithi’s plans for immersion, in view of the court order, the general secretary said that it would take a final decision only after the state government files its response. “Else, we will announce our plan of action if the Telangana government does not respond to our plea,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/samithi-urges-govt-to-appeal-against-hc-order-on-pop-idols/articleshow/86127739.cms||Sunil Mungara

Since the number of cases are on the rise, the health department has deployed multiple teams in rural areas to collect the samples of suspected patients. The health department also confirmed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in some of the 1,400 patients. The malaria strain had claimed over 200 lives in Bareilly district in 2018. Taking no chances, health teams are spraying anti-larvae medicines to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes in the city and villages. Recent rainfall has resulted in waterlogging in several parts of Bareilly district and the stagnant water provided an active breeding ground for the mosquitoes. District magistrate Nitish Kumar recently held a review meeting with health officials in the presence of journalists and necessary instructions were given to control the spread of vector-borne diseases. On Saturday, Bareilly CMO Dr Balveer Singh told TOI, “We are sending teams door-to-door to detect malaria cases and distribute medicines. We are sharing the data with district administration on a daily basis and taking every possible step to ensure there is no outbreak of malaria or dengue in the district. In neighbouring Shahjahanpur district, two cases of dengue and 16 cases of malaria were reported this week. Shahjahanpur CMO Dr SP Gautam told TOI, “One of the two dengue patients is from Lakhimpur Kheri district. And malaria cases have been reported from a few villages. We have taken the necessary precautions and distributed medicines there. Medical camps are held on a regular basis and the overall health situation is under control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/over-1400-confirmed-malaria-cases-in-bareilly-so-far-this-year/articleshow/86119513.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Ganesh idol makers in the city told TOI that 50,000 to 80,000 idols have been made with PoP and 50,000 idols have been made with clay. “The idols will be immersed based on a decision taken by the state government and instructions received from the Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi. Till then, idols will have to be kept at the pandals,” a pandal organiser in Ameerpet said. A member of a residents welfare association (RWA) in SR Nagar said, “There is a lot of uncertainty due to the recent HC order banning PoP idols for immersion. The government officials must resolve the issue at the earliest.” Another Ganesh pandal organiser in Secunderabad said that the government must respond to the HC orders soon as the idols cannot be kept at the pandals for too many days. BGUS general secretary Bhagwant Rao said that they do not have the exact number of PoP idols that were installed by the pandal organisers this year in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ganesh-pandal-organisers-in-a-fix-await-orders-from-govt/articleshow/86127754.cms||---

The commission’s work was stalled for some time on account of the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic, but has now gained momentum thanks to a hybrid mode of functioning evolved by authorities. In the next phase of hearing, scheduled between September 13 and 18, the commission will examine 14 witnesses, most of them relatives of the four accused and a few officials. In the last sitting at the commission’s office at the high court’s extended blocks, which lasted for a week, the Supreme Court-appointed panel had recorded the depositions of the investigation officers and the commission’s advocates cross-examined them with several questions and pointed out several discrepancies in their versions. The judges were presiding over the session from their respective residence offices in Mumbai and Delhi. The advocates of the commission were present before the court, both physically and virtually. The commission had received 1,333 affidavits from the general public and 112 affidavits from the officials and the investigators. The task of collecting relevant documents and records was almost over. The commission would examine the affidavits and the record and would decide on the number of persons to be examined. Though it has arrived at a figure on the number of people to be examined, the number might vary in the coming months. Based on the evidence collected so far, the commission might summon some more people for examination, a source in the commission said. It may be recalled that the commission was appointed by the SC 18 months ago and the commission’s extended tenure too will end in February 2022. The commission has prepared its task in such a way that it will be able to complete it by February, the source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sirpurkar-commission-may-submit-report-by-february/articleshow/86127723.cms||---

TOI spoke to citizens at immersion points at Futala and Sonegaon lakes. Appreciating the arrangements done by the civic authorities, Vaibhav Gundawar, a hospital administrator, said that it was ensured that all protocols were followed and there was no crowding or inconvenience caused to devotees. “There is a nirmalya kalash at several places. I saw many people wearing their masks properly and carrying sanitizers,” he said. Gundawar believes the visarjan will be done very smoothly and in an eco-friendly manner and appreciated the efforts taken by NMC and volunteers. According to a student, Kaiwalya Joshi, this year the authorities are very strict about not letting immersion of idols in the lake. “There are artificial tanks everywhere and proper arrangements have been made for a smooth and crowd-free ritual. People are following all the rules as there is fear of the projected third wave.” Appreciating the steps taken by the authorities, Namdeo Thombare, a sub-divisional engineer said that those will ensure a smooth visarjan in the next nine days. “If these efforts continue, there will be no damage to the environment. Authorities here are not only concerned about Covid-19 but also are spreading awareness regarding dengue, which is the need of the hour,” he said. Pankaj Rai, an advertising professional, observed that this year there are barricades to prevent immersion of idols in the lakes. He also appreciated the volunteers who are doing a “great job by preventing the people from immersing idols in the lake”. Smita Gondse, a teacher, was impressed with cleanliness and hygiene maintained by the authorities and volunteers at Futala lake. “People are not dumping garbage and are making proper use of the bins placed at various spots,” she said. Businessman Sohan Yadav said, “I feel everything is going well as people are following rules and are not throwing garbage. The team looking after nirmalya collection at Futala lake was very friendly and helpful.” (With inputs from Dhriti Khatri and Hatim Hussain)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-impressed-with-steps-taken-for-eco-friendly-immersion/articleshow/86125753.cms||Anchal Bhatia

The statue was set up in 1982 after the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, M G Ramachandran, had requested Jyoti Basu for a memorial in the poet’s honour. At that time, Lake Road was also renamed as Kavi Bharati Sarani. Those who had gathered on Saturday morning to celebrate the centenary celebrations organised by the Bharathi Tamil Sangam, the 80-year-old Tamil literary society here, not only remembered the poet through his works but also spoke about his contributions to the freedom struggle and his special association with Bengal through Rishi Aurobindo and Sister Nivedita. “To avoid being arrested by the British, he took refuge in Pondicherry where he became close to Rishi Aurobindo. He was highly influenced by Sister Nivedita too,” remembered SS Kumar, spokesperson of the Sangam. Bharati’s contribution is all the more remarkable because he died when he was just 39. Saturday’s programme started with the singing of Tamil Tai Vazhthu by the secretary of the Sangam Chutra Sivaramakrishnan. Interesting anecdotes were shared like why the poet wore a turban and kept a thick moustache despite being a Tamil Brahmin. “He had great respect for Sikhs and so he did this,” said TK Radhakrishnan, who attended the programme. A sequel to the morning’s programme was held at Brahmapur, which is now a Tamil hub, with many Tamils having migrated to that part of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tamils-remember-poet-on-birth-centenary/articleshow/86125757.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Registrations had taken a beating last fiscal due to the Covid-19 induced disruption. As many as 743 real estate projects — residential, commercial, mixed development and plotted schemes — have been registered with the Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority (GujRERA) in 2021-22 as of September 9. This translates to 55% of last fiscal’s total 1,345 project registrations, and that too in just the first five months of the current fiscal. The total investment in these projects is estimated to be Rs 19,639 crore, which is about 60% of the total investment proposed through the registered projects last fiscal, shows data available with the state real estate regulatory authority. "Increased number of real estate projects have been registered with the state regulatory authority, especially in the past three months. This is because the demand for residential real estate has picked up pace, with people upgrading to bigger dwellings. The unsold inventory has also come down to its lowest levels in the wake of fewer launches over the past two years due to several factors, including the pandemic," said Tejas Joshi, president, CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, city chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI). While the commercial segment remains muted, the residential segment has seen a strong demand across affordable, premium, luxury and plotting categories. This could be seen from the fact that 310 (42%) of the total projects registered are purely residential, while 275 (37%) are mixed-use projects. It may be mentioned that realty project registrations had declined by 23% to 1,345 in 2020-21 from 1,745 projects in 2019-20 due to the pandemic-induced slowdown. Pressure rises on margins as production costs escalate Real estate developers have seen their production cost escalating 10-12% with the rise in prices of cement, steel, sanitaryware, bricks and other construction materials. The increase in diesel prices has further raised the material transportation costs. Although real estate prices have gone up, developers have not been able to fully pass on the higher production cost to the consumers. "When many projects are hitting the market, developers cannot raise their prices," said a city-based realtor. As a result, realtors’ margins are getting squeezed. However, developers feel there can be a price hike. Steps such as a reduction in stamp duty and floor space index (FSI) fees can provide relief to both developers and consumers, said industry players. New launches to gain momentum With buoyant demand, along with the unsold inventory dwindling to its lowest level, realtors see more housing schemes coming to the market during the upcoming festive season. "Ongoing projects which are slated to be completed in the next one or two years have seen bookings up to 60-70%. With demand going up, several new projects are going to be launched during the festive season of Navratri, Dussehra and Diwali this year," added Joshi, who himself plans to launch two projects in the premium and luxury segment in the coming months. According to real estate consultant Knight Frank India, the unsold inventory (housing) in Ahmedabad stood at 12,151 units in January-June 2021 as against 40,035 units in January-June 2016. The projects which were registered last year, but could not be launched are also being rolled out now, say market players. "Given the improved sentiment and positivity in the market, developers also think that it is a time to roll out projects according to the customers’ current needs," Joshi said. Sales up 30-35% Traditionally, residential property bookings remain negligible from April to August. "This year, however, developers are witnessing an increase in site visits and bookings even in this lull period," said Dipak Patel, a city-based real estate developer. "Riding on the resurgent demand, sales and bookings have gone up by at least 30-35% compared to last September. Sales have bounced back to the levels seen before the outbreak of the pandemic," added Ashish Patel, president, CREDAI-Gujarat. The uptick in sales could be seen from the fact that the state’s revenue from stamp duty and property registrations jumped 148% at Rs 3,061 crore during April-July 2021. The revenue had stood at Rs 1,234 crore in the same period last year. In July alone, this revenue surged by 65% to Rs 968 crore. Realty consultant Knight Frank India’s latest report shows that 1,163 residential units were sold in Ahmedabad during April-June 2021, a growth of 362% over the same period last year. However, the sales were down when compared with the preceding quarter of January-March due to the second wave of the pandemic affecting sales on a quarter-on-quarter basis. NRI investments flowing in: NRGs from the US, the UK and Canada are buying housing properties in their hometowns in the state. Till now, commercial and plotting schemes used to grab a larger share of the NRI investments. Now, they are also purchasing housing apartments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/realty-registrations-spike-as-hope-lights-up-residential-projects/articleshow/86130184.cms||Kalpesh Damor
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rain spanner in civic road repair drive ahead of Pujas||KOLKATA: The civic body will give priority to broken stretches that lead to major Puja pandals when it takes up repair of the city’s battered roads. According to a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) roads department official, the civic body was ready with its borough-wise road repair teams but has been struggling to initiate the drive due to consistent rain. “We are upset with the rain throwing a spanner in our road repair drive,” said an official. KMC board of administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim, said, “We are ready to take up a repair drive of all major roads to give the commuters relief from bumpy rides during the Pujas. But the rain is playing spoilsport. We need a dry spell of at least eight days to take up the repair drive across the city.” “We will give priority to the major roads which have developed craters. Several such roads are considered very important due to their proximity to big Puja pandals and we will take up the repair of these roads first,” an official said. After conducting a preliminary survey, the Kolkata Police had handed over a list of 350 roads to the KMC for urgent repairs. A KMC civil engineering department official said the civic road repair teams were set to wrap up the repair drive across the city by October 2. “If it does not rain further, we can wrap up the patchwork before Mahalaya,” the official said. Organising committees of some of the pujas that have requested the police and the civic body to take care of the roads near their pandals include Haridevpur 41 Pally, Mudiali, Kasba Tarun Dal, several pujas in the Maniktala-Kankurgachhi belt, College Square, Md Ali Park, Sealdah, Park Circus Sarbojanin, several pujas in the Bhowanipore area, Hazra Road, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road and Raja Subodh Mullick Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-spanner-in-civic-road-repair-drive-ahead-of-pujas/articleshow/86125763.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Delhi||Delhi govt set to exit retail liquor business in November||NEW DELHI: Under the new excise policy of Delhi government, the new licences for retail sale of liquor by private vendors will come into operation from November 17. It will mark the exit of the government from the retail liquor business. “In order to ensure smooth transition from the old excise licences to the new licences for the year 2021-22 and to ensure the supply of bona fide liquor to the residents of Delhi, it has been decided that all wholesale licences will continue to operate beyond September 30, 2021 till November 16, 2021 i.e one day prior to the scheduled date of commencement of business for new licences (under new excise policy),” an order issued by the excise department stated. It added that all government liquor vends for retail sale of liquor will also continue to operate during the same period. “The government of NCT of Delhi has approved the new Excise Policy 2021-22, which is being implemented with new retail licences scheduled to start from November 17,” the order stated. The government has also extended the date of licence of hotels, clubs and restaurants serving liquor on the premises. “All HCR licences for service of liquor ‘on’ the premises will continue to operate beyond September 30, 2021 till November 16, 2021,” the order stated. The new excise policy seeks to transform the liquor trade in the capital and give higher revenue to the government. Delhi will get modern and bigger liquor vends, which will also offer the facility to walk in to explore and select the preferred brands of alcohol, when the new retail licence holders start running the trade. Currently, Delhi government agencies run around 60% of the total 850 retail liquor shops in the capital and they do not offer great liquor buying experience. The government liquor vends generate less revenue than the private vends. Under the new excise policy, Delhi has been divided into 32 retail zones and 20 retail zones have already been auctioned. Last month, the government collected Rs 5,300 crore from the initial rounds of draw of lots held for allocation of 20 zonal retail zones, while the auction of the remaining 12 zones is in the process. The financial bids for the 12 zones are expected to open next week, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-set-to-exit-retail-liquor-business-in-november/articleshow/86125808.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Lucknow||84% sugarcane dues of Uttar Pradesh farmers cleared||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh government claimed on Saturday that it has cleared over 84% dues of nearly 45 lakh sugarcane farmers of the state, making it the highest and fastest payment in a season in the past 50 years. The total amount given to the cane farmers in the past four years is approximately Rs 1,42,650 crore, a cane development department release said, adding that the earning to the farmers is at least Rs 3,200 per quintal. “As many as 120 sugar mills were functional in the 2020-2021 crop season. They have procured 1,028 lakh tons of sugarcane worth Rs 33,025 crore. Against the target, dues to the tune of Rs 27,465 crore have been cleared. Also, 53 mills have cleared 100% dues,” an official said. The cane crushing season this time started in October 2020 and continued till July 2021. Additional chief secretary, cane development, Sanjay Bhoosreddy said: “This is the highest and fastest payment made by any government in the past 50 years. “What adds to the achievement is that the record payment has been made despite the decline in the institutional procurement of sugar - the main by-product generated from the sugar mills. And, the process for the disbursement of the remaining Rs 5,560 crore is underway and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued instructions to clear the dues at the earliest,” Bhoosreddy added. ACS Bhoosreddy attributed the achievement to a host of measures undertaken by the department, including tagging cane products other than sugar — molasses, bagasse and press mud. Besides, ethanol produced from B-heavy molasses or sugarcane juice and that used for sanitizer production were also tagged for payment of cane price. In fact, cane price payment got accelerated due to an increase in ethanol production and sale. After coming to power in 2017, the BJP government created an escrow account, which was operated jointly by the mill representative and district cane officer/senior cane development inspector. As per rules, 85% money received in the account was kept for farmer payment. This resulted in arresting diversion of money for purposes other than cane payment. As on August 31,the total stocks of sugar with the mills was approximately 47 lakh tonnes with an estimated value of Rs 14,982 crore. Even the mills which have pending dues have sugar stock worth Rs 6,297 crore. "So, the payment of the remaining outstanding of Rs 5,560 crore shouldn't be difficult, but it will depend on the clearance of the stock," said a cane department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/84-cane-dues-of-up-farmers-cleared/articleshow/86129790.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||India||Days after SC rap, govt okays NCLT & ITAT appointments||NEW DELHI: The government on Saturday approved the appointment of 18 members in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and another 13 were appointed as members of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), filling up vacancies in two important tribunals after a wait of several months. The appointments come just days after an Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, pulled up the Centre for delaying the filling of vacancies in Tribunals. It had even warned of contempt proceedings if the appointments were not done in a week. Keen to avoid further confrontation, the government appointed eight judicial members and 10 technical members in the NCLT for five years or till the age of 65 years. In addition, it has also approved the appointment of four judicial members in the ITAT, besides two in SC and OBC categories and seven accountant members. The eight judicial members appointed in the NCLT are retired high court judges, including Justices Telaprolu Rajani of Andhra Pradesh HC, Pradeep Deshmukh of Bombay HC, S Ramathilagam of Madras HC, Harnam Singh, presiding officer of DRT, Delhi and Harnam Singh Thakur, retired registrar of Punjab & Haryana HC. With over half the 62 sanctioned strength in NCLT lying vacant, cases have begun piling up in the tribunal that deals with matters related to bankruptcy, Companies Act and Competition Law. According to latest data, it is now taking almost 600 days to clear insolvency cases from the time of admission against the maximum permissible 270 days under the law. The four judicial members appointed to the ITAT include advocates Sonjoy Sarma, S Seethalakshmi; and additional district & session judges Shatin Goyal and Anubhav Sharma. T R Senthil Kumar, advocate, has been appointed as judicial member in the OBC category, while Manmohan Das, law officer, has been appointed in the SC category in the ITAT. In the unreserved category, five chartered accountants have been appointed as accountants members in the ITAT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/days-after-sc-rap-govt-okays-nclt-itat-appointments/articleshow/86131604.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Highest in India, Uttar Pradesh’s vaccination rate ahead of US, Russia: Ministry of health and family welfare||LUCKNOW: With the administration of over two crore vaccine doses in just 20 days, Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the fastest state in India to carry out Covid-19 vaccination. What adds to the achievement is that the daily rate of vaccination in UP is more than that of the United States of America and Russia. The assessment for September month, conducted by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, noted that UP administered an average of 11.73 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses per day. This is way more than other states in the top five namely – Maharashtra (7.6 lakh jabs per day), Gujarat (4.80 lakh), Madhya Pradesh (3.71 lakh) and Rajasthan (4.5 lakh) as calculated on the basis of data from the Cowin Portal. The health ministry’s comparison also showed that the daily rate of vaccination in UP is more than that of the United States of America where an average of 8.09 lakh doses are being administered daily. It is also ahead of countries like Mexico (5.56 lakh jabs per day), Russia (3.68 lakh), France (2.48 lakh) and Canada (0.85 lakh) were also way behind UP in daily vaccinations. Secretary to the CM, Alok Kumar-III, said Covid-19 vaccination was the top priority of the Yogi Adityanath government as it was the best line of defence against the pandemic. “The CM is monitoring the situation twice daily and has urged the people to come forward and get vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. Lauding the achievement, health department officials credited the hard work put in by field staff and cluster approach for improvement. UP administered over 33.42 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses on September 6, the highest ever vaccination achieved in a single day by any state since the start of Covid-19 vaccination drive. “The recent assessment undertaken by the Union health ministry, department of health research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed that the vaccine’s efficacy in prevention of mortality with one dose was over 96%, while with both the doses it was 97.5%. It also concluded that vaccines help in preventing Covid-19 mortality in all age groups,” Kumar said. Experts, however, are of the view that while comparison with other countries could give motivation, it was not fair to do so as the target before UP is way bigger than all of them. Also, the scales swing against UP when one gets to know that over 64% of the eligible population in the USA has taken at least one dose while 52% are fully vaccinated. Contrary to this, the CoWin portal (updated till 6 pm on September 11) indicated that 8.67 crore doses have been administered in UP. In terms of population, 7.21 crore people have taken at least one dose whereas 1.45 crore are fully vaccinated. This speaks for an achievement of over 47% and 9.5% when seen against the target of 15.25 crore. Meanwhile, the sustained decline in the number of daily cases and surge in recoveries took the state's active cases to 184. Just 14 new cases and 19 recoveries were recorded across the state in the last 24 hours. Active cases are spread in 41 districts only while the new cases were reported from 10 districts. Also, as many as 34 districts of the state have become free from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/highest-in-india-ups-vax-rate-ahead-of-us-russia-mohfw/articleshow/86129801.cms||Shailvee Sharda

An official from the state irrigation department said, “We have started the release of water in the Mutha canal. The Khadakwasla dam will discharge more water if the inflow of water increases. We have alerted the civic administration and towns located along the river about the water release.” The collective reserve in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle increased to 97.9% (28.53 TMC) on Saturday evening. Temghar’s catchment areas recorded 27mm rainfall till Saturday evening, while that of Panshet and Varasgaon received 13mm rainfall each. The stock in Panshet and Temghar increased to 98% and 97%, respectively. Rainfall continued in the catchment areas of all the four dams catering to Pune, increasing the water release from Varasgaon to 4,400 cusecs. “There is no space to accommodate water in the Varasgaon dam because its stock has reached 100%. Water levels in Panshet and Temghar may increase to their maximum level if heavy spells of rain continue in the catchments for a day or two,” another irrigation department official said. Apart from the reservoirs near Pune, four reservoirs in the Bhima basin discharged water after their storage reached to their maximum capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/khadakwasla-stock-at-84-discharge-into-canal-starts/articleshow/86127883.cms||Sarang Dastane

According to the data available with the health and family welfare department, the state average is 69.55%, while Belagavi has recorded 70.07% till Wednesday. So far total of 25,32,394 people have been jabbed and the target is 36,14,324. However the district is lagging behind in administering second dose, registering just 16.5% compared to the state average of 23.81%. The health department has so far given the second dose to 5,96,375 people. Hukkeri taluk has recorded the highest average, reaching 80% of the target, while Savadatti taluk is at the bottom completing merely half of the target. Officials say that in the last 15 days, the district has received over 11 lakh doses and this helped expedite vaccination drives in every village. Officials also say that reaching 100% target may take some time as they are seeing lack of enthusiasm among the masses who are yet to be jabbed. Khanapur taluk is at the top in achieving second dose target, recording an average of 22% and it has provided the first dose to 75% of the eligible population. Raibag’ second dose coverage is the lowest with registering just 9.7% . This taluk is also one of the poor performers in administering the first dose registering 62% of the total target. Immunisation officer I P Gadad said: “We covered the maximum number of people in the last 15 days as we received over 11 lakh doses. But, when the supply was slow, more people were showing enthusiasm. Now, when the supply is high, less number of people are voluntarily coming up to take the vaccine. We are planning more drives to give them a push.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/70-of-eligible-population-in-belagavi-administered-first-dose/articleshow/86123838.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ganesh immersion dress rehearsal for Durga Puja||KOLKATA: Several Durga Puja organizers, cops and KMC officials are tracking Ganesh Puja preparations and safety guidelines adopted by committees, and the immersion plans since they feel they will come handy just a month later. Though there has been a surge in Ganesh Pujas in the city and suburbs this year, the scale is nowhere close to Durga Puja, which calls for mobilisation of the police force and elaborate arrangements for immersions by KMC. TimesviewGanesh Puja would have given organisers of Durga Puja and other bigger festivals a sort of template to work on. Organisers and revellers should be as much responsible as government agencies when it comes to having Covid-season festivities.According to a rough estimate, there were close to 1,200 Ganesh Pujas in Kolkata this year, a big chunk of which was in complexes. “Residents of our neighbouring block organized Ganesh Puja and held meetings with cops and civic authorities, who provided a list of dos and don’ts. We celebrated on Friday but also observed the guidelines so that we can plan for the Durga Puja in our block,” said Debi Prasad Ghosh, secretary of AC Block in New Town. “Visiting Ganesh Pujas helped us understand the loopholes we will need to plug for Durga Puja,” said Bapi Haldar, president of a Durga Puja committee in north Kolkata. Cops and KMC officials are also treating the Ganesh immersion, most planned for Sunday, as the dress rehearsal for the main event next month. “The deployment, routes for immersion and rules for Ganesh immersion will come handy during Durga Puja immersions,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ganesh-immersion-dress-rehearsal-for-durga-puja/articleshow/86125881.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||E-registration of properties to commence from Oct 2: Balasaheb Thorat||PUNE: State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Saturday that e-registration for developers for first sale of properties will commence from October 2. “The registration department is ready with the software and the process will be officially rolled out from October 2. This will be for Rera-registered builders who will be given the software by the department after due checks. This will enable them to register the documents from their offices. Citizens will benefit from this initiative,” he told TOI. Though the minister had earlier said that e-registration would be made mandatory for all such developers, Thorat said that citizens would be allowed to register properties at sub-registrar offices as well. Ahead of ushering in e-registration for all new housing projects listed under the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) from October 1, the state registration department is all set to test the software next week, said Shravan Hardikar, inspector general of registration and stamps.Currently, 50-60 developers are already carrying out e-registration in the state. So far, 350 plus projects and 2,700 documents have been registered through e-registration. “The software being readied will enable a builder to ready the template for a project within a day’s time. The process used to take more time earlier,” said Hardikar. He said He said that an orientation programme would be held for developers in the last week of September. The department is also mulling the application process. A developer will have to first reach out to the joint district registrar for accessing the software. With this process expected to see more e-registrations, the department will also ensure more staff to speed up e-registration of documents. State CREDAI president Sunil Furde said that e-registration would be a game changer for Rera-registered developers and customers. “This will bring transparency and clarity in the registration process,” he said. Customers planning to register properties next month said that the process would rule out middlemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-registration-of-properties-to-commence-from-oct-2-thorat/articleshow/86127914.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Pests affect paddy farming across 250 hectares in district||PUNE: Pest attaacks have affected different varieties of paddy, including the popular Indrayani, cultivated across 250-hectare area in the hilly region of seven tehsils, including Maval and Mulshi, in the district. “We have so far recorded white grub attack on 250 hectare of the total 61,000 hectare of the paddy cultivation in seven tehsils. This usually occurs when there is a lack of rainfall. The white grubs grow under the soil and eats the roots of the crop,” district agriculture officer Dnyaneshwar Bote told TOI. The white grubs survive by chewing the roots of the growing crop. The most risky aspect about the grub is that the effects of its underground impact are invisible until the crops start wilting. “We have taken grub management measures on the affected farms through the tehsil agriculture office. We have also conducted awareness workshops for the paddy farmers,” Bote said. The white grubs usually grow about one inch long. Their soft, bulky, grey-white bodies have brown heads and six distinct legs. “It does not grow in water saturated condition. Usually, the paddy beds accumulate water in large quantity in the monsoon season. So the grubs die naturally before they grow under the soil. But this year, the rainfall is less and hence the crop has been affected badly,” Bote said. “The growth of paddy is not impressive this year mainly due to less rainfall. The planting was also done late at many places in the district. The long break in rainfall in August and the first few days of September have had adverse impact on the crop. The extent will be known in October and November,” said a senior agriculture official. Ashok Pathare, a Maval resident who has farms near Pavana dam, said, “We have been getting good harvest for the last few years. We also fetch good price for Indrayani variety as there is a good demand for it in eateries, restaurants and hotels. However, this year, we won’t be able to get good harvest because of the pest attack.” Similar reactions have come from paddy farmers in Bhor, Velhe, Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils. “Staffers from the tehsil agriculture office should visit farms and inspect the condition of the crops. Many farmers often fail to understand the gravity of the problem and cannot take early measures,” said Digambar Bhlachim, a resident of Malin village in Ambegaon tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pests-affect-paddy-farming-across-250-hectares-in-dist/articleshow/86127906.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Moderate rain forecast for Pune||PUNE: The city received light showers on Saturday with Shivajinagar and Lohegaon recording 5.7mm and 10.6mm rainfall, respectively, from 8.30am to 8.30pm. India Meteorological Department has forecast light to moderate rain on Sunday and Monday in the city. Isolated heavy to very heavy rain is expected in ghat areas of the district during the next two days. The rain in Pune and other parts of Maharashtra during the next few days would be the fallout of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, its west-northwestward movement and its further intensification. Lower-level westerlies were also very likely to strengthen along the west coast during the next five days, IMD said. The low-pressure area lies over the central and the adjoining north Bay of Bengal with associated cyclonic circulation up to the middle tropospheric levels. It is likely to move north-westwards and concentrate into a depression over the northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha-West Bengal coasts in a couple of days. The depression was likely to move towards west, north-west, across north Odisha and north Chhattisgarh during the subsequent two-three days, IMD said. The department forecast fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha during the next four days. Isolated extremely heavy rainfall is expected over Madhya Maharashtra on September 13 and in Konkan-Goa during the September 13-14 period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/moderate-rain-forecast-for-city/articleshow/86127897.cms||---
---||Pune||Over 3,200 mandals celebrating this year||PUNE: As many as 3,282 public trusts and mandals have installed idols of Ganesh in the city, as against 2,949 last year. Last year, many mandals did not celebrate the festival in view of the pandemic and related restrictions. This year, however, most of the registered mandals took permission to celebrate the festival publicly, said the police. “This year, more Ganapati mandals approached the police with applications seeking permission to install idols in their pandals or temples. We have given them permission,” said deputy commissioner of police (Special Branch) Mitesh Ghatte. Officials of the Pune Police’s Special Branch said that as many as 3,282 mandals took permission to celebrate the 10-day Ganeshotsav publicly this year. According to the police, the number of mandals has increased this year due to the merger to Loni Kand and Loni Kalbhor under the jurisdiction of the Pune city police. Also, many mandals which did not celebrate the festival last year are doing so this year. “Mandals have been told to follow all the guidelines of the state government and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) pertaining to Covid-19. At the same time, people should also strictly abide by all the norms and regulations,” said Ghatte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-3200-mandals-celebrating-this-year/articleshow/86127930.cms||---
---||Pune||As ghats stay off-limits, devotees immerse idols in municipal tanks||PUNE: Deepak Soman, a resident of Karvenagar, rued that during the Ganapati immersion on Saturday he and his family did not get the chance to conduct the rituals or even see their Ganesh idol for the last time because of the strict, pandemic-related restrictions. “The civic body had placed the temporary immersion tank in a truck. We were not allowed to conduct the aarti before the visarjan, or even see the idol for the final time before the immersion,” he lamented, speaking about the visarjan, which was arranged by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) at Karvenagar. The first immersion day of the Ganeshotsav is traditionally conducted by some households and families one-and-a-half days after the beginning of the festivities. The immersions this year were subdued as compared to the ones that were conducted before the global pandemic hit, especially for the ones who would conduct the rituals outside their homes at locations including along the river banks. The prominent ghats along the city’s rivers were not an option for immersions for citizens this year, even in the immersion tanks at these locations, as the authorities had made the riverfront out of bounds to avoid crowding. Instead, people opted for the immersion tanks that were placed at prominent places by the Pune Municipal Corporation under each of the ward offices, including in the areas that were recently merged into the civic body’s jurisdiction. On Saturday, a lot of devotees also chose the more hassle-free home immersion, using tanks or buckets, and ammonium bicarbonate, which they procured themselves, or was distributed by local ward offices. The ones who had used eco-friendly clay idols had it easier. They immersed their Ganesh idols in water and some even planned to reuse the clay to plant saplings and seeds. “The idol seller I bought our Ganesha from also gave us a sapling, as well as instructions on how to plant it. The clay from the immersed idol has to be mixed with soil and manure and then the sapling can be planted. This is the first year that I got an eco-friendly Ganesha home. I plan to continue this in the future as well as it is environmentally-friendly,” said Rajendra Chauhan, a resident of Wadgaonsheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-ghats-stay-off-limits-devotees-immerse-idols-in-municipal-tanks/articleshow/86127931.cms||---
---||Kolkata||City police meet||Kolkata: Outreach programmes by Kolkata Police - an attempt to meet residents and warn them of modern crime trends, especially during the pandemic and the various means they can use to reach out to the police to lodge their complaints - will figure high in the police to do list in the run up to the festive season. At a high level meeting attended by the brass this week - and which culminated with some immediate action on Saturday - has led cops to decide to hold a Facebook Live session with the citizens of Kolkata to make them aware of the various cyber crimes and threats. Similarly, the Kolkata traffic police came out with the online complaint form to lodge traffic issues and complaints directly with Lalbazar. Both the announcements were announced on their Facebook pages on Saturday. According to sources, the outreach programme that last week saw police put up hoardings at important crossings against cyber menace, will now see sleuths from cyber cell and the anti-bank fraud section address the netizens on the safety measures. "Officers of the Cyber Crime and Anti Bank Fraud sections of Kolkata Police will interact with you live from our Facebook page on Monday, September 13 at 5.00 pm, during a session on cyber crime and bank fraud, and how to take preventive measures against them. Stay tuned, and do share this post as much as possible so that more people can avail this opportunity to know more about a rising menace," the cops stated. The Kolkata Traffic police page also put out the complaint slip stating: "'As per requests received from various quarters, Kolkata Police Traffic Department hereby shares the link to Traffic complaint card which can be used by all complainants to submit their grievances on traffic related matters for speedy enquiry and disposal." Almost immediately after putting this up, cops were inundated with complaints about auto fare and bus fare overpricing, illegal parking and taxi harassment, said sources. Police are also asking bank officers of private banks to join them to create cyber fraud awareness among residents. In attendance will be area residents - traders, senior citizens and students - considered the most prone to cyber crime attacks. The residents will also be told of non-banking frauds and methods to keep safe while ordering online or in a Work From Home experience. Across the city, NGOs working on women and child rights and anti-trafficking and cops are also meeting residents to speak on crime against women and trafficking and the danger signs that need to be read so as not to fall prey to the lure of fake job gangs. Cops said the idea was to involve players outside the police to drive the importance of staying safe. These interactions are also harping on the need to stop child marriages that have seen a sudden rise even within the city ever since the pandemic broke out last year. BOX: The do's and don'ts to stop cyber crimes: First, no one should rely on customer care numbers from any search engine. They should instead visit the official websites or contact banks directly. Two, do not click on links received through SMS from unknown numbers or emails. Three, do not receive VoIP calls or video calls from unknown numbers and social media like Whatsapp. Four, avoid financial transactions on websites. Five, always opt for payment on delivery from any new or verified website. Six, be aware of calls related to SIM card or ATM blocks or KYC updates. Almost in all cases, these are fakes. Seven, be very alert on the use of crypto currency and bitcoins. Eight, never share your personal OTP with anyone Nine, do not fall for advertisements that are difficult to be true - offers that do not match those available in the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-police-meet/articleshow/86125888.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Covid growth rate in hotspot Byculla is double that of Mumbai||MUMBAI: Due to a sudden rise in infection among healthcare workers, E ward (Byculla) has emerged as a Covid hotspot with the highest weekly growth rate and the lowest doubling rate in the city, according to BMC data. To combat the rising cases, the BMC has tweaked its testing strategy to voluntarily test all residents of sealed buildings within a five-day period. In E ward, the weekly growth in Covid cases has climbed to 0.12%, double the overall rate in the city. "More than 30 healthcare workers attached to a number of hospitals in E ward have got Covid despite being vaccinated," said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. All are asymptomatic and were diagnosed only during routine testing in the respective hospitals, said E ward officer Manish Walanju. Although a few of them were hospitalized due to comorbidities or age, it was only as a precautionary measure and they have mild to moderate infection. In real numbers, 72 cases have been diagnosed in E ward between September 3 and 11. The city has registered a rise in Covid cases in the four weeks since travel and entertainment restrictions were eased. While the daily tally on August 17 was 196, it climbed to 532 on September 8. On Saturday, it dropped to 361 mainly due to the festival season. The other wards that have registered a rise in infection rate include F North (Matunga), H West (Bandra), M Ward (Chembur) and S (Bhandup). The doubling rate in these five wards range from 745 days to 907 days as against the city average of 1,185. At the other end, P North ward, comprising Malad, has the lowest growth rate of 0.03% and a doubling rate of 2,017 days. BMC officials said the rise at present is marginal and cases are too mild to need hospitalization. A doctor from H West ward said that most beds, be they ICU or oxygen-supported ones, are vacant in private hospitals. At present, the BMC has aggressively implemented the 'testing, tracing and treatment' policy. “We have asked for high-risk contacts to be tested on the first day of diagnosis (of the index patient) and test everyone living in a sealed building within five days,” said Kakani, adding that the period after the Ganpati festival will be crucial for the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-growth-rate-in-hotspot-byculla-is-double-that-of-city/articleshow/86128016.cms||---
---||Dehradun||2 priests from each Char Dham to be part of govt committee to review contentious Devasthanam board||Dehradun: A delegation of priests from the Char Dham shrines met CM Pushkar Singh Dhami on Saturday and discussed with him their grievances related to the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. The priests have been agitating against the board ever since it was constituted during the tenure of former CM Trivendra Rawat. After taking over as CM, Dhami had constituted a high-power committee to look into the matter. Post the meeting with the priests, the CM announced that it has been decided that two priests from each dham would be included in the committee which will look at finding a solution to the issue. The priests meanwhile said that they are “giving one more opportunity to the government” and that they have decided to postpone their protests till October 30. “We had a positive meeting and we told the priests that a committee headed by Manohar Lal Dhyani has been formed to listen to their issues. If there is any communication gap, we will sort it out. On the basis of the findings of the committee, a decision will be taken on the Devasthanam Board,” Dhami said. Suresh Semwal, chairman of the Gangotri Temple Samiti and convenor of the Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said that the CM has assured “time-bound action in the matter.” “Taking his assurance into consideration, we have announced to postpone all our protests till the end of next month.” The priests said that they were giving “one more opportunity to the state government” so that it resolves the issue. Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of the mahapanchayat, told TOI, "The CM has assured to withdraw the cases registered against the priests, who had staged a protest outside the assembly building on December 10, 2019." The priests also raised the issue of contradictory statements made by cabinet ministers on the issue. "The CM told us that only his statement should be considered by us," said Sati. The priests of Char Dham shrines and the government have been at loggerheads on the issue since 2019 when the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act was passed in the state assembly and subsequently, the board also started functioning. In his brief tenure as CM, Tirath Singh Rawat had announced to remove 51 smaller temples, which were included under the ambit of the Act, and had also said that the decision on the board would be reviewed. Later, when Dhami took over as CM, he announced in July this year the review of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. On August 15, the high-powered committee was constituted to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/2-priests-from-each-char-dham-to-be-part-of-govt-committee-to-review-contentious-devasthanam-board/articleshow/86124262.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||Pune Cantonment Board to seal shops without trade permits from September 15||PUNE: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) will seal shops without trade permits from September 15. There are 700 shops running without licences, officials said. “Licence is necessary for fire safety and hygienic conditions. We have decided to act against violators. Their shops will be sealed until further notice,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB. The board has issued a public notice in this regard. It has also sent notices to some of the shops in the last few weeks. However, the board did not receive any response from them, said the officials. “The charges for licence are in the range of Rs800 to Rs3,000. The traders will have to apply through our website and submit the necessary documents online,” said Kumar. An applicant will have to submit a fire safety and hygiene certificates while applying for licence. Many prominent eateries and restaurants do not have these certificates, but they are still offering dine-in facilities, said board sources. “We have already sent notices to some of the violators. They haven’t responded to our notices yet,” said Kumar. The board could not initiate action against the violators earlier due to pandemic restrictions, said Kumar. “But this time, the board’s team would physically visit shops, eateries and restaurants to check licences,” he added. As per the Cantonment Act 2006, the board can also charge a fine of Rs 50,000 from a violator. A section of traders has said they do not know how to process an application online. “I have never applied for trade licence online. The board should also make available facilities for physical submission of documents,” said a shopkeeper. Traders, who got trade licences before 2006, do not have to apply, barring certain exceptions, states the Cantonment Act, 2006. “The board is authorised to serve notice if a particular shop or restaurant is in an unhygienic condition. PCB has already sent notices to them three months ago. If they do not maintain proper hygienic condition, we will seal the shops,” said a senior official from the PCB’s health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-to-seal-shops-without-trade-permits-from-sept-15/articleshow/86127981.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Navi-mumbai||Navi Mumbai Covid cases at 17-month low||NAVI MUMBAI: Despite a slight surge in the number of new Covid cases in the past few days, the number of active cases has dropped to 606 — the lowest in the last 17 months — resulting in an improvement to the overall recovery rate in the NMMC area. The number of recoveries is now more than the daily fresh cases. The recovery rate has improved to 97.61%, which is the highest so far in the city and better than the national recovery rate of 97.5%. As many as 224 infected people are being treated at the NMMC-run covid care centres and dedicated Covid health centres, whereas 274 cases are home quarantined. The remaining 103 patients are being treated at private Covid hospitals. Meanwhile, the NMMC has augmented its healthcare infrastructure in view of the possible third wave. On April 4, the city had witnessed 1,441 positive cases, the highest single day till date, which has dropped to below 80 now. During the peak of the second wave in April and May, the number of active cases went up to 11,605, the highest so far ever since the pandemic struck. NMMC continues to conduct 7,000 to 8,000 tests daily to avert the anticipated third wave. The dip in active cases has led to the closure of as many as 10 Covid care centres out of 15 that were in operation during the peak. The NMMC has kept the Cidco Exhibition Centre care facility open for fresh admissions while closing entry into four centres where patients are recuperating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-cases-at-17-month-low/articleshow/86128072.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: ‘Third wave knocking at the door, but may not be severe’||BHOPAL: The number of active Covid-19 patients in Madhya Pradesh has increased by more than 38% in the 11 days of September, leading experts to warn that the third wave may be around the corner. However, it may not be as severe as the second one, they feel. There were 83 active patients in the state on September 1, which has now increased to 136. The numbers seem low, fueled mainly by a spurt in Jabalpur, but the trend is worrying. “Given the recent rise, it could be the beginning of the third wave. Unless there is 100% vaccination, there will always be the possibility of another wave,” AIIMS-Bhopal director Dr Sarman Singh told TOI. ‘Covid-appropriate behaviour way out’It may still happen, despite 100% vaccination, but even if a vaccinated patient gets infected, the symptoms will not be severe. Covid-appropriate behavior – wearing face masks and maintaining social distance – is the only way out,” Dr Sarman Singh told TOI. There has been one death this month, and four since August 1. On the positive side, 45 districts are not reporting new cases, and the recent cases are confined mostly to Jabalpur, Bhopal and Indore. Jabalpur is causing concern because it accounts for 56 (41%) of the state’s 136 active patients. On Saturday, it had half of MP’s 16 new cases. Asked why cases are being reported from a few pockets only, Singh said, “Even during the second wave, there were several villages and pockets that had remained out of the purview of Covid-19 infection. Thus, this spurt could definitely be considered the start of the third wave”. “But we can say that this time, the infection will probably not be as severe, unless a new version of the virus is there,” Dr Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/third-wave-knocking-at-the-door-but-may-not-be-severe/articleshow/86128064.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ACB busts bribery racket in skill development corporation, 2 held||JAIPUR: The ACB busted a corruption racket at Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) on Saturday and arrested two of its employees for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 5 lakh. The agency also seized the mobile phones of two IAS officers — RSLDC chairman Neeraj K Pawan and MD Pradeep K Gawande — to probe their role. The arrested duo was identified as RSLDC scheme coordinator Ashok Sangwan (left top pic) and Rahul Kumar Garg, an assistant lecturer who is on deputation as a manager of the corporation. They had sought the amount in lieu of clearing pending bills and the bank guarantee and for granting permission for continuing the training programme by the complainant. “The complainant, who was involved in a training programme, approached us saying the accused demanded Rs 5 lakh for clearing his bills worth Rs 1.5 crore and also for continuing permission to his firm for the training programme. Acting on this, the special unit-II verified the complaint and laid the trap,” said ACB DG BL Soni. RSLDC was incorporated as Section 25 Company, a Not for Profit company, in 2010 with chief secretary as its chairman. As part of its major action, it established skill training mechanism by involving training partner agencies to execute the training programmes across the state. “In the investigation so far, we have incriminating evidence against Gawande. We will probe his role in the racket. Our team has seized his mobile phone,” he added. Pawan’s direct role was yet to be established. “Our team intercepted him near Jodhpur and had seized his mobile phone,” Soni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-busts-bribery-racket-in-skill-devpt-corp-2-held/articleshow/86128050.cms||---
---||Delhi||Manic Saturday: Incessant rain in Delhi results in flooded roads, traffic nightmare||NEW DELHI: As is now resignedly expected by the capital’s denizens, the day-long showers caused 58 city roads to go under, the main consequence being massive traffic jams. A building collapsed in Begumpur, but there was no loss of lives. Reports of waterlogging came from RK Puram, Rajpath, Outer Ring Road, Moti Bagh, Dwarka, Aurobindo Marg, Tis Hazari Courts, Madhu Vihar and the underpasses at Rani Khera, Pul Prahladpur and the area near Indira Gandhi International Airport. The condition of Minto Bridge was, however, heartening with no accumulation of water there, according to traffic officials. Videos surfaced during the day of children ‘swimming’ in the collection of water on roads and public areas, such as opposite the Civic Centre, headquarters of the municipal corporations. In another video, a biker was seen struggling to extricate his two-wheeler from the deluge at Mundka Underpass in north Delhi. Abhishek Dutt, Congress member of South Delhi Municipal Corporation from Andrew Ganj, shared a video of Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. “This road, used by thousands, was inundated and shut down. Unfortunately, nothing seems to have been done to improve the drainage system here,” Dutt said. Muktesh Chander, special commissioner of police (Traffic), explained that waterlogging slowed down traffic considerably. “Several vehicles break down, two wheelers riders take shelter below bridges and at bus-stops, creating road constrictions, water collection reduces road width and at some spots, the water level is dangerously high,” he said. “We had traffic officers managing the traffic, though it is still difficult for them to perform their duties wearing raincoats.” There were traffic gridlocks throughout the city, particularly frustrating at Dhaula Kuan, Azadpur in north Delhi and Khajuri flyover in east Delhi. High water levels halted vehicular movement on several other major roads. Due to construction work and barricading at the underpass project at Pragati Maidan, traffic moved at snail’s pace. “Waterlogging cannot be avoided here because of the construction work, and the project team arranged for pumps immediately,” claimed a PWD official. Traffic had to be diverted from Mukarba and Azadpur chowks due to waterlogging to prevent access to a flooded GT Karnal Road. At Khajuri flyover, the traffic going to Brijpuri was crammed into a single lane. There was another traffic problem, when around 2pm, the residents of Kanjhawala blocked the road to protest the unending work of Delhi Jal Board that was impeding movement. The local police and the traffic cops reached the protest site and diverted the traffic, restoring it to normality around 4.20pm after getting the protesters to vacate the spot. The fire department rescued 59 people in different locations across the city. In Jain Nagar near Begumpur in northwest Delhi, the showers led to a building collapse. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation had, however, already vacated it on Friday and there were, therefore, no casualties. Besides this, the civic body also received some complaints about some portions of buildings falling in Paharganj and Jama Masjid areas. About the building that collapsed, area councillor Jayendar Dabas said, “It was a four-storey structure that we had fortunately vacated after finding it to be in a dangerous state. On Saturday morning, it finally came crumbling down. Thankfully, no casualty has been reported. This is an unauthorised but regularised colony where waterlogging is a constant problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-of-lakes/articleshow/86126971.cms||Vibha Sharma

If they do not have any professional degree or diploma, they will have to undergo skill training for three months at RSLDC (Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods and Development Corporation),” employment secretary Neeraj K Pawan said. Under the revamped scheme, the unemployment allowance will be increased from Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 for girls, specially abled persons and transgenders, and from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for boys. Also, 2 lakh beneficiaries will be eligible for the scheme every year, an increase from 1.60 lakh. Unemployment allowance to youth was part of the Congress election manifesto for 2018 assembly polls. The Mukhyamantri Yuva Sambal Yojana was launched on February 1, 2019. As part of the employment department’s campaign to physically verify 2% beneficiaries of the state government’s unemployment allowance scheme every month, it has been revealed that only two persons had received it despite getting a job. It also revealed that the allowance of 83 people was approved by the department despite they getting jobs in private and public sectors.

---||Delhi||Delhi: 7th heavy rain spell makes it wettest monsoon in 46 years||NEW DELHI: The city recorded the wettest monsoon in the past 46 years this year. Safdarjung weather station, which logs the official readings for the capital, has already recorded 1,139.8mm of rainfall for this season till 5.30pm on Saturday. The record seasonal precipitation is 1,155.6mm rainfall in 1975. Track the pollution level in your cityWith India Meteorological Department issuing an orange alert for moderate rain for Sunday, the 1975 record looks likely to be overtaken. The normal average precipitation from June till September otherwise measures 653.6mm. The all-time record is 1,420.3mm rainfall in 1933. Saturday’s was also the city’s highest rainfall on a September day in the past 77 years at 383.4mm rainfall till 5.30pm. The only time the city received more rainfall in a day in September was 417.3mm rainfall in 1944. The normal mark for the entire month of September is 125.1mm rainfall. In September 2020, Safdarjung had recorded only 20.9 mm rainfall. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said September this year has been “highly unusual.” He said, “In just 11 days, the rainfall is almost three times than the normal for the month. With 19 days still left, more records may be broken.” Despite the late arrival of the monsoon on July 13, the capital received 507.1mm rainfall in July, a surplus of 141%.

---||Jodhpur||Work for Rajasthan govt to claim unemployment allowance||JAIPUR: Mukhyamantri Yuva Sambal Yojana, the state repackaged unemployment allowance scheme which is pending approval at the chief minister’s office, mandates four-hour duty for five days a week in government offices, agencies or at anganwadis. “Once the scheme is launched, youths will have to work for at least four hours a day to be eligible for the allowance. If they do not have any professional degree or diploma, they will have to undergo skill training for three months at RSLDC (Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods and Development Corporation),” employment secretary Neeraj K Pawan said. Under the revamped scheme, the unemployment allowance will be increased from Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 for girls, specially abled persons and transgenders, and from Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for boys. Also, 2 lakh beneficiaries will be eligible for the scheme every year, an increase from 1.60 lakh. Unemployment allowance to youth was part of the Congress election manifesto for 2018 assembly polls. The Mukhyamantri Yuva Sambal Yojana was launched on February 1, 2019. As part of the employment department’s campaign to physically verify 2% beneficiaries of the state government’s unemployment allowance scheme every month, it has been revealed that only two persons had received it despite getting a job. It also revealed that the allowance of 83 people was approved by the department despite they getting jobs in private and public sectors. However, money was not transferred to their accounts, revealed the physical verification of beneficiaries. “Some beneficiaries got their names removed from the scheme after getting a job, while others did not. After verification of provident fund (PF) data and the department’s portal, it was found out that a couple of them got benefits under the scheme despite getting a job,” said an official. There are around 3 lakh pending applications of unemployment allowance with the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/work-for-raj-govt-to-claim-unemployment-allowance/articleshow/86136256.cms||---

As only 21% of the population has taken both the doses, Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran urged eligible people to make use of the mass vaccination drive planned today at 1,475 places across the district to provide 1.5 lakh doses. Chief executive officer of Tamil Nadu khadi and village industries board P Shankar, who has been appointed as the special officer for the mass vaccination drive, took stock of the arrangements on Saturday. “Special focus is on Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts, which are bordering Kerala, as cases are increasing in the neighbouring state. Rural areas are given preference, where 1,016 camps are set up for vaccination. As many as 151 camps will be conducted in municipal limits and 308 in the city limit,” the official said. “Every centre will have a vaccinator and a data entry operator. A total of 2,950 workers have been deployed for the purpose. This apart, two anganwadi workers will be employed in each centre to persuade people to get vaccinated. Those due for their second dose and who have not vaccinated so far will be receiving SMS to get vaccinated,” said Shankar. Special arrangements have been made at VOC Park, where two counters have been set up to inoculate people who want Covishield and another for Covaxin. A separate counter has been set up for those who want to get the second dose, besides a counter for senior citizens and disabled people. “Industries should encourage workers to get vaccinated on Sunday,” the collector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mass-covid-vaccination-drive-today-targets-1-5-lakh-jabs/articleshow/86128117.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Have nothing in my belly, I am walking on my back, Mother). This Konkani riddle (parkonnem) buzzing on social media groups is puzzling many as they delve deep into their mind for answers. Those still rooted in the oral traditions — fading over the last few decades due to changes in social and cultural changes — know the answer. ‘Panch zann voita, chear zann porot yeta. Kitem tem sang.’ (Five depart, and four come back. Guess the answer). This is yet another one posted by the Chicalim Bio-Crusaders, a group that is documenting the rich biodiversity of the fast-urbanising village as it seeks a heritage tag for the place on the basis of its natural and cultural assets. The riddles keep pouring on social media, piquing the interest of Konkani and Goan diaspora across the globe, especially the United Kingdom, Portugal and USA. “This shows parkonnim existed as an oral tradition in different strata of our society, especially among the working class and still continues, though it is slowly fading,” convenor, Chicalim Bio-crusaders Parkonnim, Cyril A Fernandes said. In the days of yore, the limited means of communication and entertainment gave rise to ideas to keep the folks busy. “Posing these riddles kept their brains ticking and helped with distribution of knowledge. We have the crossword now, but riddles kept Parkinson’s away or kept people busy,” Sahitya Akademi Award winning Konkani writer Dilip Borkar said. A lot of thought and intelligence was obviously involved in inventing these puzzles. “Riddles are the wisdom of people. It is a treasure of information about contemporary cultural life. It is a sum total of the people’s social, political, economical and religious life. They include social mores and manners,” Pandurang Phaldesai, a folk researcher said. The idea for the unique competition in the Konkani world took shape after Fernandes met a village elder Joaquim Inacio Gama while documenting Chicalim’s heritage. “He asked me if I knew any parkonnim, and kept reeling off a few. We posted three of them on our social media group,” Fernandes said. The members were enthralled by the riddles and a competition took shape. The thrill of answering the riddles and the interest it generated spilled onto various other social media groups. When George Varkey, son of IAS officer C G Varkey heard about it, he offered a silver rolling trophy and prize money of Rs 5,000 for a three-year, state-level competition. Varkey, who had studied in Goa, felt nostalgic after seeing the posts on parkonnim and offered the prize in his father’s memory. A batch of 50 riddles for the competition — now at half-way stage — is being posted during the second edition of the competition. After the final one next year, more riddles sent by enthusiasts will be added to the 150 taken up for the competition. “We have received many more from as far as Canacona to Vanxim, Divar and Quepem to Chicalim. This way, we will have a sizeable document of riddles that will be good for Goa’s history, culture and language,” Fernandes said. “Holding parkonnim competitions is a good idea to revive this folklore which has a poetic sense,” Borkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/reviving-goan-heritage-one-konkani-riddle-at-a-time/articleshow/86128128.cms||Paul Fernandes

The man was allegedly enraged that she did not tell him to whom she was speaking over the phone and stabbed her at their house in north Delhi’s Burari. DCP (North) Anto Alphonse said the accused was currently out on parole and was arrested near the Old Delhi railway station while trying to flee. Police received information from the Trauma Centre in Civil Lines regarding a woman being stabbed. “The woman’s brother said that her brother-in-law had stabbed her, and a case under Section 307 of IPC was registered.

Officials said the drop was due to a decline in testing during the festive season. Maharashtra reported 3,075 cases, lowest since February 9 (2,515), and 35 deaths, lowest in over six months. With this, total cases in the state rose to over 64.9 lakh and deaths to nearly 1.4 lakh. On Friday, only 1.3 lakh tests were conducted across the state as compared to the 1.5-1.7 lakh tests conducted daily on an average.   Mumbai reported 361 cases and four deaths, taking the total caseload 7.34 lakh and fatalities to 16,015. Mumbai’s daily detection dropped below 400 for the third time in September on Saturday. Coronavirus live updatesHowever, the number of active cases in the city shot up beyond 5,000 (5,089) after more than two months. Also, as the number of sealed buildings has almost doubled from the 25 reported two weeks back, the number of people in home quarantine has increased to 63,000 on Friday from 31,521 on August 22.   The BMC health machinery is, however, not in an overdrive. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the positivity rate in Mumbai is still around 1%, which is “reassuring”. While close to 50,000 tests were performed for three days in the run-up to the Ganpati festival, only 35,851 tests were done on Friday, which was a public holiday. Kakani said the BMC will be on alert till October 5, a fortnight after Ganpati visarjan. “We have to be careful when the people who left the city for Ganeshotsav return home. We have to catch any infection early in order to check its spread,” he added. State officials said that districts in western Maharashtra and Konkan region have been asked to be extra cautious as the festival is celebrated in a big way in these regions. “We have also directed district collectors to ensure that Covid tests are easily available in their jurisdictions and also be conducted in crowded areas like markets,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-logs-lowest-daily-detections-in-over-200-days-mum-cases-below-400/articleshow/86129917.cms||Bhavika Jain

Since early morning, long queues of vehicles were seen at Gandhi Chowk and on the road leading to Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. Tourists as well as locals were stuck in the jam for hours. Hoteliers though reported average room occupancy of 60% to 70% in the town. Incidentally, the district administration has been announcing that only 15000 tourists would be allowed entry to Mussoorie on weekends and the entry of two-wheelers would be banned but there was no checking at Kuthal Gate or anywhere else on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road to implement this order. On Saturday evening district magistrate, Dehradun and senior superintendent of police, Dehradun made a surprise visit to the town and took a walk on the Mall road to check whether wearing of masks was being ensured. Meanwhile, in Nainital, low tourist footfall was recorded which hoteliers attributed to the threat of landslides and road blocks which was keeping many people away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/weekend-rush-results-in-massive-traffic-jams-in-mussoorie-tourists-stay-away-from-nainital-fearing-landslides/articleshow/86124408.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Kolkata||On the prowl: Delivery agents in Kolkata offer service offline, dupe customers||KOLKATA: A group of unscrupulous delivery agents employed with point-to-point general products delivery platforms have been duping customers around the city promising them to deliver the products offline for the same amount as shown in the app citing poor payment system by the service provider. Once the customer agrees to the arrangement and makes a deal with the agent to pay only after proper delivery of the package, the agents on several occasions are switching off their phones and scooting away with the package. Multiple complaints regarding the same have been lodged in Bidhannagar and Kolkata where multiple persons have been arrested as well. “We have been urging app users to never go for such deals with unknown riders and hand them over their valuables. App-based delivery systems are a safer option only when the deal is made online and the company and the cops are in a position to track the whereabouts of the rider. Such deals should always be avoided,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police who has recently cracked a similar case. A New Town psychologist, Amrita Panda, had one such experience recently when she trusted a delivery agent last month. “I had booked a rider from a delivery app to deliver an expensive saree to my sister who stays in north Kolkata. The rider came to my house and told me that the company doesn’t pay them well and requested me to cancel the booking and tell him the address instead. He said he would deliver the product for the same amount of money charged by the app and would accept the payment only after the product is delivered. He said he was seeking the arrangement to make a better profit so that he doesn’t have to pay a share of the fee to the company,” said Panda. The woman agreed to the arrangement and handed him the package but the man went off the radar soon and switched off his phone as he didn’t deliver the package. “When he picked the call he abused me. I lodged a complaint with Eco Park PS. The cops nabbed the man and recovered the stolen package,” she said. A similar incident was reported at Jorabagan last month, when the rider had allegedly stolen a suitcase containing ornaments. The rider was supposed to deliver the suitcase to the complainant’s relative’s house at Belur but he fled with the package. The rider was later arrested from Dum Dum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-the-prowl-delivery-agents-offer-service-offline-dupe-customers/articleshow/86126084.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Goa||Yet another task force to PULL St Inez creek out of the gutter||PANAJI: Junking several reports for rejuvenation of the St Inez creek, and after squandering Central and international funds, the state government has now formed yet another task force to deliberate and revive the 9 km-long creek. Ignoring its own “detailed study” prepared in 2019, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Limited (IPSCDL) has constituted a task force for the creek’s rejuvenation under the project urban living lab (PULL). The 11-member task force, which is headed by the secretary of urban development, aims to implement the rejuvenation project through “urban flood management, urban water body management, urban mobility” and other strategies. Director for municipal administration Gurudas P Pilarnekar notified the constitution of the inter-departmental committee or task force, which will function as part of a pilot project of India’s first urban living lab. PULL was set up in the state capital with funding from the government of Denmark. It is functioning as per a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Royal Danish Embassy in India and IPSCDL, drawing on an earlier MoU on sustainable and smart urban development signed between Denmark and India in April 2018. In mid-2019, IPSCDL submitted a report to the state government indicating that overloading of the sewerage treatment plant (STP) at Tonca and dumping of sludge in the creek are partly responsible for its putrid nature. IPSCDL’s draft report, which was reviewed by TOI, states that a 10cm-thick layer of sludge lies at the bottom of the creek, which needs to be removed through de-silting. The Asian Development Bank, under its cities development initiative for Asia, had sanctioned funds to rejuvenate the creek. The Union ministry of urban development, meanwhile, had sanctioned Rs 19.5 crore to the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) in March 2014 to revive the creek under the Jawaharlal Nehru national urban renewal mission (JNNURM). The Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) had prepared a detailed project report through LKS Consultancy, seeking funds to invigorate and beautify the creek, but all the plans and proposals have remained on paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-another-task-force-to-pull-st-inez-creek-out-of-the-gutter/articleshow/86128162.cms||Newton Sequeira

Brahmadev died of gunshot wounds in Piri forest of Latehar district and security personnel had claimed that the deceased was an extremist and killed during an “encounter”. The PUCL has also appealed to the government to initiate a departmental inquiry against the policemen and the CRPF personnel who were out on anti-Naxal operation and involved in the “killing. They also demanded handing over of the case to the CBI PUCL state vice-president Shashi Sagar Verma said several fact-finding teams, which visited the Piri forest after the reported “encounter”, have concluded that the security men had opened fire on innocent villagers in which Brahmadev Singh was killed. “Unfortunately, a case has been registered against the villagers to put them under duress while the complaint of Jiramani Devi has not been converted into an FIR,” Verma said. Verma said family members of the deceased and the villagers have filed written complaints against the officers concerned before the Garu police station and the SP Latehar. So far, police have not acted on their complaints. “A representation was also made to the DC, Latehar, by the Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha, an umbrella organisation of several civil rights groups, seeking immediate action against the accused officials, but it was ignored for the past three months,” he said. Along with the appeal, the PUCL has also furnished copies of media reports of June 13 which described the incident as a case of firing by security men on villagers along with a detailed fact-finding report of the mahasabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pucl-demands-fir-in-fake-encounter-case-in-latehar/articleshow/86125919.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Jamshedpur||After CAG censure, experts to study bridge quality in Jharkhand||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government has decided to rope in retired bridge experts for supervision of the construction work of bridges in rural areas after such structures crumbled prematurely. The move also came in the backdrop of the CAG report for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, which said lack of planning, monitoring and poor execution of the bridges built for rural connectivity under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY and the Mukhyamantri Gram Setu Yojana (MGSY). The report, which was tabled during the monsoon session of the assembly earlier this week, also slammed the government over wasteful expenditure in such bridge projects, causing heavy loss to the state exchequer. To address such concerns in future, the Jharkhand State Rural Road Development Authority (JSRRDA) under the rural works department decided to hire expert civil engineers with expertise in handling bridge projects. Talking to TOI on Saturday, the chief engineer of the rural works department (rural development department), J P Singh, said they have begun scouting for 15 bridge experts in the first phase. “We have scheduled an interview to hire about 15 experts on September 22. If all goes well, we hope to have them on board soon after the interview process. Advertisement regarding these openings is already out,” said Singh, adding that they are looking for candidates who are retired or will be retiring in December this year. “Since it is not a regular government post, we are preferring retired personnel having expertise in handling bridge projects. The maximum age of the candidates should be of 65 years at the time of interview. The selected candidates will be empanelled with the department for one year initially. During this period, we will take their services based on the projects and will be paid on per day remuneration/honorarium basis,” he informed. Notably, the CAG report revealed how scores of rural bridges built between 2014 and 2019 were of compromised quality and sub-standard due to lack of monitoring at all levels, resulting in their premature collapse. In some cases, it was also found the bridges were built in such places where there were not any need while some structures still remain incomplete for long. During this year’s monsoon and Cyclone Yaas in May, at least two bridges in Tamar on Ranchi outskirts suffered damage while in a few districts such as Chatra, Ramgarh, and Koderma, the bridges suffered due to the rise in water level of the rivers. While Singh didn’t categorically comment on the CAG report, he agreed that due to the absence of experts or a special cell for monitoring, such instances tend to occur. “We hope to address such issues from now by hiring bridge experts. Their job will be to evaluate project reports, monitoring the constructions from time to time and conduct quality checks among others as assigned by the department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/after-cag-censure-experts-to-study-bridge-quality-in-jharkhand/articleshow/86132924.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Admission in 3 med colleges on hold, NEET aspirants to suffer||Ranchi: Even as this year’s NEET exam will be conducted on Sunday, medical aspirants aiming to get entry into the state medical colleges may have limited options to study near their homes as the National Medical Commission (NMC) has put on hold the admissions to MBBS courses at the three newly established medical colleges in Palamu, Dumka and Hazaribag for lack of requisite facilities. In November 2020, chief minister Hemant Soren had written a letter to the NMC, requesting the regulatory body to reconsider the decision. Soren had also requested NMC chairman Dr Suresh Chandra Sharma to allow admissions for the 2020-21 session and assured him that the state government is committed to fulfilling all academic and infrastructural requirements as per the NMC norms by November 30 this year. However, the commission hadn’t budged and didn’t allow fresh admission in the last session. However, even after Soren’s commitment, the situation of these medical colleges hasn’t changed and a lot of work is still pending. The NMC had highlighted these shortfalls in its assessment. The major part of deficiency was lack of faculty members, absence of libraries and laboratory equipment. A senior resident at the Hazaribag Medical College said, “The infrastructure is not a problem anymore as buildings have been completed and we have enough space for academic activities. However, the equipment required in laboratories is still a problem. For example, there must be a gas pipeline to the laboratories, which is yet to be done, and various instruments for experiments need to be installed.” Meanwhile, aspirants from the state, who were hopeful that there will be additional 300 seats for MBBS in the state, were saddened as they prepare for Sunday’s examination. “I had expected that the ban on admissions to be resolved before NEET 2021, but it wouldn’t happen now as the results will be announced in the next one month and we will be having lesser seats to compete in state,” said Pranjal Kumar, a medical aspirant. Additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said, “We are trying to eliminate all deficiencies at the three colleges. We have also advertised for recruitment of faculty members and it will be completed soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admission-in-3-med-colleges-on-hold-neet-aspirants-to-suffer/articleshow/86126023.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Hosps flooded with viral fever cases, patients mostly kids||Ranchi: Hospitals as well as Out Patient Departments (OPD) in the city are registering a rise in the number of viral infection cases, most of which are children. TOI spoke to several paediatricians as well as physicians and they said that they get patients with influenza and viral fever symptoms between August and October, but the increase in number of children is a worrisome sign. Total 160 children are admitted at the paediatric ward of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) which is double its capacity. OPDs are also witnessing a rush with doctors examining over 150 children on a daily basis. Private hospitals too have reported an increase in such cases. Talking to TOI, associate professor of paediatric surgery department at RIMS, Dr Abhishek Ranjan said, “This is nothing new as children get infected like this every year. But the reason behind a surge this time has different reasons. In my opinion, since the children were confined to their homes in the past one year due to the pandemic, they didn’t get exposed to even minor infections. Therefore, now when they are slowly coming out, they are catching the flu as the immunity has not developed properly.” Chief consultant and paediatrician at Balpan hospital, Dr Rajesh Kumar said: “We have seen a steep rise in patient inflow with symptoms of viral fever. However, there is a change this year as the infection is getting prolonged and children who would recover in three to four days are taking 10 days to improve. I think the situation will continue for another month as the weather is changing and this is the time when viral diseases peak.” Cases in private paediatric hospitals have also gone up significantly. “I am attending to around 60 patients on a daily basis in OPD and five to six among them are getting admitted. The most common infection is respiratory syncytial virus and it affects children every year. It has increased this year. The word of caution is to wear mask and protect oneself,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, consultant paediatrician and neonatologist. Not only children but adults are also falling sick. Doctors said that people who have been infected with Covid-19 should take extra precaution as they are more susceptible to getting sick from other viral infections. “The patient inflow in my unit has increased. It is not as high as paediatric ward but people are getting sick due to the change in weather.

Strange as it may sound, but it was shock for the man, a native of Uttar Pradesh, who was taken into custody by the surveillance staff of Karelibaug police station for a serious crime of abducting a minor girl for marriage as a teenager in 2001. The man and the woman were teenage lovers and wanted to get amrried but fearing that her family would not accept their relation, the duo fled from Vadodara and lived in Delhi for some time before settling down in his native place. The man, who is now the father of their three children had kidnapped his minor ‘love’ for which he was booked by the police then. However, despite keeping a vigil on their relatives in the city, cops could never find the lovebirds in nearly two decades. On Saturday, cops found themselves to be lucky when they received information about the ‘teen and his abducted minor girl’ had come to city to meet her relatives as a much married couple living a happy married life with their three children. When cops saw him near the Friday flea market, surveillance sleuths took him into custody and brought him to the police station. Police source said that when the man was taken into custody, his wife requested cops to leave him as the crime is irrelevant now. “We pacified her by saying that it is a procedural matter,” said a cop. “Although he is a 37-year-old man, but since he was a minor when he committed the crime, he will be considered a juvenile,” said inspector V N Mahida of Karelibaug police station. The ‘accused’ will be produced before a juvenile court in accordance with the law, Mahida added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/37-year-olds-crime-as-a-teen-catches-up-two-decades-later/articleshow/86126618.cms||---
---||Ranchi||After CAG censure, experts to study bridge quality in Jharkhand||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government has decided to rope in retired bridge experts for supervision of the construction work of bridges in rural areas after such structures crumbled prematurely. The move also came in the backdrop of the CAG report for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, which said lack of planning, monitoring and poor execution of the bridges built for rural connectivity under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY and the Mukhyamantri Gram Setu Yojana (MGSY). The report, which was tabled during the monsoon session of the assembly earlier this week, also slammed the government over wasteful expenditure in such bridge projects, causing heavy loss to the state exchequer. To address such concerns in future, the Jharkhand State Rural Road Development Authority (JSRRDA) under the rural works department decided to hire expert civil engineers with expertise in handling bridge projects. Talking to TOI on Saturday, the chief engineer of the rural works department (rural development department), J P Singh, said they have begun scouting for 15 bridge experts in the first phase. “We have scheduled an interview to hire about 15 experts on September 22. If all goes well, we hope to have them on board soon after the interview process. Advertisement regarding these openings is already out,” said Singh, adding that they are looking for candidates who are retired or will be retiring in December this year. “Since it is not a regular government post, we are preferring retired personnel having expertise in handling bridge projects. The maximum age of the candidates should be of 65 years at the time of interview. The selected candidates will be empanelled with the department for one year initially. During this period, we will take their services based on the projects and will be paid on per day remuneration/honorarium basis,” he informed. Notably, the CAG report revealed how scores of rural bridges built between 2014 and 2019 were of compromised quality and sub-standard due to lack of monitoring at all levels, resulting in their premature collapse. In some cases, it was also found the bridges were built in such places where there were not any need while some structures still remain incomplete for long. During this year’s monsoon and Cyclone Yaas in May, at least two bridges in Tamar on Ranchi outskirts suffered damage while in a few districts such as Chatra, Ramgarh, and Koderma, the bridges suffered due to the rise in water level of the rivers. While Singh didn’t categorically comment on the CAG report, he agreed that due to the absence of experts or a special cell for monitoring, such instances tend to occur. “We hope to address such issues from now by hiring bridge experts. Their job will be to evaluate project reports, monitoring the constructions from time to time and conduct quality checks among others as assigned by the department,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-cag-censure-experts-to-study-bridge-quality-in-jharkhand/articleshow/86126057.cms||ASRP Mukesh

A private agency hired by the Noida Authority would carry out the survey of the entire project, but with focus on the Apex and Ceyane towers, which have to be brought down in three months. Officials said the findings of the aerial survey would be matched with the records and building maps available with the Authority. The digital data would also be shared with the Central Building Research Institute in Roorkee, whose assistance the Supreme Court had asked Noida to take in bringing down the towers. “The Authority officials got in touch with us about a week ago and informed us about the need to carry out the survey. We have been coordinating with them to ensure the exercise gets done smoothly,” said Rajesh Rana, president of the residents’ welfare association of Emerald Court. A team of experts has already visited the project twice this week. According to officials, the drones would not only capture the layout of the entire project aerially, but also record the twin towers from all sides from the ground to the top floor. After data of all vital parameters have been collated, a 3D modelling of the project would be made. “It’s going to be extremely difficult to get the exact height and measurements of the building manually. A total of 32 floors have been constructed apart from the basements. We will have to check the condition of each and every floor. A structural audit will be required before the demolition takes place. Also, the number of scaffolding, wooden planks and other materials that have been used needs to be accessed. Using drones to do all these is much more convenient,” an Authority official said. Findings of the survey would also be shared with the special investigation team that is probing — as the apex court had observed — the collusion of Authority officials and the developers. The four-member SIT was set up after the August 31 order of the apex court to probe the collusion in allowing the construction of the twin towers and fix responsibility. The legal battle against the twin towers was fought by the Emerald Court RWA. The area between the two towers, the building setback and the space for car parking would also be analysed and collated with the sanctioned building maps. The survey team, sources said, wants to find out how much area has been used for constructing the twin towers. The Emerald Court RWA has decided to hire a civil engineer for advice on the way forward. The engineer will be tasked with coordinating with the Authority and the agency appointed to bring down the twin towers. The RWA wants an understanding of the protocols that are to be followed to ensure safety of residents before the demolition happens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-plans-a-drone-survey-of-twin-towers/articleshow/86128488.cms||Shalabh

Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee president Amit Chavda said, "By changing the CM, the government’s failure will not remain hidden. People have become victims of failed economic policies, farmers are committing suicide and, even after paying more for education, youth are unemployed." Chavda re-tweeted his post of August 1 in which he had questioned the celebrations announced to mark the completion of Rupani’s five years as CM. "We said that this was an occasion to give him a grand farewell, and the BJP gave him a send-off with a celebration in the name of his completing five years in office," he said. He also asked why nobody is allowed to complete a full term in office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rupani-paying-for-failures-of-bjp-congress/articleshow/86131588.cms||---

He declared that the state will build the stadium and it has also finalized the land for the same. The area is known for producing a number of football players. “Despite having a rich history of over 80 years and producing many international players, Kamptee never got a football stadium. The state has acquired around 10 acres of land and the work will start soon after tenders are floated,” said Kedar during a visit to the Sports Journalists’ Association of Nagpur (SJAN) office. TOI has learnt that the state has sanctioned an initial amount of around Rs18 crore for the project. The district sports officials are closely following up in order to start the work soon. Kedar also said that until sports bodies resolve disputes, their right to run the sport will be withdrawn. Infighting among officials have hampered the career of players. “A government resolution will be issued soon,” he said. The minister expressed concern about sports complexes that are built by the state government but are either underutilized or not maintained properly. “We are about to frame a policy where private firms could be involved to maintain and run the facilities,” he said. About the city’s divisional sports complex at Mankapur, Kedar said, “I know a lot of work is pending at the complex. As we complete the existing work, we are focusing on developing state-of-the-art facilities for players.” When asked about the sports certificate scam, he said, “I know government sports officials may be involved and no one will be spared if found guilty.” THREE COURSES START 3 courses to start at state's international sports university in 1st phase: The state's pet project — international sports university at Balewadi in Pune — will soon start three courses at the campus from October in the first phase. The state plans has already sanctioned 213 posts for the university and it named the governing council a couple of days ago. It comprises rugby player and actor Rahul Bose, former Indian spinner Nilesh Kulkarni, former international shooter Anjali Bhagwat, former Indian football goalkeeper Henry Menezes, pro-VC of Symbiosis University Vidya Yeravdekar, Vandana Krishna, Om Prakash Bakoria and Anjali Thakre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kamptee-to-get-football-stadium-soon-kedar/articleshow/86128613.cms||---

It had to be rescued in the early hours of the day to ensure that immersions took place safely in the pond. City-based Wildlife Rescue Trust got a call at around 1am on Saturday. Volunteers reached the pond along with forest department officials and found a four-feet crocodile there. The pond was being filled with water for the immersions when the workers spotted the reptile. It took the rescuers around three hours to capture it as lights around the pond were not working. The fire brigade was called which arrived with flood lights to facilitate the rescue. Two more crocodiles were also spotted near the Jalaram Temple in Karelibaug on Friday night. The reptiles had strayed into the Jaladham Society and had to be rescued by volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/croc-found-in-immersion-pond/articleshow/86126659.cms||---
---||World||Under fire, China tech firms vow ‘self-discipline’||SHANGHAI: Chinese content platforms including Weibo and Tencent Video have agreed to enforce more self-discipline to help maintain a "clear" cyberspace environment, a government-affiliated industry association said on Saturday. Chinese regulators last month cracked down on what they call a "chaotic" celebrity fan culture after a series of scandals involving artists. The authorities barred platforms from publishing lists of popular celebrities and ordered fan groups to be regulated. The China Association of Performing Arts (CAPA) said it met on Friday with platform representatives, who pledged to promote only "healthy" content with positive values, to refrain from using data and traffic as their main guide and to stop encouraging "false hype". Fourteen platforms signed the pledge, CAPA said in a WeChat statement, including short video platform Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, and news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, both owned by ByteDance. Tencent said on its official Weibo account that it would work to create a clean and upright online culture. Weibo and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The platforms would strengthen their management of accounts and restrict those that spread baseless star gossip or stir up conflicts between fan groups, CAPA said. They would also encourage users to actively report illegal content. "The participating platforms reached a consensus that in order to maintain a clean cyberspace environment and strengthen the construction of online cultural content, companies should carry out more proactive self discipline," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/under-fire-china-tech-firms-vow-self-discipline/articleshow/86131704.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Learning gaps among students are more than expected, say teachers||BENGALURU: Attention deficit, hyperactive and disconnected. These are the words that school teachers in Bengaluru are using to describe most of their students, who returned to the campus after a Covid-induced break of months. While on-campus classes for students in grades 9 to 12 resumed on August 23, offline learning for children in grades 6 to 8 began only on September 6. The latter have been going to school on alternate days. After finally meeting them in person, teachers and experts said that their worst fears about learning gaps had come true. Surekha KV, a science teacher at a government school in the city, told STOI that though teachers in her school expected this, the magnitude of disconnect among students had shocked them. “Students in class 9 have forgotten the basics of class 7. We have to repeat our online lessons and remind them of what was taught in 2019,” she said, adding that some of the brightest pupils, who answered questions and interacted effortlessly in the classroom earlier, were struggling a little now. Shashi Kumar D, the general secretary of the Karnataka Associated Management of English Medium Schools (KAMS), said that learning gaps were not the same among students of a single class. “The gaps vary depending on their attendance in online classes,” he said. Though hyperactive, several students are finding it difficult to concentrate and recall previous lessons. “The situation is quite challenging for teachers. Just half a day of classes on alternate days is not sufficient to address issues that have developed over the past 16 months,” he said, adding that the attendance is slowly picking up. In some parts of Karnataka, students who started working to support their families financially have not returned to school yet. Teachers of schools with low attendance are going the extra mile to bring their pupils back. Kotresh B, an English teacher at a government high school in Tidigol village in Raichur district’s Sindhanur taluk, said that staff members were going door to door and persuading parents to send their children to classes. “As attendance is not compulsory right now, a section of parents is not ready. They are happy that their kids are bringing some money home. We are raising awareness about the long-term benefits of formal schooling and are seeing some success,” he said. According to Kotresh, some children who have been stuck at home are suffering from mental breakdowns, depression and other issues. “Confined in their homes with added family issues, they are missing social interactions that happen in school,” he said. Niranjanaradhya VP, a development educationist and mentor of School Development and Monitoring Committees (SDMCs), said that to fill learning gaps, the curriculum must be reorganised and teachers should be trained. The government must prepare a different plan altogether to address the education emergency, he suggested. “Two months of a bridge course is not the solution for the problems we are seeing. A knee-jerk response is not going to help address the gravity of the learning crisis. A plan must be made with inputs from academicians and teachers,” he said, adding that the National Coalition on the Education Emergency has been working to tackle the issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/as-schools-open-learning-gaps-revealed/articleshow/86130639.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Man kills son; girlfriend and wife help dispose of body||BENGALURU: A man, his wife and girlfriend have been arrested on charges of murdering the married couple’s 10-year-old son and trying to cover up the same. Sunil Kumar, 30, allegedly killed his son in the presence of his girlfriend Nadia on February 7 and the trio disposed of the body in a Tamil Nadu forest. All three are residents of Gurappanapalya. Kumar, a private company employee, filed a missing person’s complaint with Mico Layout police in southeast division on August 26. He claimed that his son had gone missing from his friend’s house on February 7. “We were shocked to hear from Kumar that his son went missing in February and he was filing the complaint only in August. We immediately suspected him and felt there was foul play involved as no parent would wait for six months to complain about his/her missing child,” an investigating officer said. Kumar has worked in different private companies, while his wife Sindhu, 26, is employed with a garment factory. Nadiya, who’s from Channapatna, also works in the same factory. On receiving the complaint, police began questioning neighbours, family members and friends of Kumar and Sindhu. During investigation, Kumar’s extramarital affair with Nadia came to light. Also, Kumar was found making contradictory statements about his friend’s house from where he claimed his son went missing. “Kumar’s friend claimed he was innocent and the boy had never visited his house. We then interrogated Kumar and Nada and they spilled the beans about the murder,” the officer said. He added Kumar had smashed his son’s head with a metal pipe and other hard objects inside his house on the night of February 7. “Sindhu had been objecting to Kumar’s affair with Nada. On that night, Kumar’s son is said to have also spoken something which angered Kumar. In a fit of rage, he killed him as Nadiya watched,” the officer said. Explaining why Sindhu was arrested, police said upon her return from work that night, Kumar and Nadiya confessed to her about the crime. “Kumar requested Sindhu to protect him and promised he wouldn’t be involved with Nadiya. Sindhu agreed to keep the matter a secret. The trio then covered the body in bedsheets and bundled it into a car Kumar borrowed from his friend and drove to forests near Bargur in Tamil Nadu. The body was disposed of there,” police said. Complaint filed under family pressure: CopsCops added the missing person’s complaint was finally filed in August after Sindhu’s family members grew suspicious as to why the couple hadn’t taken help from police in tracking their son. “Forced by family members, Kumar came to the police station and filed the complaint,” the investigating officer added. The trio has been remanded in judicial custody and is lodged at Central Prison (Parappana Agrahara).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-kills-son-girlfriend-and-wife-help-dispose-of-body/articleshow/86125934.cms||---
---||World||On 9/11 anniversary, Afghans blame departed US forces for their woes||War-weary residents of Kabul expressed anger and feelings of betrayal by the United States on Saturday, as the world marked the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that prompted a U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the toppling of its Taliban rulers. After a two-decade occupation, U.S. forces abruptly pulled out of Afghanistan last month, triggering the collapse of its Western-backed government and the Taliban's dramatic return to power. "The misfortunes we are currently experiencing are because of America," said Abdul Waris, a Kabul resident, as the white flags of the Taliban emblazoned with lines from the Koran hung from nearby lampposts. Some of the mostly young men who spoke to Reuters complained that U.S. forces had not tried to help the Afghan people. "After the September 11 events took place, the Americans were in our country for 20 years for their own benefit," said Jalil Ahmad. "They took the benefits they had in mind for 20 years while we did not get any benefit from them. They have left the country in a state of confusion." Bearded Taliban fighters with guns slung over their shoulders were visible around the capital but the mood was quiet and calm following the dramatic changes of recent weeks. "Now there is security and security is good... May God give the Taliban more strength to maintain this (calm) forever," said resident Gul Agha Laghmni. 'A LOT OF COMMOTION' U.S. forces toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks because they had provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, leader of al Qaeda, which carried out the attacks. Since returning to power last month, the Taliban has appointed an acting cabinet including several former militants held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Western leaders have expressed concern over the outlook for human rights, especially for women, under Taliban rule. Several street protests led by women have been broken up in the past two weeks, and some people have been detained and beaten. The Taliban have promised to investigate such incidents. When they were last in power from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban imposed a strict version of Islamic law and often punished people with public floggings, amputations and executions. Women's rights to work and education were severely restricted. There were relatively few women on the streets of Kabul on Saturday, and all those who were out had their heads covered - a fact welcomed by residents such as Shah Raoof. "In the presence of America, there was a lot of commotion in our country. Women were unveiled," he said. "The majority of our youth fled, a number were martyred and a number of others were afflicted by America through war and misery."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/on-9/11-anniversary-afghans-blame-departed-us-forces-for-their-woes/articleshow/86131741.cms||---

The laboratory is set up for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai high speed rail project by M/s L&T which is executing the civil works between Ahmedabad and Vapi. The laboratory has generated employment for around 900 persons including engineers, technicians and skilled labourers, a NHSRCL official said on Saturday. It can conduct 3,500 tests per day through 20 geotechnical engineers and 188 lab technicians. During the training, students are familiarized with instruments being used for various geotechnical investigations. “The Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project has also given a boost to the local geotechnical investigation setup with labs upgrading their old equipment. Around 15 laboratories at Valsad, Surat, Vadodara, Anand and Ahmedabad have upgraded their infrastructure to comply with the international standards required for the project. Fully automatic and semi-automatic ground testing machines have been deployed at project sites,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/svnit-students-get-training-at-asias-biggest-geotech-lab/articleshow/86126784.cms||---
---||World||Evidence disputes US’ claim of IS bomb in Afghanistan drone strike||KABUL: It was the last known missile fired by the United States in its 20-year war in Afghanistan, and the military called it a “righteous strike” — a drone attack after hours of surveillance Aug. 29 against a vehicle that U.S. officials thought contained an Islamic State bomb and posed an imminent threat to troops at Kabul’s airport. But a New York Times investigation of video evidence, along with interviews with more than a dozen of the driver’s co-workers and family members in Kabul, raises doubts about the U.S. version of events, including whether explosives were present in the vehicle, whether the driver had a connection to the Islamic State group and whether there was a second explosion after the missile struck the car. Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car’s driver when the drone fired but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an Islamic State group safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car. Times reporting has identified the driver as Zemari Ahmadi, a longtime worker for a U.S. aid group. The evidence, including extensive interviews with family members, co-workers and witnesses, suggests that his travels that day actually involved transporting colleagues to and from work. And an analysis of video feeds showed that what the military may have seen was Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water into his trunk to bring home to his family. While the U.S. military said the drone strike might have killed three civilians, Times reporting shows that it killed 10, including seven children, in a dense residential block. Ahmadi, 43, had worked since 2006 as an electrical engineer for Nutrition and Education International, a California-based aid and lobbying group. The day of the strike, Ahmadi’s boss called from the office around 8:45 a.m. and asked him to pick up his laptop. “I asked him if he was still at home, and he said yes,” the country director said in an interview at NEI’s office in Kabul. Like the rest of Ahmadi’s colleagues, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his association with an American company in Afghanistan. According to his relatives, Ahmadi left for work around 9 a.m. in a white 1996 Toyota Corolla that belonged to NEI, departing from his house, where he lived with his three brothers and their families, a few miles west of the airport. U.S. officials told The Times that it was around this time that their target, a white sedan, first came under surveillance, after it was spotted leaving a compound identified as an alleged Islamic State group safe house about 3 miles northwest of the airport. It is unclear if officials were referring to one of the three stops that Ahmadi made to pick up two passengers and the laptop on his way to work: The latter location, the home of NEI’s country director, was close to where a rocket attack claimed by the Islamic State group would be launched against the airport the following morning, from an improvised launcher concealed inside the trunk of a Toyota Corolla, a model similar to Ahmadi’s vehicle. A Times reporter visited the director at his home, and met with members of his family, who said they had been living there for 40 years. “We have nothing to do with terrorism or ISIS,” said the director, who also has a U.S. resettlement case. “We love America. We want to go there.” Throughout the day, an MQ-9 Reaper drone continued to track Ahmadi’s vehicle as it drove around Kabul, and U.S. officials said they intercepted communications between the sedan and the alleged Islamic State group safe house, instructing it to make several stops. But the people who rode with Ahmadi that day said that what the military interpreted as a series of suspicious moves was simply a normal day at work. After stopping to pick up breakfast, Ahmadi and his two passengers arrived at NEI’s office, where security camera footage obtained by The Times recorded their arrival at 9:35 a.m. Later that morning Ahmadi drove some co-workers to a Taliban-occupied police station downtown, where they said they requested permission to distribute food to refugees in a nearby park. Ahmadi and his three passengers returned to the office around 2 p.m. As seen on camera footage, Ahmadi came out a half-hour later with a hose that was streaming water. With the help of a guard, he filled several empty plastic containers. According to his co-workers, water deliveries had stopped in his neighborhood after the collapse of the government and Ahmadi had been bringing home water from the office. “I filled the containers myself and helped him load them into the trunk,” the guard said. At 3:38 p.m., the guard and another co-worker moved the car farther into the driveway. The camera footage ends soon after, when the office shut off its generator at the end of the work day, and Ahmadi and three passengers left for home. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Around this time, U.S. officials said that the drone had tracked Ahmadi to a compound 5 to 7 miles southwest of the airport, a location that matched NEI’s office. There, they said the drone observed Ahmadi and three others loading heavy packages into the car, which they believed might contain explosives. But the passengers said that they had only two laptops with them, which they put inside the vehicle, and that the trunk had no other cargo than the plastic water-filled containers that were placed there earlier. In separate interviews, all three passengers denied loading explosives into the vehicle they were about to commute home in. According to one of Ahmadi’s passengers, a colleague who regularly commuted with him, the ride home was filled with their usual laughing and banter, but with one difference: Ahmadi kept the radio silent, as he was afraid of getting in trouble with the Taliban. “He liked happy music,” the colleague said. “That day, we couldn’t play any in the car.” Ahmadi dropped off his three passengers and then headed for his home near the airport. “I asked him to come in for a bit, but he said he was tired,” the last passenger said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Although U.S. officials said that at that point they still knew little about Ahmadi’s identity, they had become convinced that the white sedan he was driving posed an imminent threat to troops at the airport. When Ahmadi pulled into the courtyard of his home — which officials said was different from the alleged Islamic State group safe house — the tactical commander made the decision to strike his vehicle, launching a Hellfire missile around 4:50 p.m. Although the target was now inside a densely populated residential area, the drone operator quickly scanned and saw only a single adult male greeting the vehicle, and therefore assessed with “reasonable certainty” that no women, children or noncombatants would be killed, U.S. officials said. But according to his relatives, as Ahmadi pulled into his courtyard, several of his children and his brothers’ children came out, excited to see him, and sat in the car as he backed it inside. Ahmadi’s brother Romal was sitting on the ground floor with his wife when he heard the sound of the gate opening and Ahmadi’s car entering. His adult cousin Naser had gone to fetch water for his ablutions and greeted him. The car’s engine was still running when there was a sudden blast, and the room was sprayed with shattered glass from the window, Romal recalled. He staggered to his feet. “Where are the children?” he asked his wife. “They’re outside,” she replied. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Romal ran out into the courtyard; he saw that his nephew Faysal, 16, had fallen from the exterior staircase, his torso and head grievously wounded by shrapnel. “He wasn’t breathing.” Amid the smoke and fire, he saw another dead nephew, before neighbors arrived and pulled him away, he said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Since the strike, U.S. military officials justified their actions by citing an even larger blast that took place afterward. “Because there were secondary explosions, there is a reasonable conclusion to be made that there is explosives in that vehicle,” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said last week. But an examination of the scene of the strike, conducted by The Times’ visual investigations team and a Times reporter the morning afterward, and followed up with a second visit four days later, found no evidence of a second, more powerful explosion. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Experts who examined photos and videos pointed out that, although there was clear evidence of a missile strike and subsequent vehicle fire, there were no collapsed or blown-out walls, no destroyed vegetation and only one dent in the entrance gate, indicating a single shock wave. “It seriously questions the credibility of the intelligence or technology utilized to determine this was a legitimate target,” said Chris Cobb-Smith, a British army veteran and security consultant. While the U.S. military has so far acknowledged only three civilian casualties, Ahmadi’s relatives said that 10 members of their family, including seven children, were killed in the strike: Ahmadi and three of his children, Zamir, 20, Faisal, 16, and Farzad, 10; Ahmadi’s cousin Naser, 30; three of Romal’s children, Arwin, 7, Benyamin, 6, and Hayat, 2; and two 3-year-old girls, Malika and Somaya. Neighbors and an Afghan health official confirmed that bodies of children were removed from the site. They said the blast had shredded most of the victims; fragments of human remains were seen inside and around the compound the next day by a reporter, including blood and flesh splattered on interior walls and ceilings. Ahmadi’s relatives provided photographs of several badly burned bodies belonging to children. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Family members questioned why Ahmadi would have a motivation to attack Americans when he had already applied for refugee resettlement in the United States. His adult cousin Naser, a former U.S. military contractor, had also applied for resettlement. He had planned to marry his fiancée, Samia, last Friday so that she could be included in his immigration case. “All of them were innocent,” said Emal, Ahmadi’s brother. “You say he was ISIS, but he worked for the Americans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/evidence-disputes-us-claim-of-is-bomb-in-afghanistan-drone-strike/articleshow/86131762.cms||---
---||World||Evidence disputes US’ claim of IS bomb in Afghanistan drone strike||KABUL: It was the last known missile fired by the United States in its 20-year war in Afghanistan, and the military called it a “righteous strike” — a drone attack after hours of surveillance Aug. 29 against a vehicle that U.S. officials thought contained an Islamic State bomb and posed an imminent threat to troops at Kabul’s airport. But a New York Times investigation of video evidence, along with interviews with more than a dozen of the driver’s co-workers and family members in Kabul, raises doubts about the U.S. version of events, including whether explosives were present in the vehicle, whether the driver had a connection to the Islamic State group and whether there was a second explosion after the missile struck the car. Military officials said they did not know the identity of the car’s driver when the drone fired but deemed him suspicious because of how they interpreted his activities that day, saying that he possibly visited an Islamic State group safe house and, at one point, loaded what they thought could be explosives into the car. Times reporting has identified the driver as Zemari Ahmadi, a longtime worker for a U.S. aid group. The evidence, including extensive interviews with family members, co-workers and witnesses, suggests that his travels that day actually involved transporting colleagues to and from work. And an analysis of video feeds showed that what the military may have seen was Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water into his trunk to bring home to his family. While the U.S. military said the drone strike might have killed three civilians, Times reporting shows that it killed 10, including seven children, in a dense residential block. Ahmadi, 43, had worked since 2006 as an electrical engineer for Nutrition and Education International, a California-based aid and lobbying group. The day of the strike, Ahmadi’s boss called from the office around 8:45 a.m. and asked him to pick up his laptop. “I asked him if he was still at home, and he said yes,” the country director said in an interview at NEI’s office in Kabul. Like the rest of Ahmadi’s colleagues, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because of his association with an American company in Afghanistan. According to his relatives, Ahmadi left for work around 9 a.m. in a white 1996 Toyota Corolla that belonged to NEI, departing from his house, where he lived with his three brothers and their families, a few miles west of the airport. U.S. officials told The Times that it was around this time that their target, a white sedan, first came under surveillance, after it was spotted leaving a compound identified as an alleged Islamic State group safe house about 3 miles northwest of the airport. It is unclear if officials were referring to one of the three stops that Ahmadi made to pick up two passengers and the laptop on his way to work: The latter location, the home of NEI’s country director, was close to where a rocket attack claimed by the Islamic State group would be launched against the airport the following morning, from an improvised launcher concealed inside the trunk of a Toyota Corolla, a model similar to Ahmadi’s vehicle. A Times reporter visited the director at his home, and met with members of his family, who said they had been living there for 40 years. “We have nothing to do with terrorism or ISIS,” said the director, who also has a U.S. resettlement case. “We love America. We want to go there.” Throughout the day, an MQ-9 Reaper drone continued to track Ahmadi’s vehicle as it drove around Kabul, and U.S. officials said they intercepted communications between the sedan and the alleged Islamic State group safe house, instructing it to make several stops. But the people who rode with Ahmadi that day said that what the military interpreted as a series of suspicious moves was simply a normal day at work. After stopping to pick up breakfast, Ahmadi and his two passengers arrived at NEI’s office, where security camera footage obtained by The Times recorded their arrival at 9:35 a.m. Later that morning Ahmadi drove some co-workers to a Taliban-occupied police station downtown, where they said they requested permission to distribute food to refugees in a nearby park. Ahmadi and his three passengers returned to the office around 2 p.m. As seen on camera footage, Ahmadi came out a half-hour later with a hose that was streaming water. With the help of a guard, he filled several empty plastic containers. According to his co-workers, water deliveries had stopped in his neighborhood after the collapse of the government and Ahmadi had been bringing home water from the office. “I filled the containers myself and helped him load them into the trunk,” the guard said. At 3:38 p.m., the guard and another co-worker moved the car farther into the driveway. The camera footage ends soon after, when the office shut off its generator at the end of the work day, and Ahmadi and three passengers left for home. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Around this time, U.S. officials said that the drone had tracked Ahmadi to a compound 5 to 7 miles southwest of the airport, a location that matched NEI’s office. There, they said the drone observed Ahmadi and three others loading heavy packages into the car, which they believed might contain explosives. But the passengers said that they had only two laptops with them, which they put inside the vehicle, and that the trunk had no other cargo than the plastic water-filled containers that were placed there earlier. In separate interviews, all three passengers denied loading explosives into the vehicle they were about to commute home in. According to one of Ahmadi’s passengers, a colleague who regularly commuted with him, the ride home was filled with their usual laughing and banter, but with one difference: Ahmadi kept the radio silent, as he was afraid of getting in trouble with the Taliban. “He liked happy music,” the colleague said. “That day, we couldn’t play any in the car.” Ahmadi dropped off his three passengers and then headed for his home near the airport. “I asked him to come in for a bit, but he said he was tired,” the last passenger said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Although U.S. officials said that at that point they still knew little about Ahmadi’s identity, they had become convinced that the white sedan he was driving posed an imminent threat to troops at the airport. When Ahmadi pulled into the courtyard of his home — which officials said was different from the alleged Islamic State group safe house — the tactical commander made the decision to strike his vehicle, launching a Hellfire missile around 4:50 p.m. Although the target was now inside a densely populated residential area, the drone operator quickly scanned and saw only a single adult male greeting the vehicle, and therefore assessed with “reasonable certainty” that no women, children or noncombatants would be killed, U.S. officials said. But according to his relatives, as Ahmadi pulled into his courtyard, several of his children and his brothers’ children came out, excited to see him, and sat in the car as he backed it inside. Ahmadi’s brother Romal was sitting on the ground floor with his wife when he heard the sound of the gate opening and Ahmadi’s car entering. His adult cousin Naser had gone to fetch water for his ablutions and greeted him. The car’s engine was still running when there was a sudden blast, and the room was sprayed with shattered glass from the window, Romal recalled. He staggered to his feet. “Where are the children?” he asked his wife. “They’re outside,” she replied. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Romal ran out into the courtyard; he saw that his nephew Faysal, 16, had fallen from the exterior staircase, his torso and head grievously wounded by shrapnel. “He wasn’t breathing.” Amid the smoke and fire, he saw another dead nephew, before neighbors arrived and pulled him away, he said. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Since the strike, U.S. military officials justified their actions by citing an even larger blast that took place afterward. “Because there were secondary explosions, there is a reasonable conclusion to be made that there is explosives in that vehicle,” the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said last week. But an examination of the scene of the strike, conducted by The Times’ visual investigations team and a Times reporter the morning afterward, and followed up with a second visit four days later, found no evidence of a second, more powerful explosion. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) Experts who examined photos and videos pointed out that, although there was clear evidence of a missile strike and subsequent vehicle fire, there were no collapsed or blown-out walls, no destroyed vegetation and only one dent in the entrance gate, indicating a single shock wave. “It seriously questions the credibility of the intelligence or technology utilized to determine this was a legitimate target,” said Chris Cobb-Smith, a British army veteran and security consultant. While the U.S. military has so far acknowledged only three civilian casualties, Ahmadi’s relatives said that 10 members of their family, including seven children, were killed in the strike: Ahmadi and three of his children, Zamir, 20, Faisal, 16, and Farzad, 10; Ahmadi’s cousin Naser, 30; three of Romal’s children, Arwin, 7, Benyamin, 6, and Hayat, 2; and two 3-year-old girls, Malika and Somaya. Neighbors and an Afghan health official confirmed that bodies of children were removed from the site. They said the blast had shredded most of the victims; fragments of human remains were seen inside and around the compound the next day by a reporter, including blood and flesh splattered on interior walls and ceilings. Ahmadi’s relatives provided photographs of several badly burned bodies belonging to children. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Family members questioned why Ahmadi would have a motivation to attack Americans when he had already applied for refugee resettlement in the United States. His adult cousin Naser, a former U.S. military contractor, had also applied for resettlement. He had planned to marry his fiancée, Samia, last Friday so that she could be included in his immigration case. “All of them were innocent,” said Emal, Ahmadi’s brother. “You say he was ISIS, but he worked for the Americans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/evidence-disputes-us-claim-of-is-bomb-in-afghanistan-drone-strike/articleshow/86131753.cms||---
---||Business||Google illegally underpaid temporary staff in at least 16 countries: Report||In December, a group of Google managers responsible for overseeing thousands of its temporary staff members discovered the company had been underpaying some of those workers for years. The gap in so-called bench mark rates between what Google paid full-time employees and temporary workers doing similar work had widened significantly, according to internal company emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times. This was especially problematic in countries with so-called pay parity laws requiring the company to pay temporary workers the same wages as full-time employees in similar positions. But Google’s lapse had gone undetected outside the company. The managers worried that fixing the shortfall by suddenly lifting hourly rates 20%-30% would call attention to the problem and invite negative publicity to a company already criticized for creating a two-tier workforce of generously compensated full-time employees and less-expensive temps and contractors who are easy to hire and fire. So, Google landed on a fix that would not call as much attention to the problem: It decided to apply the correct rates for only new hires starting in 2021 but held off on more-expensive, wholesale changes, according to company emails reviewed by the Times. Alan Barry, a Google compliance manager in Ireland, wrote in an email to colleagues that adjusting the rates for all of its temps was the correct move from a “compliance perspective.” However, doing so might increase the likelihood that Google's current temporary staff members could “connect the dots” about the reason behind the pay bump and place the staffing agencies who supply and pay the workers in “a difficult position, legally and ethically.” “The cost is significant and it would give rise to a flurry of noise/frustration,” Barry wrote. “I’m also not keen to invite the charge that we’ve allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant.” Google’s decision to not immediately correct the pay rates for all current temps was flagged in June in a whistleblower complaint to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Google may owe more than $100 million in back salaries over nine years of noncompliance in 16 countries with pay parity laws, according to the complaint. The figure does not include possible fines or legal costs. The complaint accuses Google of securities violations because it failed to disclose the risk to investors. It is not clear if the SEC is currently investigating Google. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment. In addition to the complaint, the Times separately reviewed dozens of documents and internal emails about Google’s management of its temporary workers, offering an unusual glimpse into how the company is grappling with growing pressure to treat temps more like permanent employees. Google said this week that it had started to make some changes to temp pay rates. The company said that while bench mark rates had not changed for some years, actual pay for temporary workers had increased numerous times and that most temps were paid more than the pay ranges. “It’s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company,” Spyro Karetsos, the company’s chief compliance officer, said in a statement. “We’re going to figure out what went wrong here, why it happened, and we’re going to make it right.” The total number of temps and contractors working at Google exceeds 150,000, while Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has 144,000 full-time employees, according to people who are familiar with the figures but are not permitted to disclose them publicly. Google has said temporary workers account for roughly 3% of its nonpermanent staff. The vast majority are outsourced workers. The company has said temps fill short-term roles to stand in for employees on leave or when a sudden business need arises for a maximum term of two years. In some cases, Google employees said temporary roles extend year after year. There is no federal law requiring U.S. companies to pay temps and permanent employees the same salaries for similar work, but other countries are passing laws to push for more equal treatment. More than 30 have some form of pay parity laws for temps. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) In countries with equal pay laws recognized by the company, Google normally takes extra precautions to make sure open temporary jobs are paid on a par with the appropriate full-time positions. In those countries, Google pays a 15% annual bonus to temps, which is the same as the lowest bonus rate for its permanent employees. It usually does not pay bonuses to temps in countries without equal pay requirements. But last year, in a company email, a Google manager said it appeared that 16 additional countries, including Brazil, Canada, Australia and Mexico, had some form of equal treatment laws for temps that the company had not properly recognized and had not taken any extra steps to be compliant with the local laws. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) As more countries introduce new regulations, Google is being forced to take action. In 2019, the Netherlands passed a law that requires Google’s staffing agencies to provide temps with the same benefits as the company’s permanent employees such as sick pay, maternity and other paid leaves, health care and stock grants. This change affected at least seven Google temp workers in the country. (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.) “This is a situation we ought to avoid,” Barry wrote in an email to colleagues. He recommended that Google fire all seven workers before the law went into effect in 2020. Ultimately, Google said it decided to hire six of the temp workers to full-time positions for the remainder of their contracts. The other worker was let go but with three months’ pay, according to the company. In recent years, Google has sought ways to cut back its use of temporary workers. In 2018, Google started Project Brightlight, an initiative that included a review of whether jobs were being categorized correctly as part of “labor model reset.” In one internal 2021 email, a Google executive said the company had reduced the number of temps by 2,700 since 2018. Most of those positions were outsourced, the email said, while 750 temps were converted to full-time employees. The project also sought to establish pay parity for temps with permanent employees doing similar jobs in the United States by 2019. In a preliminary 2019 study to weigh the financial impact of taking this step in the United States, where Google employs more than half of its temp workers, the company estimated that it would cost up to $52 million to bring pay for 4,000-plus temporary workers up to the minimum pay of a newly hired permanent employee. Internal communications viewed by the Times indicate that three years into the project, Google has struggled to make progress on equal pay for temps. In January 2020, Google apparently realized that it had been using out-of-date pay scales. In a company email reviewed by the Times, a Google manager said it had not reviewed European rates in eight years and three years in Asia. This year, a company presentation laid out the discrepancies for specific jobs. Google found that the comparison hourly wage for a temporary, midlevel administrative assistant in Britain was 16.51 pounds (about $22.86), based on what it paid full-time employees in that role in the past. But an updated 2021 rate should be 40% higher, at 23.08 pounds. Google uses Pontoon, a unit of the staffing agency Adecco Group, to handle the hiring of temps, and it pays a premium to staffing agencies to find and be the employer of record for the workers, the company documents said. Mary Beth Waddill, a spokeswoman for Pontoon, said it did not disclose information about client contracts. “Pontoon does not set pay rates, and in countries with pay parity laws, we play a role in ensuring that contingent workers are paid in adherence with the law,” she said. When a Google manager wants to hire a temp, Pontoon provides “bill rate cards” with minimum and maximum wages based on what Google said it pays full-time employees in a similar role, according to company documents. Those wages include a markup for the agencies and Pontoon. (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) Even though Google managers are allowed to pay above the maximum wage, the outdated pay ranges provide a framework for setting pay, according to a source familiar with the framework. One Google manager expressed concern in an email that the company classified the temporary roles in ways that artificially lowered its pay scale by comparing them to many unrelated and lower-paying jobs. For example, based on a spreadsheet of European pay rates reviewed by the Times, massage therapists and lawyers fall under the same job family of “HR/Admin” and they share the same basic pay rates — although managers have discretion to pay different rates. In another email, a manager said they were told to compare pay for the temp role not with the permanent job closest in terms of responsibilities and requirements, but instead use the “lowest common denominator” or the junior-most role within a job category. As Google worked to assess how to correct the rates for temps, according to emails viewed by the Times, managers continued to weigh openly what it could do without negative attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/google-illegally-underpaid-temporary-staff-in-at-least-16-countries-report/articleshow/86131782.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Several injured as Youth Cong, BJP workers turn stone-pelters||Ludhiana: Several Youth Congress and BJP workers were injured in a clash during a protest against the Centre over rising prices and inflation at Clock Tower chowk on Saturday. The cops, who had been deputed at the spot, yet again failed to prevent the situation from turning violent. Stone pelting during the protest resulted in serious injuries to at least three-four workers of both parties while several others received minor injuries. A few mediapersons also received minor injuries at the protest site. The leaders of both parties later blamed the opposite camp for the violence even as cops were criticised for their failure to control the situation. The workers of Youth Congress had given a protest call against rising prices of essential commodities outside the BJP office near the Clock Tower. The local BJP leadership and workers had also gathered in and outside their office while heavy police force was deployed at the spot since morning. The way to the BJP office was also barricaded. As district Youth Congress president Yogesh Handa reached the spot with his supporters with an effigy of PM Narendra Modi and started raising slogans, the BJP workers too started raising slogans against Congress and its leaders. The heated arguments soon led to stone pelting after some persons first threw tomatoes and sticks. Soon, there was free exchange of bricks and stones from both the sides. Several were injured and some of protesters who received serious injuries were taken to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) and Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). As cops present at the spot could not control the mob, more deployment was called to tackle the crowd. The entire drama was captured in the drones which hovered around the spot. ADCP-1 Pragya Jain also reached the spot. The cops then had to use minor force to control workers of both camps. State BJP president Ashwani Sharma, who visited DMCH to meet the injured party workers, said, “The Congress workers had come with stones in their bags with an intention to hurt BJP leaders as the BJP had taken a stand against corruption in the LIT. But we will not bow down to such pressure tactics. We are ready for any protest.” Demanding police action against Congress workers, BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said, “Congress is in a retaliatory mode as we unearthed a major scam in the Ludhiana Improvement Trust, in which names of senior Congress leaders have also cropped up. Two days back, we protested outside LIT office and also locked its gate, so this protest by Youth Congress was carried out just to settle scores with us.” He also alleged in the guise of Congress workers, goons came to gherao BJP office and started pelting stones. One BJP worker Naveen Saini received very serious injury near his eye and is under treatment at DMCH. Besides, Manu Arora, Yashpal Verma, Rahul Kaushal also received serious injuries. Some others also received minor injuries.” He alleged that police was a mute spectator in this incident. On the other hand, district Youth Congress president Yogesh Handa said, “We were protesting against the Modi government for its failure in controlling rising prices, but BJP workers could not bear the same. They first threw tomatoes and sticks and then started hurling stones.” He said one Congress worker Sahil Bassi was seriously injured in stone pelting. Kashish Mehta, Chetan Thapar and other workers also received injuries who have been admitted to CMCH. SI Harjit Singh, SHO Kotwali police station, said a cross case against unknown persons from both the parties has been registered. Action will be taken after recording statement of injured, he added. As the protest occurred on the busiest intersections of the city, many commuters stopped at the spot to make videos of the ongoing protest. But when stone pelting started, the cops first chased away the onlookers. The team of health officials which was present at the spot for Covid sampling also ran away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/several-injured-as-youth-cong-bjp-workers-turn-stone-pelters/articleshow/86129506.cms||---
---||World||Abimael Guzmán, leader of Guerrilla group that terrorized Peru, dies at 86||Abimael Guzmán, the founder and leader of the Shining Path guerrilla movement, which spread terror across much of Peru in the 1980s and ’90s, died on Saturday in Peru. He was 86. Mr. Guzmán died in a maximum-security prison in the Callao naval base in Peru, where he was serving a life sentence, prison officials said. They said he died of health complications but did not specify an exact cause. An estimated 70,000 Peruvians were killed during the decade-long peak of the Shining Path insurgency, at least one-third at the hands of guerrillas. Shining Path advocated a violent reordering of society away from the vices of urban life. Its leaders echoed Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge with warnings that “rivers of blood” would flow after their victory, and that as many as one million Peruvians might be put to death. Shining Path was almost entirely Mr. Guzmán’s conception, and for a time he seemed poised to seize power in one of Latin America’s most important countries. His avowedly Maoist movement was one of the most violently radical in the hemisphere’s modern history, and his fertile mind and extraordinary powers of persuasion laid the basis for an intense personality cult. Like many of his generation in Latin America, Mr. Guzmán was thrilled with Fidel Castro’s revolutionary victory in Cuba in 1959. Later, however, he came to scorn Castro, the Soviet Union and even moderate factions in China. Mr. Guzmán visited China several times. He came away with the vision of a Peru without money, banks, industry or foreign trade, where everyone would be a landholder and live from barter. Both of Peru’s main Communist parties expelled him, but he developed a devoted coterie of students and professors. “He was a very charismatic teacher, with a florid rhetorical style that really attracted students,” the political scientist David Scott Palmer said in 2013. “He became so strong partly because of 17 years of preparation, and partly because government missteps created conditions favorable to revolution.” (Professor Palmer, who as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s shared an office at San Agustín National University with Mr. Guzmán, a faculty member, died in 2018.) Shining Path carried out its first violent actions in 1980, including the bombing of polling places and the takeover of town halls in remote villages. One morning in December, people in Lima, the capital, awoke to the sight of dead dogs hanging from dozens of lampposts. Around the neck of each was a placard with a slogan referring to factional struggle within the Chinese Communist Party. This was the first sign of the phantasmagorical savagery that was about to descend on Peru. Mr. Guzmán, calling himself President Gonzalo, proclaimed himself the “Fourth Sword of Communism,” after Marx, Lenin and Mao. He preached “Gonzalo Thought,” which he said would bring the world to a “higher stage of Marxism.” “When the Shining Path took up arms, the attempt seemed a doomed effort to graft the Chinese experience onto the entirely different Peruvian culture,” the Peruvian journalist Gustavo Gorriti wrote. “To most people in Peru, including the legal left, the movement seemed to be a crazy sect, hopelessly divorced from reality.” But Mr. Guzmán’s fighters waged a spectacularly successful military campaign that brought large parts of the country under their control. Terror and assassination were favored tactics. The conflict spread from rural areas to Lima, where supplies of water, electricity and food became unreliable. Bombs exploded in movie theaters, restaurants and police stations. Kidnappings were rampant. Notices appeared on walls warning civilians to flee. Thousands did. The economy, already in dire shape because of poor political leadership, plunged toward chaos. Shining Path tried to find a base among Indigenous people whose needs had long been ignored by Peru’s elite, though many Indigenous people were also victims of the insurgency. Part of Mr. Guzmán’s strategy was to draw the nation’s army into bloody reprisals, revealing its “fascist entrails.” Military repression was indeed fierce. Soldiers killed many civilians and terrorized Indigenous regions, driving many to support the rebels. After several years, the government changed course. It withdrew some abusive units, gave soldiers rudimentary human rights training and began civic action programs. Two figures associated with the campaign against Shining Path, President Alberto Fujimori and his intelligence director, Vladimiro Montesinos, were later given long prison sentences after being convicted of engaging in corruption and sponsoring death squads. On Sept. 12, 1992, members of a special police unit dedicated to tracking Shining Path leaders closed in on a home in a well-to-do Lima neighborhood and captured Mr. Guzmán. He appeared in a military court wearing a black-and-white striped prisoner’s uniform. Hooded judges found him guilty of terror crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In 1993, Mr. Guzmán appeared several times on Peruvian television and called on Shining Path fighters to give up their arms. Most did, and the rebellion faded. Manuel Rubén Abimael Guzmán Reynoso was born on Dec. 3, 1934, in the town of Mollendo, on Peru’s southern coast. His father, who had six children with three women, won a prize in the national lottery and sent him to a Roman Catholic high school and to college. After earning degrees in law and philosophy, Mr. Guzmán joined the faculty at San Agustín National University in the mountain town of Arequipa. He became director of its teacher training program, which attracted students from Indigenous villages. Mr. Guzmán is not known to have had children. As a young man, he married Augusta La Torre, daughter of a Communist Party leader in Ayacucho. Known as “Comrade Norah,” she became the second in command of Shining Path. She died in 1988 under mysterious circumstances. In 2010, when Mr. Guzmán was 75, the authorities gave him permission to marry Elena Iparraguirre, who had replaced Comrade Norah as the No. 2 Shining Path leader and was also serving a life sentence on terrorism charges. They continued to be held in separate prisons. Mr. Guzmán was given a second trial, before a civilian court, after his military trial was found unconstitutional. In 2006 it found him guilty of aggravated terrorism and murder, and affirmed his life sentence. At the trial, he shouted what might have been his last public words. “Long live the Communist Party of Peru!” he cried, waving a fist above his head. “Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism! Glory to the Peruvian people! Long live the heroes of the people’s war!” Julie Turkewitz, Elda Cantú and Mitra Taj contributed reporting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/abimael-guzmn-leader-of-guerrilla-group-that-terrorized-peru-dies-at-86/articleshow/86131811.cms||---

The LIT received the official direction on Saturday. The LIT has also been directed to return the amount deposited by the bidder. However, auction of the rest 22 properties has been approved. But in the orders, it has not been specified on which ground the auction of this property has been cancelled. In the official letter issued on Saturday, it was mentioned that auction of resolution number 9 stands cancelled. Officials claimed that around Rs 13.50 crore was deposited by the bidder. The order said, “The LIT should decide whether to sell the said property as chunk site or constructing the shop-cum-offices. After this, rates should be fixed again through the district-level price and rate fixation committee.” The orders also read, “Decision regarding rate fixation of a built-up complex at Rani Jhansi Road will be intimated later.” Even for Gian Singh Rarewala Market, the order said rates should be fixed separately if there is any chunk site. The orders have been issued after discussion with local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra. Mohindra, when contacted, said, “I had cancelled the auction as the deputy commissioner gave separate statement over fixation of rates and even Bharat Bhushan Ashu had asked the government to do the same. We will now probe the matter.” The LIT had auctioned 23 properties on August 16 and resolution regarding these properties was sent on August 27. After BJP and Akali leaders alleged undervaluation of the said land, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu recommended the state government to cancel this auction. LIT chief’s ‘warning’ LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium in a post on social media warned two Akali leaders without quoting their actual names. He wrote, “They are speaking because we are letting them to do so, but we will see them.” However, he refused to comment over the same. An Akali leader said, “It is simply the frustration of the LIT chairman that he is posting such comments on his social media account. The public knows everything and I don’t need to comment anything on it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/land-row-lit-directed-to-fix-reserved-price-again/articleshow/86129544.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj

South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal had directed the chief officer of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to carry out the pruning/cutting of trees expediently, following the trail of destruction left behind by Cyclone Tauktae in mid-May. On the collector’s direction, under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Salcete mamlatdar had prepared a list of trees perceived as dangerous. But some have raised queries about the inspection carried out a few weeks back. “We have confirmed information that no forest department official was present during the inspection. As such, we demand that the department should supervise the exercise of cutting/trimming of trees,” Savio Coutinho, convener, Shadow Council, Margao said. A former member of Goa State Biodiversity Board, Antonio Mascarenhas, in a letter to the collector, questioned the need to chop the trees, stating that several trees have a large canopy due to overgrowth, which only needs scientific pruning. “All such trees, and for that matter all trees around the city, need to be pruned to a maximum height of say six to eight metres above ground level,” Mascarenhas, a former NIO scientist said. The trimmed branches sprout and become bushy, with plenty of leaf cover, due to which nutrients remain localised. “The trees become stronger, remain stable, and yield more fruit, if fruit bearing, or produce more flowers, if ornamental,” he stated. Experts say even healthy trees collapse during storms and lack of scientific pruning is depleting the state’s green cover during extreme weather and causing massive losses. “The trees grow towards light and grow tall, but when they are not pruned they become top heavy and come down due to strong winds,” senior horticulturist, Rozendo Mendonca said. Proper canopy management after scientific assessment by experts can help maintain tree balance. “Once in three years, the top heavy branches should be cut vertically to prevent water seepage and fungal infections and sprayed with systemic fungicide,” he said. While MMC is yet to receive government funds for the work, a few trees have been hastily pruned, raising concern over the unscientific hacking of the trees. “We have photographic evidence wherein trees listed for trimming have already been cut fully or the tree’s neck has been just hacked away, leaving a portion of the stem standing on the ground,” Coutinho alleged. MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes said, “The trees have been listed for trimming or cutting depending on the danger posed to property and human life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unscientific-plan-for-cutting-of-trees-in-margao-fatorda-evokes-ire-of-greens/articleshow/86127654.cms||---

The government has decided to exempt the written examination for shortlisting the candidates, in order to “avoid further delay” in rolling out the fellowship programme. The candidates will have to still appear for the oral interview. “The essential qualification for the fellowship shall be master’s degree in any discipline,” said director for Planning & Statistics Y. Durga Prasad. He also said that the relaxation also “exempts the written examination for shortlisting the candidates, in order to avoid further delay in implementation of the said programme.” The chosen fellows will be paid Rs 40,000 per month after their initial one month training is complete.

---||World||Veiled protest: Afghan women rally in support of the Taliban||KABUL: Afghan women wearing full face veils sat in rows at a Kabul university lecture theatre Saturday, pledging commitment to the Taliban's hardline policies on gender segregation. About 300 women -- covered head-to-toe in accordance with strict new dress policies for education -- waved Taliban flags as speakers railed against the West and expressed support for the Islamists' policies. A handful wore blue burqas, which have only a small mesh window to see from, but most wore black niqabs covering most of the face apart from the eyes. Many also wore black gloves. Women's rights in Afghanistan were sharply curtailed under the Taliban's 1996-2001 rule, but since returning to power last month they have claimed they will implement a less extreme rule. This time, women will be allowed to attend university as long as classes are segregated by sex or at least divided by a curtain, the Taliban's education authority has said. They must also wear an abaya robe and niqab. The women, who organisers said were students, listened to a series of speeches at Shaheed Rabbani Education University in the capital, Kabul. Large Taliban flags flanked the podium, as the female speakers criticised women who have protested across Afghanistan in recent days. They also defended the new government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which has banned demonstrations unless permission is granted by the justice ministry. Daud Haqqani, director of foreign relations at the education ministry, said the protest was organised by the women, who had asked and been granted permission to demonstrate. "We are against those women who are protesting on the streets, claiming they are representative of women," said the first speaker, covered head to toe. "Is it freedom to like the last government? No, it is not freedom. The last government were misusing women. They were recruiting women just by their beauty," she claimed. Some in the audience held babies, who occasionally cried during the speeches, while others were young girls clearly too young for university. A student named Shabana Omari told the crowd she agreed with the Taliban's policy that women should cover their heads. "Those not wearing the hijab are harming all of us," she said, referring to the headscarves worn by many Muslim women. "The hijab is not an individual thing." Omari concluded her speech by leading a chorus of "Allahu Akbar", or "God is greatest". Another speaker, Somaiya, said history had changed since the Taliban came back. "After this we will not see 'bihijabi' (people not wearing headscarves)," she said. "Women will be safe after this. We are supporting our government with all our strength." After the speeches in the meeting hall, the women walked in organised lines a short distance on the street outside, holding printed banners and flanked by Taliban soldiers carrying rifles and machine guns. The public demonstration was in stark contrast with scenes in Kabul and elsewhere earlier in the week, when Taliban fighters fired into the air to disperse a number of protests against their rule, shooting two people dead. "Women who left Afghanistan cannot represent us," one pro-Taliban banner on Saturday read. "We are satisfied with attitude and behaviour of Mujahideens (Taliban)" read another. The Taliban say they want to distance themselves from the harsher policies of old, when half the population was excluded from work and education. Under new rules, women may work "in accordance with the principles of Islam", the Taliban have decreed, but few details have yet been given as to what that exactly might mean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/veiled-protest-afghan-women-rally-in-support-of-the-taliban/articleshow/86131837.cms||---

Great effort, powered by a collective spirit and the prowess of our doctors as well as innovators,” the PM tweeted. Goa is the second state, after Himachal Pradesh, to have administered the first jab to 100% of the population aged 18 and above. “I congratulate our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers for administering the first dose of #COVID19 vaccines to 100% eligible population in Goa. I thank the people of Goa for their support in making this drive a huge success,” tweeted chief minister Pramod Sawant . “On behalf of the people of Goa, I thank the union govt led by Hon’ble PM Shri @narendramodi ji for providing free vaccination to all persons above 18, and a seamless supply of doses to fight this pandemic. We shall continue to march ahead with same energy to ensure that we also complete the second dose,” the CM said in his tweet. Sawant has set October 31 as the target for Goa to complete second dose of vaccine. Meanwhile, BJP national president JP Nadda, Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, Union health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya and Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur also showered praises on Sawant for the feat. “Another milestone in vaccination! Under the guidance of Hon PM @narendramodi Ji, Goa has administered the first vaccine dose to 100% of the adult population. I express my gratitude to the public of Goa, CM @DrPramodPSawant Ji & all medical fraternity for the success of this drive,” Nadda tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pm-lauds-goa-for-100-first-dose-covid-vax-coverage/articleshow/86127911.cms||---

---||Goa||Yet another lie, says Cong to CM’s 100% vaccination claim||Panaji: A day after chief minister Pramod Sawant claimed that every eligible person in Goa has received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, Congress accused him of lying, and said that BJP seems to be in a hurry to declare Goa a green zone, and is ready to lie in order to do so. Congress also asked PM Narendra Modi and Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to verify facts before making “tall claims” about Goa. It said that many eligible persons in Goa are yet to receive their first dose. “The BJP government has tried to mislead and misguide the people with false claims of achievement, when the ground realities are in sharp contrast,” said opposition leader Digambar Kamat. “The recent claim by Sawant of 100% Covid vaccination to the eligible population is one more lie added to the pack of lies of the BJP government.” On Friday, after Sawant’s claim, Modi hailed Goa for administering the first dose of the vaccine to all of the eligible population in the state. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that BJP is spreading lies and trying to fool the people. “The pathological liar Narendra Modi has congratulated certified liar Pramod Sawant on 100% Covid vaccination to the eligible population in Goa. This is another blatant lie of the BJP government, which keeps fooling the people with jumlas,” he said. Kamat said that the “insensitive BJP” had earlier declared Goa as open defecation-free, and had also claimed 100% piped water and also no deaths due to the oxygen shortage, all of which proved to be false. “I urge Mandaviya to verify facts and figures before making any tall claims. I want to remind (him) as well as the CM that the over-excitement of the BJP government to declare Goa as a green zone had resulted in Covid havoc in Goa,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-another-lie-says-cong-to-cms-100-vaccination-claim/articleshow/86128158.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Prayer meeting disrupted; locals allege conversion||UDUPI: A group allegedly belonging to the Hindu Jagarana Vedike barged into a prayer meeting hall at Kukkundoor in Karkala on Friday and alleged that the organisers were engaged in religious conversion. Udupi superintendent of police N Vishnuvardhana told STOI: “A few Christians had gathered for prayer and some men, said to be members of HJV, and a few residents of Kukkundoor objected to conversion allegedly happening there. The Karkala sub-inspector rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowd.” Vedike: Prayer meet was in violation of Covid normsPastor Benedict filed a complaint that the men created a ruckus and abused him. Another FIR was registered after a person complained of alleged conversion. Probe is on and witnesses’ statements are being recorded,” the SP said.  Prashanth Jathana, president, Indian Christian Federation, said, “When 30 persons were at prayer, 20 men entered the hall and made allegations about religious conversion . They dragged a Dalit woman and assaulted her and threatened people there. Nobody at the venue was converted. They were at the prayer meeting of their own volition.” Mahesh Bailur, district general secretary, HJV, said 60 people had gathered in violation of Covid-19 protocols. “For the past two months, we have been following this issue after two youths, Gunesh and Sunil, complained they had been invited for conversion. We went to the hall well prepared and the arguments that followed have been recorded. We did not assault anyone,” he said. A police officer said a month ago, a similar meeting was held at Doopadakatte in Karkala and a case was filed against Pastor Benedict for allegedly converting people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/prayer-meeting-disrupted-locals-allege-conversion/articleshow/86129999.cms||---

Install this app and you will be guided virtually on how to celebrate the festival. Two Barodians — Daxesh Jangid and his friend JIgar Bhatt — have developed a mobile app to guide Ganesha devotees to perform daily rituals after bringing the idol home. “Amid the pandemic, many are not willing to call the pandit for installing Ganesh idols while many are not able to find one. I decided to develop ‘Sanskriti Live’, the app so that people can perform their own puja and rituals,” said 27-year-old Jangid, a resident of Tarsali who developed the app along with his friend Jigar Bhatt. He added that they have included the history of Ganesha Chaturthi celebrations and all the important information on the lord. “We will add more features to this app by next Ganesha Chaturthi,” Jangid said. He added that he has done a diploma in electronics and communication but he was drawn towards arts. “I began making clay idols of Ganesha and also started painting.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Priyanka Tibrewal visits Kalighat temple, BJP plans to reach out to every family||KOLKATA: BJP Bhowanipore candidate Priyanka Tibrewal is not banking solely on the ‘Modi-versus-Didi’ narrative that the party had tried in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls. As a “crusader for democracy”, Tibrewal says she has a story to tell. “I am not into the fray to become an MLA. My battle is to protect people. I have come here to take maayer ashirbad (Goddess Kali’s blessings) as people do before beginning work,” Tibrewal said after offering prayers at Kalighat temple on Saturday. The BJP candidate took up the cause of post-poll violence victims in the Calcutta High Court that later ordered a CBI probe and set up a Special Investigating Team (SIT) to investigate complaints. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Saturday said: “We have won the legal battle. We will also win the electoral battle.” Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said at East Midnapore’s Tamluk: “Bhowanipore voters have to decide which way they will vote. Will they vote for the ones who rendered people homeless or for those who stood by the homeless?” Tibrewal went to Kalighat accompanied by actor-turned-politician Rudranil Ghosh, the former BJP candidate from Bhowanipore, sending out a message to party ranks in the constituency. “We will reach out to each and every family,” Ghosh said. Political observers see Tibrewal’s Kalighat visit as a bid to break the perception that the BJP was still a party of the Gujaratis, the Marwaris and Hindi-speaking people in cosmopolitan Bhowanipore because the constituency has a sizable Bengalispeaking population. For mer Tripura gover nor and Bengal BJP president Tathagata Roy, who didn’t even spare criticizing state leaders, blessed Tibrewal and wished her victory. Former Union minister Babul Supriyo, who has distanced himself from party politics and didn’t like the way his name was included in the list of 20 “star campaigners” without taking his consent, also had his good wishes for Tibrewal. Ghosh also harped on lowkey but intensive door-to-door campaigns and para meetings instead of high-voltage rallies. “Our leaders are already having meetings with party workers at the mandals, booths and shakti kendras. They will fight the elections. We will help them. Our MLAs and MPs will hold small para-based meetings,” Ghosh said with focus on reaching out to voters unlike in the assembly polls when BJP seniors and Union ministers wanted to “overawe” voters with their presence. Ghosh left it to party seniors over Supriyo’s decision to stay away from the campaign. “Party leaders in Delhi had asked for 20 names as campaigners. The reason is that the expenses of these campaigners will be borne by the party and will not reflect in the candidate’s election expenses. Supriyo’s name was on the list. Somebody may have problems,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tibrewal-visits-kalighat-temple-bjp-plans-to-reach-out-to-every-family/articleshow/86128555.cms||---

He has been asked to appear before the agency in New Delhi on September 21. Banerjee had appeared before the ED once on September 6. He was questioned for nearly eight hours. His wife Rujira too was summoned, but she had expressed her inability to do so keeping the safety of her children in mind. The agency had asked the MP to appear for a second time on Wednesday, but he had said he was not ready with documents and sought more time. Hence, the fresh summons were issued on Saturday. The ED may issue fresh summons to Rujira too, sources said. Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said: “We don’t have anything more to add to what Banerjee has already said. He minced no words to say that he is being victimised after the Trinamool started to gain ground in states like Tripura. Such efforts will never be fruitful because people have seen the BJP’s misrule.” Banerjee had earlier said party workers would not sell themselves to autocrats who could not defeat them politically.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-summons-abhishek-in-coal-case-on-september-21/articleshow/86128459.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||‘Tree felling’ cry at Buxa amid tiger relocation plan||Kolkata: Reports of rampant tree felling inside Buxa Tiger Reserve (BTR) in north Bengal — the only other big cat park in the state apart from the Sunderbans in south Bengal — may mar an ambitious project to augment tiger presence. While a senior forest official said the reports were most likely old because the department has been cracking down on the axe brigade and even conducting raids at sawmills in the vicinity for a year and a half, a local NGO has shared what it claims to be “recent photographs from people who have been there”. Amal Dutta of Alipurduar Nature Club said he had received from his sources some photographs that were taken between “a couple of weeks and two months”. The pictures shared with TOI show several trees — including sal and teak — being felled inside forest areas. “There are reports of illegal felling in compartment 5 and 9 of Jayanti and Kumargram’s Chengmari area. There are reports of tree felling in Sankosh too,” Dutta said. After seeing some of these photographs, BTR field director B R Sewa said: “We will definitely look into the matter. But, in the past one-two year/s, there has been a major crackdown on illegal tree felling. We even conducted raids in nearby tea gardens to nab culprits. From the photographs it is not clear that the sites are really at Buxa. These pictures can be taken anywhere in north Bengal. Besides, the vegetation of Jayanti is different.” Dutta, however, said the photographs were likely genuine and showed poor management of the tiger reserve. “Let alone a tiger reintroduction plan; if trees are felled like this, it will impact the habitat of herbivores and affect the population of elephants and the Indian bison. Why can’t the BTR authorities install camera traps at locations from where tree felling has been reported?” he said. Nabyendu Kar, the chairman of Alipurduar District Citizen and Forest Villager Welfare Foundation, said the forest was under pressure. “There are 52 forest villages in Buxa. You can imagine the pressure on the forest. Villagers with no proper source of livelihood are forced to venture into the woods,” he added. A year-long estimation process carried out in 2018-19 and compiled by the National Tiger Conservation Authority did not register any presence of the big cat in Buxa. Earlier, in November 2016, the Centre had cleared a tiger relocation plan for the reserve, which had not witnessed a sighting in two decades. There were indications that at least one male and two breeding females would be brought to BTR from any northeast national park that has a surplus big cat population. Sewa said work was going on in full-swing to improve the habitat and prey base at the reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tree-felling-cry-at-buxa-amid-tiger-relocation-plan/articleshow/86128561.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The maximum temperature was recorded at 27 degrees, seven notches below the normal. Unlike neighbouring Delhi, there were no reports of waterlogging till Saturday afternoon. Some low-lying areas, including Narsinghpur, Rajeev Chowk, Jwala Mill, Sheetala Mata road, Sector 9 and 9A, however, witnessed some waterlogging during the evening. All the arterial roads, national highways, underpasses remain largely unaffected and no major disruption in traffic movement was reported in Gurgaon due to rainfall. In Delhi, intense waterlogging was reported from RK Puram, Rajpath, Outer Ring Road, Moti Bagh, Dwarka, Aurobindo Marg, Tis Hazari Courts, Madhu Vihar and the underpasses at Rani Khera, Pul Prahladpur and the area near Indira Gandhi International Airport. “The intensity of the rain was low and intermittent due to which water receded quickly. Our team was on the ground and no major waterlogging has been reported, except at a few low-lying areas in the evening when the rain picked up,” an official of GMDA said. Gurgaon has been witnessing overnight intermittent rain with a couple of moderate spells since Friday night which continued throughout Saturday. According to the IMD observatory, the city has recorded 38.4 mm rainfall in the last 33 hours. The data from the revenue department shows that Manesar received the highest rain with 60 mm of rainfall during the day, following Badshapur (50), Sohna (44), Pataudi (41), Kadipur and Harsaru (41 each), Farukkhnagar (34) and Wazirabad (30). According to the IMD, more rainfall is in store as the monsoon is active in the region for the next 4-5 days. The IMD has issued an orange alert for Sunday predicting moderate rain and thundershowers. Good rainfall activity has been witnessed since the beginning of September. To date, Gurgaon has received surplus rainfall of 209%, recording 164.9 mm of rain as against the normal of 53.4 mm. The district has received a cumulative rainfall of 675.6 mm so far as compared to the normal of 468.2 mm, which is an excess of 44%, the second-highest in the state after Sonepat (754 mm). “This year, monsoon has been normal in the state with most of the districts have received excess or normal rainfall except a few. Monsoon has been active over the state and the condition is likely to prevail in the next few days,” an IMD official said. Meanwhile, the air quality index in the city improved slightly but remained in a satisfactory level. The AQI was recorded at 51 on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/overnight-rain-in-gurgaon-temperature-drops-marginally/articleshow/86128608.cms||Akanksha Gupta
---||Kolkata||Post-poll violence: CBI files 4th charge sheet||Nadia: The CBI on Friday submitted a charge sheet in the alleged murder of BJP worker Palash Mandal in Nadia district. This is the fourth charge sheet filed by the central agency since Calcutta High Court asked it to probe allegations of post-poll violence in Bengal. Mandal was allegedly dragged out of his Kotwali residence in Krishnanagar and hacked to death on June 14. A CBI team had, on August 28, visited his house and spoken to his family members. According to sources, the agency has named 15 persons in the charge sheet and 12 of them have already been arrested by police. “Those named accused in the case are yet to be proven guilty. The CBI will place its findings before court, which will give the judgment,” said Ujjal Biswas, state correctional home minister. Mandal’s wife Shefali said: “I heard three more persons have been accused by the CBI. I want exemplary punishment for all of them.” Nadia BJP secretary Nabin Chakraborty said 16-17 people were present when Mandal was killed. “The agency must arrest all. Some of the accused are yet to be named by police and CBI,” he added. In another development, the CBI on Saturday questioned Ratna Sarkar, the investigating officer in the murder of Narkeldanga BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar. She was quizzed for nearly an hour at the agency’s CGO complex office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-poll-violence-cbi-files-4th-charge-sheet/articleshow/86128515.cms||Ashis Poddar
---||Kolkata||The Change Agents||You see things; and you say, ‘Why?’ But I dream things that never were; and I say, ‘Why not?’ — George Bernard Shaw Bengal’s entrepreneurial ecosystem is thriving, thanks to these ambitious dreams and untamed spirits. From tech support to farming and online education to niche travel and interior designing, these go-getters have business solutions in place in consonance with the changing times. Aunkita Nandi was born and brought up in a middle-class family in Burdwan, her father a government employee and mother a homemaker. But, since childhood, Nandi was focused on starting her own company, one that would be able to generate employment. A software engineer, she went on to develop applications on her own and finally realised her dream in 2015 with Tier 5. Today, Nandi’s startup on software development is valued at a staggering 12 million dollars, employs around 100 people and has 15,000 customers globally. “Tier 5 is specialized in making innovative and user-friendly products that enable business owners to grow their operations and attain more customers. Though we have an office in Kolkata, the headquarters is in the US. We have designed over 21 products while eight more are in the offing,” said Nandi, the managing director. Sparing a thought for the well-being of farmers, Shashank Kumar and Amrendra Singh founded agri-tech startup DeHaat in 2012. Farmers can sign up through an app or call for consultancy related to cultivation, seeds, fertilizer purchase and, most importantly, sale of crops. “At present, there are 85 DeHaat centres in Nadia, Hooghly and Murshidabad. We are trying to create more opportunities for Bengal farmers through our support. We have also set up warehouses to address storage problems and reached out to over 10,000 peasants. We plan to add 1,000 micro-entrepreneurs to our network in the current financial year,” Kumar said. Asked about his plans outside Bengal, Kumar added: “We are also assisting farmers in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. We target to reach out to five million farmers across the country by the end of 2024.” A group of tourism experts from the city recently launched the digital-age travel startup TravelLive. Pinaki Mitra, a founder of the startup, said: “Being travel operators, we have covered 60 countries and our startup will help people explore new places on an affordable budget. We plan to stream live videos during trips abroad. One can hop on to the OTT platform and be live with the group — be it a splendid Paris from the top of Eiffel Tower or wildlife migration in Masai Mara or the Machu Picchu site of Inca Civilisation in Peru. We have done extensive research on travellers’ choices post-pandemic in designing our tours for the next six to eight months.” The journey of Ark & Arts, an interior design consultancy startup, began in 2011. Founder and principal designer Ankita Baid said they worked both in commercial and residential segments on traditional and modern designs as per a client’s style and needs. “Whether it is a modest family home or Rajbari, a small business office or a grand resort, our team can implement a beautiful design transformation. We make imaginative and thoughtful space planning in keeping with the taste of our clients,” said Baid. For mutual fund investors in the city, the initial pandemic blues was followed by a significant recovery afterwards. This acted as a catalyst for online education and fin-tech platforms, Elearnmarkets and StockEdge, run by startup Kredent Infoedge on the concept of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”. Vineet Patawari, its co-founder and CEO, said: “Financial markets are witnessing a dramatic shift from a traditional commission-driven model to a digital platform. The emergence of direct equity as an asset class has been augmented by the pandemic with over 1.5 crore new investors added in the country in the past 15 months.” Then there are lending startups like mPokket, which are finding a silver lining in business amid the pandemic. “Under the present circumstances, people often need small-ticket loans for emergencies. Banks don’t offer such loans as they have a high cost of acquisition and servicing. It is through our instant loan app that we lend money to college students and young professionals and the loans range from Rs 500 to Rs 30,000.

But there’s one crucial change, thematically: last year, the focus was disease and infection; this year, it’s ways to emerge from the pandemic, in keeping with the global scenario. “If 2020 was about Covid-19 infection, 2021 is all about vaccination, the only weapon against the disease. So, this year, we are attempting to propagate the importance of vaccination from our Puja premises,” says Ashok Ojha, joint secretary, Md Ali Park Durga Puja Committee. While the central Kolkata puja would be themed around a Covid vaccination centre, another Puja organiser — Baghajatin Vivekananda Milan Sangha in south Kolkata — is focusing on mental anxiety triggered by lockdowns and restrictions, and ways to overcome it. Yet another Puja in Kasba is modelling the Asura idol and decor around Covid, with multiple guidelines to beat the disease. Several clubs have even employed artisans and performers who have been badly hit by the pandemic to showcase their talent on their premises and donating the lion’s share of the subscription proceeds to them. “The pandemic has had an impact on mental health. Our pandal will focus on the issue of depression,” says Apu Saha, secretary of the Puja committee. “There will be artefacts and art forms showcasing medication and other ways of recovery from depression.” Highlighting the issue of learning hurdles for kids, with schools being closed for the pandemic, Uttar Kolkata Sanhati in Maniktala is decking their pandal with imageries of kids stuck home, with minimal human interaction and restricted to online learning via laptops and mobiles. Meanwhile, stressing on the importance of wearing masks and maintaining distancing, the idol at Baguiati’s Ashwininagar Bandhu Mahal Club will be wearing a golden mask, even as the pandal itself would be done up with Covid guidelines and instructions. Similar messages will be aired by Rabindra Memorial Sporting Club in Kasba, where the Asura’s head is being shaped in the form of the Delta variant of the virus, and the pandal will carry reminders on Covid-appropriate behaviour. “This is the first time we are experimenting with the idols,” says Arnab Chowdhury, the Puja committee secretary. “While sticking to all Covid-related guidelines, we want to send out a message that the Covid demon can be slayed if we maintain basic rules of masking, sanitisation, physical distancing and making sure we get vaccinated.” There are also committees like Janakalyan Sangha in Beleghata and 75 Pally in Bhowanipore, who are dedicating this Puja to wooden doll-makers in East Burdwan and Chhau artists in Purulia, donating a major share of the subscription and the state’s dole to them, along with making their premises available for them to perform and sell their goods. While the former committee will support 50-odd families of wooden doll-makers at Natungram in East Burdwan, the latter will support a number of Chhau performers from their premises. “Performers like them are the biggest victims of the Covid pandemic, and we are dedicating this year’s Puja to them,” says Subir Das, secretary, 75 Pally. “We are staying away from all glitz, preferring to donate the money to performers and present their families with new clothes and also allow them to sell their goods from our premises.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pujacovid-2-0-durga-set-to-slay-virus-asura-this-yr/articleshow/86129257.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||‘Lieutenant’ Hakim in Chetla to garner support for Didi||Kolkata: A day after Madan Mitra’s “colourful” campaign for chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Bhowanipore, her “able lieutenant” Firhad Hakim on Saturday did the rounds of the Chetla backyard where he is a ward coordinator. For the ruling Trinamool Congress the outcome of the Bhowanipore by-election is a given when “gharer meye Mamata” is in the fray with active support from her 213 MLAs and also four defectors from the BJP. The challenge, however, is scripting a victory by a “record margin”, way more than the lead of 28,000 votes that Trinamool senior Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay took during the Bengal assembly polls. He had resigned after his win to make room for Banerjee in her home constituency and ensure that she continued as the chief minister. Hakim, the state’s transport minister, began his campaign trail from Rakhal Das Auddy Road in Chetla, an area he knows like the back of his hand. Yet, the Trinamool leader didn’t leave anything to chance. He went door to door in ward 82, a Trinamool bastion where the minister is seen as the “boy next door”. A known face in the neighbourhood, Hakim exchanged pleasantries with the elderly and even walked straight into the living rooms of many voters, seeking unwavering support for Banerjee during the bypoll on September 30. Mousumi Da, a resident of Rakhal Das Auddy Road, wondered why the minister was reaching out to the electorate when he was “the guardian of voters” in several parts of Chetla. But, a veteran like Hakim knows voters must never be taken for granted. A local Trinamool leader pointed out that CM Banerjee had adopted the same strategy to “spring a surprise” in 1984 during the Jadavpur Lok Sabha elections, when she defeated CPM heavyweight Somnath Chatterjee. The state transport minister has been working overtime to avenge the Nandigram defeat. “Bhowanipore voters will reward Mamata Banerjee with an emphatic victory this time. She will increase her lead manifold. People here will give the BJP a befitting reply,” Hakim said. In 2011, Banerjee won from Bhowanipore by more than 50,000 votes. The bypoll back then was held after she came to power defeating the Left Front. The target this time is to surpass that margin, a Trinamool leader said. The other target is to get a lead in all the wards under Bhowanipore constituency, including cosmopolitan ones such as 70 and 74, where the Trinamool had trailed during the assembly elections earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lieutenant-hakim-in-chetla-to-garner-support-for-didi/articleshow/86128617.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Raped & brutalised in Mumbai's Andheri, woman dies; accused arrested||MUMBAI: A 32-year-old pavement dweller died on Saturday, almost 36 hours after being brutally sexually assaulted with a sharp object inside a parked tempo at Saki Naka early on Friday that left her with serious lacerations to her private parts. The 45-year old accused, a part-time driver who is also a pavement dweller, was tracked to Kurla late on Friday with the help of CCTV cameras and arrested. “The woman had suffered severe injuries in her perineal area (the area between the thighs) and some of her organs, including intestines, were spilling out when she was brought to the hospital,” said a senior doctor. The woman, assaulted outside Rashid Compound, was on ventilator at Rajawadi Hospital for roughly 28 hours before her death around 11.30am on Saturday. On learning of the crime, CM Uddhav Thackeray called an urgent meeting of senior IPS officers and said the case will be tried in a fast-track court. He directed the police to file a chargesheet in a month. “Police have been asked to be more vigilant and take steps to ensure that Mumbai’s image as a safe city is not tarnished,” said a senior police official. Around 3.15am on Friday, a security guard at Rashid Compound near Chandivli Studio had called the police control saying a woman was being assaulted inside a parked tempo; all tempos parked outside belong to Rashid Compound. A Saki Naka police team reached the location within 10 minutes and found the injured woman. The accused, who is from UP, had fled by then. “Wasting no time, a police constable and other cops got the tempo's ignition key from the security guard and drove the victim to the hospital,” said DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. “The motive behind the crime is not yet known and the accused has not revealed the reason. The CCTV footage showed him fleeing but we did not see him carrying any weapon used in the crime. The victim has suffered severe injuries and lost her life due to excess bleeding,” said a police officer. Till late on Saturday, it was still unclear if the police had recovered the sharp object used in the assault. She was brought to the hospital in a serious condition and a five-member team of gynaecologists and surgeons operated on her on Friday. She never regained consciousness, though, to be able to talk to the doctors or the police. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent, Rajawadi Hospital, said the woman was brought in, in a critical condition. “We don’t know how the injuries were caused or if she was sexually assaulted. Forensic tests and police investigation should reveal that,” she said. Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale said a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed which will be led by ACP Jyotsana Rasam. The accused has been remanded to police custody till September 21. “The investigation will be completed in a month. Initially, it was suspected more persons may have been involved but the arrest of the accused has cleared that,” said Nagrale. “There are QR codes placed in the jurisdiction of all police stations and whenever police personnel are deployed on night patrol, they have to scan the code to show they have completed patrolling the locality. As part of the investigation, we will check whether police patrolling was conducted in that locality. But the incident occurred in little time and we have to verify whether the team had patrolled the area before it happened,” he said. “The accused has been booked under Indian Penal Code sections for murder, rape, unnatural offence and sexual harassment,” said a Saki Naka police officer. On Saturday, he was produced before the Andheri court and remanded in police custody till September 21. Police said the victim, married and separated twice, did odd jobs for a living. She had two daughters from her first marriage and a son from the second. She did not have a good equation with her family. She, though, briefly met her mother and neighbours known to her since childhood on Thursday around 7pm, hours before her death. A relative told TOI: “She had no bad habits. She was upset ever since her (second) husband left. Her daughters live with her physically diabled mother and son with estranged husband. The person who killed her was never seen by any of us. Her mother is in shock. Her younger sister visited the hospital and completed the formalities.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)(With Malathy Iyer & Bhavika Jain)Watch 32-year-old brutally raped with iron rod in Mumbai, dies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/raped-brutalised-in-mumbais-andheri-woman-dies-accused-arrested/articleshow/86131962.cms||V Narayan

He is likely to explain to her that this is not the first time political personalities have been nominated as MLCs under the governor quota and got clearances from her predecessors. Sources in the government said KCR did not want any rift with the governor on the issue. “The governor also categorically stated during her interaction with the media that she had good relations with the CM. She only said she will scrutinise whether Kaushik Reddy’s nomination comes under social service quota or not,” a senior CMO official recalled. Officials said the CM is planning to meet her not only on Kaushik Reddy’s issue but for other reasons too. KCR could not meet the governor personally to convey his condolences after her mother passed away on August 18. Though he tried to call on her, the governor had been shuttling between Hyderabad and Puducherry as she also holds additional charge as lieutenant governor of the Union territory. Official sources said the CM wanted to meet Tamilisai Soundararajan after he returned from Delhi on Thursday (September 9). But the governor left for Puducherry as the assembly is in session in that state. After taking over as lieutenant governor of Puducherry, she has been staying three to four days in the Union territory and three days in Hyderabad. She is expected to come back to Hyderabad in the middle of next week. “It is a general practice when CM goes to Delhi and meets PM and other important personalities at the Centre, he apprises the governor on the developments and issues. In this case, KCR would likely to meet her. When ESL Narasimhan was governor, the CM had followed the same convention,” sources in the CMO said. Meanwhile, the CM might also convey the state government’s intention to hold an assembly session after Ganesh immersion and request her to issue the formal notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-cm-k-chandrasekhar-rao-may-meet-governor-tamilisai-soundararajan-push-trs-leader-p-kaushik-reddys-case/articleshow/86132027.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||In 32-day trial, man gets 1 year for molesting Mumbai banker||MUMBAI: In a speedy trial that took 32 days and just over four court dates, the Esplanade magistrate’s court convicted and sentenced a 27-year old man to one year of rigorous imprisonment for molesting a city banker who was about to enter her workplace near Fort in May. The court said the fact that the key eyewitness happened to be a colleague who came forward to help her and caught the molester did not mean he was not an independent witness. The woman said that despite her screams, none of the passersby came to her rescue. “The incident occurred at 1.45pm and though there were many passersby, the informant (woman) has specifically stated that no one came to rescue her. In such circumstances, it is difficult for the investigating officer to ascertain who was present... at the time. Even otherwise, it has become a common tendency that passersby try to dissociate themselves from the incident,” the court said. It refused to let the accused get off on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act. “It is true that the accused is not a habitual offender...However, offences against women are on the rise and concern is being raised on various occasions at various levels and giving him benefit of Probation of Offenders Act may send wrong signals in the society,” the court said. The incident took place on May 12. The trial commenced on August 3, with the woman, her colleague and a police officer deposing. The court pronounced the verdict on September 2. The court refuted the defence contention the statements of the woman and her colleague were not enough to find the accused guilty. “Often such incidents happen in isolated places where the victim is alone. Therefore, expecting eyewitnesses to such an incident would be unjustifiable,” metropolitan magistrate Hemant U Joshi said.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: After online preparation, 1.1L appear for NEET today||CHENNAI: Aspirants writing the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) 2021 on Sunday are a wary lot as most of the coaching they got was online. Experts say many students miss the face-to-face coaching and peer learning and performances could dip this year. Many coaching centres and schools prepared the students one last time by giving them mock tests on Saturday afternoon, which they wrote wearing masks and gloves. Along with their knowledge and skill, Sunday’s exam is likely to test the endurance of students as the first batch will have to enter exam halls by 10.30am for the 2pm start because of Covid protocols. From Tamil Nadu 1,10,971 students are scheduled to appear for the exam at 225 exam centres. In Chennai,17,992 students will appear at 33 exam centres. J S Dharani, a medical aspirant from Ayanavaram, said preparation in online mode was a new experience and difficult. “The coaching institute and school guided us constantly. On a positive note, faculty members were available till 9.30pm to clarify our doubts,” she said. She said the staggered entry timing and wearing masks for four to five hours inside the exam halls will test the endurance of the students. "We have attended mock tests wearing masks and gloves from 2pm to 5pm. I was comfortable for the first hour, but felt uneasy after that," she said. Ebenezer Kirubakaran G, an aspirant from Tambaram, said, remembering the concepts was difficult in online mode preparation. He was doing aerobics and wearing masks at home in the past few weeks to prepare for the exam. He said the introduction of choice will help the students. Now students need answer only 180 of the 200 questions. B Pavan Kumar, deputy director, FIITJEE Chennai, said, lack of peer competition and face-to-face coaching by mentors will impact the performance of mid-level students. P Prameela, academics director, Narayana Educational Institutions, said, this year students got two to three months offline coaching. "We applied the same kind of coaching system and pattern followed offline to online. But, they have to sit before the system for long hours. Students are a bit strained. But, they are acquainted with online coaching and adjusted better," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-after-online-preparation-1-1l-appear-for-neet-today/articleshow/86132088.cms||A Ragu Raman

The bypolls were to be held in six districts for seats originally reserved for the OBC category. On March 4, the SC had upheld OBC quota in elections to local bodies in Maharashtra, subject to a 50% cap for SC/ST/OBC taken together. A day later, the SEC declared bypolls to six zilla parishads and 33 panchayat samitis for seats vacated following the SC order on political reservation for OBCs. On June 22, the SEC announced by-elections in five districts—Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur—as they were in level 1 of the curbs, but not for Palghar which was in level 3. In July, when the state moved the SC citing the pandemic and seeking orders for postponement of the by-polls by six months, the SC had asked SEC to take a call considering the disaster management authority notifications and factoring in the pandemic conditions. The government, had on August 11, relaxed lockdownlike curbs in Maharashtra as Covid-19 cases were under control, but maintained a prohibition on elections. The SEC, on September 6, filed a fresh application before the SC in a “compliance report’’ saying it has “partially completed’’ the by-election process it had undertaken. The SEC, through its advocate Ajit Kadethankar, said, “It is only if the state government, on its own, removes restrictions on elections or if the SC directs, the election processes can be completed.’’ The SEC said it was “continuously monitoring” the situation as directed by the SC and “realised that the situation is conducive enough to resume the paused ongoing overdue elections’’. On September 9, the SC heard state counsel Rahul Chitnis, who sought an adjournment, and SEC counsel Kadethankar before declining an adjournment. The SC bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and C T Ravikumar, in its order, said, “In our opinion, there is no need to adjourn the matter as the state has no say in the matter of deciding the publication of dates and election schedule. That is the prerogative of the state election commission.’’ The SC said the state, by its August 11 notification, “cannot constrict the directions given by this court…in respect of constituencies which have become vacant as a consequence of (its) decision’’. It directed that SEC may submit compliance report after 6 weeks and placed the matter next on October 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-says-election-panel-to-decide-on-maharashtra-bypolls/articleshow/86132127.cms||Swati Deshpande

Gunaseelan, 23, who had befriended her first on social media and then visited her often at her workplace, had lured the woman to ride with him saying he would take her to meet someone for a better job. He then gave her a soft drink he had spiked with sedatives and took her to his farm at Melkathipur near Kancheepuram. By then the woman was swooning and her raped her repeatedly in the motorshed. Gunaseelan then called up four of his friends who came in a car. They too took turns raping the woman. As soon as the woman regained consciousness, she screamed out and some villagers gathered there. They saw her semi-naked and two men in a similar state. The villagers tried to rescue the woman, but the suspects managed to flee in the car with the woman. Later, they pushed her out on the Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway near Baluchetty Chatiram and sped away. The survivor went to the Baluchetty Chatiram police station and filed a complaint. She was taken to the Kancheepuram government hospital where superintendent of police (SP) M Sudhakar arrived and conducted an inquiry. Special teams soon nabbed the accused men. Police identified them as Gunasekaran, 24, of Nakheeran Street in Orikkai, Gunaseelan of Vaniyar Street in Periya Kancheepuram, Ajith Kumar, 23, of Kachabeshwarar Mada Street, and Jebanesan, 29, of Periya Kancheepuram. The fifth man, Kamaraj, 23, of Kamaraj Street in Kancheepuram, was arrested from Salem late on Friday. The car was also seized from him. Police said Gunaseelan had introduced himself as a businessman and realtor to the woman. On one of his visits to her workplace, the woman asked Gunaseelan if he could help her find a betterpaying job. He promised and on Thursday evening picked her up at her workplace and they set off on his two-wheeler. Police said he had planned the whole thing as he had bought sedatives and mixed it in a soft drink.

The parents had filed a complaint at Shivaji Nagar police station after the boy did not return home from a tuition class he attended in his building complex. Even as police began probing the case, the boy’s uncle received a VoIP call on Friday evening from an unknown person demanding the ransom. Meanwhile, the crime branch team scanned the CCTV footage of the building, in which they spotted four men moving around suspiciously 3-4 three to four days before the kidnapping. The boy’s father identified the men as employees of a sweet shop in the area and said he has known them for 15 years. On Saturday afternoon, police raided the residence of one of the kidnappers, Amjad Khan, in Ambernath and rescued the child. After learning that two of the other accused were trying to flee towards Igatpuri, police alerted their Thane rural and Nashik counterparts and managed to nab them. The other kidnappers have been identified as Chotu Singh, Yogendra Singh and Sunil Lad, aged between 30 and 40. Lad was the last to be nabbed. Ashok Morale, additional commissioner of police (crime), who led the probe, said, “Our teams, along with the city police, have successfully nabbed the kidnappers. So far, the probe has revealed the child was kidnapped for ransom.” Laxmikant Patil, deputy commissioner of crime branch, Thane, said the accused were not educated, but had learnt to make VoIP calls on social media due to which police faced difficulty in tracing the call locations. He further said the probe had revealed the kidnappers had moved the child to three of their homes to avoid getting caught. But when Chotu and Yogendra learned of Khan’s arrest, they began to flee towards their hometown in Uttar Pradesh. His child back home, the father told TOI, “I am very happy that the police safely rescued my child. I never thought the accused would commit such a heinous crime for money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-9-year-old-kidnapped-for-rs-40-lakh-ransom-rescued/articleshow/86132150.cms||Pradeep Gupta

In his address at the foundation-laying of the NLU by President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday, CM Yogi recalled Dr Rajendra Prasad’s relationship with the city and said, “Dr Rajendra Prasad had a great relationship with Prayagraj and the National Law University at Prayagraj should be dedicated to him.” Dr Rajendra Prasad had done his doctorate in Law from Allahabad University in 1937. The CM lauded the setting up of NLU at Prayagraj saying the city is a centre of spiritualism, justice and education. “It is heartening to note that the Chief Justice of India will be the ‘Visitor’ of the law university. The NLU at Prayagraj will emerge as a good centre of research,” the CM said. “The High Court of Allahabad is the largest high court in Asia which is serving justice to 24 crore people of the state,” he added. The previous state governments never even thought of fulfilling people’s demand for construction of parking in the High Court as well as Law University, he said. “People of the state had to wait for so long to see the foundation stone of these projects being laid. Today, under the guidance of PM Narendra Modi, our government is making all efforts to bring happiness in the lives of the people and provide them justice,” added Yogi. Referring to the importance of technology and digitization, the CM said, “Today’s era is the digital era. We all have realised its importance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has sanctioned Rs 70 crore for digitization in subordinate courts, Rs 30 crore for purchase of computers for the High Court, Rs 20 crore for computers in subordinate courts and Rs 18 crore for buying laptops for the judicial officers.” The state government had taken big initiatives for infrastructure development in Prayagraj at the time of Kumbh and received full cooperation from the court. The new complex of Allahabad High Court will have a multi-level parking that can park over 4,000 vehicles and around 2,600 chambers for the lawyers besides a state-ofthe-art library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/national-law-university-in-prayagraj-to-be-named-after-dr-rajendra-prasad-says-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/86132156.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Preparations on for school reopening, says minister V Sivankutty||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has given in-principle nod to the officials concerned to prepare plans for the reopening of schools in the state. The final decision on the school reopening would be based on the Supreme Court verdict on Plus One examination, general education minister V Sivankutty said on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, requesting permission to conduct the Plus One examination in the conventional, offline, mode. The government pointed out the unavailability of computers and internet facilities for all students as the major reason for dropping the idea of online examination for Plus One students. The state also rejected the possibility of conducting the evaluation of students based on the marks they obtained in the model tests. The apex court had on September 4 stayed the government decision to conduct the Plus One examination in the conventional mode, despite the steep rise in the number of Covid cases and amid concerns for the safety of students. The court has slammed the state government for not considering the safety of students at the thick of the pandemic crisis. The examination was set to start on September 6 and last till September 27. Over three lakh students are supposed to attend the Plus One examination. Since the result of the Plus One examination has no academic sanctity for the two-year course, the government had invited widespread criticism from students, parents and a section of teachers for insisting on the offline examination, risking the health of unvaccinated children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-preparations-on-for-school-reopening-says-minister-v-sivankutty/articleshow/86132191.cms||---

The state has been getting enough dose of the vaccine from the centre,” he told reporters after inspecting the Perumbakkam primary health centre. On Saturday, the state vaccinated 1.5 lakh people. “We urge all people to take the vaccine on time as it is one of the best tools to prevent disease and death,” he added. Those taking the vaccine on Saturday must carry valid central government recognised IDs to the centre. Those with fever and symptoms of flu will not be permitted to attend the camp. So far, at least 46 of the eligible adults in the state have taken at least one dose of the vaccine, while 12% of them have completed the course. Nevertheless, the coverage is not uniform across all districts. Although Chennai has given the more than 43 lakh doses — the maximum number of doses among all districts, the city has vaccinated only a little more than half of its eligible population with the first dose, compared to Nilgiris, which has vaccinated more than 71% of its adults. “We have priority to the district because it is a hard-to-reach terrain and has a high number of tourists,” said DPH Dr TS Selvavinayagam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/over-27l-doses-sent-across-tamil-nadu-for-mega-vaccination-drive-today/articleshow/86136207.cms||---

Although the woman in the car made it to the hospital, she soon died of a cardiac arrest. The deceased were identified as Subaida Kunjumuhammad (49) and Neseema Yousuf (48) of Kizhakkambalam who were on a morning walk. The woman in the car was identified as Dr Swapna (50) of Pookkattupady. According to police, the accident happened at Shappumpady in Pazhanganad in Ernakulam at around 6.15am on Saturday. The woman reportedly felt uneasiness and chest pain at her home and the husband was rushing her to a private hospital here when the accident happened. “There is a dangerous curve here and a property by the road is protruding into the road due to some land acquisition issues. The husband was obviously in a rush due to the hospital emergency. The vehicle seems to have gone into the right lane when he was taking the steep turn and rammed into the group of four women. It seems like the visibility was low as well. The driver also claims that a bike came to the spot at the time,” said a source. The driver of the car reportedly did not stop after the accident. However, on reaching the hospital he informed the hospital about the accident. Local residents meanwhile rushed the others to the hospital. Subaida, police said, died on the spot while Neseema succumbed to injuries at the hospital. Sources said that the condition of the other two injured women was not serious and they were referred to a city hospital. Thadiyittaparambu police have registered a case under Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC. All the four women who met with the accident were from ward 16 of Kizhakkambalam panchayat and were friends. They had been going for a walk together for a while, sources said. Inquest proceedings were completed on Sunday and the bodies were moved to Kalamasserry Government Medical College for post-mortem. Kunnathuanad MLA PV Sreenijin visited the accident spot later in the day and held discussions with the owner of the property adjacent to the deadly curve. Later, a portion of the boundary wall next to the curve was demolished in the evening so as to decrease the curvature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-car-rushing-woman-to-hospital-knocks-down-four-women-in-pazhanganad/articleshow/86132294.cms||---

The crash also left three women occupants of the Ertiga seriously injured, police said. The accident occurred around 4am when Hathras resident Naeem and his five family members were returning home after attending a family function at a relative’s house in Ghaziabad. He was accompanied by his wife Ruby, sisters-in-law Reena and Muskaan, and his two small children. The family was returning towards their home in the Sikandra Rao area of Hathras when one of the tyres of their Ertiga got punctured near Galgotias University along the Yamuna Expressway. The car was being driven by their driver, Farukkh, who too belonged to their village in Sikandra Rao. “Farukkh parked the car and started changing the tyre. After replacing the tyre, Farukkh was keeping the punctured one in the boot of the car when a speedy truck approaching from behind crashed into our Ertiga,” Naeem said. The impact of the crash was such that Farukkh got sandwiched between the two vehicles, resulting in serious injuries in his limbs and head, Naeem said. Ruby, Reena and Muskaan, who were inside the car, too suffered serious injuries. Police were informed and the four were taken to a private hospital in Greater Noida, where Farukkh was declared brought dead. Dankaur police later lodged an FIR against the truck driver who fled the spot. Arvind Pathak, SHO Dankaur, told TOI, “The truck has been seized. An FIR has been lodged in the case under IPC sections 279 (rash driving) and 304a (death due to negligence). The owner is being contacted and the driver will also be traced soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/one-dead-3-hurt-as-truck-hits-ertiga-on-yamuna-eway/articleshow/86128762.cms||---

He had just turned 80, and having cycled 4,500 kms all the way from Thrissur to the rarefied heights of Ladakh, what better way for a man, a plumber by profession and a cyclist by passion, to celebrate his birthday. Josettan, as he is fondly called by his friends and is from Athani in Thrissur, told TOI over phone from Leh that he had cycled to a spot just 34 kms from Khardung La, which is located at 17,600 feet above mean sea level and is the highest motorable point allowed for civilians. He could not proceed further on Saturday from there because of unexpected snowfall . Jose has won accolades for excelling in triathlon competitionsIn this cycle expedition, christened `Wheel of Life’, Jose is accompanied by Gokul P R from Ayyanthole in Thrissur, who, incidentally, had undertaken a cycling trip from Thrissur to Khardung La in 2013 via Manali. Gokul’s wife Dr Lekha Lakshmi and 14-year old daughter joined them from Ladakh, after reaching there by flight. Jose, who retired from the Thrissur Medical College Hospital as a plumber, said he has had no major health issues during his cycling trip. "I encountered an oxygen problem when I reached Leh about nine days ago, but my fellow cyclists supported me by providing artificial supply of oxygen,’’ he said. "Oxygen shortage is a problem commonly encountered by all, including military personnel, on reaching Leh,’’ Dr Lakshmi said. Jose said he started cycling when he was studying in class V. “Cycling is my passion, and I used to cycle for long distances in the past. But this one is obviously the longest cycling trip I’ve undertaken,” he said. He is also a regular participant in swimming and marathon competitions. Jose has won accolades for excelling in triathlon competitions too. Wheel of Life, which was flagged off by former Kerala education minister Prof C Raveendranath from Thrissur on July 15, is being supported all the cycle clubs of Kerala, as well SAI, Thrissur district sports council, Thrissur district Olympic Association, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangatan and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Jose’s wife and three children are ecstatic about his achievement but also a little worried for his safety. Gokul’s cousin, Ajayan, is a brigadier in the Indian Army, and through him they got extensive support from the military to pass through high security areas and tough terrains. Lieutenant General PGK Menon, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps -- also known as the Fire and Fury Corps -- had given a reception to the cycling team, Jose said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/joses-everest-moment-80-year-old-from-kerala-cycles-4500-km-to-celebrate-birthday-in-ladakh/articleshow/86132342.cms||T Ramavarman

That’s when we were suspicious on the “rape theory”. Woman and her brotherin-law were sternly questioned and interrogated in which it was found that woman, her brother-in-law and one Deepak Meena conspired in Delhi of blackmail someone. They had planned to bring somebody to Rajasthan and task was assigned to Deepak Meena,” the SP added. “It was planned that after the arrival of youths from Delhi, the girl will go along with them and implicate them of rape and had planned that they will settle the case after getting Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh,” the officer added.

Reviewing poll preparedness, Priyanka Gandhi held marathon meetings with organisational leaders and said workers should be prepared to work round-the-clock. She also held zone-wise meetings with respective office-bearers, the spokesperson said, adding brainstorming sessions were also held to chalk out election strategy. Stating that a strong organisation is equally important for nation-building, she said the commitment of every worker counted. On ticket distribution, she said the office-bearers would play an important role in deciding the candidates. Spokesperson Uma Shankar Singh said Gandhi also discussed the issue of farmers’ protest. SP-backed Kheri nominee in CongSP-supported block pramukh candidate from Lakhimpur Kheri who was manhandled and disrobed by the rivals from BJP on the nomination day for block pramukh election in July joined the Congress in the presence of national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who had paid a visit to her in July.

Hooda said: “It does not behove an ageing leader to target the opposition instead of the BJP government when its policies have increased unemployment, crime, and drug addiction to a record high, while the state’s farmers were out on the streets for 10 months.” He accused Chautala of targeting the opposition to divert attention from the BJP’s failures and claimed that the BJP could take root in Haryana and come to power in the state only due to the kindness of the Chautala family. The LoP said: “But if Chautala has made up his mind to do politics against the opposition instead of the government, then he should at least present facts of the JBT recruitment scam to the public.” He said Chautala and his family had escaped FIR in both his tenures even when his own-appointed director primary education had accused him in 2003. This IAS officer had moved the Supreme Court with two lists of JBT selection. Chautala was both CM and education minister of Haryana at that time, Hooda has reminded the public, claiming that: “IAS officer Rajni Sekhari Sibal had kept the original, sealed list inside a cupboard before July 2000. How did that list change? Who changed it? And how did a second list reach that cupboard? All these questions were raised during Chautala’s own term not during the Congress tenure.” On November 25, 2003, the Supreme Court had moved the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. “Chautala was neither tried nor convicted on the Congress orders,” Hooda said, adding: “I never acted out of political malice or made unwarranted allegations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chautala-shouldnt-lie-at-his-age-hooda/articleshow/86129088.cms||---
