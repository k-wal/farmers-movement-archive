At least 50 people were killed in six Eastern states as record rainfall last Wednesday overwhelmed rivers and sewer systems. Some people were trapped in fast-filling basement apartments and cars, or swept away as they tried to escape. The storm also spawned several tornadoes. Biden is scheduled to visit New Jersey and New York City on Tuesday to survey storm damage, the White House said. The storm killed at least 27 people in New Jersey and 13 in New York City. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, touring flood-damaged areas of Lambertville on Labor Day, said Biden's major disaster declaration will allow individuals to receive assistance, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. An existing emergency declaration issued last week enabled state, county and local governments to get reimbursed for disaster spending, Murphy said. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said an initial assessment found that the storm damaged more than 1,200 homes and caused about $50 million in damage to public infrastructure and property. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said damage to city infrastructure was estimated at $35 million. In the Hudson Valley, Metro-North said commuter rail service will return for Tuesday morning's rush hour after crews removed several feet of mud from the tracks and and restoring washed out slopes and ballast. Two of the four tracks on the Hudson line remain out of service for repairs between Riverdale and Tarrytown. Biden's disaster declarations cover Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic, and Somerset counties in New Jersey and allow for individual assistance for people in Bronx, Queens, Kings, Richmond and Westchester counties in New York. Murphy said he would be talking to Biden during his visit to about adding other counties to the major disaster declaration. Murphy joined state and local officials on a walking tour of Lambertville, passing homes with belongings piled outside as residents spent their Labor Day clearing flood debris, aided at one point by a bulldozer. The major disaster declaration could help people like Nick Cepparulo, who told Murphy all of his family's first-floor possessions were washed away soon after they got in their car and raced for higher ground. "We'll be all right," Cepparulo told reporters after speaking with Murphy. "We need a little help getting there.'' In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Sen. Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spent part of the morning touring of storm damage in Queens with Deanne Criswell, the former city emergency management chief who's now administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. One resident greeted de Blasio with an arm on his shoulder and a quip about their flooded homes. "Welcome to Woodside," she said. "We have swimming pools in each house. So you can get your bathing suit on and take a dip with us.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-directs-federal-aid-to-ny-nj-after-deadly-flooding/articleshow/85988514.cms||---

The experts have made it clear that the immunity has been built up to 97.5% among persons who took two doses of the vaccine and it prevents death, Subramanian said in reply to an urgent call attention motion jointly moved by former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and former health minister C Vijayabaskar on booster shots for people who have taken two doses of vaccine. EPS was not present when the motion was taken for discussion. US chief medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci had expressed that Covid-19 vaccines provide immunity for a period of one year and they were discussing booster shots, said Vijayabaskar, and sought to know if the TN government had any such idea. Responding to the motion, the health minister clarified that so far, the WHO has not recommended booster shots. “If it gives any such recommendations, TN will be the first state to administer booster shots as per the Union government’s direction,” the minister said. “Our chief minister (M K Stalin) wanted to set a target of vaccinating 20 lakh people per day,” said the minister and the department is planning to organise 10,000 vaccination camps on September 12 to achieve the target of 20 lakh. Special focus would be on the nine districts along the TN-Kerala border, targetting 100% coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/booster-shot-plan-only-if-who-recommends-it-says-health-minister/articleshow/85988451.cms||---

Collector G S Sameeran inspected screening conducted by health department officials at the Walayar check post on Monday. “After a boy died due to Nipah in Kerala, the Tamil Nadu government has strengthened screening at check posts. All local bodies have intensified measures to prevent spread of Nipah and vector-borne diseases such as Zika,” the collector told reporters. If a fever patient visits primary health centre, doctors should confirm that the person is not suffering from Covid-19, Zika or Nipah before sending them home, Sameeran said. “We are monitoring distribution of tablets such as paracetamol. Those who wish to enter Coimbatore should show negative RT-PCR certificate not older than 72 hours or proof that they are fully vaccinated. Thermal scanning is being done,” the collector said. “The district is recording higher number of Covid-19 cases as seroprevalence was less in the earlier months. Seroprevalence in Coimbatore in July was only 43% while it was 80% in places such as Chennai,” the collector explained. The administration has inoculated 3.08 lakh people in the past week. “Of the 27 lakh people above 18 years of age in the district, 19 lakh have received at least one dose of vaccine against Covid-19, which means we have covered around 70% of the adult population,” Sameeran said. When asked whether more restrictions, like in the Nilgiris where people have to show vaccination certificate to buy liquor, will be introduced, Sameeran said such measures would be taken if the infection is not contained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nipah-screening-tightened-at-13-check-posts-on-ker-border/articleshow/85988455.cms||---
---||World||Taliban claim Panjshir valley has fallen, Massoud vows to fight on||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban announced on Monday that they had captured the Panjshir valley, north of Kabul, ousting the resistance force that had been one of the obstacles in the way of the group announcing its government for Afghanistan. The announcement came hours after National Resistance Front (NRF) chief Ahmad Massoud said he was ready to hold peace talks, as suggested by religious scholars, if Taliban fighters halted their offensive. Massoud’s post emerged after the Taliban had declared that they had entered Bazarak, the provincial capital. "Panjshir, which was the last hideout of the escapee enemy, is captured," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told a crowded press conference in Kabul. "This victory has ended the war and paved the way for a peaceful and prosperous life in an independent Afghanistan," Mujahid said, claiming that he was told that former vice-president Amrullah Saleh had escaped to Tajikistan. The Taliban assured the people of Panjshir, who are ethnically distinct from the Pashtun-dominated group, that there wold be no reprisals. "They are our brothers and would work together for a joint purpose and welfare of the country," Mujahid said. Some sources suggest that the Taliban might announce a government on September 11, the anniversary of the 2001 suicide attacks on targets in the US. There are also reports that Turkey, China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Qatar would be invited to attend the government formation function. The spokesman called for recognition of Afghanistan, saying the country has the right to be recognised under a Taliban government. He urged the international community, on behalf of his group, to reopen their embassies in Kabul. Mujahid also called upon military personnel who had served under the previous regime to join the new force. "The Afghan forces who were trained in the past 20 years will be asked to rejoin security departments alongside Taliban members," he said. The Taliban media team released several videos of their takeover of Panjshir, with the militants raising the group’s white flags with religious inscriptions over government buildings, including the governor’s house. In the latest post on Twitter, commander Massoud said from an undisclosed location that he was still in the valley. "We are in Panjshir and our Resistance will continue," he said on Twitter. Sunday was a bad day for the NRF as several of its senior members were killed in the fight following unverified claims from both sides that they had inflicted heavy losses on each other. The resistance group later confirmed that its official spokesman, former journalist Fahim Dashty, Massoud’s cousin, General Abdul Wudood, and Saleh Muhammed Regastni, one of Massoud’s most trusted men in the fight against the Taliban, had been killed. Twitter posts by Afghans suggested that many more senior NRF commanders and fighter had lost their lives. Panjshir was the last remaining area resisting the Taliban after they captured the country’s 33 provinces in a lightning campaign last month. A week after Kabul’s fall on August 15, the NRF, comprising personnel of the previous US-backed Afghan government and private militias, retook Andarab and two other adjoining districts in Baghlan, next to Panjshir. The Taliban had denounced that attack as a breach of their general amnesty for all members and politicians of the ousted government and had urged resistance leaders to surrender their arms and find a negotiated settlement to the security crisis. Last week, the Taliban had launched a major offensive after the talks broke down. The armed group not only retook lost ground but also captured the last remaining province to complete its takeover of the entire country ahead of the formation of an interim government. During his press conference Mujahid said all important decisions on future government have already been made and that they are now working on technical issues. He also said an interim government would be announced first, allowing for changes later. Mujahid added that the government would be inclusive and that women’s rights would be respected under the framework of the Sharia, or Islamic law. He did not elaborate further on women’s role in government, if any. Domestic flights across Afghanistan have resumed and Mujahid said that the group was waiting to see the resumption of international flights. Accusing the US of damaging Kabul airport before exiting Afghanistan, the spokesman said that the governments of both Turkey and Qatar were helping to restore services at the facility. Reuters, meanwhile, reported an organiser as having said that about 1,000 people, including Americans, have been stuck in northern Afghanistan for days awaiting clearance for their charter flights to leave, but that it could not independently verify the details of the account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-claim-panjshir-valley-has-fallen-massoud-vows-to-fight-on/articleshow/85988654.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||Chennai||Documents should allow both parents’ names: Madras HC||CHENNAI: Remarking that it would be appropriate if columns are provided to include names of either or both parents of a child applying for official documents, the Madras high court has issued notice to the Union and state governments on a PIL. The petitioner also wanted the court to direct the government to permit single parents to include their name alone in such documents. When the plea came up for hearing on Monday, the first bench of chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu said: “It may be more appropriate if the column or columns in the printed forms permit either or both (parents) as per the wishes of the applicant.” It then adjourned the hearing to November 1. The petitioner, B Ramkumar Adityan, said children should be able to use the names of either their mother or father. Citing the steady and sizable increase in the number of single-parent adoptions in the past 30 years, he said challenges for single parent adoption had greatly reduced. Many factors may have encouraged this drift. “One such factor can be the growing acceptance of one-parent families due to divorce or separation and unmarried single women raising a child on their own. Other factors such as increasing literacy and financial independence of women may have also fairly contributed in making single parent adoption popular,” he said. But still several public and private institutions and almost all documents in all departments such as affidavits, deeds, oaths, schools, banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, licences, registrations, permits, identity cards, orders, records, legal documents, official documents, court documents and applications of any nature continue to issue forms that require the father’s name alone and require the father to sign off as the guardian, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/docus-should-allow-both-parents-names-hc/articleshow/85988519.cms||Suresh Kumar

Kishtwar SSP Shafqat Hussain Batt said, “On July 23, it was learnt that Zewara Begum, wife of Mohammad Ashraf of Afti Warwan, committed suicide by jumping into Marusudar river at Chudraman. Police collected evidence, lifted some suspects for questioning and accordingly on the basis of witnesses and other evidence it was established that she was being tortured physically and mentally by her husband and other members of the family." The SSP added that her husband Mohammad Ashraf, brother-in-law Fayaz Ahmed and sisters-in-law Sharifa Begum, Sara Begum and Rafiqa Begum were arrested after it was established that they suspected her character and used to torture her, due to which she took the extreme step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/husband-family-booked-for-suicide-of-woman-in-kishtwar/articleshow/85988687.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Go for night burial, top cops told Geelani sons||SRINAGAR: J&K police on Monday said it had requested the two sons of deceased Hurriyat patriarch Syed Ali Shah Geelani to bury their father in a Srinagar graveyard in the middle of the night, away from public attention, to avoid any potential law and order problem. In a series of tweets from its official handle late Monday, Kashmir Zone Police said, "After death of SAS Geelani, IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar along with SP & ASP met both of his sons at their residence at 11pm, condoled them & requested for burial in the night for larger interest of general public due to potential major Law and order situations. Both agreed and asked to wait for two hours until relatives reach." Some media reports had quoted Geelani’s family as claiming that the police forcibly took away his body and gave it a quiet burial. PTI reported a commotion at the separatist leader’s residence, but this was refuted by IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar, who said “some vested interests tried to spread baseless rumours about the forced burial of Geelani by the police”. According to one of the tweets on Monday, "IGP Kashmir personally spoke to a few relatives and ensured them safe entry into the house of Geealanis". Three hours later, "probably under pressure from Pakistan and miscreants, they behaved differently & started resorting to anti-national activities, including wrapping (the) dead body in Pakistani flag, making loud sloganeering in favour of Pakistan and instigating neighbours to come out", the police said. "After persuasion the relatives brought the dead body to the graveyard and performed last rites with due respect in presence of members of Intizamia Committee and local Imam. The refusal of both his sons to come to graveyard indicated their loyalty to Pakistani agenda rather than their love & respect for their departed father." PDP president and former J&K CM Mehbooba Mufti said the way Geelani's burial had been "handled" was uncalled for. "You can fight with a person when he is alive, but once dead, you need to respect the body like others," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/go-for-night-burial-top-cops-told-geelani-sons/articleshow/85988721.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Blinken in Doha for Afghan crisis talks with Qatar||DOHA: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Doha on Monday for crisis talks with the Qataris after the Taliban claimed to have full control over Afghanistan. Shortly before landing, an official disclosed that four Americans had left Afghanistan with Taliban knowledge, in the first departures arranged by Washington since its chaotic military pullout. The four US citizens left by land and were greeted by US diplomats, said the senior official, without specifying to which country they crossed, adding that "the Taliban did not impede them". Blinken, accompanied by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, is the most senior US official to visit the region since the Taliban's lightning takeover of Afghanistan on August 15. He was not due to meet any of the Taliban's Doha representatives but State Department official Dean Thompson said Washington would continue to engage with the Islamist group "to ensure our messaging with them is clear". "We are thankful for Qatar's close collaboration on Afghanistan," the State Department said ahead of Blinken's arrival in Doha at 1500 GMT, seen by an AFP correspondent. Blinken's team praised Doha's "indispensable support in facilitating the transit of US citizens, embassy Kabul personnel, at-risk Afghans, and other evacuees from Afghanistan through Qatar". Qatar, which hosts a major US airbase, has been the gateway for 55,000 people airlifted out of Afghanistan, nearly half the total number evacuated by US-led forces after the Taliban's lightning takeover. Before his arrival, Blinken said that in Qatar he would "express our deep gratitude for all that they're doing to support the evacuation effort" and meet rescued Afghans. He will also meet US diplomats, after Washington relocated its embassy in Kabul to Doha, along with a number of allies including Britain and the Netherlands. The State Department said Blinken would discuss with Qatar its efforts, alongside Turkey, to reopen Kabul's ramshackle airport -- essential to fly in badly needed humanitarian aid and to evacuate remaining Afghans. Qatar invited the Taliban to open a political office in Doha in 2013, subsequently hosting talks between Washington and the Taliban that concluded in 2020 with a troop withdrawal agreement. It was followed by direct negotiations between the former insurgents and Afghan government. The Taliban on Monday claimed total control over Afghanistan, saying they had won the key battle for the Panjshir Valley, the last remaining holdout of resistance against their rule. The group is yet to finalise its new regime after rolling into the capital Kabul three weeks ago at a speed that analysts say likely surprised even the hardline Islamists themselves. After Doha, Blinken will head Wednesday to the US air base at Ramstein in Germany, a temporary home for thousands of Afghans moving to the United States. US officials say some Americans may have left Afghanistan since the United States ended its 20-year war at the end of August but they would have done so by private means. Washington is closely watching whether the Taliban makes good on promises to let US citizens and allies depart as it decides how to deal with the Islamists. US officials say just over 100 Americans, mostly dual nationals, remain in Afghanistan after the massive airlift of tens of thousands of people in the last days of America's longest war. President Joe Biden's Republican rivals have been quick to accuse him of abandoning Americans. But tens of thousands of interpreters or others who supported the US mission and their family members are believed to remain, with many fearing retribution despite Taliban assurances. With the Kabul airport in disarray, land routes are the key way out of Afghanistan, primarily though Pakistan or Iran, which does not have diplomatic relations with Washington. While at Ramstein, Blinken will hold a virtual 20-nation ministerial meeting on the crisis alongside German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/blinken-in-doha-for-afghan-crisis-talks-with-qatar/articleshow/85989079.cms||---

However, small temples will be kept open and worshipped idols will be collected by staff of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department and will be immersed in a water body in a regulated manner, it said on Monday. “Guidelines in such regard have been issued by the Union government. The necessary instructions have been forwarded to state governments and union territories and appropriate measures have been put in place in this state pursuant to the guidelines issued by the Union,” Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shanmugasundaram said. The state informed the court that through a communication dated August 28, the union home ministry had advised chief secretaries of all states to take suitable measures to avoid large gatherings during the coming festive season and, if required, impose local restrictions. In view of the communication, the state government issued a press release on August 30 imposing certain restrictions for festive celebrations, Shunmugasundaram said. The release made it clear though placing idols and worshipping in public places was completely prohibited for organisations, it could be done only by individuals in their houses. The submissions were made on a PIL moved by K Gopinath, president of Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam, Tiruppur seeking direction to the state to notify standard operating procedure to be followed during the celebration. According to the petitioner, the celebrations for the festival generally start at least three days in advance and therefore wanted the state to come up with a SOP as early as possible in view of the pandemic.

The bridge has been lit up at night as part of the Chennai corporation’s efforts to install dynamic lighting at bridges and flyovers in the city. On most nights and weekends, several cars and two wheelers can be seen parked on the bridge, with several families jostling for space near the bridge to click pictures. Civic body authorities say that the crowd was expected when they came up with the dynamic lighting project. The image makeover has seen dynamic lighting on flyovers, grade separators, Rail Over Bridges (ROBs) and subways across the city. “In major cities across the world, bridges are seen as icons, such as the Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Napier bridge is already one such structure in Chennai. The dynamic lighting seems to have added to its aesthetics,” said an engineer with the bridges department of the corporation. While the lighting has been in place since the beginning of this year, consistent lockdowns and the closure of Marina beach for the public meant a large part of the city’s populace was not aware of the lighting project on the bridge. “I was not aware of the lighting at the bridge. When I visited the beach recently with my family and was driving back home, we stopped by the bridge to click selfies,” said J Kaushik, a resident of Velachery. While the lighting at the bridge sure attracts visitors, incidences of people slipping into the Cooum river while taking photographs have also been recorded. About three weeks ago, on August 10, a casual labourer from Periamet fell into the river while taking a selfie from the parapet wall. He had an anxious wait in neck deep sludge for about eight hours before he was rescued. Police said that they have to ask people to disperse during late hours due to safety concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/illuminated-napier-bridge-is-citys-latest-selfie-spot/articleshow/85989241.cms||---

Saudi Aramco on Sunday announced a discount of $1 per barrel for October, leading to a marginal fall in oil prices to about $72 per barrel. The fall was capped by US production outages due to hurricane Ida.  The oil market is expected to remain bearish as the OPEC+ grouping stuck to their plan of adding 400,000 barrels per day every month till December as planned and due to weak US job figures as well as non-encouraging China growth data.  At home, the Saudi move is expected to hasten the pace of reduction in pump prices that are still ruling at near-record levels after a few rounds of cuts that began in August after a gap of more than a month. India’s crude cost stood at $71.86 per barrel, down from earlier. The price cut would act as a sweetener for Indian refiners, prompting them to fully lift monthly deliveries of Saudi crude as per commitment. The refiners had in April reduced offtake of Saudi oil to take advantage of cheaper littoral supplies from the spot market and new producers. Saudi Aramco sets the official selling price (OSP) every month for oil supplied under term contracts. Other Gulf producers take a cue to tweak their prices. The OSP adjusts the difference in quality between particular Saudi crudes and the monthly base price of the Dubai-Oman basket quoted in Singapore. The base price is derived from a rolling average of 30-month quotes. Easing oil prices at this point will also give the government the much needed fiscal headroom at a time it is trying to keep the economy aloft in the aftermath of a deadly second Covid wave and needs money to prepare for a third wave. High oil prices stoke inflation, jacks up import and subsidy bills. This has a negative impact on macroeconomic indicators such as current account deficit and trade balance. The RBI estimates every $10/barrel rise in crude price reduces GDP growth by about 0.15% points. Last year, the historic oil price crash came as a boon when the pandemic first hit. It resulted in a saving of Rs 25,000 crore, which offered a prop for macroeconomic parameters and allowed the government fiscal leeway to spend on fighting the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/saudi-oil-price-cut-may-hasten-fuel-rate-reduction/articleshow/85989091.cms||Sanjay Dutta

Ending the fourth such procession in a week, police intercepted the group as it prepared to leave the town of Huixtla in southern Chiapas state, AFP observed.  It was made up mainly of people from El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti and Venezuela.  Police blocked streets that the travelers would need to use to get out of the town onto a northbound highway, making some arrests while others from the procession fled further into Huixtla.  The police also took up positions on the highway itself to keep the caravan from reforming.  About 80 people were arrested in the operation and would be deported, according to a police source.  A member of the National Guard was injured in the operation, authorities said.  "We are asking for asylum in Mexico, we do not want to go there (the United States)," Alexander, a man traveling with his wife and eight-year-old grandson, fleeing violence in El Salvador, told AFP.  Like other recent caravans, this one had set out from the Mexican town of Tapachula on the border with Guatemala.  It did so amid a heavy presence of Mexican national guards bent on stopping asylum-seekers hoping to reach the United States for a better life.  Activists and United Nations officials traveling with the migrants say police have used excessive force against them. Two migration agents were suspended for hitting a traveler.  The government has said it will nonetheless maintain its policy of trying to keep US-bound migrants from traveling through Mexico.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Thursday he will send President Joe Biden a letter reiterating his proposal for the United States to grant work visas to Central Americans and Mexicans and address the poverty and violence that are helping fuel the migratory flow.  Mexico has seen an increasing number of undocumented migrants heading north since Biden arrived in the White House promising a more humane approach than that of former President Donald Trump.  In an attempt to curb the influx, the Mexican government says it has deployed more than 27,000 members of the security forces along its southern and northern borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mexican-police-disperse-us-bound-migrant-caravan/articleshow/85989940.cms||---

Police blocked streets that the travelers would need to use to get out of the town onto a northbound highway, making some arrests while others from the procession fled further into Huixtla.  The police also took up positions on the highway itself to keep the caravan from reforming.  About 80 people were arrested in the operation and would be deported, according to a police source.  A member of the National Guard was injured in the operation, authorities said.  "We are asking for asylum in Mexico, we do not want to go there (the United States)," Alexander, a man traveling with his wife and eight-year-old grandson, fleeing violence in El Salvador, told AFP.  Like other recent caravans, this one had set out from the Mexican town of Tapachula on the border with Guatemala.  It did so amid a heavy presence of Mexican national guards bent on stopping asylum-seekers hoping to reach the United States for a better life.  Activists and United Nations officials traveling with the migrants say police have used excessive force against them. Two migration agents were suspended for hitting a traveler.  The government has said it will nonetheless maintain its policy of trying to keep US-bound migrants from traveling through Mexico.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Thursday he will send President Joe Biden a letter reiterating his proposal for the United States to grant work visas to Central Americans and Mexicans and address the poverty and violence that are helping fuel the migratory flow.  Mexico has seen an increasing number of undocumented migrants heading north since Biden arrived in the White House promising a more humane approach than that of former President Donald Trump.  In an attempt to curb the influx, the Mexican government says it has deployed more than 27,000 members of the security forces along its southern and northern borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexican-police-disperse-us-bound-migrant-caravan/articleshow/85989514.cms||---
---||World||Brazil braces for pro-Bolsonaro rallies on Tuesday||BRASILIA: Brazil prepared on Monday for Independence Day demonstrations by supporters of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has called for a show of support for his attacks on the country's Supreme Court that are rattling Latin America's largest democracy. Security was reinforced in the capital Brasilia and police started blocking access to the central mall where thousands are expected to march on Tuesday, supporting Bolsonaro in his clash with the judiciary over changes to Brazil's voting system. Critics fear the president is encouraging supporters to the point that they might try to intimidate or invade the courts, warning of parallels with former US President Donald Trump's backers who stormed the Capitol after his electoral defeat. Internationally, more than 150 left-leaning former presidents and party leaders signed an open letter criticizing Bolsonaro for encouraging what they called an imitation of the Jan. 6 "insurrection" at the USCapitol. The demonstrations are "stoking fears of a coup d'état in the world's third-largest democracy," the letter warned. Bolsonaro said on Friday that the demonstrations will be an "ultimatum" to the Supreme Court justices who have taken "unconstitutional" decisions against his government. The court has authorized investigations of Bolsonaro allies for allegedly attacking Brazil's democratic institutions with misinformation online. He has called the court-ordered probes a violation of free speech rights. Congress and the courts also resisted Bolsonaro's attempt to introduce paper voting receipts as a backup of an electronic voting system, which he argues is vulnerable to fraud. The electoral court maintains the system is transparent and safe. Bolsonaro's critics say he is sowing doubts so he can challenge the results of next year's election, which opinion polls now show him losing to former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva. Neither has confirmed their candidacies. Lula announced that he would make a video address to the nation on Monday at 7 p.m. (2200 GMT) via social media. Brasilia will have 5,000 police and military personnel on hand to maintain order at the march outside Congress, where Bolsonaro is scheduled to appear on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon, Bolsonaro will join supporters on a major avenue in midtown Sao Paulo at gathering that he has forecast as the biggest political rally in Brazilian history. Many leftist leaders have urged their followers to avoid clashes by avoiding counter demonstrations on Tuesday in favor of larger anti-Bolsonaro protests on Sept. 12. Financial, industrial and agribusiness leaders in Brazil have also distanced themselves from Bolsonaro's attacks on the Supreme Court and called for dialogue between the executive and judiciary, warning the tensions threaten an economic rebound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazil-braces-for-pro-bolsonaro-rallies-on-tuesday/articleshow/85989624.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: AICC nod to break-up with Ajmal party||GUWAHATI: AICC general secretary and Assam in-charge, Jitendra Singh, on Monday said the high command will accept the state Congress's decision to snap ties with the AIUDF. Days after a state Congress delegation submitted a report before the AICC in Delhi informing it of its decision to break free from the alliance with Badruddin Ajmal's All India United Democratic Front, Singh made the decision of the high command public through the media. Assam PCC president Bhupen Borah told TOI from Delhi on Monday that an official announcement of the break-up and a possible new partner for the alliance will be made once the dates for the byelections are declared. “Whatever the state Congress leadership has decided is going to be the final decision of the AICC. It will respect the opinion of the Assam PCC and approve its strategy to win the upcoming byelections in Assam,” Singh told media persons in New Delhi. While AIUDF supremo Ajmal said they are no more in alliance with the Congress, he categorically pointed out that ‘both parties will benefit from the split’. BJP has termed the split as being spurious. “The upcoming byelections are in constituencies where the minority vote is hardly a factor. And so the BJP will be with the indigenous tribes and communities, who do not side with Ajmal's party,” a BJP leader said. Speculations are doing the rounds that any one of the two new regional parties, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) or the Raijor Dal (RD), or a combination of both may slip into the place of the AIUDF in the Congress-led alliance. The Congress, however, sources say, is more favourably disposed towards the AJP, headed by former All Assam Students' Union general secretary, Lurinjyoti Gogoi. Borah, in fact, said that RD president Akhil Gogoi was trying to disrupt the progress of the talks with AJP with his bargaining with the Congress. Akhil met Rahul Gandhi recently and claimed that the latter is in favour of having Akhil’s party on board. “Rahul Gandhi said he will instruct the AICC general secretaries Jitendra Singh and Mukul Wasnik to discuss the strategies with me,” Akhil had then told TOI. But senior Congress leaders like Pradyut Bordoloi and Sarat Barkatoky have claimed that Akhil cannot be trusted as he keeps changing his colours. At a news conference here on Monday, Nagaon MP Bordoloi said, “There is no point in giving importance to Akhil. If he says something in the morning, he changes it at night.” The Congress blamed Akhil for spoiling the music in the run-up to the byelections when the two parties are nearing some kind of an understanding by accusing their MPs, Gaurav Gogoi and Pradyut Bordoloi, of blocking the Congress-RD alliance to ensure the defeat of the Congress . The AJP and RD could not do well in the last election and the Congress had maintained that both the parties had ruined their prospects in many seats in upper and northern Assam by splitting anti-BJP votes. Nevertheless, the AJP is now inching closer to the Congress. Lurinjyoti has said discussions with the Congress are in an advanced stage. “There are positive indications and we are eagerly waiting for a seat-sharing agreement with the Congress to defeat our common enemy, the BJP. There should be one consensus candidate from anti-BJP parties in the upcoming by-election,” said Lurinjyoti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/aicc-nod-to-break-up-with-ajmal-party/articleshow/85989728.cms||Kangkan Kalita

While the bills never reached the office of the CGM, HR and MD, the officials received the medical reimbursement amount,” an APDCL source said. The company has so far recovered over Rs 90 lakh of the total funds siphoned off by its workers. The state-level medical referral board comprises Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) principal as the chairperson, GMCH superintendent as the member secretary and three members. A government official has to submit a medical referral certificate, approved by the medical board along with the medical reimbursement bills, to their respective departments. Of the 34, one is AGM, two are junior engineers and others are Grade-III and Grade-IV employees. The source said a departmental inquiry has been initiated to unearth further linkages and nab the kingpin in the department. “The kingpin must be in the department, who forged the signatures. We have sent the documents to the forensic and are waiting for the results.” Investigating officer Omar Faruk said: “A probe is underway into the case. No one has been arrested so far.” The scam came to light after the GMCH authority filed three separate FIRs against 41 officials of APDCL, department of elementary education and finance department at the Bhangagarh police station. A case has been lodged against all 41 accused under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (use of a forged document or electronic record as genuine) and 472 (making or possessing counterfeit seal with intent to commit forgery) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/forged-medical-bills-34-apdcl-officials-booked/articleshow/85989732.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Congress seeks relief for workers of closed Nagaon paper mill||GUWAHATI: In a show of solidarity, the Congress on Monday appealed to the employees of the closed Hindustan Paper Corporation (HPC), who were asked to vacate their quarters last week, not to leave. The party urged the state government to come up with a relief package for the workers, especially because of the prevailing pandemic. The two paper mills have been defunct for years and a notice to vacate the quarters have triggered a massive outcry. The two HPC paper mills, Nagaon Paper Mill at Jagiroad in Morigaon district and Cachar Paper Mill at Panchgram in Hailakandi district, were brought to a halt in March 2017 and October 2015 respectively. “The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) will stand by and protect the interests of the employees of the closed paper mills. APCC considers the direction of the liquidator, Kuldeep Varma, to the employees to vacate their residential quarters within 15 days as ridiculous, preposterous and devoid of any compassionate reasoning,” Congress MP from Nagaon, Pradyut Bordoloi, said in a news conference on Monday. The APCC has demanded that the state government shows solidarity for the employees and comes forward with a relief package by meeting all their past commitments about the revival of the closed mills and payment of all dues. “The order to vacate the residential quarters without any financial guarantee, especially during the economic distress faced due to the pandemic, is utterly inhuman,” said Bordoloi. “The government has kept the HPC-run paper mills under lockdown and now is willing to liquidate them. It is alleged that the reason behind liquidating could be because this industry needs bamboo and the Assam government wants to give access to bamboo to vested interests to make products such as ethanol which has a high demand and value,” said chairperson of the media department of the state PCC, Bobbeeta Sharma. “Similarly, the Assam government has to be clear on its stand regarding the handing over of oil wells in Panchgram. APCC contends that no asset of the government should be handed over to private parties on a platter and demands transparency on such deals,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cong-seeks-relief-for-workers-of-closed-nagaon-paper-mill/articleshow/85989761.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Chennai||Property registrations in Tamil Nadu under SIT lens||CHENNAI: Alleging large-scale irregularities in registration of immovable properties “in the past”, the DMK government on Monday announced the setting up of a special investigation team to probe and submit a report to the government. The state government will also set up a high-level committee to restructure the guideline value for registration of sale deeds of properties to set right the discrepancies. The guideline value saw a sharp hike in 2012 and subsequently, it was cut by 33% by the previous AIADMK regime.  Replying to the debate on demand for grants for commercial taxes and registration department, minister P Moorthy said there were continuous complaints from the public about the registration of fake documents, unrecognised plots and loss to the exchequer. “Setting right the wrongs of the past and ensuring that no wrongdoings occur in the future is a big challenge for the registration department,” the minister said.  “We have come to know of instances of fraudulent registration by people impersonating landowners staying in other states and countries and those who passed away, creation of fake pattas, selling properties to more than one person, grabbing of properties citing missing documents and improper sharing of properties among siblings. Based on the report of the SIT, legal action will be initiated against the culprits,” Moorthy said. The initiative will cost the government 80 lakh this fiscal and 2.20 crore towards recurring expenditure.  The authorities have come upon cases of registration of wetland, government poromboke land, temple and Wakf board properties in the name of private individuals. The affected public faced difficulties with no avenues to cancel the documents and have been sending petitions to the government now. The state government has passed a Bill to amend The Registration Act, 1908, inserting provisions to empower the registrar to cancel the registration, and imposing penalty and three-year imprisonment for the officer who register through forged sale deeds. Moorthy said the public grievance redressal camps will be held on Mondays in zones by deputy inspector general and district registrar in every district.  The government will also take up delimitation of village panchayats and the revenue villages for the benefit of sub-registrar offices. Under ease of doing business, the government integrated the services of encumbrance certificate, certified copy of the document, registration of societies and registration of partnership firms with the ‘single window portal’ of the Guidance Bureau from July. Murthy said the government proposed online registration of documents relating to deposit of title deeds with banks and rental agreement for the benefit of investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/property-registrations-under-sit-lens/articleshow/85989966.cms||Julie Mariappan

The MoU was signed in the presence of chief minister M K Stalin at the Secretariat. “To become self-sufficient in meeting the energy needs of the state, and reduce the amount spent on power purchase, the Tangedco has planned to augment its renewable energy sources by 25,000MW in the next 10 years. This includes 20,000MW solar energy, 3,000MW of hydro power and 2,000MW electricity generated by gas turbines. It has been estimated that Tangedco will have to raise 1.32 lakh crore funds,” said an official release. Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji, Tangedco CMD Rajesh Lakhoni and IREDA CMD Pradip Kumar Das were present The plan is that IREDA will provide advisory services in matters relating to assistance in market assessment, assessment support in project development, assistance in bid process management and implementation support. In debt raising, the agency will provide support in understanding the market instrument, undertake due diligence activities and prepare the information memorandum for raising funds. The state government is keen on investing in renewable energy given that its own generation from thermal power stations is only 4,320MW, as against the average demand of 15,000MW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tangedco-to-add-25000-mw-of-clean-energy/articleshow/85990027.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Schools and colleges reopen in Assam, but attendance thin||GUWAHATI: Schools and colleges reopened in Assam after four months with adequate precautions, though low attendance was recorded on the first day. In Guwahati, less than 50% attendance was recorded in schools, while technical institutions and state universities are yet to be fully functional. Technical institutions have been given the go ahead to start all classes, while universities have been directed to start the final year classes for undergraduate and post-graduate courses only. “Many students stayed at home as they had no idea what's going to happen on the first day,” said inspector of schools, Kamrup (Metro), Prasanna Bora. He added most Class XII students are below 18 and not vaccinated. But the majority of the teachers have been fully vaccinated. “Over 95% of the teachers, who reported to work today, have got both the doses,” said Bora. In colleges too, the presence was not encouraging, but those who did attend classes were enthusiastic. “In our college, about 30% attendance was recorded among Class XII and degree final year students. Many students, who skipped the classes on the first day, hail from the districts and are still at home. Hopefully, they will join us in a few days,” said B Borooah College principal, SN Barman. Barman said physical distance was maintained, the classes were sanitized and students came wearing masks. “Final year students have already lost two months of studies. They were happy to return to class,” said Barman. “Final-year students have already lost two months of studies. They were happy to return to class,” said Barman. Gauhati University, Cotton University, Dibrugarh University and some other universities did not open for offline classes on Monday as hostels are still closed. However, final year undergraduate and postgraduate classes in affiliated colleges of universities started as per the state government's instructions. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if everything passes off smoothly till next week, Class X will also be opened. “If there is a possibility of a third wave looming large, offline classes will be closed again,” said Sarma. Chayanika Dutta, a Class XII student from the city, said, “In markets, public places, government offices, everywhere life looks normal. Most of the Covid curbs have been withdrawn. So why should the students be the losers?” she asked. The state disaster management authority, through an SOP, allowed reopening of physical classes for Class XII, undergraduate final year and post-graduate final year from Monday. However, at least the first dose of vaccination was made mandatory for all, except for those below 18 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/schools-and-colleges-reopen-in-assam-but-attendance-thin/articleshow/85989958.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||Mumbai||Mumbaikars gear up to welcome Ganpati Bappa amid the pandemic||While things are slowly returning to some semblance of normalcy in the newly vaccinated world, the government is still taking precautionary measures for everyone’s safety. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) even issued some guidelines ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi, and much like last year, celebrations are expected to be subdued this festive season, too. Guidelines to be followed strictly Authorities including the BMC, Ganeshotsav Coordinating Committee and Mumbai Police have decided that most of the guidelines for the festival would remain the same as last year. Deputy Municipal Commissioner, Harshad Kale, said, “The height of public murti can be a maximum of four feet and household Ganpati murtis cannot be more than two feet. No procession will be allowed in the city. We have also asked all the mandals in Mumbai to perform their last aarti on the day of visarjan at the mandal itself.” Immersion of idols The grand 11-day-long festival is set to begin on September 10 this year. And while people are allowed to visit Chowpatty, no processions will be permitted. “For clay idol immersions, there are 173 artificial immersion sites and around 70 natural immersion sites. Also, only 10 volunteers would be allowed to bring the idol to the sea fronts and natural immersion sites in the city. No devotee would be allowed to enter the area and all idols would have to be handed over to the volunteers from BMC and NGOs, who will then take the idols into the sea for immersion,” said Kale. The Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti’s demand for immersion from renowned mandals to be allowed at sea was accepted by the BMC last month. “We are happy that BMC has accepted this demand,” said the BSGSS president. Get darshan online The umbrella body of mandals in the city, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), had asked to allow devotees to get ‘offline’ darshan as well. BSGSS president Naresh Dahibavkar said, “Though we had demanded for darshan to be allowed physically, but abhi tak humein koi proper decision nahi diya and, as of now, all darshan across Mumbai will only be online. The SOP guidelines’ ninth column has stated this.” Number of mandals are higher than the previous year Every year, the BMC used to receive around 3,000 mandal applications, but that has  drastically gone down amid the pandemic. “However, the number of mandals this year is higher than it was last year, which is a positive sign,” said Dahibavkar. Loudspeakers for sarvajanik mandals Ganesh Chaturthi is not only one of the biggest festivals of the state, it’s also one of the loudest. And this year, sound pollution and decibel levels are under the radar, too. “Lalbaugcha Raja’s organisers had requested for loudspeakers to be allowed, and so we had demanded this in our last meeting. Mandal workers would definitely need microphones for announcements. The Mayor also supported us in this, and the DCP was also present at this meeting. He said that clarity regarding this would be given soon. If Pune can get the permissions, why not Mumbai?” Dahibavkar added.  Height of public idols cannot exceed four feet, while murtis at home should be less than two feet No procession will be permitted People are encouraged to opt for marble or metal idols There are 173 artificial immersion sites and 70 natural immersion sites. For clay idols, all immersion guidelines have to be followed People can go to Chowpatty, but processions are not allowed No devotee allowed to enter the immersion area Only 10 people per mandal would be allowed with idols at sea fronts Idols to be handed over to official volunteers for immersion at sea fronts||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-gear-up-to-welcome-ganpati-bappa-amid-the-pandemic/articleshow/85984704.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||World||More US first responders are dying of Covid-19||The resurgence of the Covid-19 this summer and the national debate over vaccine requirements have created a fraught situation for the nation's first responders who are dying in larger numbers but pushing back against mandates.  It's a stark contrast from the beginning of the vaccine rollout when first responders were prioritised for shots.  The mandates affect tens of thousands of police officers, firefighters and others on the front lines across the country, many of whom are spurning the vaccine. That is happening despite mandates' consequences that range from weekly testing to suspension to termination - even though the virus is now the leading cause of the US law enforcement line-of-duty deaths.  According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, 132 members of law enforcement agencies are known to have died of the Covid-19 in 2021. In Florida alone last month, six people affiliated with law enforcement died over a 10-day period.  Despite the deaths, police officers and other first responders are among those most hesitant to get the vaccine and their cases continue to grow. No national statistics show the vaccination rate for America's entire population of first responders but individual police and fire departments across the country report figures far below the national rate of 74% of adults who have had at least one dose. On the other hand, the US government's top infectious disease expert says he believes delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine booster shots would start September 20 for Americans who received Pfizer doses, while Moderna's may end up rolling out a couple weeks later.  Dr Anthony Fauci told CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday that it is still the Biden administration's plan "in some respects" to begin the third doses the week of Sept. 20, pending approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The administration had hoped that both Pfizer and Moderna booster shots would be rolled out at that time. But Fauci said it is "conceivable", that for Moderna's, there might be "at most a couple of weeks, a few weeks delay, if any," while the company provides more data to the FDA on the booster's efficacy.  President Joe Biden on August 18 touted boosters as a protection against the virus' more transmissible delta variant, and said Americans should consider getting an extra shot eight months after their second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/more-us-first-responders-are-dying-of-covid-19/articleshow/85990974.cms||---

As part of this tactic, activated even before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, ISI has already been pushing its “protégé” terrorist outfits LeT, JeM and Al-Badr into the Union Territory since the past two months. A source in the Indian central security establishment told TOI that around 200 terrorists are currently active in J&K, with the share of foreign terrorists matching that of local ultras. “Eventually, they will indulge in terror attacks as and when ISI directs,” said the source. Determined to neutralise these efforts by ISI, the Indian security forces have further fortified the border grid and increased surveillance and manpower along the Pakistan border. To ensure the infiltrated terrorists do not get easy hideouts in Kashmir’s villages, the J&K police are aggressively tracking down overground workers who are likely to give shelter to the foreign terrorists and also facilitate their missions. Afghan crisis: Live updatesSources said since January this year, around 500 overground workers have been arrested. “We are closely watching more suspected ones, some of whom try to project themselves as ‘nationalists’, and will crack down upon them in the days ahead,” said a security officer.

Yet, there are genuine concerns about some of the weapons and military equipment left behind by the US forces as well as trained terrorist cadres from Afghanistan finding their way into J&K because of ISI’s nexus with the Taliban and groups active on its western frontier. Sources in J&K police said infiltration has picked up since July along the border in north Kashmir as well as Jammu region. Terror launchpads and infiltration routes are noticeably active in Bandipore, Kupwara and Baramulla, while terrorist activity is mostly concentrated in south Kashmir. A source said foreign terrorists and narcotics traffickers usually infiltrate from north Kashmir and stay in hideouts there before coming down south. Infiltrators headed for south Kashmir, a terror hub with Srinagar currently reporting the highest terror activity, infiltrate mostly through Jammu and then move to the Valley by road. Foreign terrorists traditionally outnumber local terrorists in north Kashmir; south Kashmir mostly has local recruits from districts like Anantnag, Srinagar and Shopian. A new concern among the security establishment in J&K is the engagement of locals by terrorist outfits for small acts like grenade throwing, rather than their being given a longer role in their terror activities.  "These locals are paid good money for a one-off assignment. They mostly do the limited job and then merge into the civilian population. So it becomes very difficult to track them and get anything concrete to nail them," said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/after-afghanistan-pakistan-eyeing-more-aggressive-tactics-in-jammu-kashmir/articleshow/85990878.cms||Bharti Jain

---||India||Health experts’ body calls for reopening all schools||NEW DELHI: The Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM), a consortium of some of the leading public health experts in the country, has strongly advocated reopening all schools in the country. It issued an advisory stating that the gains from resumption of academic activities far outweigh the risks involved, and that the government must not wait for vaccination among kids to resume classes. Dr Suneela Garg, IAPSM president, told TOI that even the pre-school classes should resume. “Many states, for example Delhi, are prioritising opening of schools for older children. There is no logic behind this. If at all, evidence shows, younger children have the lowest risk of developing severe infection and therefore we should prioritise opening pre-schools and primary classes first,” she said. The IAPSM has shared a copy of its recommendations on resumption of schools with the Union health ministry, Indian Council of Medical Research, Niti Aayog and the department of education for necessary action. There are two main concerns around sending children to schools. First, children getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and the risk of severe infection among them, and second, children transmitting infection to other family members, especially elderly, the advisory states.  “Data from Indian states, including the latest and fourth national sero survey, shows that children have already got Covid-19 infection at a similar or even higher rate than adults (mostly asymptomatic and with far lower rate of moderate to severe disease). Therefore, they are already protected and not at additional risk,” the advisory says. About the fear of children spreading infection to the family members, the expert group quotes a report from 15 countries on school re-opening and a surge in Covid-19 cases. “Only three countries observed an increase in transmission due to school reopening. However, this surge was not proven scientifically to be linked to school attendance,” the advisory says. Schools have remained closed in most parts of the country for over a year on account of widespread cases of Covid-19. Chandrakant Lahariya, a leading public health expert and co-author of the IAPSM advisory, said it was causing a serious problem for the physical and psychological well-being of children. “Not all children have mobiles and laptops to attend virtual classes. Also, this is not a long-term solution. We must open the schools,” Lahariya said. While Delhi has a positivity rate of less than 0.1%, states such as Maharashtra and Kerala continue to have high positivity rates. Dr Lahariya said that, if at all, localised epidemiology can be taken into account for closure of schools in particular areas to prevent disease spread in future. The safeguards suggested by IAPSM while reopening schools include proper ventilation in classrooms, avoiding morning assembly for the entire school and training teachers to identify respiratory symptoms. The expert group has also recommended linking the schools to local health facilities or strengthening the school health programmes. On the need for vaccination among children, the IAPSM states that there is no evidence that vaccination for kids is essential. “In more than 175 countries, schools are open but no country in the world has vaccinated children younger than 12 years. The risk of moderate to severe disease is already very low among children,” IAPSM says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/health-experts-body-calls-for-reopening-all-schools/articleshow/85991181.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Roughly 124,000 people were evacuated last month from Kabul in a massive US-led airlift of the country's and other foreign nations' citizens as well as vulnerable Afghans as the Taliban took control there. The US officials have said about 100 more citizens who have said they want to leave remain in Afghanistan.  "We have facilitated the departure of four American citizens from Afghanistan via an overland route. Our Embassy greeted the Americans as they crossed the border into the third country," the official said without elaborating. US representative Ronny Jackson identified the four as being from his district in Texas, saying in a Twitter post they left "after 2 weeks & multiple life threatening attempts."  With the US troops gone, the evacuation flights over, and commercial fights avoiding Kabul's airport, which has no air traffic control, thousands of Afghans are focused on potentially hazardous overland escape.  Countries bordering Afghanistan include Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Iran.  The state department on Sunday published a declaration by around 100 countries committed to helping Afghans reach destinations outside Afghanistan. However, none of Afghanistan's neighbours signed up.  Tajikistan has pledged to accept 100,000 Afghan refugees, while Uzbekistan committed to allow transit through its territory for Americans and potentially others from Afghanistan. But it was not clear how many people, if any yet, both countries have actually allowed in.  Pakistan - home to more than 1.4 million Afghan refugees - has admitted some 2,000 Afghans employed by foreign missions, international institutions, and non-governmental groups on one-month transit visas, said a diplomatic source on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/four-americans-evacuated-from-afghanistan-overland-state-dept-official/articleshow/85991686.cms||---
---||India||Let citizens opt for early second Covid dose: HC to govt||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Monday held that not allowing citizens to have the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine early while allowing some categories such as those going abroad was discriminatory, especially when they are willing to avail of paid vaccination. Allowing pleas filed by Kitex Garments Limited and another company for early second-dose vaccination of their workers, Justice PB Suresh Kumar ordered the Central government to make changes to vaccine-booking portal CoWIN to allow citizens willing to pay for the second dose to choose between an early vaccination to be safe or a late vaccination for better efficacy. Both the central and state governments had agreed before the court that early second-dose vaccination is being allowed for some categories, such as people going abroad for jobs or studies, government officials requiring travel abroad, and those participating in the Olympics. The court held that citizens who pay for Covishield vaccine have the right to choose whether to be vaccinated after four weeks of first dose, as was originally prescribed by the government, or after 84 days as prescribed by the central government citing better efficacy. In the judgment, the court noted that vaccination is voluntary and the dosage gap prescribed by the Centre can only be considered advisory. In such circumstances, there is no reason for the central government to oppose its own decision to distribute vaccines through private hospitals to enable people to get vaccinated early, the court said. The court has also clarified that it has not given a ruling on whether citizens have a choice for early vaccination or late vaccination while availing vaccines for free from the government. Advocate Blaze K Jose had argued for Kitex that the preventing early administration of second-dose vaccines to the petitioner’s employees after having bought the vaccine at a cost of Rs 1.5crore amounts to discrimination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/let-citizens-opt-for-early-second-covid-dose-hc-to-govt/articleshow/85991685.cms||---
---||India||You’re testing our patience, Supreme Court warns government on tribunal appointments||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday tore into the Centre for deliberately dithering on appointment of members and chairpersons to crucial tribunals dealing with grievances of consumers, central government employees, companies and corporates and armed forces personnel and sternly warned of contempt action if vacancies were not filled in a week. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao spat fire at solicitor general Tushar Mehta and said the government's decision to introduce the Tribunal Reforms Bill, which was enacted by Parliament and notified on August 13 after receiving the President's assent, was clearly in total disregard of the SC's judgment. It was also of the clear prima facie view that non-appointment of members and chairpersons to tribunals, despite repeated orders by the SC and promises by the Centre, amounted to contempt of court. CJI Ramana said, "There is no respect for the Supreme Court's judgment. You are testing our patience. This much I will say." On petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act, which virtually re-enacts the provisions in the earlier law struck down as invalid by the SC in the Madras Bar Association judgment, the bench said, "We cannot have this situation, where there is Madras Bar Association judgment and the same provisions are re-enacted. This will continue. Next time we strike down a law being contrary to earlier judgment, there will be a fresh Act identical to the one struck down. It's a replica. There is virtually no difference at all... Legislature can enact a new law after taking away the basis of a SC judgment. But it cannot enact a law which is directly contrary to the SC judgment." It sought answers from the Centre on the validity of the new law as well as on making appointments to tribunals within a week. Posting the matter for further hearing on September 13, the CJI said, "I think that the government is bent upon not respecting the SC's orders and judgments. We have three options — one, stay the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 and direct the government to make the appointments; second, close down the tribunals and give the power to the high courts to take up the matters; third, we ourselves will appoint members and chairpersons to tribunals and initiate contempt of court proceedings." At one point, the bench said, "We and everyone in the legal fraternity appreciated the speed with which you appointed the nine SC judges. We do not want any confrontation with the government. But why are you taking so much time to appoint tribunal members and chairpersons? The tribunals are collapsing without members and chairpersons. Why such delay in appointments." The CJI-led bench said appointments for tribunals, including the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, National Company Law Tribunal and the appellate NCLAT, armed forces tribunal, TDSAT, central administrative tribunal, were recommended months ago by search-cum-selection committees headed by the SC judges after the candidates were cleared by the Intelligence Bureau. "Why are the recommended names, which were made strictly in accordance with the existing law, not made so far, despite repeated orders from SC? Do you have no faith in the selection panels headed by SC judges," it asked. Justice Rao said, "Some tribunals are on the verge of closure. Some are functioning with one member and that too on extension. You are emasculating the tribunals by this approach. You must realise it." The SG attempted to douse the heat by reading out a finance ministry communication promising to take a decision in two weeks on appointing those already recommended by the selection panels headed by SC judges. But it had small impact. Referring to proliferation of corporate insolvency cases under the IBC, Justice Chandrachud said, "NCLT and NCLAT are critical to the economy. They are really the cornerstones of the government policy for reconstruction and rehabilitation of the corporate sector. What has happened is, because of the large number of vacancies, NCLT and NCLAT are not able to dispose of matters in accordance with the prescribed timelines." "As per the law, there is an outer limit of 330 days for resolution of the corporate insolvency process. An SC judgment says except in exceptional cases, this is a mandatory period beyond which companies have to go for liquidation. With NCLT and NCLAT not being manned, a very critical situation has arisen. Same thing is happening to AFT. There is no reasonable possibility of resolving grievances of armed forces personnel and retired servicemen. Under the new memorandum of procedure, only those candidates who are IB cleared are considered by the search-cum-selection committees. Notwithstanding that, the names we recommended are either deleted. There is no explanation why they are deleted? It is a waste of time and energy." Not to be disheartened, the SG continued with his persuasions for some more time for making appointments. The CJI-led bench said, "We have trust and faith in you (the SG). We don't think you will advise the government to bring legislation after legislation to counter SC judgments. Some bureaucrats may be there who advise the government to make such legislation. If the SC passes a judgment, pass a law nullifying it. This is how the bureaucracy functions. But, the government has to take a call now. We are very serious. Even though we are very upset, we will give you another week to come back with instructions. On that day we will pass orders on the legislation also." Justice Chandrachud culled out the four key lacunae in the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021. He said, "There are four provisions. A person below the age of 50 years is ineligible for member or chairperson, directly contrary to the Madras Bar Association judgment. Selection committee to recommend two names from which the Centre will choose. Term of four years, which again is directly contrary to the judgment. Allowances to chairperson and members identical to that of central government officer holding a post carrying the same pay as that of chairperson and members, again directly contrary to the judgment." The CJI said, "Everyone knows what the law is, including the secretaries. One thing we want to make very clear, we are not interested in any confrontation nor are we inviting any confrontation. We are listing next Monday. By that time we expect appointments. We are issuing notices on the petitions challenging the validity of the new law. CGST Tribunal also constituted. You have to constitute the tribunals."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/youre-testing-our-patience-supreme-court-warns-government-on-tribunal-appointments/articleshow/85991811.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Will protect Texas abortion clinics that come under attack: US justice dept||WASHINGTON: The United States justice department on Monday said it would not tolerate attacks against people seeking or providing abortions in Texas, as the agency explores ways of challenging the state's recently enacted law. The law, known as SB8, leaves enforcement up to individual citizens, enabling them to sue anyone who provides or "aids or abets" an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy. US Attorney Merrick Garland said in a statement the department would “protect those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services” through a 1994 law known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act). The FACE Act prohibits the use of force and physical obstruction to interfere with a person obtaining or providing reproductive health services. Former President Bill Clinton backed the legislation in response to violence by anti-abortion activists in the 1980s and 90s. "The department will provide support from federal law enforcement when an abortion clinic or reproductive health center is under attack," Garland said, adding that he would "not tolerate violence against those seeking to obtain or provide reproductive health services." Garland said the justice department would enforce the FACE Act while it "urgently explores all options to challenge Texas SB8 in order to protect the constitutional rights of women and other persons." Texas governor Greg Abbott's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The law took effect early on Wednesday in Texas after the US Supreme Court did not act on abortion rights groups' request to block it. That suggests the Supreme Court justices are closer than ever to overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision, under which abortion rights have been protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/will-protect-texas-abortion-clinics-that-come-under-attack-us-justice-dept/articleshow/85991800.cms||---

Iran became the first country to protest against the Taliban blockading the valley north of Kabul, calling for negotiations rather than military action. Afghan crisis: Live updates"Last night's attacks are condemned in the strongest terms…and the foreign interference …. must be investigated,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh told journalists on Monday. “We are investigating it.” The Taliban said they have captured the Panjshir valley, where the resistance is being led by Ahmad Massoud, and former vice president Amrullah Saleh. Both sides maintained they retained control of the valley. But the Taliban are being helped by Pakistan, baring what has been one of the world's worst kept secret, according to reports. Read AlsoIran 'strongly' condemns Taliban offensive on Panjshir ValleyTEHRAN: Iran on Monday "strongly" condemned the Taliban's military offensive against holdout fighters in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, as the Islamist group claimed it had taken control of the area. "The news coming from Panjshir is truly worrying," Iran's foreign ministry spokesman SaeedIran has openly objected to Pakistan virtually running the show in a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Pakistan’s ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed had landed in Kabul to oversee government formation and to iron out disputes besides ensuring key roles for allies like the Haqqani network. Though Iran has been much more welcoming of the Taliban lately, Monday’s statement indicates it may not be ready to give up its influence over the Taliban resistance either, comprising as it is of mainly of Tajiks and some other minority groups. India has maintained silence in the past few days on the ongoing developments in Afghanistan. However, government sources maintained they were watching events closely and would judge them based on the actions on the ground.

The US is hurting after a particularly ill-executed withdrawal from Afghanistan that has geopolitical consequences. This may result in a global distancing from the Afghan problem, with many western powers willing to leave it to Pakistan. According to senior government sources, this could mean a return to 20 years ago when Pakistan made itself a frontline state and will look to stabilise Afghanistan in a way that the ruling dispensation is better disposed towards Islamabad rather than New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/iran-slams-pakistans-role-in-panjshir-valley-wants-probe/articleshow/85992104.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||India||Online nuptials can be registered under Special Marriage Act: HC||KOCHI: Weddings under the Special Marriage Act can be registered without insisting on physical presence of the parties, the Kerala high court said on Monday. However, the challenge was identification of both the parties by the marriage officer and one of the options for that was the use of technology like facial recognition or biometrics, the court said. Noting that the court does not have the expertise to work out modalities for use of technology for such matters, a bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Kauser Edappagath impleaded the department of information technology and the ministry of external affairs as parties in the matter. The bench directed the central government’s lawyer to seek instructions on policies on facial recognition and other data tools for identification of the parties. The court was hearing a batch of pleas referred to it by a single judge on whether a wedding under the said Act could be solemnised/registered online via video conference without insisting on the physical presence of the bride and the groom. The single judge, Justice P B Suresh Kumar, was of the view that parties to an intended marriage can certainly be permitted to solemnise it through exchange of words through video conference. However, he referred the matter to a larger bench as two other judges of the court had ruled that solemnisation of marriages under the said Act via videoconference would dilute the provisions of the Act and that physical presence of both parties was mandatory. Appearing to agree with the view of Justice Kumar and the contentions of the petitioners, the bench on Monday said, “We have no hesitation to hold that a marriage under SMA can be registered without insisting on physical presence of the parties before the marriage officer. However, the marriage officer must be in a position to identify the parties. But the manner in which such identification can be made online is a concern for us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/online-nuptials-can-be-registered-under-special-marriage-act-hc/articleshow/85992253.cms||---
---||World||Threat of terror export to J&K, Russia real: Moscow||NEW DELHI: Admitting the risk of terrorism flowing into Russia and Kashmir from Afghanistan, Russian ambassador to India Nikolay Kudashev Monday said India and Russia had "common concerns" that Afghanistan should not be used to spread terrorism. "As far as the phenomena of terror are concerned, we do share our concerns with India. There is a danger of terror being spread to the Russian territory and the territory of Kashmir. This is a matter of common concern," Kudashev told a news agency on the sidelines of an event at the Russian embassy. Russia and China had last month abstained from voting on a UNSC resolution on Afghanistan saying that it didn't name terror groups like ISIS and ETIM. Kudashev said that there was ample scope for cooperation between India and Russia on Afghanistan and both sides have been in regular touch with each other. "Both India and Russia are concerned about the situation in Afghanistan. We want an inclusive government. We want that the Afghan soil should not be a source of terror for other countries in the region," Kudashev said, adding that recognition for the government was not an immediate area of focus. Asked about Pakistan's support to terror groups operating in Afghanistan, Kudashev said Russia expects Pakistan to be among the countries that would like to see predictability and a secure environment in Afghanistan. Kudashev said tackling the threat of terror had been a matter of continued dialogue between Russia and India under multiple frameworks, including the bilateral mechanism of the counter-terror working group. "Counter-terrorism is part of each and every bilateral meeting. Rest assured we know about this danger and we are most willing to cooperate to deal with it," he said. "We are for an inclusive government in Afghanistan that can ensure sustainable development in the war-torn country. The Afghan people deserve peace, stability, and sustainable development just as any other nation in the world," Kudashev added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/threat-of-terror-export-to-jk-russia-real-moscow/articleshow/85992361.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli issued notices to the Centre, Medical Counselling Committee and National Board of Examination after hearing arguments made by senior advocates Arvind Datar and Vikas Singh, who appeared for the 27 doctors from Chhattisgarh, Goa, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Punjab. Recently, the Madras high court had upheld the 27% OBC reservation in all-India quota in government medical colleges across states but struck down the 10% EWS quota on the ground that it allowed the total reservation to go past the 50% ceiling. Datar said that these fresh writ petitions can be heard along with the petitions challenging the Madras HC order. The petitioners said that in 2007, the Supreme Court had introduced a reservation of 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs in the AIQ scheme. With the introduction of the OBC and EWS quotas, the total reservation in AIQ seats would shore up to 59.5%, which would be in breach of the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Indra Sawhney case in which a constitution bench had capped the total reservation at 50% to prevent reverse discrimination of merit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-takes-up-doctors-pils-challenging-quota-move/articleshow/85992475.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The book titled "What Really Happened in Wuhan" is written by Australian investigative journalist Sharri Markson. The book claims that the controversial research to make diseases more potent was backed by Dr Anthony Fauci, US' top infectious disease expert, Markson wrote in The Times. Markson asserted that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) was creating a database of potentially lethal viruses with the help of Shi Zhengli, famously known as the 'batwoman', in a lab with poor safety practices and no US oversight. In March 2018, two years before the pandemic struck the world -- probably from the same city/lab -- US career diplomat Rick Switzer, along with his colleague Jamie Fouss, the US consul-general in Wuhan, led a team to inspect the WIV. Switzer sent a cable to the state Department in April, and made clear how the National Institutes of Health (NIH), headed by Dr Anthony Fauci, was funding research at the Wuhan lab -- which included experimenting with coronaviruses, the Daily Mail reported. Zhengli was working on China's own version of the Global Virome Project (GVP) -- supposed to be an international collaborative effort to identify within 10 years all of the planet's viruses which have pandemic or epidemic potential in humans. The "NIH was a major funder, along with the National Science Foundation of China, of SARS research by the Wuhan Institute of Virology," read the cable, according to the report. "Last year, the institute also hosted visits from the NIH, National Science Foundation and experts from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston," it added. The book noted that despite the US's help in funding and training the lab and its technicians, only few international researchers were welcomed to work inside the facility. "So a laboratory working with the most lethal pathogens known to humankind had effectively cut off collaboration with the international community," Markson commented in the book. WIV and Zhengli came under intense scrutiny, after the coronavirus spread like wildfire throughout the world. Many governments and scientists worldwide suggested that the institute was the source of the Covid-19 outbreak, leading to multiple probes and inconclusive findings. The US, along with the probe teams of the World Health Organization, has criticised China for not cooperating with the investigation. However, Zhengli and the Chinese government have denied their role in the origin of the Covid-19. They have dismissed the Wuhan lab leak theory as "extremely impossible" and have accused the US of "political manipulation".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-cash-funded-wuhan-virus-lab-claims-new-book/articleshow/85993045.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: Over 1 crore jabs given in a day, UP & Bihar show the way||NEW DELHI: Over one crore doses of anti-Covid jabs were administered on Monday - the third time in last 11 days – with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar accounting for most number of doses administered during the day. More than 1.08 crore doses were given across the country till 9pm on Monday, of which around 29% were administered in UP and nearly 15% were given in Bihar. This assumes significance as the two states – with significant proportion of population over 60 plus – were lagging in vaccination coverage, particularly with regard to the second dose. Overall, the total number of inoculations touched nearly 70 crore on Monday with around 56.8% of the total 94 crore adult population receiving at least one dose of anti-Covid vaccines, whereas more than 17% inoculated with both doses. India achieved a record high of administering 1.41 crore doses on a single day on August 31. It had crossed the milestone of over 1 crore doses for the first time on August 27. With improved supplies of vaccines and the Centre pushing states to ramp up vaccination, the average number of daily inoculations with anti-Covid jabs has increased further this month. In September so far, an average of 70.88 lakh doses per day were administered, up from 59.29 lakh doses daily in August and 43.41 lakh a day in July, respectively. The government aims to inoculate majority of the adult population with at least one dose by October, while it is expecting to supply around 185 crore doses by December. In August, a total of 18.38 crores of doses were given, up from 13.45 crore in July. While supplies are expected to improve further, the government estimates around 20-22 crore doses in September and another 25-30 crore in October. The last two months of the year are expected to receive 35 crore doses each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-over-1-crore-jabs-given-in-a-day-up-bihar-show-the-way/articleshow/85992610.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||India, Australia to boost ties in first 2+2 ministerial talks this week||NEW DELHI: India and Australia plan to further crank up their bilateral defence ties with more combat exercises, strengthening cooperation on maritime security and intelligence-sharing, even as they also work together with the US and Japan in the ‘Quad’ strategic grouping in face of China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific. Defence minister Rajnath Singh will meet his Australian counterpart Peter Dutton on Friday in New Delhi to discuss specific measures to further expand the bilateral defence cooperation. This will be followed by the two defence ministers joining foreign minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Marise Payne for the first ‘two-plus-two’ ministerial dialogue between the two countries on Saturday. “Defence Ties with Australia have gained a lot of momentum after the relationship was upgraded to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ in June 2020. Several new steps and exchanges are being discussed,” an official said on Monday. With Australia now becoming a permanent member of the quadrilateral ‘Malabar’ naval exercise, the 25th edition of which was conducted off Gaum in the western Pacific late last month, Dutton is very keen on India joining his country’s largest biennial wargames called ‘Talisman Sabre’ in 2023, as was earlier reported by TOI. Australia believes it will further consolidate the Quad, which has declared its firm intent to deter any “coercion” in the Indo-Pacific, since the exercise already features the US and Japan as well as other countries like the UK, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand. On Monday, India and Australia also kicked off the 4th edition of their naval drills ‘Ausindex’ off Darwin. While India has deployed guided-missile frigate INS Shivalik and anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kadmatt for the exercise, Australia is taking part with frigate HMAS Warramunga and submarine HMAS Rankin as well as F-18A fighter jets and P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. “Australia and India are comprehensive strategic partners. We share a commitment to increasing the regularity and complexity of our military training so we can be confident in our ability to work effectively to respond to the maritime security needs in our region,” said Australian fleet commander Rear Admiral Mark Hammond. “Each time our nations come together, we develop further maritime interoperability by exercising more involved warfare serials demonstrating our strong commitment to an open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” he added. Indian Eastern Fleet commander Rear Admiral Tarun Sobti, in turn, said, “This exercise will further strengthen the partnership and interoperability with the Australian navy in the Indo-Pacific. We’re looking forward to adopting the best practices and building on the warfare training standards achieved in the Malabar drills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-australia-to-boost-ties-in-first-22-ministerial-talks-this-week/articleshow/85992742.cms||Rajat Pandit

Stephen Dwayne Cannada was killed in an altercation with a fellow inmate the same day he arrived at USP Terre Haute, a high-security prison in Indiana, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The 47-year-old was stabbed repeatedly by a fellow inmate, according to the people, who could not discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  It is the latest serious security issue for the federal Bureau of Prisons, which has long been plagued by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. His death comes a little more than a week after another inmate at the same prison, Michael Rudkin, was beaten to death in an altercation with a fellow prisoner.  Cannada was found unresponsive inside the Terre Haute prison around 9.30 pm Friday, the Bureau of Prisons said. USP Terre Haute is also home to the federal death row, where 13 executions were carried out in the waning months of the Trump presidency. Neither Cannada nor Rudkin was a death-row inmate.  Cannada was serving a more than eight-year prison sentence for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. He was sentenced in US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The Bureau of Prisons said staff responded immediately to the emergency call, "initiated life-saving measures" and called for emergency medical crews. Cannada was pronounced dead inside the prison by emergency medical personnel, the agency said.  Federal prisons officials said they also notified the FBI, a standard protocol when inmates are killed in federal custody.  The Terre Haute prison houses more than 1,100 male inmates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/2nd-inmate-killed-in-2-weeks-at-indiana-federal-prison/articleshow/85992802.cms||---

This ruling was given by a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and A S Bopanna while allowing an appeal filed by Madhya Pradesh government which had struck down a state government notification deleting the names of priests from revenue records as owners of temple land vested in deities. Appearing for the state, advocate Saurabh Mishra argued that the executive instructions were issued to delete the names of ‘Pujari’ (priest) from the revenue record so as to protect the temple properties from unauthorised sale by them. Appearing for the association of priests, advocate Divyakant Lahoti submitted that the ‘pujaris’ have been conferred ‘Bhumiswami (ownership)’ rights, a right which cannot be taken away by executive instructions. Writing the judgment for the bench and taking into consideration various decisions of the SC in similar issues, Justice Gupta said, “Taking into consideration the past precedents, and the fact that under the Gwalior Act, Pujari had been given right to manage the property of the temple, it is clear that it does not elevate him to the status of tenant in cultivation... Since the priest cannot be treated to be Bhumiswami, they have no right which could be protected under any of the provisions of the Code.” The SC said in the ownership column, the name of the deity alone is required to be mentioned, as the deity being a juristic person is the owner of the land. “The occupation of the land is also by the deity which is carried out by the servant or the managers on behalf of the deity. Therefore, the name of the manager or that of the priest is not required to be mentioned in the column of occupier as well,” it ruled and said that the state government did not commit any mistake in issuing executive instructions to delete priests as owners of lands belonging to deities. At the same time, the Supreme Court did not approve of the state's decision to substitute names of priests with collectors as owners of the temple land vested in deities. “We find that the name of the Collector as manager cannot be recorded in respect of property vested in the deity as the Collector cannot be a manager of all temples unless it is a temple vested with the state,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/priests-cant-be-owners-of-temple-deitys-land-says-supreme-court/articleshow/85992863.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The petitioner also wanted the court to direct the government to permit single parents to include their name alone in such documents. When the plea came up for hearing on Monday, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice P D Audikesavalu said: “It may be more appropriate if the column or columns in the printed forms permit either or both as per the wishes of the applicant.” It then adjourned the hearing to November 1. The petitioner, B Ramkumar Adityan, said children should be able to use the names of either their mother or father. Citing the steady and sizable increase in the number of single-parent adoptions in the last 30 years, he said challenges for single parent adoption had greatly reduced. Many factors may have encouraged this drift. “One such factor can be the growing acceptance of one-parent families due to divorce or separation and unmarried single women raising a child on their own. Other factors like increasing literacy and newly-found financial independence of women may have also fairly contributed in making single parent adoption popular,” he said. But still several public and private institutions and almost all documents in all departments such as affidavits, deeds, oaths, schools, banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, licences, registrations, permits, identity cards, orders, records, legal documents, official documents, court documents and applications of any nature continue to issue forms that require the father name alone and father to sign off as the guardian, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/should-have-column-for-mothers-name-too-says-madras-hc/articleshow/85992973.cms||Suresh Kumar

I will back them till the government withdraws the three farm laws,” Yadav said in Agra, where he was attending a private event. “Farmers are annadatas (providers of food). The Centre should listen to their demands, respect them and resume the dialogue with them to resolve the crisis.” At the mahapanchayat, farmer leaders had said they would use their protest platforms to mobilise support against BJP, which is in power, for the upcoming Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand assembly elections. “People will vote for change and the transformation will be historical,” Yadav said. His party will form alliances with smaller ones for 2022, he added. “The gathering of farmers in western UP and that of teachers in eastern UP (a public meeting of his party’s teachers’ wing which he addressed at Bhadohi) has shown that BJP... will not come back. It is the voice of the people,” he had tweeted earlier. About his uncle Shivpal Yadav, who broke away and formed the Pragatisheel Samajwadi (Lohia) party, he said the party “respects him and his associates and the Jaswantnagar seat (which Shivpal has been winning in an unbroken streak since 1996) will be left uncontested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/day-after-mahapanchayat-akhilesh-backs-farm-stir/articleshow/85993106.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

As she spent six days hooked to a non-invasive ventilator last week, her family kept wishing she was immunised. Kolhapur resident Shashikant Awghade (24) is camping in the corridors of St George Hospital and breaks down at the very mention of his mother who is in the ICU. Anusuya Awghade (40) is battling Covid as well as the deadly mucormycosis that has affected an eye already. “Vaccination reached our village late and even when it did, barely 50-100 doses would arrive once a week,” he told TOI, explaining why his mother couldn’t get the shot. Most Covid ICUs in Mumbai share a common feature: unvaccinated patients. In SevenHills ICU, which has nearly a third of the city’s critical Covid load, 68% haven’t had a jab: of 133, 91 haven’t taken a single shot. At St George, seven of the eight in ICU are unvaccinated. The sole exception had taken one dose. At Mulund’s Fortis Hospital ICU, five of nine admitted are partially vaccinated and two have had no shots. The most telling numbers come from an analysis at the Nesco Jumbo facility in Goregaon — of 619 Covid-19 deaths since March 2021, 93% are of the unvaccinated. TOI spoke to several families whose loved ones, who didn’t or couldn’t get a vaccine, are now fighting severe Covid-19. The reasons ranged from unavailability, ignorance, lack of awareness about the severity of disease or strong hesitancy. W D’Souza, 68, who is battling Covid pneumonia, wasn’t keen on inoculation. None of the family members of Malad girl Vibha are vaccinated either, including her 51-year-old father, mother and three siblings. The father, who works at a diamond polishing unit, said his employers promised to get him inoculated and he’s been waiting. She said they never tried to get vaccinated by visiting a centre or registering on CoWin. Kolhapur resident Shashikant said his 50-year-old father had taken both doses because he worked in a mill while he himself had got a single dose. He said his mother was open to vaccination but stocks were not easily available. She developed Covid and subsequently mucormycosis last month. The Mumbai civic corporation claims to have vaccinated 80% of the city’s population with at least one dose but the reality on ground may be different.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/more-than-2/3rd-in-mumbais-covid-icus-are-unvaccinated/articleshow/85993443.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Making a statement in the assembly, Das said the state government has been taking steps to start MBBS admissions for 100 seats and 500-bed hospital. The medical college has been jointly established by the state government and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). While the state government has allocated 21 acres of land free of cost, the NTPC has spent over Rs 350 crore for infrastructure. The state government has also sanctioned 271 posts, including 160 teaching posts, 85 non-teaching posts and 26 other posts. As demand for establishment of a second AIIMS in Sundargarh grows, the health minister said no communication has been made by the Centre in this regard even as the state government has assured complete cooperation. To provide better healthcare services to people of western Odisha and in view of robust infrastructure developed by NTPC for the Sundargarh medical college, the state government on November 24, 2020 had written a letter to the Centre to establish a second AIIMS at Sundargarh, said Das, adding he had also written a letter to the Centre on the issue on March 15. The Union health ministry formed a six-member team including director, medical education and training (DMET), Odisha as a member to look into the demand. The team that visited the Sundargarh medical college had expressed its satisfaction over the infrastructure and spoke about requirement of around 200 acre of land, which was assured by the Sundargarh collector, said the health minister. Since Sundargarh is a tribal-dominated district, the second AIIMS, which will be an institution of national repute, will cater to the healthcare need of tribal people in the region by extending quality tertiary treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/sundargarh-med-college-to-function-from-2022-23-min/articleshow/85985409.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi
---||India||Air gun surrender could be conservation’s silver bullet||ITANAGAR: In Arunachal Pradesh, where hunting has been a community practice steeped in history and culture, the ‘Air gun Surrender Abhiyan’ is spinning a new hope for conservation with over 2,000 weapons given up voluntarily since its launch in March. State environment and forests minister Mama Natung, who masterminded the initiative, said the programme is completely voluntary and is aimed at gradually easing the people into the concept of conservation. “We want to raise awareness about conservation. Arunachal covers an area of 83,743 sq km, out of which 80% is covered with forests where we have some 500 species of birds and animals, perhaps many more undiscovered. If we keep killing them, our forests will disappear,” Natung said. Over the last few months, his team has collaborated with the district administrations, forest department officials, NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) on the ground to conduct awareness drives. The programme was launched on March 17 at Lumdung village in East Kameng district where 46 air guns were surrendered. In return, the person got a certificate of appreciation. The minister also appealed to the governments of Assam and Nagaland to check killing of birds and animals in their states. “There is no geographical boundary for birds and wildlife. They move freely from one state to another. Our efforts for conservation will go in vain if people in our neighbouring states continue to kill wildlife and birds indiscriminately,” Natung said. Earlier, hunting was more of a seasonal activity, limited primarily to tribal rituals, he said. “With the proliferation of air guns and rifles, found freely in markets, hunting has increased manifold in Arunachal Pradesh,” he said. “We are also working on plans to compensate those who surrender their guns,” he said. CM Pema Khandu recently said for the campaign to be successful, it has to emerge as a people’s movementKhandu added that the campaign would be far from successful if people do not pledge ‘not to eat wild meat’. The chief minister said hunting during the festival is an ancient practice and cannot be stopped by any legal or government order but has to be pondered upon by elders and youngsters alike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/air-gun-surrender-could-be-conservations-silver-bullet/articleshow/85993470.cms||---

During the question hour, several MLAs from the BJD, BJP and Congress said there has been a spurt in crimes owing to inadequate number of police stations in the state. Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra said it is unfortunate that the government is yet to take any action on the issue despite speaker Surya Narayan Patro having directed it to address the matter earlier. Responding to the queries of the MLAs, minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra said the issue of opening more police stations and outposts in the state is under the consideration of the state government. “We have received representations from several MLAs for opening as many as 68 new police stations and 103 new outposts. The setting up of new police stations and finalising the limits of their operations is a lengthy process. We are considering the issue,” Mishra said. Taking note of the concern of the MLAs, the speaker asked Mishra to hold a meeting with the home secretary, the director general of police and the crime branch on the issue and make a statement in the house. In a separate written reply to the house, Mishra said as many as 11,456 posts of different ranks in Odisha Police have been lying vacant as on August 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/oppn-blames-inadequate-policing-for-spurt-in-crimes/articleshow/85985428.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Probe on||NEW DELHI: The defence ministry is now conducting an inquiry into the alleged forgery of records during a promotion board for selection of the second-highest rank in the Coast Guard. The inquiry by a joint secretary began after allegations of the forgery came to the fore in the service records and annual ratings of inspector-generals being considered for the rank of additional director general of the Coast Guard. "The promotion board, which was held in July for a single vacancy in the ADG-rank, has now been scrapped. The internal inquiry by the joint secretary is underway after discrepancies were found in the documents submitted for the board and the original records with the defence ministry,” said a source. “If the charges are found to be true, then the officer or officers responsible can even be dismissed from service. Strict action will be taken,” he added. While the Army, Navy and IAF are under the new department of military affairs (DMA) headed by chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat in the defence ministry, the Coast Guard is under the department of defence (DoD) led by defence secretary Ajay Kumar. Vice-Admiral rank officers from the Navy were earlier posted as the director-general of the Coast Guard, the smallest of the four armed services under the MoD. In recent years, however, officers from within the Coast Guard have made it to the top post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/records-forged-for-selection-of-coast-guard-deputy-chief-probe-on/articleshow/85993473.cms||---

The housing and urban affairs ministry has already passed eviction orders and asked Paswan’s wife and son to vacate the bungalow. It has allotted the bungalow to the new railway minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw. Sources said one of the offices in the bungalow’s premises mentions ‘Ram Vilas Paswan Smriti’ at the entrance, indicating that his family had set up a memorial of LJP leader who lived in this bungalow for nearly three decades. Paswan’s son Chirag did not respond to calls or messages from TOI. Sources in the housing and urban affairs ministry said no change has been made in the allotment after the bungalow was last allotted to Vaishnaw. The rail minister can shift to the bungalow, once Chirag, his mother and other family members vacate the house. Officials said any addition or alternation in any government accommodation is not allowed after an allotment has been cancelled. Paswan died on October 8 due to prolonged illness and there were reports that Chirag was keen to keep the bungalow till his father’s first death anniversary. Chirag, who was allotted an accommodation on 23 North Avenue, can get a bigger house after becoming a second-time MP. He, however, is not entitled to get a type-8 bungalow, which the biggest. Also, the 12 Janpath bungalow falls under the ‘general pool’ category, which can be allotted by the housing minister. Being an MP, Chirag can get a house that is under the Lok Sabha pool. The LJP got vertically split recently with its remaining five MPs accepting Chirag’s uncle Pashupati Paras as their leader. Despite being left alone, Chirag has been undertaking ‘Ashirwaad Yatra’ and has so far covered 26 districts in Bihar. Sources said as per the decision taken by the Union cabinet in 2014, there is no chance of any bungalow getting converted into a memorial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pic-of-paswan-bust-at-bungalow-triggers-squatter-speculation/articleshow/85993498.cms||---

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of an event to inaugurate the Bangabandhu Media Centre at the Press Club of India, Mahmud said India tackled the second wave of coronavirus effectively and it was a “great achievement” that the infection rate dropped from over 25% to 2%. “The Indian government has assured us that they would provide vaccines that are in the contract,” he said. Bangladesh signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII) to procure 30 million doses of vaccine. In January, India gifted 3.2 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to Bangladesh as part of its ‘neighbourhood first’ policy. Later, under the agreement, Bangladesh received seven million doses in two consignments until February. “Unfortunately, the second wave of Covid-19 hit India a few months ago. That’s why we did not get further deliveries. But I must register my thanks to the Indian government and SII. Also, India gifted us some vaccines as well,” he said, adding that the delay was attributable to domestic demand, which was at the time top priority. The first senior Bangladeshi leader to visit India since PM Modi travelled to Dhaka in March to participate in Bangladesh’s National Day celebrations, Mahmud is also likely to meet his Indian counterpart Anurag Thakur and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/india-has-assured-us-of-vaccine-says-bangladesh-minister/articleshow/85993500.cms||---
---||India||ED quizzes Mamata nephew for 9 hours in coal scam case||NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, was grilled by the Enforcement Directorate for close to nine hours at its Delhi office on Monday in connection with a money laundering case against a coal mafia and some of Banerjee’s close associates. The ‘proceeds of crime’ in the coal pilferage racket is estimated to be more than Rs 1,300 crore. The ED is investigating Banerjee, his wife Rujira and other close associates as alleged beneficiaries of the ‘proceeds of crime’ generated from the illegal coal mining. While the main accused in the scam, Anup Majhi, is still out of ED’s dragnet, two others — former Bankura police station in-charge Ashok Mishra and Vikas Mishra — have been arrested in the case. The ED has claimed that these two worked for Abhishek and had carried out illegal transactions sending out money to the UK and Thailand through hawala (illegal) channels. Vikas Mishra is brother of a former TMC youth wing secretary, Vinay Mishra, also said to be a close associate of Banerjee. Vinay Mishra fled the country sometime in November-December last year soon after CBI registered a case against Majhi and others. Mishra took citizenship of Vanuatu, a South Pacific island nation, after renouncing Indian citizenship to evade the agencies. The officials investigating the case have said the questioning of Abhishek Banerjee is in the light of its money trail that revealed the proceeds of the illegal coal mining were laundered to London and Thailand in accounts of 'close relatives' of Banerjee. Banerjee, who arrived at the ED’s office at 11 in the morning, left the agency’s office around 8 pm. After the questioning, the TMC general secretary sounded combative as he said that he will not be frightened by “all this”.. “If they think TMC will accept defeat like Congress and other parties, we will fight more vigorously. We'll go to every state where they have killed democracy," he told reporters. The TMC general secretary further said that “anyone who fights BJP is harassed”. He questioned the rationale of being summoned to Delhi when the case was registered in Kolkata. “I have been asked questions non-stop for the last eight hours. From day one, I've been asking to bring evidence, if any, against me into the public domain,” he said. Earlier in the day when he arrived at the ED office, he was more conciliatory saying he was ready to face investigation and cooperate with the agency as it was doing its job. Rujira Banerjee was summoned on September 1 but she has sought exemption and wanted the ED session to be conducted at its Kolkata office. She is facing money laundering charges with the agency having told a special PMLA court here earlier that ‘proceeds of crime’ from illegal coal mining to the tune of Rs 168 crore had been sent out of the country through hawala channels to accounts beneficially controlled by her in Thailand and London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-quizzes-mamata-nephew-for-9-hours-in-coal-scam-case/articleshow/85993533.cms||---

At a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra accused the Congress leader of posting an old picture of farmers'' protest while referring to their Sunday mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh''s Muzaffarnagar district, and said this is part of his politics of “spreading confusion and lies”. “The Congress is without a (regular) president. It is incapable of raising ground issues. That is why Sonia Gandhi holds virtual meetings with leaders of other parties while Rahul Gandhi relies on old photographs in his attempt to spread confusion for politics,” Patra told a press conference. The BJP spokesperson further said, “As a cuckoo does not build her nest and seeks comfort in nests of other birds, Rahul Gandhi also works in a similar manner.” Patra said Rahul Gandhi does not work to build his party''s organisation and doesn’t work hard. “It has become his habit to use others’ shoulders for politics,” Patra said. With protesting farmer unions hitting out at the government, Patra claimed that the Modi dispensation was always dedicated to farmers and will remain so. He cited a number of measures taken by the government, including direct transfer of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore to farmers, and record procurement and payment for their produce, to make his point. He also attacked the Congress leader for not speaking out on the alleged rape of a minor in Rajasthan and registration of an FIR against Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel''s father for his remarks allegedly targeting a community. “While Gandhi spreads confusion everywhere for his politics, he has kept quiet on these issues involving the Congress-ruled states,” the BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-cuckoo-of-indian-politics-bjp/articleshow/85993555.cms||---

With this, the total number of CBI arrests in post-poll violence cases in Bengal rose to eight. According to allegations, workers of the ruling party targeted those of the opposition party at Domjur’s Rajib Pally soon after the assembly poll results were declared. Cash and jewellery were looted during the attack while women were allegedly molested. On Monday morning, the agency detained and interrogated 13 people in connection with the case, after which two were formally arrested. “Police had earlier arrested six people who were later released on bail. If the CBI applies any new section in the case, it has to submit a prior notification in court and seek approval,” Kalyan Banerjee, Trinamool’s Serampore MP, said. Howrah BJP member Umesh Rai countered this argument and said police had deliberately slapped bailable sections on those arrested. The CBI, in a related development, has sent a letter to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) seeking details of cases that could not be registered earlier. There have been allegations that many cases, particularly those involving atrocities against women, have not been registered because the survivors are apprehensive of reprisal. Based on the feedback from the NHRC, the CBI may look into the possibility of registering these cases afresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-arrests-2-more-in-bengal-violence-case-total-now-at-8/articleshow/85993557.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||World||A curtain divides male, female students as Afghan universities reopen||Students across Afghanistan have started returning to university for the first time since the Taliban stormed to power, and in some cases females have been separated from their male peers by curtains or boards down the middle of the classroom. What happens in universities and schools across the country is being closely watched by foreign powers, who want the Islamist militant movement to respect the rights of women in return for vital aid and diplomatic engagement. When it last ruled from 1996-2001, the group banned girls from school and women from university and work. Despite assurances in recent weeks that women's rights would be honoured in accordance with Islamic law, it is unclear what that will mean in practice. Teachers and students at universities in Afghanistan's largest cities - Kabul, Kandahar and Herat - told Reuters that female students were being segregated in class, taught separately or restricted to certain parts of the campus. "Putting up curtains is not acceptable," Anjila, a 21-year-old student at Kabul University who returned to find her classroom partitioned, told Reuters by telephone. "I really felt terrible when I entered the class ... We are gradually going back to 20 years ago." Even before the Taliban took over Afghanistan, Anjila said female students sat separately from males. But classrooms were not physically divided. A document outlining guidelines for resuming class circulated by an association of private universities in Afghanistan listed measures such as the mandatory wearing of hijabs and separate entrances for female students. It also said female teachers should be hired to teach female students, and that females should be taught separately or, in smaller classes, segregated by a curtain. It was unclear if the document, seen by Reuters, represented official Taliban policy. The group's spokesperson did not immediately comment on the document, on photographs of divided classrooms or on how universities would be run. The Taliban said last week that schooling should resume but that males and females should be separated. A senior Taliban official told Reuters that classroom dividers such as curtains were "completely acceptable", and that given Afghanistan's "limited resources and manpower" it was best to "have the same teacher teaching both sides of a class." Photographs shared by Avicenna University in Kabul, and widely circulated on social media, show a grey curtain running down the centre of the classroom, with female students wearing long robes and head coverings but their faces visible. Several teachers said there was uncertainty over what rules would be imposed under the Taliban, who have yet to form a government more than three weeks after they seized Kabul with barely a shot fired in anger. Their return to power has alarmed some women, who fear they will lose the rights they fought for in the last two decades, in the face of resistance from many families and officials in the deeply conservative Muslim country. A journalism professor at Herat University in the west of the country told Reuters he decided to split his one-hour class into two halves, first teaching females and then males. Of 120 students enrolled for his course, less than a quarter showed up at school on Monday. A number of students and teachers have fled the country, and the fate of the country's thriving private media sector has suddenly been thrown into doubt. "Students were very nervous today," he said. "I told them to just keep coming and keep studying and in the coming days the new government will set the rules." Sher Azam, a 37-year-old teacher at a private university in Kabul, said his institute had given teachers the option of holding separate classes for men and women, or partitioning classrooms with curtains and boards.

---||World||Jobless Americans will have few options as benefits expire||NEW DELHI: Millions of jobless Americans lost their unemployment benefits on Monday, leaving only a handful of economic support programs for those who are still being hit financially by the year-and-a-half-old coronavirus pandemic. Two critical programs expired on Monday. One provided jobless aid to self-employed and gig workers and another provided benefits to those who have been unemployed more than six months. Further, the Biden administration's $300 weekly supplemental unemployment benefit also ran out on Monday. It's estimated that roughly 8.9 million Americans will lose all or some of these benefits. While the White House has encouraged states to keep paying the $300 weekly benefit by using money from the stimulus bills, no states have opted to do so. Many states even opted out of the federal program early after some businesses complained that they couldn't find enough people to hire. The data have shown minimal economic benefits from cutting off aid early in those states. Economists Peter McCrory and Daniel Silver of JPMorgan found "zero correlation" between job growth and state decisions to drop the federal unemployment aid, at least so far. An economist at Columbia University, Kyle Coombs, found only minimal benefits. The amount of money injected by the federal government into jobless benefits since the pandemic began is nothing short of astronomical. The roughly $650 billion, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, kept millions of Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own in their apartments, paying for food and gasoline, and keeping up with their bills. The banking industry has largely attributed the few defaults on loans this past 18 months to the government relief efforts. "The end of the pandemic unemployment benefits will be an abrupt jolt to millions of Americans who won't find a job in time for this arbitrary end to assistance," Andrew Stettner with the Century Foundation said in a report. The ending of these programs comes as the US economy has recovered from the pandemic, but with substantial gaps in the recovery. The Labour Department says there are still 5.7 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. These benefits are also ending sooner than during the previous crisis, the Great Recession. In that downturn, jobless benefits in various forms were extended from the start of the recession in 2008-2009 all the way until 2013. When those benefits finally ended, just 1.3 million people were still receiving aid. Americans still financially struggling in the pandemic will find a smaller patchwork of social support programs, both at the state level and through the federal government. The White House approved last month a 25 per cent increase in food stamp assistance, also known as SNAP benefits. That increase will continue indefinitely for those 42.7 million Americans who receive those payments. While the federal eviction moratorium has expired, roughly a dozen states — all controlled by Democrats — have extended their moratoriums, including California, New York, Washington, Illinois and Minnesota. New York's eviction moratorium was extended until January 15. The Biden administration also pushed the restart of federal student loan repayments until January. Those were supposed to have restarted this month. Those unemployed less than six months will still be able to collect their benefits, but the amount will fall back to the level that each state pays. The average weekly check is roughly $387, according to the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, but varies greatly state by state. But none of these programs will have the flexibility or direct impact as unemployment benefits being paid directly to jobless Americans, wrote JPMorgan economists McCrory and Silver. They say the loss of benefits could lead to job losses that potentially could offset any of the job gains made as the economy recovers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jobless-americans-will-have-few-options-as-benefits-expire/articleshow/85993990.cms||---

He also informed that the Taliban will address Islamabad's concerns about Pakistan based terror group 'Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan' (TTP), Samaa News reported. Mujahid also confirmed that an upcoming meeting between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Chief Lt General Faiz Hameed and Taliban senior leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. CPEC is a part of China's most ambitious project 'Belt and Road Initiative', aimed at renewing the country's historic trade routes in the coastal countries of south-east Asia. In 2015, China announced the 'China Pakistan Economic Corridor' (CPEC) project which is worth USD 46 billion. With CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India. The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometers west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail, and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East. These developments came amid reports suggest that ISI has supported the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. "Islamabad has played an important role in the formation of the Taliban, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is their creator and supporter," Author Sergio Restelli reported on the InsideOver news website. The creation of the Taliban was Islamabad's attempt to gain hold in Kabul as a part of its strategic plan to gain hold in the region, Restelli added. Several reports also claim that ISI had deployed its "cooperation agents" with the Taliban who have been involved in takeover of Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-say-they-desire-to-join-china-pakistan-economic-corridor-projects/articleshow/85994321.cms||---

However, the BJP denied the allegations and stated that the people who had been cheated by Rose Valley and other non-banking financial institutions were staging a sit-in seeking the return of their money and action against Manik Sarkar, as they claimed they had deposited the money to the organisations after he had encouraged people to do so during his tenure. “Our cadres are not involved in the incident. The people were cheated by ponzi firms during the Left Front regime which had promised that the money would be returned but nothing happened. Not only the then chief minister, many of the top CPM leaders were involved in the business, who had encouraged the people to deposit money and finally were cheated,” said Khurshed Alam, a local BJP leader. The CPM MLA of Sonamura, Shyamal Chakraborty, alleged that after getting the information of Manik Sarkar’s visit to his constituency and addressing a rally at Kathalia, the BJP had mobilised its cadres since morning. They have been abusing Sarkar but police were silent spectators. When Sarkar’s convoy were close to the venue, BJP cadres blocked his car and tried to attack him despite heavy security, Chakraborty alleged. The police said they were trying to prevent violence. But both the groups became violent at a point of time and resulted in the police having to apply mild force to manage the situation. According to reports, about a hundred BJP workers had assembled in the name of protest to prevent Sarkar from reaching his constituency and party rally. But CPM cadres in large numbers were equally prepared since morning. When they tried to prevent Sarkar, CPM cadres chased them away and three of them were injured in the melee. Sarkar expressed grave concern over the incident and asked the BJP leadership to restrain their cadres, as people are on edge over its 42-month misrule “On one hand, there is no work, no food, no basic amenities for a large number of people. On the other, the freedom of speech and expression have been taken away by this government. People have no other option but to fight back.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/cops-use-force-to-stop-clash-after-bjp-cadres-block-manik-convoy/articleshow/85988151.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

A Kankarbagh-based jeweller, Prakash Singh, who is offering a 50% discount on making charges to his customers, told this newspaper, “While girls are buying lightweight jewellery this year, women are purchasing ‘mangalsutras’ from my shop.” Vikas Kumar, the owner of another jewellery store near Dak Bungalow crossing, was happy with an increased footfall on Monday. He said, “Many customers are looking for lightweight ‘mangalsutras’.” Vishnu Agrawal, who runs a shop in Hathwa Market, pointed out that Kanchipuram silk saris were in high demand. “I suffered huge losses amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year. This time, however, the customers’ response has been great,” he added. Hartalika Teej, which is popular in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Married women observe a fast and pray for the well-being and longevity of their husbands during the festival. A Saguna Mor resident, Anshika Singh, who will celebrate her first Teej, went shopping on Monday. She said, “Since I want to perform all the rituals, I have bought ‘alta’, ‘mehndi’, mirror, comb, ‘sindoor’, and ‘bindi’.” Sanaya Bhushan, a resident of Patna City, got ‘mehndi’ applied on her hands ahead of Teej. “People say if the ‘mehndi’ turns dark, your husband adores you,” she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/markets-abuzz-with-teej-shoppers/articleshow/85986112.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Prdesh: Two-lane roads proposed from mandals to district headquarters||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy asked officials to start road works in the state once the rains recede. The CM, who reviewed the progress of roads, ports, fishing harbours and airports works at his Tadepalli camp office on Monday, also told them to start work on developing road links to fishing harbours and ports. The officials informed that road works would be taken up through Rs 6,400 crore funds provided by New Development Bank. Two-lane roads from all mandal headquarters to the district headquarters are also being planned, they said. Noting that the state received heavy rains in the last two years, the chief minister said while the rains have come as a blessing for farmers, they have also damaged roads causing inconvenience to people. “Get reports on the status of roads from the village level and prepare the tenders. Start road repairs and new road works from October and complete them on time. People are witnessing the development and won’t go by the opposition’s false campaign,” he said, asking them not to worry about criticism. Jagan further wanted officials to keep an eye on the progress of national highways in the state like the Vijayawada-Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam-Sabbavaram, and Visakhapatnam-Anakapalli-Anandapuram highways. Officials also presented a report on Nadikudi-Srikalahasti, Kadapa-Bengaluru, Kotipalli-Narsapur and Rayadurg-Thumkur railway line works. The CM also reviewed the works on Ramayapatnam, Bhavanapadu and Machilipatnam ports during the meeting and studied the report on the progress of work on fishing harbours at Uppada, Machilipatnam, Nizampatnam and Juvvaladinne. Five more fishing harbours at Budagatlapalem, Pudimadaka, Biyyaputhippa, Kothapatnam and Vadarevu would be taken up in the second phase. He directed officials to complete work on Bhogapuram airport at the earliest. He also asked them to work on providing international connectivity to Tirupati and Visakhapatnam airports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2-lane-roads-proposed-from-mandals-to-dist-hqs/articleshow/85987620.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Nagpur||Covid-19 cases rising, curbs to be back in Nagpur in 2-3 days: Raut||Nagpur: With Covid-19 cases reaching the double-digit figures in the last few days, restrictions will be reimposed in Nagpur within two to three days, said guardian minister Nitin Raut on Monday after conducting a review meeting with top officials from the administration. If implemented, Nagpur would be first district in Maharashtra to reimpose restrictions though it has much less cases than Mumbai and other districts. Collector Vimala R and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B attended the meeting where review was also taken about increase in cases of dengue.  Making his intentions clear to impose restrictions before the festival season which commences from September 10, the minister said that the shops would be allowed to operate till 4pm while the restaurants timing would be curtailed by two hours till 8pm from current 10pm. All establishments, except medical and essential shops, will remain shut on Saturday and Sunday. Declaring that Covid-19 third wave has entered the district, Raut said that he would be holding talks with various stakeholders, including the public representatives, NGOs, hotel management and shopkeepers’ associations, before imposing restrictions. Raut said that out of 13 new patients, most of them are fully vaccinated and one of them is a child. “It shows that there is no guarantee of not contracting the infection even after vaccination. Some four to five Delta Plus patients were also found earlier. We have sent 78 samples for genome sequencing and waiting for results. But at this stage, we cannot take any risk,” he said. On preparations for the projected Covid-19 third wave, the North Nagpur MLA said that they have already made arrangements at both government medical hospitals and AIIMS and in rural areas. “We will be conducting a meeting with the State Disaster Management Authority in a couple of days where guidelines would be decided on restrictions. The issue would be discussed in the state cabinet meeting as well. We will be strictly following the ICMR guidelines,” he said. While not divulging whether he had a talk with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray before deciding on the restrictions, the cabinet minister said that the CM had already reiterated that for the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, human lives were more precious than festivals. The guardian minister said since cases are multiplying, there is no other way out to prevent its spread. “Prior to the second wave, I had tried to impose similar restrictions, but many opposed it strongly under one or other pretext and results are there to see. This time, our administration is fully prepared for the third wave, but restrictions are necessary to save lives,” he said. Responding to a query on oxygen supply, Raut said that unlike the second wave this time the city has sufficient stock along with that of ventilators and beds. “We have also told the doctors to be ready for the third wave. Unfortunately, the citizens are taking the warnings lightly and not following the protocols like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. Therefore, the curbs on their movements are a must.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-19-cases-rising-curbs-to-be-back-in-nagpur-in-2-3-days-raut/articleshow/85990785.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The team led by joint secretary in the Union home ministry, R K Singh, held a meeting with the state disaster management department (DMD) officials before visiting Darbhanga on Monday itself.  They would assess the damages in Bhagalpur on Tuesday, DMD sources said. The central team will have a meeting with chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, DMD senior officials and heads of other departments before returning to Delhi on Tuesday evening. “It will be a debriefing meeting. The central team will like to have some more information and details from the state government officials, or answers to some queries, if any,” a source said, adding that the details sought by the team are normally sent by email. The state officials might also submit the details of the assistance sought by the government from the Centre against the damages caused by the flood this year. The DMD has prepared a revised note on the extent of the damages since June till now, sources said.  The central team will compare the state’s report with its own assessment and then quantify the amount of central assistance to be provided by the Centre. Incidentally, Darbhanga is still wrecked by Bagmati, which also passes through Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, Samastipur and Khagaria districts and was flowing above the danger mark at most places along the downstream on Monday. Its water level was 1.17 metre above the danger level at Benibad in Muzaffarpur and 1.14 metre at Hayaghat in Darbhanga. Darbhanga district, which is also ravaged by the Kareh besides a few other rivers, suffered a huge damage both in the township area and also in the countryside. In the Kusheshwar Asthan block, where the floodwaters accumulate before falling into the Kosi, the bund was damaged at a few points recently. As for Bhagalpur, its northern and southern areas suffered heavy damage on account of floodwaters from the Ganga and Kosi as well as a few small rivers.  The damage was severe in seven blocks of northern Bhagalpur across the Ganga and also in Bhagalpur Sadar, Sabour, Kahalgaon, Pirpainty, Nathnagar and Jagdishpur blocks. The floodwaters had breached the Ismailpur-Bindtoli bund, inundating the seven blocks of north Bhagalpur, besides entering Naugachhia town. The Kosi, notorious for causing soil erosion after the floodwaters recede, has devoured parts of a few villages like Kaharpur in Bihpur block. Moreover, NH-80 has been damaged by the floodwaters and become unmotorable at long stretches like after Sabour en route Kahalgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/central-team-to-assess-damages-in-flood-hit-darbhanga-bhagalpur/articleshow/85986413.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||Heritage panel plans int’l centre at Chandraketugarh||Kolkata: Days after Dholavira received the World Heritage tag from Unesco, members of the West Bengal Heritage Commission had visited the archaeological site at Chandraketugarh to explore plans of setting up an international centre. Dholavira’s Unesco recognition has given a boost to the commission, which has a plan in place, to begin work on setting up this centre to attract international tourists and researchers. The main attractions here are the ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to prophesiers Khana and Mihir, and Chandraketugarh Fort, and the site housing both structures is called ‘Khanamihirer Dhipi’. Antiquities from Chandraketugarh have long been available for sale in the international market. Even now, a Sunga-period pottery is on sale at barnebys.com for $2,801 (Rs 2,07,864). Though the Archaeological Survey of India protects the site officially, a lot more needs to be done to project its historical importance to the world. WBHC chairperson Shuvaprasanna told TOI the commission has over an acre to build this centre. “We visited the Chadraketugarh Museum, which has preserved the personal collection of Dilip Kumar Maite, one of the earliest collectors from Chandraketugarh. We want to start work on building an international centre for research here.” Curator of Chandraketugarh Museum Souvik Kumar Dutta said it was inaugurated on January 11, 2019. Dilip Kumar Maite’s son Dipan had donated 524 artefacts collected by his father to the museum. According to him, “Our museum, which was initiated by MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and is housed inside the Pather Sathi motel constructed by the state government in Berachanpa, has preserved only those artefacts.” The archaeological siteDutta had met with the members of WBHC on August 1. “During heavy rain, locals said semi-precious stones surfaced in the muddy water. Many homes here still possess relics — from beads and seals to coins and figurines. If this centre comes up, it will prevent smuggling and might pave the way for repatriation of Chandraketugarh-origin artefacts from across the globe,” Dutta said. Officer on special duty for West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) Basudeb Mallik paid a visit to this site on July 12 and August 1. “Archaeological dating has suggested that Chandraketugarh is approximately 2,500 years old. Some historians have linked this site to the approximately 2,300-year-old Indo-Roman maritime trade. Even IIT-Kharagpur experts have tried to establish its antiquity to Sandrocottus mentioned by Greek explorer Megasthenes. Potteries have been found there that have a distinct Roman connection. Unfortunately, it is impossible to understand the richness of the civilization by visiting the site as it stands now. A centre of international standard will create awareness, promote tourism and help people understand the importance of this place,” Mallik added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-panel-plans-intl-centre-at-chandraketugarh/articleshow/85988318.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The state government plans to transform Swaraj Maidan into Ambedkar Smriti Vanam and arrange a library and cultural centre on the premises. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy laid the foundation for the project in July 2020. Work on the project has been delayed with the shifting of offices located at Swaraj Maidan. The collector, who is inspecting the status of works, said, “The government is keen on this project. The 20-acre land is now ready and the memorial park will be developed with an estimated cost of Rs 249 crores. Old irrigation quarters are already demolished and few more constructions need to be demolished.” The statue erection will be completed by Ambedkar Jayanti on April 14, 2022 as per the instructions of the government, the collector added.

According to the CEO of the country’s most valuable life insurer, Vibha Padalkar, the Exide Life acquisition is aimed at increasing the share of agents and reducing dependence on HDFC Bank’s distribution. Speaking to TOI, Padalkar said that HDFC Life has managed to survive volatility in macro-economic conditions and regulatory changes better because of portfolio diversification. As a result, the company does not want to increase the share of unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) to beyond the present level of 25% despite surging markets. Even when it comes to the company’s best-selling investment product Sanchay Plus, it has decided to cap the extent of sales. “Bancassurance used to be around 75% of our business at one time. It’s hovering around 50% of the business. I am not saying that it will not grow. I am saying that other channels should grow faster purely from a diversification point of view,” said Padalkar. On Friday, HDFC Life had announced that it will buy Exide Life Insurance for Rs 6,687 crore. According to Padalkar, it is product diversity that has helped HDFC Life survive the shift in the regulation of ULIPs in 2010 that resulted in several other insurers losing market share. She added that it was this strategy that helped the company increase sales of protection policies during the pandemic. “Our share of agency business had shrunk because we had focused on persistency of agents and reducing complaints, which we have got right. The Exide Life acquisition helps us to expand our agency force by 40%,” said Padalkar. Pointing out that the trend was for insurance to be sold through company advisers, she said that HDFC Life had all the tools in place to improve the productivity of agents.“Exide agents would be excited to have the bouquet of products that we have to offer because we are seen as a product innovator or product factory. We have the technology for our agents to quickly onboard customers or allow them to offer a pre-approved sum assured to the client,” she said. The private insurer, which has made huge investments in digital technology and artificial intelligence, has the capability of profiling the customer and their needs once his basic information is updated. “We have a digital agent platform where they can do business without ever attending office. We have a Google-like tech solution, using which agents can get any product-related questions. This question can be asked in regional languages and forms can be filled in regional languages,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-life-to-cap-policies-channels-share-in-sales/articleshow/85990451.cms||Mayur Shetty

Earlier, platform ticket sales for people had been banned during the lockdown period. “Railways has enhanced platform ticket price to Rs50 per person at each ‘A’ category station and Rs10 per person at other categories of stations under the ECR,” the chief public relations officer (CPRO) of ECR, Rajesh Kumar, said on Monday. Welcoming the decision to restart platform ticket sales, Priya, a resident of Anisabad, said most senior citizens and women in particular were facing difficulty in climbing the stairs as railways shifted platform ticket counters to the upper floor at the PRS and UTS counters of Patna Junction. “Platform ticket counter in the main concourse area of the Patna Junction was a convenient for all categories of people visiting there,” she said. R N P Singh of Bailey Road area said majority of people would not like to stand in queue to procure platform tickets at Patna Junction or other stations as the pandemic was not yet over. “Railways should introduce an app through which people could procure platform tickets as and when required, instead of facing rush at the counters. Or, railways should install automatic machines to obtain platform tickets easily like in metropolitan cities,” he said. According to sources, railways had increased platform ticket price from Rs10 to Rs50 at 50 stations under the ECR in March 2020 to dissuade people from unnecessary rush on railway platforms during the pandemic. The number of these 50 stations included 13 in Danapur division, sources said. Railways had also increased platform ticket price to Rs50 per person at six stations under Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya division, at 11 stations under Dhanbad division, 12 stations under Samastipur and and eight under Sonepur divisions. Incidentally, all these 50 stations have restarted issuing platform tickets at Rs50 each again, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/platform-ticket-sales-resume-at-railway-stations-under-ecr/articleshow/85985711.cms||Kumod Verma

Senior counsels B Adinarayana Rao, P Veera Reddy and Vedula Venkata Ramana argued against the GOs, terming them ‘illegal’ and ‘arbitrary’. Arguing on behalf of a petitioner, Rao said the government cannot bring in arbitrary legislations in the name of providing education. He said the AP School Education Regulatory & Monitoring Commission fixed the fees arbitrarily without taking the views of school managements, nor did it consider the costs incurred by them. Rao also contended the reasoning of the commission of fixing the school fees keeping in view the financial status of less well-off parents. He said it is the constitutional obligation of elected governments under Article 21 to provide education to poor students, but it cannot pass its constitutional obligation on to private institutions. He further argued that the apex court has categorically said in several judgements that the government has only regulatory authority over private educational institutions. Justice U Durga Prasad Rao posted further hearing on the matter to Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-lacks-authority-to-fix-private-school-fees/articleshow/85987715.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Kumud Verma also told the CM that the MLA was one of the named accused in the murder case, but police had not arrested him yet. Her meeting with the CM was telecast live on different social media platforms by the state government, like that of some other complainants at the janata darbar. Kumud’s husband Dayanand Verma, a former member of the West Champaran district board, was shot dead on February 14 this year at Sirsia Chowk under Naurangia police station area in Bagaha police district. Police had lodged a murder case against four named accused, including Rinku, on the written complaint of Kumud. After inquiring from Kumud whether an FIR had been registered, the CM sent her to the DGP. After coming out of the janata darbar, Kumud told mediapersons that her husband was shot dead in front of her and in the presence of a police team led by an assistant sub-inspector, Anil Singh, of Naurangia police station. “My husband was sitting at Sirsia Chowk. Shakeel, a contractor associated with the MLA, came there and indulged in a verbal duel with my husband. I was interacting with some women at some distance. The women told me that an argument was going on with my husband. I rushed to him. I saw vidhayak ji (MLA) there. Altogether 4 four-wheelers were parked there. Some gun-toting people were with the MLA, who ordered his men, ‘goli maar do saale ko (shot him)’. And, my husband was shot in his temple and died on the spot,” Kumod told mediapersons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-tells-nitish-jdu-mla-ordered-to-kill-hubby/articleshow/85986191.cms||Madan Kumar

The foundation for the Rs 422 crore project was laid by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday. Khurshid Karim, senior project manager of Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL), which is the executing agency of the project, said: “The Ashok Rajpath area is one of the most crowded localities in the city. The traffic load on this road is quite high. This upcoming facility will help in the easier and faster movement of vehicles. With the help of this development, the traffic load on the Ashok Rajpath will be reduced and the local residents will get a better and improved alternative to commute.” He added: “For one year, we studied and planned everything on this project before finalising it. The double-decker road would be ready in the next three years." With the foundation having been laid, commuters frequenting the Ashok Rajpath are hopeful of respite from frequent snarls. Manya Singh, a resident at Patliputra Colony, said: “The double-decker flyover is much needed to ease the snarls in the area. I am very happy because going to the area at present is like a nightmare. I prepare myself for hours if I ever think of travelling through the Ashok Rajpath. The irony is that many of the important places are located in the area and you can’t avoid going there.” Surbhi Kumari, a resident of Gandhi Maidan area, is also very happy. “Its great that this flyover is getting constructed because I face huge traffic while going to my college and often reach very late. I have to leave home early to avoid getting stuck in the traffic," she said. Vipin Chaudhary, a resident of Boring Road, said one of his family members is admitted at PMCH and he has to face traffic snarls while visiting the hospital frequently. “After getting to know about the double-decker flyover coming up on the Ashok Rajpath, I am happy and relaxed as it will be very helpful for those who have to visit the PMCH,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/double-decker-flyover-to-ease-traffic-on-ashok-rajpath/articleshow/85986462.cms||---

The Ganpati festival starts from Friday. Thackeray also chaired a meeting of the state disaster management authority in the morning, where no decision on new curbs was taken. “There was no discussion of implementing any fresh restrictions like night curfew during the Ganpati festival. However, we will continue to monitor the situation,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. In his appeal, Thackeray said: “We can celebrate festivals later. Let us first prioritise the lives and health of our citizens. The situation can go out of hand in view of the spike in daily cases.” If people follow all Covid-related guidelines issued by the government, there will be no need to impose any restrictions, he said. “Who would like to impose restrictions on festivals and religious programmes? But people’s lives are important… the upcoming festive days will be crucial and the onus is on political parties to ensure things do not go out of control. So, I appeal to all political parties, including my Shiv Sena, to cancel all social and political gatherings that draw large crowds,” he said. The CM said people want to open up everything, but they do not realise the risk opening up brings with it. “The third wave of Covid is at our doorsteps. Kerala is seeing a spike of 30,000 cases daily. This is a danger signal and if we don’t take it seriously, Maharashtra will have to pay a heavy price,” he added. Senior officials who were part of the disaster management authority meeting said the ministers are of the opinion that with the downsizing of Ganpati festival, it is unlikely people will crowd in public places. For instance, all big Ganpati mandals have been asked to make arrangements for live darshan through social media platforms to discourage physical mandal visit. They said the state will continue to monitor the situation and in case the cases continue to surge, they could impose certain restrictions. But no decision was taken on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-cancel-crowd-pulling-events-says-cm-mum-on-new-curbs/articleshow/85995267.cms||---

The accused, Naresh Sah (35), was arrested and forwarded to jail on Monday. Naresh’s wife Anita Devi (30), Malti Devi (45) and Kajal Kumari (15) were admitted to the Bettiah Government Medical College and Hospital. The incident took place after Anita objected to consumption of liquor at home. That enraged her husband who thrashed her mercilessly. Apprehending trouble, she went to her neighbour Malti’s house. Naresh went there and fired with his licensed gun, causing injuries to Anita and two others. Bettiah SP Upendra Nath Verma said the weapon used in the crime had been seized. Bettiah Mufassil police station SHO Ugranath Jha said on Monday that Naresh was drunk when police arrested him. The SHO said a container full of foreign liquor was also seized from his house Sunday night. A case related to attempt to murder and under relevant sections of Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act 2016 was lodged against him. Anita, in her statement to the police, said her husband came home on leave on Saturday. He had carried a bucket full of liquor from Patiala in Punjab. “He started consuming alcohol ever since reaching home. I didn’t complain to anybody on Saturday. But he started consuming liquor again on Sunday evening and I objected to it. Then he thrashed me,” she said. “My husband used to harass me on one pretext or another,” Anita told this newspaper from the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/army-jawan-shoots-at-wife-2-others-held/articleshow/85986230.cms||Ramashankar

The minister’s statement came a day after Tej floated a new student organization named Chhatra Janshakti Parishad. While Neeraj congratulated Tej for his new venture. However, when asked if Tej would be welcomed in the BJP, the minister said there was no vacancy at present. Even a day before, BJP’s OBC Morcha national general secretary Nikhil Anand criticized Lalu for not recognising the stature of Tej and eldest daughter Misa Bharti as per their seniority in the family. “Lalu Prasad used to talk about social justice, but in his own family he has sidelined Tej and Misa and given the entire legacy to younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav,” Anand said and added that Tej was frustrated because of such treatment. However, a senior RJD leader said, “He is Lalu Ji’s son, so no action is being taken by the party. He has openly criticized senior leaders like Jagadanand Singh and Shivanand Tiwari. Now going against the party lines, he has formed his own student organization.” Tej has time and again expressed his anger over the way he has been ignored in the party, while his younger brother Tejashwi had been accepted as the leader of oppsoition in the state legislative assembly.  In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, too, Tej had formed a new front named Lalu-Rabri Morcha and even campaigned against a few RJD candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/talented-tej-ignored-by-lalu-bjp-minister/articleshow/85986276.cms||Sheezan Nezami

IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the three-hour surgery was conducted by Dr Saket Kumar of gastrosurgery department four days ago. After remaining under observation, the patient was discharged on Monday.

Several factors have contributed to this record-breaking rally in global markets, including in India. These include the unprecedented amount of fund infusions by almost all the central banks to support their respective economies, record low interest rate in most of the large markets, and investors’ urge to channelise their savings in the absence of lack of spending opportunities during the pandemic months. On Monday, the sensex ended 167 points higher at 58,297 — its third successive session of a record closing with the intra-day high at 58,516. On the NSE, the Nifty too followed a similar record-breaking trajectory and closed at a new all-time peak of 17,378 points, up 54 points on the day. Official data showed that so far in 2021, both the sensex and Nifty have rallied to fresh life-high marks around 40 times each. However, the Indian benchmarks still lag their US peers. For example, the corresponding number for the S&P500 index is 54 times. Last month, the rally got another boost after the US Fed chief said that it was unlikely to raise interest rates in a hurry. As a result, the sensex added nearly 5,000 points, or 9.4%, making India the best performing stock market in the world. Domestically, the biggest booster to investors’ wealth during the current rally since March 2020, as measured by the BSE’s market capitalisation, came from Reliance Industries that saw its market value jump by $134 billion to $210 billion now. The other significant wealth-creators are TCS, up $110 billion to $191 billion, and Infosys — up $70 billion to $110 billion now, official data showed. According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), the markets are scaling new highs led by strong earnings delivery, benign liquidity and buoyant sentiments. “Good earnings delivery (during first quarter of fiscal 2022) has boosted hopes for a solid FY22 with 30%+ projected Nifty earnings growth, on the back of a strong 15% earnings growth in FY21,” it noted. In addition to strong corporate earnings, a stable currency that’s been showing an appreciating trend in the past two weeks also attracted foreign funds into Indian markets with the net buying for 2021 at over Rs 55,000 crore, data from CDSL showed. In future, management commentaries across the board suggest an improved demand environment after June 2021, led by easing of restrictions, lower active Covid cases, and a pickup in vaccinations, the report by MOFSL noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-mcap-up-over-2x-in-18-mths-races-past-3-5tn/articleshow/85996749.cms||---

---||Goa||Second Caecilian nest recorded in Ponda taluka||Old Goa: Recently, a Caecilian nest belonging to the Ichthyophis bombayensis species has been documented at Karmale-Querim village in Ponda taluka. Caecilians are species that indicate a healthy ecosystem. The Goa landscape is known to have distribution of six species namely Gegeneophis goaensis, Gegeneophis pareshi, Gegeneophis mhadeiensis, Ichthyophis davidi, Gegeneophis danieli and Ichthyophis bombayensis. “Finding a Caecilian is actually not a rarity. But locals, who spot them, think they have seen an earthworm and some know them as ‘teliyo’. Various researchers are trying to address this,” said Nirmal Kulkarni, a herpetologist. Kulkarni said the Ichthyophis bombayensis is more commonly found in the lower landscapes of Goa. Charan Desai from SAWE said that earlier a similar nest was found in Magil wada area of Priol and the one spotted now is the second record as far as Ponda region is concerned. “There have been Caecilians recorded from Netravali, Valpoi, Keri and Sakhali areas. SAWE will take up a study in Karmale area in the near future to find out more about the amphibians there,” said Desai. “More people need to put Caecilians into the limelight so that more citizens can identify them and get interested. We must highlight Caecilians getting impacted by pesticides and fertilisers, which are being widely used now in areas where the Caecilians exist. They are indicator species of a healthy ecosystem, and chemicals can completely wipe them out. We wouldn’t even know because they are fossorial subterranean amphibian,” said Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/second-caecilian-nest-recorded-in-ponda-taluka/articleshow/85990867.cms||---

The education minister met the governor at the Raj Bhavan on Monday and apprised him of the state government’s views on the issue.

The project, which was launched in 2020, recently faced opposition in many villages. The UT administration even sought police security for electricity department staff installing smart electricity meters in villages in the face of opposition from some residents. Apprehending threat to lives of staff members, UT electricity department sought police protection through the administration. A senior UT official said that the UT electricity department has already started work on the smart metering project. In the first phase, the department has allotted work to a firm to transform 30,000 existing power meters into smart meters in sectors 29, 31, 47, 48, Industrial Area phases 1 and 2, and villages of Faida, Ram Darbar, Hallo Majra, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra and Daria. Work is likely to be completed soon. The power department will also set up a control room in Sector 18, from where it will keep a tab on consumers, the official added. Recently, the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) directed the UT administration to ensure that faulty metres were replaced on time. The JERC order reads, “The Commission has taken a serious view of the fact that the petitioner (UT electricity department) is yet to ensure full compliance. The petitioner is directed to ensure that faulty meters are replaced in a timely manner in accordance with the Supply Code Regulations, 2018.” Earlier, the UT electricity department, in its reply, had submitted, “Replacement of defective or non-functional meters is a continuous process. However, every effort is being made to ensure that faulty meters are replaced on priority. At present, very few electromechanical meters are existing and the same shall be replaced shortly. The UT electricity department submits quarterly report on the status of meters to the Commission regularly.” The JERC order said, “The petitioner had standalone revenue surplus in each year from 2016-17 to 2019-20. The projected standalone surplus for 2021-22 and cumulative revenue surplus till 2021-22 at existing tariff is expected to be 98.21 crore and Rs 345.61 crore even after discontinuing the regulatory surcharge from May 2019 and FPPCA from June 2020. The commission approves a reduction in the retail tariff for existing categories, which works out to be 9.58%.” “Even after a reduction in average tariff, the projected standalone revenue surplus at the end of 2021-22 is expected to be Rs 8.12 crore.” the order added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/union-power-secretary-to-review-smart-metering-project-today/articleshow/85988420.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Hearing a batch of petitions challenging the reported stopping of pension and other welfare schemes, Justice Battu Devanand suggested the government do proper groundwork and identify the beneficiaries in advance before launching of the scheme. The court observed that it would be painful for those who availed the benefit for some time and were declared ineligible later without being served any notices. Various petitions were filed in the HC over the monetary benefit under YSR Cheyutha scheme, which gives Rs 75,000 to the beneficiaries in four tranches over a period of four years. Several petitioners were exempted in the second year after getting the benefit in the first year. Some other petitions were filed challenging the stopping of pension. Advocate general S Sriram submitted that there have been some challenges on the ground in implementing the welfare schemes and in identification of the beneficiaries. He further admitted that there may be some cases where eligible people got exempted from the list due to negligence of some ground-level officials, but added the government has been taking corrective measures from time to time to rectify the problems. Justice Devanand said the beneficiary application process is so complex that one has to go through various stages and every stage is like an obstacle. Because of this complex process flow, 90% of people are facing problems in availing benefits from the government, the court noted. The advocate general said he would take all suggestions to the government and come up with solutions to rectify the problems on the ground. Directing the DRDA to file an affidavit on the status of payments made to the petitioners and stating the reasons if not paid yet, the high court posted further hearing on the matters to September 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/streamline-implementation-of-welfare-progs-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/85987805.cms||Srikanth Aluri

According to data from National Family Health Survey, 78.7% children and 75% women in Vizianagaram district are anaemic and suffer from malnutrition. Keeping this in mind, Vizianagaram was chosen as a pilot district to supply fortified rice to ration card holders. Distribution was launched in Bobbilli and Parvathipuram assembly constituencies, in April 2020 and May 2020, respectively. It was extended to the entire district in June 2021. Officials estimate the district needs about 1.45 lakh metric tonnes of fortified rice every year for distribution under the government supply system. A central government team, during a recent visit to the district, expressed their satisfaction over the implementation the initiative. The district officials are planning to procure rice needed for distribution from the local millers this kharif season. Vizianagaram district collector A Surya Kumari said there are misconceptions about fortified rice. “The fortification process will help avoid micronutrient deficiencies and improve essential vitamins and minerals required for healthy growth. We have asked the officials to speak on the benefits of this rice variety and create awareness among the public,” said Surya Kumari. Project director, women development & child welfare, M Rajeswari, said, “We have observed an increase in the haemoglobin levels in pregnant women consuming fortified rice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vizianagaram-leads-in-fortified-rice-distribution/articleshow/85987765.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court sets aside online admissions for Intermediate courses||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday set aside the notification issued by the Board of Intermediate Education (BIE), introducing online admission system for Intermediate courses across the state, including private colleges. The court directed admissions to be conducted as per the existing system for academic year 2021-22, adding that if the government intends to introduce a new system, it should do so after due consultation with the stakeholders and by giving wide publicity. The managements of private junior colleges, and some students had moved the high court challenging the notification issued by the BIE, stating that the new online admission system infringed upon the rights of colleges as well as students. Senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao, arguing on behalf of the colleges, told the court that the new system was introduced in a hurried manner without consulting the stakeholders. The online admission system guidelines issued by the BIE are taking away the rights of students to select the college of their choice, Rao said. “Intermediate education is the stepping stone to enter into any professional course. The choice should be left to students to select a college of their choice as the admission into Intermediate is not done on the basis of any competitive examination,” he argued. He also contended the reasons given by the government, that the system was introduced in view of the Supreme Court judgement against conducting exams amid the pandemic. The government on one hand directed conducting physical classes, while introducing online admission by citing Covid-19 as reason, he wondered. Senior counsel Dushyant Dave, arguing on behalf of BIE, said online admission system will bring in transparency into the admission process. “Students should not be forced to go around colleges for admission amid the pandemic. The system is meant to provide equal opportunity to everyone, and the decision was taken based on the recommendations of an expert committee which consulted all stakeholders,” he said.

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Farm stir has united Jats & Muslims, says BKU founder Ghulam Mohammad Jola||MEERUT: Ghulam Mohammad Jola had walked out of the farmers’ body he founded, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), after the Muzaffarnagar riots. The Tikait brothers, Naresh and Rakesh, had allegedly attended a mahapanchayat where divisive speeches were made before the riots in 2013. Jola, an influential Muslim farmer leader, broke away. The divide between Jats and Muslims ran deep for years. Now 85, Jola, who shared stage with the Tikaits on Sunday at the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat, told TOI the differences have been set aside for a cause which unites the two communities in their protest against the farm laws. “We know the riots were a way to divide us. We will not let that happen again,” Jola said on Monday. “At yesterday’s mahapanchayat, farmers were fed by Muslim dhaba owners … When I fell sick, Rakesh (Tikait) raised the ‘Allahu Akbar’ slogan on my behalf … Jats and Muslims are in it together.” Jola had founded BKU along with Mahendra Singh Tikait, father of Naresh and Rakesh, and been his close friend. After the Muzaffarnagar riots, Jola left BKU and formed the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh. Jola’s presence at the farmers’ meeting, where BKU spokesperson Rakesh raised slogans of Allahu Akbar and Har Har Mahadev as an assertion of religious unity, was significant. The stage had been set earlier this year, when BKU chief Naresh apologised for saying what he did before the riots in which 62 were killed and thousands displaced. Since then, Jola and his son Sajid Ali have been spotted with Naresh and Rakesh a couple of times. “Muslims will support everything the SKM (Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmer unions which organised Sunday’s mahapanchayat) decides. If they say we should march to Lucknow, we will. If they ask us to bring all Muslims of the country together, we will,” Jola said. “I think a big announcement is on the cards for September 27 (the day the SKM has called a Bharat bandh).” The gathering on Sunday, where lakhs of farmers from 16 states turned up, had struck a strong political note, announcing a 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' for the 2022 assembly elections in the two states. Jola said, “If Akhilesh (Yadav) and Jayant (Chaudhry) join hands and are backed by Bhim Army, no one else will get a single seat in west UP … Mayawati is finished.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farm-stir-united-jats-muslims-bku-founder-who-quit-after-2013-riots/articleshow/85986148.cms||Ishita Mishra

He also said there should not be unnecessary debate on issues like price rise and increase in the unemployment rate in the pandemic situation. Talking to mediapersons after his janata darbar, Nitish said, “Today, the most necessary thing is how to get out of this pandemic. Both the Centre and the state are working in that direction. In Bihar, we have so far vaccinated 4 crore people. The state has spent Rs10,000 crore on Covid-related works and relief measures.” Nitish said the country has been facing the pandemic for the last one and a half years. “Naturally, it has adverse impact on the country’s economic situation. The prices of certain commodities will increase and other adverse things will also happen. What can one do? …..It is all natural in the prevailing situation. But once we get over the pandemic, development works would resume at a faster pace and things would be better,” he said. When asked if he had received any response from the Centre on the state’s demand for a caste census, Nitish said, “Not so far. I will inform you as soon as I get any information in this regard. We met PM Narendra Modi with our demand and I must say that it (caste census) will benefit all sections of the society.” Nitish said people from all states were now demanding enumeration of castes population during the forthcoming census 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-need-to-debate-price-rise-nitish/articleshow/85986142.cms||Madan Kumar

The festival will commence on Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Ganesh is believed to be the remover of obstacles, patron of arts and sciences, and god of intellect and wisdom. Despite the lurking fear of a possible third Covid wave, devotees are gearing up to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with utmost fervour. Even artists, who faced huge losses during the pandemic last year, are giving final touches to the idols of Lord Ganesh in different parts of the city. Sharda Devi, an artisan on Hartali Mor, told this newspaper, “Although 2020 was a nightmare, we are working hard and hope to earn well this year with Bappa’s blessings.” Another artisan, Abhijeet Kumar Singh, said he and other workers had been preparing Lord Ganesh idols since last month. Meanwhile, a huge pandal has been erected at Maharashtra Mandal on Daroga Rai Path where a 3-foot-tall idol of Lord Ganesh will be installed. “Colourful lights that will illuminate the pandal have been brought from West Bengal,” Vishnu Rajat, an artist, pointed out. In view of the pandemic, the 10-day Vinayak Utsav will be celebrated for five days at the Maharashtra Mandal. Its secretary, Sanjay Bhosle, said all the Covid safety protocols would be followed. The Vyapar Mandal in Danapur, which has also been celebrating the festival for the last 30 years, has decided not to install an idol of Lord Ganesh this time with a view to keeping Covid at bay. “Just like last year, Vinayak Utsav will be a low-key affair,” claimed Om Prakash Yadav, a representative of the Vyapar Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnaites-ready-to-welcome-lord-ganesh-with-open-arms/articleshow/85986571.cms||---

Chaos prevailed at the Covid vaccination centre as a large number of beneficiaries moved around without masks. Dr Musarraf Hussain, the medical officer of the CHC, told this reporter that 200 doses of Covishield vaccine were being administered to the people every day. “We will now focus on those who have not received their second dose yet,” he added. Asked if the CHC was facing staff shortage, Dr Hussain answered in the negative. On the contrary, a disabled teenager, Abhishek Kumar, who had been waiting for three hours to get himself inoculated at the CHC, claimed, “There is definitely a shortage of staff here. A lot of people are waiting for their turn to receive vaccine shots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chaos-prevails-at-covid-vaccination-centre-in-katihar-district/articleshow/85985741.cms||---
---||Thane||Cancel crowd-pulling events, says Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, mum on new curbs||MUMBAI: Concerned over the uptick in Covid cases in parts of the state, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday again urged political parties, social and religious groups to immediately stop all programmes that lead to crowding. The Ganpati festival starts from Friday. Thackeray also chaired a meeting of the state disaster management authority in the morning, where no decision on new curbs was taken. “There was no discussion of implementing any fresh restrictions like night curfew during the Ganpati festival. However, we will continue to monitor the situation,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar. In his appeal, Thackeray said: “We can celebrate festivals later. Let us first prioritise the lives and health of our citizens. The situation can go out of hand in view of the spike in daily cases.” If people follow all Covid-related guidelines issued by the government, there will be no need to impose any restrictions, he said. “Who would like to impose restrictions on festivals and religious programmes? But people’s lives are important… the upcoming festive days will be crucial and the onus is on political parties to ensure things do not go out of control. So, I appeal to all political parties, including my Shiv Sena, to cancel all social and political gatherings that draw large crowds,” he said. The CM said people want to open up everything, but they do not realise the risk opening up brings with it. “The third wave of Covid is at our doorsteps. Kerala is seeing a spike of 30,000 cases daily. This is a danger signal and if we don’t take it seriously, Maharashtra will have to pay a heavy price,” he added. Senior officials who were part of the disaster management authority meeting said the ministers are of the opinion that with the downsizing of Ganpati festival, it is unlikely people will crowd in public places. For instance, all big Ganpati mandals have been asked to make arrangements for live darshan through social media platforms to discourage physical mandal visit. They said the state will continue to monitor the situation and in case the cases continue to surge, they could impose certain restrictions. But no decision was taken on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-cancel-crowd-pulling-events-says-cm-mum-on-new-curbs/articleshow/85995266.cms||---

However, most of them are happy to be back to the campus amidst their teachers and friends. Ruby Rani Singh, who teaches history at St Joseph’s Convent High School, said, “Students whom I teach are very happy after coming back to the campus and meeting their friends.” She said children were coping with the resumption of offline classes, but not finding it difficult to finish their homework. At present, she said, the classes are divided in two groups on alternate days. She said the attendance was also good. In case of small children, teachers are more cautious to ensure safety protocols and help them gel with the new environment. “We remain very sensitive to the kids,” said Shibu Anwar, who teaches students of class one, two and three at a city school. However, some children are finding it hard to get up in the morning for school and some have fear of contracting Covid-19. Sangeeta Prasad, whose son studies in a noted school at Patliputra Colony said, “During the lockdown, our lifestyle completely changed, including dinner time. My son remains stuck to the screen till late at night and finds it difficult to wake up for school in the morning.” Mehnaz Hussain said her six-year-old daughter is afraid of stepping out of her home. “She has a fear that by meeting people, she will contract Covid-19,” Mehnaz said. UNICEF advises guardians to keep an eye on the physical health, learning, emotions and behaviour of their children after they return from their schools. Parents have also been advised to carefully monitor certain signs like sadness, anger, frustration, fatigue, lack of interest in mingling with other children or finishing homework and not sleeping of eating well. Associate professor of psychiatry at NMCH, Dr Santosh Kumar, appreciated the reopening of schools, and said socialising has a good impact on personality development. However, he said increased screen time due to the use of mobile phones and laptops, have made children irritable and defiant. He advised parents to schedule their activities and fix timings for everything. “Most of the schools have alternate offline classes. So even on the online days, when they do not have to go to the school, wake them up at a fixed time. And maintain a routine. This will have positive impact on the mental and physical health of a child,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schoolchildren-happy-to-meet-teachers-friends-after-long-gap/articleshow/85986068.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Axis Bank diversity charter to empower staff, clients||MUMBAI: Axis Bank has taken several HR measures to bring equality to employees and customers from the LGBTQIA+ community as part of its strategy to promote diversity and inclusion. The private lender on Monday announced a ‘ComeAsYouAre’ charter of policies and practices that will apply to those within the organisation and customers. The bank said that this charter is in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court verdict on September 6, 2018 on Section 377, which ruled that all sexual relationships between consenting adults in private should be decriminalised. While multinational banks have already in place a diversity charter in keeping with their global practices, Axis Bank is the first among domestic lenders to publicly announce a charter. Under this charter, employees can list their partners for mediclaim benefits irrespective of gender, sex or marital status. Employees can dress following their gender or gender expression. “We recognise that employees could have gender or gender expression that’s different from their sex assigned at birth. They can choose to dress in accordance with their gender/gender expression,” the bank said. Employees can also choose to use the restroom of their choice following their gender expression/gender identity. For customers, the bank has allowed the opening of savings accounts with their same-sex partners and choose them as their nominees. Customers who are gender non-binary, gender fluid or transgender persons will have the option of choosing their title from the option of ‘Mx’ in their savings or term deposit account. “This for us is as much about the invisible markers as it is about the visible ones. We believe that it fosters a culture of innovation and leverages the multiple talent pools that exist in a rich demography like ours,” Axis Bank ED Rajesh Dahiya said. “Among our bank’s wider ESG-aligned commitments, the ‘diversity & inclusion’ agenda has been a strategic focus. Towards that, our work internally focuses on creating equitable processes and policies that allow us to create space for everyone to thrive,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-bank-diversity-charter-to-empower-staff-clients/articleshow/85990343.cms||---

As precautionary measures, separate seating arrangements are being made for senior citizens, prasad will be distributed in boxes and puja will live-streamed on social media platforms. This year, there has been a marginal increase in the number of Ganesh Pujas across the city with more residential complexes organising the festival for their residents so that they do not have to step out to visit community pujas. But healthcare experts have warned that flouting guidelines will result in a surge in Covid numbers. “We will be following all safety guidelines recommended by the government. We will have separate seating arrangements for senior citizens and ensure that others do not crowd around the pandal,” said Paramita Adhikari, cultural secretary of Greenwood Sonata in New Town that has 405 apartments. “We want to celebrate the festival but not at the cost of the safety of our residents, so everybody has been requested to follow the guidelines.” Many community pujas, too, have decided to digitally broadcast Ganesh Chaturthi proceedings so that those who are unwilling to visit the pandal. “More than 750 traders are our members and almost all of them come to offer their prayers on Ganesh Chaturthi. But many of them are elderly and there are also some who want to avoid large gatherings. For this reason, we have decided to live-stream the proceedings on Facebook on September 10,” said Mahesh Saraf, general secretary of the Posta Traders’ Welfare Association. Many organizers have decided to distribute sweets and fruits only as prasad this year. “It is easier to pack these in boxes and hand over to everybody. Nobody will be allowed to eat here to avoid any large gathering,” said Kripa Shankar Sharma, president of Salt Lake Maitri Sangha. There will be close to 1,200 Ganesh Pujas across the city and its suburbs this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-darshan-packed-prasad-this-ganesh-puja-to-avoid-crowding/articleshow/85988272.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The locals spotted the body which bore external injury marks and informed police immediately. The deceased, a resident of Rahatganj under the Bihta police station area, went missing on Saturday. His father, Vinod Rai, lodged a complaint and told police that Rahul, an autorickshaw driver, had a love affair with a woman. Agitated over the murder, the locals blocked the Khagaul-Bihta Road and disrupted vehicular traffic for over two hours. The blockade was lifted after the intervention of senior police officers, who promised to bring the culprits to justice. The SHO of Neura police outpost, Dharmendra Kumar, told this reporter that two suspects, including a woman, had been detained for interrogation. Meanwhile, some locals told police that Rahul was caught in an objectionable condition in the house of the woman on Saturday night. He was thrashed by her relatives with sticks and iron rods, leading to his death. The youth’s murder sparked off tension after which police intensified patrolling in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/body-of-22-yr-old-found-in-gunny-sack-in-patna-rural/articleshow/85986480.cms||Ramashankar

Choudhary had deserted the RJD and joined the JD(U) on August 17, 2020, a few months before the assembly polls, in a hope that the JD(U) leadership would give her a party symbol to contest either from her traditional seat Patepur or neighbouring Rajapakar (SC), both in Vaishali district. However, she was not given the JD(U) symbol to contest from any seat. Choudhary on Sunday invited mediapersons at her house in Hajipur and formally announced her decision to quit the JD(U). Choudhary told TOI that she would return to the RJD after a month. “It is the month of ‘Bhado’. I will join the RJD after the end of Bhado,” she said.

---||Business||India’s mcap up over 2x in 18 months, races past $3.5 trillion||MUMBAI: The strong bull rally that had started in late-March 2020, when global investors’ fear about the pandemic was at its peak, has taken India’s market cap to over the $3.5-trillion mark now — more than double from about $1.3 trillion then. Several factors have contributed to this record-breaking rally in global markets, including in India. These include the unprecedented amount of fund infusions by almost all the central banks to support their respective economies, record low interest rate in most of the large markets, and investors’ urge to channelise their savings in the absence of lack of spending opportunities during the pandemic months. On Monday, the sensex ended 167 points higher at 58,297 — its third successive session of a record closing with the intra-day high at 58,516. On the NSE, the Nifty too followed a similar record-breaking trajectory and closed at a new all-time peak of 17,378 points, up 54 points on the day. Official data showed that so far in 2021, both the sensex and Nifty have rallied to fresh life-high marks around 40 times each. However, the Indian benchmarks still lag their US peers. For example, the corresponding number for the S&P500 index is 54 times. Last month, the rally got another boost after the US Fed chief said that it was unlikely to raise interest rates in a hurry. As a result, the sensex added nearly 5,000 points, or 9.4%, making India the best performing stock market in the world. Domestically, the biggest booster to investors’ wealth during the current rally since March 2020, as measured by the BSE’s market capitalisation, came from Reliance Industries that saw its market value jump by $134 billion to $210 billion now. The other significant wealth-creators are TCS, up $110 billion to $191 billion, and Infosys — up $70 billion to $110 billion now, official data showed. According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), the markets are scaling new highs led by strong earnings delivery, benign liquidity and buoyant sentiments. “Good earnings delivery (during first quarter of fiscal 2022) has boosted hopes for a solid FY22 with 30%+ projected Nifty earnings growth, on the back of a strong 15% earnings growth in FY21,” it noted. In addition to strong corporate earnings, a stable currency that’s been showing an appreciating trend in the past two weeks also attracted foreign funds into Indian markets with the net buying for 2021 at over Rs 55,000 crore, data from CDSL showed. In future, management commentaries across the board suggest an improved demand environment after June 2021, led by easing of restrictions, lower active Covid cases, and a pickup in vaccinations, the report by MOFSL noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/sensex/indias-mcap-up-over-2x-in-18-mths-races-past-3-5tn/articleshow/85990614.cms||---
---||Business||Black money proceedings: Wealth order saves Yash||Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has ruled that, as Yash Birla was earlier not held liable for wealth tax on funds with Guernsey Trust, the tax authorities cannot shift their stand and launch proceedings against him under the Black Money Act for the same offshore assets. In a wealth tax litigation in January, the ITAT had passed an order in favour of Birla. The income tax authorities had stated that Birla — the beneficiary of the offshore trust — was the owner of the overseas assets as he had the power to appoint or remove the trustee. Further, bank account forms also referred to him as being the beneficial owner. However, the ITAT had held that the overseas trust was an ‘irrevocable trust’ and the trustee had the absolute discretion on distribution of income. The assets of the trust would continue to be held by the trustee and not the beneficiary. Thus, Birla cannot be liable to wealth tax on such assets. But for the financial year 2015-16, Birla was served a notice under section 10(1) of the Black Money Act. This notice was challenged and the matter was heard recently by the ITAT. The ITAT bench, comprising president P P Bhat and accountant member Shamin Yahya, took cognisance of the earlier favourable order. They pointed out that this order was not reversed by the Bombay high court. “The ITAT in wealth tax proceedings have already given a finding that the assessee was nominated as one of the several beneficiaries of an offshore irrevocable discretionary trust, settled in the year 1989 by his late maternal uncle Pratap Malpani, who was a non-resident… It is a fact on record that there are no investments which were made by the assessee or the investments were made from India.” Relying on a Supreme Court decision, the bench held that the tax authorities cannot shift their stand under different proceedings. If the ITAT had taken a decision in favour of Birla that the offshore assets do not belong to him, a contrary view cannot be taken for black money proceedings. According to tax experts, this ITAT order provides clarity as it is clear that if a taxpayer has been given a clean chit under the income tax laws as not being the real owner of offshore assets, he or she cannot be held liable under the Black Money Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/black-money-proceedings-wealth-order-saves-yash/articleshow/85990558.cms||Lubna Kably

We have received around 50 entries in all for the competition and it was indeed tough to select top four for the prizes.” Dr Balbir Shah, former medical superintendent of DMC said, “It is great to see young children participating in tree plantation drive today to safeguard nature. We should also compel government to preserve nature. Government can for example make it mandatory for citizens to plant 10 trees and submit proof of the same when getting and land registries done.” Kashmir Singh of Sekhowal village whose entire 416-acre agricultural land has been acquired by the government for industrial/textile park near here, said, “We are also participating in this exercise to preserve nature by planting trees. We are also fighting a legal battle in the courts against Glada on the issue. This battle is not only to save livelihoods of 70 poor families, but also to save Sutlej and drinking water of millions in Punjab and Rajasthan from industrial pollution.” Col C M Lakhanpal (retd.) of PAC said, “This region has some beautiful lakes also. These are special types of lakes called oxbow lakes, which are formed due to meander of the river on its flood plain. One such oxbow lake exists in this region that is so large that it touches three nearby villages — Rattangarh, Miani and Balliwal — on different sides. Such lakes on the river flood plain are beautiful gifts of nature and parts of Sutlej ecosystem that have somehow survived the land grab till date and must be preserved for the future generations. Such events will make people aware of such wonders and must be continued.” The prizes in the photography competition were won by Jaskaran Singh (1st), Ashwinder Sethi (2nd), Dr Manoj Gupta (3rd), Jagjit Singh (4th).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/environmentalists-residents-organise-photo-walk-around-mattewara-forest-area/articleshow/85990825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut said fresh curbs would be imposed in two-three days in Nagpur city after a review meeting. Coming just days ahead of the Ganpati festival, the statement went against those of deputy CM Ajit Pawar, health minister Rajesh Tope recently and Vijay Wadettiwar on Monday that no new curbs were coming. CM Thackeray too appealed to parties to hold off functions that draw crowds, but did not talk about new curbs. Raut’s concern seems to be that out of 13 new patients in Nagpur on Monday, most are fully vaccinated and one of them is a child. Daily city cases dip below 400, but +ity rate ticks upThe daily new Covid detections (383) in Mumbai on Monday dropped below 400 after six days, but again testing was not optimum. Also, worryingly, the daily test positivity rate was higher than usual. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said on Monday the state is watching the situation but has not decided to impose new curbs as of now. But Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut said more restrictions will be imposed in Nagpur before the festival season. Shop timings would be restricted to 4pm while restaurants timings would be curtailed by two hours to 8pm from the current 10pm. All establishments, except medical and essential shops, will remain shut on Saturdays and Sundays. He felt the third Covid wave had started in the city and was especially concerned as most of the local cases are being reported among fully vaccinated people. “It shows that there is no guarantee of not contracting the infection even after vaccination. Some four to five Delta-plus patients were also found earlier. We have sent 78 samples for genome sequencing and waiting for results. But at this stage, we cannot take any risk,” he said. The state’s 3,626 cases and 37 deaths took the total case tally to 64.9 lakh and fatalities to 1,37,811. Monday’s tally was the lowest since February 15 (3,365) and fatalities were lowest since March 8 (22). Navi Mumbai on Monday recorded zero Covid deaths for the first time after seven months. The last zero fatality day was February 5. Uncomfortably for Mumbai, the test positivity rate on Monday was up at 1.2%. It was less than 1% 10 days ago. The positivity rate for RT-PCR tests was higher at 1.7% while the positivity rate for antigen tests (which had dropped to less than 0.5%) has also begun rising. “The case detections were low as we couldn’t conduct more than 31,577 tests on Sunday (results are declared a day later),” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Usually over 35,000 tests are conducted in Mumbai daily. The infection’s weekly growth rate climbed to 0.06% after dropping to 0.03% three weeks ago. “There is clearly a rise in cases as the restrictions were eased. But we cannot for certain say that this is the beginning of the third wave... We need to observe for a couple more weeks for the trend to become clear,” said a doctor from the BMC’s public health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-city-cases-dip-below-400-but-ity-rate-ticks-up/articleshow/85990880.cms||---

Speaking at the meeting of Navakeralam mission, the chief minister said that the mission will have to be taken forward keeping in view the strides made in the last five years. The state could grab national attention in health and education sectors in the last five years. He said that the Harithakeralam mission could not fully achieve the goal of cleaning up all the irresponsible waste disposal. The Life mission, intended to build houses for the poor, will be completed. The chief minister said that the various department-level responsibilities should be fulfilled without delay. He assured local bodies that the funds they have spent on various Covid-19 related activities from their Plan funds will be reimbursed by the government. The chief minister also instructed that detailed guidelines for the Navakeralam mission should be ready by September 25. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the developmental works should be completed in a time-bound manner. He said that the opposition will support all such developmental initiatives of the government. The cabinet had revamped four missions that were launched during the previous LDF government. A unified Navakeralam mission, by including the Rebuild Kerala Initiative along with other missions, has been launched. As the goals under the general education protection mission that was one of the missions during the previous LDF government’s tenure has been achieved, the government scrapped it and decided to focus on quality education by launching Vidyakiranam mission. A Navakeralam mission cell has also been formed with the chief minister as its president, chief secretary as its convener, Navakeralam mission coordinator as its joint convener and the concerned ministers and secretaries as its members. The government has also decided to create 88 new posts for three years for the implementation of the second phase of the mission. Former MP and former Harithakeralam mission director T N Seema has been appointed as the coordinator of the mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/navakeralam-mission-to-unify-initiatives-cm/articleshow/85990887.cms||---

Several factors have contributed to this record-breaking rally in global markets, including in India. These include the unprecedented amount of fund infusions by almost all the central banks to support their respective economies, record low interest rate in most of the large markets, and investors’ urge to channelise their savings in the absence of lack of spending opportunities during the pandemic months. On Monday, the sensex ended 167 points higher at 58,297 — its third successive session of a record closing with the intra-day high at 58,516. On the NSE, the Nifty too followed a similar record-breaking trajectory and closed at a new all-time peak of 17,378 points, up 54 points on the day. Official data showed that so far in 2021, both the sensex and Nifty have rallied to fresh life-high marks around 40 times each. However, the Indian benchmarks still lag their US peers. For example, the corresponding number for the S&P500 index is 54 times. Last month, the rally got another boost after the US Fed chief said that it was unlikely to raise interest rates in a hurry. As a result, the sensex added nearly 5,000 points, or 9.4%, making India the best performing stock market in the world. Domestically, the biggest booster to investors’ wealth during the current rally since March 2020, as measured by the BSE’s market capitalisation, came from Reliance Industries that saw its market value jump by $134 billion to $210 billion now. The other significant wealth-creators are TCS, up $110 billion to $191 billion, and Infosys — up $70 billion to $110 billion now, official data showed. According to a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), the markets are scaling new highs led by strong earnings delivery, benign liquidity and buoyant sentiments. “Good earnings delivery (during first quarter of fiscal 2022) has boosted hopes for a solid FY22 with 30%+ projected Nifty earnings growth, on the back of a strong 15% earnings growth in FY21,” it noted.  In addition to strong corporate earnings, a stable currency that’s been showing an appreciating trend in the past two weeks also attracted foreign funds into Indian markets with the net buying for 2021 at over Rs 55,000 crore, data from CDSL showed. In future, management commentaries across the board suggest an improved demand environment after June 2021, led by easing of restrictions, lower active Covid cases, and a pickup in vaccinations, the report by MOFSL noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-mcap-up-over-2x-in-18-months-races-past-3-5-trillion/articleshow/85994528.cms||---
---||Pune||14-year-old gang-raped in Pune, eight of 13 attackers arrested||PUNE: The Wanowrie police on Sunday night arrested eight of the 13 men suspected to have gang-raped a 14-year-old girl at various locations in and around the Pune railway station between August 31 and September 1. Six of the arrested men are autorickshaw drivers, while the other two are Class IV railway employees. “On Monday night, three persons were detained for questioning in relation to the crime,” senior inspector Deepak Lagad told TOI. The police said the girl had left home around 10.30pm on August 31 to meet a friend at the railway station. But her friend did not turn up. “The traumatised girl has not yet revealed how she reached the railway station,” Lagad said. “An autorickshaw driver spotted her crying and offered to drop her back home. However, he took her to a lodge and raped her. Later, he called his friends, who took turns to rape the girl at various places before they left her on board the Pune-Jammu Tawi Jhelum express train around 5.30pm on September 2,” Lagad said. “On September 1, the girl’s parents had approached the police to report their missing daughter. We were investigating the matter and examined the CCTV footage in and around the railway station. We spotted the autorickshaw driver taking the girl, buying a ticket and leaving her in the train,” he said. “The police sent wireless messages to all railway police stations along the train route. The Chandigarh railway police found the girl on September 4 and alerted the Pune police. A police team reached Chandigarh by air on September 5 to bring the girl back to Pune. She has narrated her woes to a woman police officer,” Lagad added. On Monday, the police produced the eight arrested men before a special court, which ordered their custodial remand till September 16. Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer of the Central Railway’s Pune division, told TOI, “The police told us that two Class IV employees from the railway electrical department are among those involved in the alleged crime. Both were suspended on Monday evening.” A Central Railway officer said, “We have not received any information in relation to the incident either from our counterparts or the police in Chandigarh.” Pune DCP (zone V) Namrata Patil said, “The survivor and the suspects are not known to each other. For now, the girl is recuperating at a government hospital. Her medical test report is awaited.” Lagad said, “Based on the girl’s narration and CCTV footage, we took the autorickshaw driver into custody. He admitted to his involvement in the crime and revealed the names of his 12 others. We have since arrested seven of the 12. We have invoked charges relating to gang rape, unnatural offence, sexual assault and sexual harassment under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/8-held-on-charge-of-gang-raping-14-year-old-girl-3-detained/articleshow/85990874.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Hubballi||BJP records a thumping win in Belagavi civic polls||Belagavi: The BJP registered a historic win in the election to the Belagavi City Corporation (BCC), decimating both the Congress and the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES). Of the 58 wards in the BCC Council, the BJP won 35 seats, while the Congress won only 10.The MES has traditionally held power in the civic body, but the BJP managed to taste victory in the election to the BCC Council, wherein the polls were fought using party symbols for the first time. Experts have attributed BJP’s victory in the election, which often witnessed linguistic polarisation, to its success in wooing the Maratha community in the city.The BJP fielded candidates in 55 of the 58 wards, winning 35 of them, while the Congress, which had 45 candidates in the fray, ended with just 10 seats. The MES was reduced to two seats in the council. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) failed to taste any success in Belagavi as well – the party has drawn a blank in the polls to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council – despite having fielded 27 candidates. AIMIM, on the other hand, bagged one seat and opened its account in the city.Belagavi district in-charge minister Govind Karjol said that the people had voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in acknowledgement of the many development projects initiated by the party at the Centre and in the state. “The state government handled the pandemic very effectively,” Karjol said. Meanwhile, Belagavi South MLA Abhay Patil, who led the BJP’s campaign for the BCC Council, has emerged as a strong leader in the border district.Activist Ashok Chandaragi attributed the Congress’ poor show in the polls to former chief minister Siddaramaiah’s absence on the campaign trail. “Had he been more actively involved in the campaign, the party would have fared a lot better. However, the BJP’s victory is an indication that the people no longer want the MES, and its divisive linguistic politics. People of Belagavi have shown they do not want to encourage fringe elements,” Chandaragi said.Belagavi deputy commissioner MG Hiremath said that the urban development department would decide on the date to hold the election to the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts. “The mayor’s post has been reserved for a candidate from the general category, while the deputy mayor’s post has been reserved for a woman from the general category ,” Hiremath said. A party needs 33 votes in the BCC Council, which comprises legislators and the MP, to stake claim to the mayor’s post. With 35 seats already in its bag, the BJP faces no hurdles to claiming the mayor’s post.Mild canning at counting centreMeanwhile, Belagavi city police had to resort to mild canning to disperse the BJP supporters who gathered near BK Model School, the counting centre for the BCC election. Scores of supporters descended on the centre, showing scant regard for the safety guidelines, prompting police personnel to resort to lathi charge. Despite the DC having barred celebratory processions, supporters could be seen dancing and chanting slogans. In many of the wards, BJP workers were found bursting crackers, and participating in bike rallies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-records-a-thumping-win-in-belagavi-civic-polls/articleshow/85986204.cms||---
---||Mumbai||To put off local polls, MVA may extend terms of civic bodies||MUMBAI: Even though the Maha Vikas Aghadi government wants to defer local body polls in the state, including the election to the BMC, it is yet to decide whether it will appoint administrators or extend the terms of the local bodies. An all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday came to a consensus that local body elections should not be held until the OBC quota is restored. The state will seek empirical data on OBCs and ask for the polls to be postponed by two-three months, if required. A Sena minister said the state was yet to take a call on appointing administrators. “There are several local body polls which are due, and it won’t be politically feasible to appoint administrators at all places. Since different parties are in power in various local bodies, it is likely that the term of the respective corporations will be extended for three months till the empirical data comes through,” the minister said. The BMC elections are scheduled for February 2022, and they are important for the Shiv Sena, which has been in power in the BMC for over 30 years. Elections to 10 major municipal corporations, apart from Mumbai, are due by February. The minister said the state was going to seek empirical data on OBC representation from the state backward class commission, as required by the Supreme Court. Similarly, data from the Centre will also be sought from the SECC (Socio Economic and Caste Census) 2011. Earlier this year, SC struck down the 27% OBC quota for local body polls on the grounds that the combined quota of SCs and STs and OBCs could not exceed the 50% cap. The state’s review petition was dismissed. The SC asked for empirical data on OBCs in each local body to allow for restoration of the quota within the 50% cap. The state faces local body elections for zilla parishad and gram panchayats by December. “If administrators are appointed, it will send a message that the CM or Sena is trying to wrest control of all local bodies since administrators will be babus appointed by the CM. The opposition will claim Sena is trying to take indirect control of the corporations. As all parities are in power in local bodies, extending the term is a likely option,” the minister said. In case an administrator is appointed, usually all powers of the deliberative wing, the corporators, will go to the municipal commissioner in corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/to-put-off-local-polls-mva-may-extend-terms-of-civic-bodies-in-mumbai/articleshow/85992945.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath said marriage through videoconferencing should be allowed for marriages under Special Marriage Act (SMA) also in view of the technological advancements. The high court had earlier allowed regular marriages to be registered through videoconferencing. During the hearing, the division bench said it would have no difficulty in holding that registration of marriages under SMA through videoconferencing should be allowed. A single bench had referred the matter to the division bench last month after noticing an earlier judgment (Shitha VK vs The District Registrar – General of 2021) that requires the physical presence of parties to a marriage under SMA. Another judgment of the high court (Dioncey Augustine vs State of Kerala of 2019) that held that permitting registration of marriage under SMA through videoconferencing would trifle the solemnity of marriage and goes against the provisions of SMA was cited by the single bench. Taking a contrary view, the single bench had said registration of marriages under SMA can be allowed through videoconferencing and had referred the matter to a larger bench in view of the conflict in view with past judgments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sma-weddings-can-be-registered-without-couple-being-present/articleshow/85990954.cms||---

For the first time since Covid outbreak last year has the ministry relaxed guidelines for domestic travel under which airlines don’t have to give passengers masks, face shields or hand sanitizers. Airlines have to ensure passengers are wearing masks/face covers. “Airline operators shall keep a reserve of masks, face shields, hand-sanitizers for passengers in case of non-availability/such items need replacement,’’ said the revised August 25 guidelines, superseding guidelines of May 25, last year. “There is no requirement of usage of body coverall/apron for passengers,’’ another guideline said. “We are seeing a declining trajectory of cases across the country after a peak in reported cases during mid-May as part of the second wave,’’ it said. When cases were on the rise in March last year, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) , in a March 23 order, instructed airlines to keep the middle seat vacant for social distancing. Soon after that air travel was banned. When travel resumed in May, DGCA let airlines fill the middle seat if the passenger in that seat was given a wraparound gown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-domestic-airlines-stop-gowns-for-middle-seat-passengers/articleshow/85990958.cms||Manju V
---||Pune||6L expecting moms vaxxed in one month: Arora||Pune: About 6 lakh pregnant women availed of Covid vaccination in India after the Union government introduced a separate category for expecting mothers on the centralised Co-WIN portal, NK Arora, the chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, told TOI. The pregnant women were included in the Covid vaccination programme on July 1. But there had been no data on how many of them opted for the vaccination as the government had not introduced a separate category on the Co-WIN portal, which would help keep a record of their vaccination numbers. “Initially, the pregnant women were offered Covid vaccination under age categories just like the general public. The separate category, introduced four weeks ago on the Co-WIN portal, will also help state governments to focus on areas where there is hesitancy about taking the Covid shot,” Arora said. In Maharashtra, the state health authorities had asked the district officials to ensure manual record-keeping on the vaccination of pregnant women, but it was not up to the mark. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Maharashtra, said, “The state government had requested the Union health ministry to introduce and activate the ‘pregnant woman’ category on the Co-WIN to facilitate a tab on district-wise vaccination trends in pregnant women.” All the developed countries have a post-vaccination record-keeping system in place for pregnant women. “It is important to have data of the pregnant women who are vaccinated because they form a large segment of the population, which is at high-risk of Covid infection,” said gynaecologist Kiran Kurtkoti, vice-president, Association of Maharashtra Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies. Gynaecologist Pankaj Saorde, the vice-president of Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society, said, “Covid vaccine is approved as an emergency vaccine in this exceptional situation. No prior data about it is available as it is for other vaccines. It is more important in the case of pregnant women as they are a special class to carry out long-term follow-up and assessment. Besides, vaccination statistics, if made available and published, may encourage prospective vaccine takers to go for it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/6l-expecting-moms-vaxxed-in-one-month-arora/articleshow/85990980.cms||Umesh Isalkar

At the time of the registration of the case, senior police officials had said that inspector Vijendra Rana was on an official trip to Allahabad high court. But, six days later, there was no trace of inspector Rana. Police are now planning to issue an arrest warrant against him so that he can be brought to the police station for further investigation in the matter. TOI in its edition of September 2 had published how a fortnight of being awarded the prestigious state police gallantry medal for killing a dreaded gangster in an encounter, inspector Rana of Meerut Police was booked at his own police station under corruption charges. Rana has been booked for taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a junk dealer to let him trash a stolen truck. Ironically, the accused cop had earlier declared his police station as “corruption free”. Another constable from the same police station has also been booked for corruption with Rana in the same case. He was arrested and sent to jail as well. Inspector Rana was part of the police team that had shot dead Shiv Shakti Naidu, a dreaded gangster who had pulled off a sensational Rs 8 crore heist in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/no-trace-of-decorated-up-cop-booked-for-graft-arrest-warrant-soon/articleshow/85986266.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Dehradun||DoPT rejects U'khand officer's 'late application’ for SSC post, postal dept says ‘sent on time’||Nainital: A claim by the department of personnel and training (DoPT) that IFS (Indian Forest Service) officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi’s application for appointment as member of the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) was rejected last year due to “late submission” has been contradicted in an affidavit filed in the high court by the postal department which said the application was delivered three days before deadline. Among the reasons the DoPT had cited for rejection of Chaturvedi’s candidature was that his application was received two months after the due date. But an affidavit by the postal department in August, a copy of which is with TOI, has held that the application was delivered to DoPT via speed post before the deadline. The contradictory affidavits were filed even though both the DoPT and the postal department come under the Centre and the counsel representing the two respondents in the case is also the same. Chaturvedi, currently chief conservator of forests (research) in Uttarakhand, had approached the high court in January this year, alleging that he was the only eligible candidate out of 16 applicants for the vacancy for which an advertisement was issued in January 2020. The 2002-batch IFS officer had alleged a “criminal conspiracy” and said that the date of receipt of his application was changed and his date of birth altered to deny him the job. He has sought a CBI inquiry into the matter. The postal department’s affidavit in court, filed through Priyanka Jain, senior superintendent of post offices, said that a speed post letter was received by the New Delhi Head Post Office on the morning of March 20 and delivered to the central registry of the DoPT the same evening. The DoPT’s affidavit, filed by under-secretary, Rajbir Singh, however, informed the court that the last date for submission of application was March 23, 2020 but Chaturvedi’s letter was received on May 29 and therefore it was one of the reasons for his rejection. The affidavit goes on to say that Chaturvedi’s application was to be sent to section officer of the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions of the DoPT, but it was addressed to the secretary and sent to Room number 125-C instead of 215-C. “In the meeting on July 10, the selection committee observed that application of petitioner was received later, after last date of application,” read the affidavit. The department had also informed the court that Chaturvedi lacked a postgraduate degree from a recognised university or institution which also played a part in his rejection. Chaturvedi had said that he held a diploma from the Forest Research Institute of India (FRI) which was equivalent to the PG degree of MSc (forestry). The SSC is the largest recruitment agency in the country which conducts recruitments for various Group C as well as Group B posts for the Government of India and subordinate offices. The commission is headed by its chairman and has two members and secretary-cum-controller of examinations. Chaturvedi had applied for the post of a member. The selection committee finally named Ashok Kumar, a 1991 batch officer of Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS), for the post. Chaturvedi has been posted in Uttarakhand after his cadre was changed from Haryana by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) in view of threat to his life in August 2015. The whistleblower officer had unearthed several scams and corruption cases during his tenure in Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dopt-rejects-ukhand-officers-late-application-for-ssc-post-postal-dept-says-sent-on-time/articleshow/85986267.cms||Prashant Jha

The order reads, “A meeting to be convened with private hospitals at the level of the secretary, health to encourage them to provide oxygen generation plants in their hospitals on priority. All available information and the agencies who can be contacted for installation of oxygen generation plants to be provided to private hospitals during the meeting”. UT health secretary Yashpal Garg said they would hold a meeting with private hospitals and try to convince them to set up oxygen generation plants. “UT administration will provide them all possible help and assistance in setting up the plants. As we have seen during the second wave, oxygen plants set up at government hospitals played a major role in the fight against Coronavirus, therefore UT administration will ensure more such plants not only in government hospitals but also in private hospitals,” he added. Recently, TOI carried a report on UT’s proposal to set up oxygen plants in private hospitals of Chandigarh. To tackle a likely spread of infection among children, Government Multispecialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, has decided to set up a 32-bed dedicated paediatric ICU centre. The Sector-16 hospital already has 20-bed ICU facility for children. It has eight ventilators and 12 beds with oxygen facility at the hospital’s surgical ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/o2-plants-health-secy-to-meet-pvt-hospital-representatives/articleshow/85988643.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Metro work biggest source of dust pollution in Mumbai: Report||MUMBAI: Among the various ongoing infrastructure activities in Mumbai, the Metro rail work is the biggest source of dust pollution, revealed the World Resources Institute (WRI) in its findings submitted to the BMC. “Construction activities are contributing to almost 8% of the total emission of particulate matter. Construction of Mumbai Metro projects specially contribute to 3.2% of suspension dust,” said the report, which suggested that air quality issues should now be locally identified and tackled. The WRI recommended that Mumbai should adopt cleaner fuels and decongest traffic by shifting people to public transport. It also urged for improving waste collection mechanisms, scientific remediation of landfill sites, increase in stack heights in industries, adoption of low-sulphur fuels by Tata Power, and appointment of enforcement marshals to ensure that citizens strictly follow the anti-pollution norms. Frequent fires at landfill sites of Deonar and Kanjurmarg, besides indiscriminate frequent burning of wastes at isolated places, increase the pollution of deadly hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, the WRI report pointed out. “Paved and unpaved road dust results in high concentration of suspension dust,” the report said, suggesting a better road-sweeping and washing mechanism. Mumbai has a high annual concentration of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from roadside construction and traffic emissions from heavy duty diesel vehicles. The WRI also asked BMC for better monitoring and coordination to tackle pollution through a dedicated cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/report-metro-work-biggest-source-of-dust-pollution-in-city/articleshow/85990993.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The report will be presented before forest minister A K Saseendran on Wednesday. While monkeys will be caught and sterilized before being shifted to a shelter just like the ones set up in New Delhi, the report will suggest culling of wild boars caught in the traps to ‘address’ their rising menace. The special strategy for addressing monkey and wild boar menace is one of the eight suggestions put forward to bring down the rising man-animal conflicts in the state, sources said. One of them is setting up barriers depending on site-specific situation. Measures to resolve conflicts will include SMS alerts, radio collaring of problematic animals, translocation of problematic animals, among others. Strengthening infrastructure and human resources is another suggestion. Constituting new 24 rapid response teams to be deployed in each division. Conflict management teams will be constituted at range level and Rs 5 lakh will be utilized to buy kits containing equipment to scare away animals. Crop compensation, medical insurance and life insurance of staff will also be suggested. Currently, crop compensation is given by the forest department after the agriculture department fixes the amount of damage. The report will suggest that the agriculture department should distribute the compensation by giving them funds. For maintenance of infrastructure, the work should be entrusted with NREGS. It will also suggest participation of other departments to address conflict with elephants. LSGDs should also allocate funds for addressing conflicts in their areas. “Currently, monkey menace is limited to Wayanad and Kozhikode districts. But it will spread fast to other areas also. We will provide food to the monkeys in the shelters. For wild boars, which are 2km away from the forest limits, we will catch them with traps. No shooting of wild boars will be allowed in places close to forests. Subsidy will be given to farmers to erect fences around their farmlands. LSGDs should collaborate with it,” said a forest official, who was part of the team preparing the report. The report will also include locally-available containment measures being successfully employed by farmers, in order to promote it. However, experts are not happy with the suggestion of the department to cull wild boars, even as they admit that man-animal conflicts are rising in the state. “The absentee landlords, who are no longer actively managing the land, have increased in the state. Animals move into the lands which remain virgin. Culling wild boars is the easiest option, which is a drastic step. It is fine in areas where it is highly problematic. But once you open up culling as an option, demand will also rise to cull all other animals, including elephants. We should think of permanent site- and climate-specific solutions to manage the issue. There should be a change in the attitude of people too,” said professor Santhosh Kumar A V, department of forest biology in Kerala Agricultural University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/trap-monkeys-wild-boars-to-address-menace/articleshow/85991014.cms||T C Sreemol

So far, 84 people, of them 58 children, have died due to the suspected dengue in the last three weeks. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dinesh Kumar Premi said, “We have acquired 50 water packets, containing 25,000 Gambusia fish from Badaun district. These fish were released into ponds and places with stagnant water to stop breeding of mosquitoes.” “Mosquitoes generally have a lifecycle of 20-25 days. And they stay in stagnant water for 8-9 days. Gambusia fish eat the larvae of mosquitoes in water itself. Besides dengue, this measure will also help us contain malaria,” the CMO added. The step was taken after a team of the National Centre for Disease Control confirmed the dengue outbreak in the district. Gambusia has a voracious appetite. An adult fish can eat up to 150 mosquito larvae in eight hours. Not just UP, states and UT’s like Punjab and Delhi have used the fish to check the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. Meanwhile, on Monday, there was no let off in the number of people thronging health centres across the district. Firozabad Medical College, the largest health centre in the district, was overrun by patients. Over 400 people suffering from high fever, severe dehydration and low platelets counts were getting treatment there. Of these, about 300 were children, health department officials confirmed. The health department has set up 65 camps across the district. “Over 4,500 people, including those with fever, are undergoing treatment there,” the CMO said. Sources told TOI that at least 5,000 people in the district are bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals. To put a tab on the spread of dengue, municipal corporation officials in Firozabad district are conducting door-to-door surveys to drain out stagnant water from coolers, pots and other utensils. Anti-larval spraying is also being conducted in the affected areas. Firozabad MLA Manish Asija said, “People would not have died had the municipal corporation taken care of its responsibilities. Local authorities came into action only after chief minister Yogi Adityanath took cognizance of the situation and visited the district last week.” According to the health department officials, so far 200 cases of dengue have been confirmed in the district. On Monday, the chief minister held a meeting with senior officials in Lucknow and directed that teams of specialists from Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and King George’s Medical University be sent to Firozabad, Agra and Mathura. The teams will guide local doctors and will also oversee the treatment of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-25k-mosquito-killer-fish-introduced-in-firozabad-ponds-to-check-dengue/articleshow/85986263.cms||Deepak Lavania

The MTHL, which will connect Sewri to Nhava Sheva in Navi Mumbai, is expected to open by September 2023. Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “We will have dedicated bus lanes as the trans-harbour link must benefit common citizens, too.” He said that the number of routes and services has yet to be worked out. However, there could be services every four minutes, at least during the peak hours, Srinivas added. The MMRDA has completed around 67 per cent of the work on the project. Between 50,000 and 60,000 vehicles will ply on the MTHL in the first five years, and the number will gradually increase by five per cent every year. The link is expected to reduce travel time by one hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dedicated-bus-lanes-for-mumbai-trans-harbour-link/articleshow/85993047.cms||Manthank Mehta

Justice Rekha Palli pointed out that the ban was a policy decision of the government but asked the petitioner, Association of Wellness Ayurveda & Spa, to file an affidavit listing its members and action taken by the authorities for violating the ban. TimesViewTraders and businessmen have suffered serious losses due to Covid-19. Efforts should be made to improve their lot, facilitate the revival of their businesses. The opposite seems to be happening. The authorities concerned must look into the matter and ensure that they don’t suffer.Delhi government stated that the guidelines prohibiting cross-gender massages, evolved by a lieutenant governor-appointed taskforce, were in relation to the grant of health trade licences and were yet to be notified as law. The taskforce was set up following a reference received by the LG from Delhi Commission for Women on the working of spas, the counsel informed the court. However, the court responded that the grievance of the association was that such a guideline was being made by the authorities. They have the right to challenge if these are being followed, the court observed. On their part, the petitioners maintained the ban was unconstitutional and in violation of Article 19(1)(g). It is irrational, discriminatory and a great setback for the industry, said the lawyer. The petitioners complained that, based on the guidelines, which were not in the public domain, two spas had been closed and others were being threatened with closure by the officials. “Every industry, workplace and businesses have some bad apples, but that doesn’t mean that every spa centre across the state is running a prostitution and human trafficking racket,” the plea argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-hc-against-ban-on-cross-gender-massage-in-spas/articleshow/85991006.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mucormycosis cases drop in Maharashtra, but 1,700+ on treatment||MUMBAI: Mucormycosis has seen a significant dip in cases, but the deadly fungal infection continues to affect Covid-19 patients. In August, the state reported 161 cases of mucormycosis despite a drop in Covid-19 infections. However, August cases were a massive decline over 5,644 reported in May, 2,653 in June and 675 in July. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said over 1,700 people continue to be under treatment for mucormycosis in the state. The fungal infection that saw an exponential surge in the second wave has affected 10,104 people so far. “Mucormycosis has a mortality rate of 20%. In advanced cases, people also have to go through debilitating surgeries such as removal of eyes, jaws, which causes disfigurement. We need to remain vigilant, prevent it and detect them early,” he said. While the mortality rate for mucormycosis is maybe 20% for the state, certain districts saw a much higher death rate. Palghar had the highest death rate (45.4%) as five of the 11 confirmed mucormycosis cases succumbed to it. Washim, Ratnagiri, Satara and Jalgaon recorded a fatality rate of more than 21%. Mumbai, too, saw a mortality rate of 20% as 136 people died out of 680 admissions. In absolute numbers, Nagpur saw 467 deaths, the highest in the state. Dr Rahul Pandit, member of Covid-19 task force, believes the misuse of steroids and patients with uncontrolled sug-ar levels created a fertile ground for mucormycosis. “80% of the patients had uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Hence, monitoring sugar levels must be the sixth important parameter, in addition to temperature, BP, pulse rate, oxygensaturation and respiratory rate checks,” he said. But Dr Vasant Nagvekar, an infectious disease expert, believes that the Delta variant caused massive immune suppression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mucormycosis-cases-drop-in-state-but-1700-on-treatment/articleshow/85991049.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Plenty on their plate, but little to show for rewards||NEW DELHI: Kamlesh Bayal, an Anganwadi worker, measured the height and weight of children at an Anganwadi centre and pointed out to the mother of a two-year-old girl that the child was 10.1kg but her normal weight should have been 14kg. The 55-year-old childcare worker advised the girl’s mother on what nutritious elements she could include in her daughter’s diet. She also shared recipes for daliya, the healthy broken wheat provided under the Anganwadi scheme. Bayal later worked on updating the Anganwadi centre records. Bayal, like all Anganwadi workers, has been toiling extra hard due to the pandemic, but her labour has gone unrewarded. They have not received their full honorarium since January. Bayal, an Anganwadi worker for nearly 25 years, has received only Rs 7,003 since January when her full honorarium is Rs 9,678 per month. Anganwadi helpers have been getting around Rs 3,500 a month against the full honorarium of Rs 4,839. TimesViewAnganwadi workers serve a valuable role in our society. But they are grossly underpaid. Depriving them of over 25% from their already modest salary is unacceptable. They should be paid their dues without delay.Shivani Kaul, president, Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union, said, “The workers deserve a salary hike, but a part of their meagre honorarium has been pending for over six months. Most of them come from poor backgrounds and it becomes difficult for them to take care of their own children.” Kaul wished they were upgraded to the status of government employees. The association wants the government to increase the honorarium of Anganwadi workers and helpers to Rs 18,000 and Rs 12,000 per month, respectively. Delhi has nearly 11,000 Anganwadi workers and a similar number of helpers. They conduct online classes for pre-school children, provide food supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children and provide counselling on pregnancy and infant care. They also facilitate immunisation and health-checkups. “Apart from our primary responsibilities, we are often roped in for election-related work, fill the forms of Prime Minister Matru Vandana Yojana, conduct surveys, have even been visiting houses falling under our Anganwadi centre to check if people have Covid symptoms,” said an Anganwadi worker. “Though our door-to-door visits increased during the lockdowns, we were not even provided basic protective gear, neither masks nor hand sanitisers by the government. And those who got infected with Covid did not receive any assistance from the government.” Poonam Rani, an Anganwadi worker in Ayanagar, talked of work pressure. “The lockdown meant we had to visit the home of each beneficiary to provide them with nutritional supplements,” said Rani. Now there is resentment over Delhi government’s decision to associate Anganwadi hubs with the Saheli Samanvay Kendra centres. An Anganwadi worker from Prem Nagar explained, “This only adds to our existing work pressure. We do not want to be part of it.” Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union has decided to stage a protest against this at Delhi Secretariat on September 7. They also said that they will demand an increment in their honorarium and facilities like state insurance, provident fund and pension. A government official who did not want to be named responded, “The honorarium of Anganwadi workers and helpers is being paid at a 60: 40 between the central government and state. The state’s share of the honorarium has been paid up to July 2021. However, the Centre’s share will be paid only when use of the funds is approved by the finance department. This is currently under submission and soon a new head of accounts will be opened.” The official also claimed that the workers and beneficiaries had been given protective kits during the pandemic period. Reacting to the association with Saheli Samanvay Kendra, the official explained, SSK have been set up for integrated women and child-centric activities. However, these activities are part and parcel of the Anganwadi services being rendered to the community from the platform of the Anganwadi hub.” As for the demand of the Anganwadi workers for status as government employees, another government official said, “Anganwadi workers are honorary workers and render their services in the area of childcare development on the payment of a monthly honorarium. As Anganwadi workers are honorary workers, they cannot be declared permanent government servants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plenty-on-their-plate-but-little-to-show-for-rewards/articleshow/85991055.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Maharashtra task force bats for caution in districts of concern||PUNE: The state’s task force on Monday called for exercising caution ahead of festivities, especially in districts of concern, and follow the Covid-19 protocols strictly. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the ball was in people’s court now. “Following Covid protocols is the only way to curb the spread of the virus. If people don’t mask themselves and don’t avoid crowd ahead of festivities, we can expect the third wave sooner,” he told TOI. The health authorities highlighted the rise in Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra’s “districts of concern” over the past 10 days and expressed fear about the possible third wave beginning from these areas. Of the state’s 52,025 active patients, as many as 37,897 (72.84%) are from five districts — Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Mumbai, said additional chief secretary Dr Pradip Vyas in a presentation for family doctors on Sunday. The presentation stated that there had not been any decline in cases in the past 10 days, while the number of active cases increased slightly during this period. He said the spill over of the second wave was continuing or it was not over yet, and the state was on the threshold of the third wave. “It is up to people to act responsibly and ensure that the wave is nipped in the bud. Districts of concern should be on caution and follow all Covid protocols,” Dr Joshi said. He said the C 1.2 variant found in South Africa had been seen in just seven countries and the number of cases of the variant was not more than 100. Of the 44, 437 Covid patients reported in the past 10 days, 68% (30,313 patients) are from five districts — Pune (22%), Ahmednagar (17%), Satara (11%), Solapur and Mumbai (9% each). “The growth rate and weekly positivity rate in these districts are too high. With the Ganesh festival beginning from Friday, there are chances of cases rising there. The administration needs to take utmost care in these districts,” a senior health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-task-force-bats-for-caution-in-districts-of-concern/articleshow/85991010.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Notwithstanding the revised prices given by the Plastic Export Promotion Council for export, under-invoiced human hair is being sent out of the country through air cargo from metros. More people from Hyderabad who have not come under the scanner are involved in smuggling. ED had recently booked FEMA case after conducting searches on around 10 human hair exporters for under-invoicing and hawala transactions. Several key players in the smuggling are still operating from Hyderabad to Myanmar. Mizoram has emerged as a key transit point for banking operations for the racket. A hair exporter told TOI: “Some declaring $60 in Indian customs. They are getting money through hawala only. Smugglers are trying to ship through other companies, which were not raided by ED. Several are operating from Parsigutta, LB Nagar, Nagole, Bowenpally and Yadagirigutta.” Eluru Lok Sabha MP, Kotagiri Sridhar, in his letter to Prime Minister Narender Modi, said: “Around 99% human hair wigs and hair extension world-wide was once sourced from India because of the unique quality of hair. Myanmar and Bangladesh traders are now buying directly from middlemen. They are smuggling it out or importing from India at undervalued price of as little as one dollar per kg as against as actual price of $80 as verified in the recent export data. They then process the raw hair with cheap child labour within the border and dispatch it to China for manufacturing finished products, who in turn sells them as made in China.” Sridhar further wrote, “In Eluru parliamentary constituency alone, over the last six years, 15,000 direct unskilled jobs were lost. This would run to 8,00,000 in the country. Representations were made to several agencies. There is a need to stop the smuggling to China via Myanmar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hair-smuggling-ed-findings-just-tip-of-iceberg/articleshow/85991017.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The helicopter had taken off from Dehradun at 10.30am for Almora where the CM was to attend BJP’s election campaign rally. Dhami was accompanied by state BJP chief Madan Kaushik. Just moments before the chopper was to land, it developed a technical snag and returned to the state capital. The chopper underwent repair and after a wait of two hours, the chief minister boarded the same chopper for Almora. “It was a minor problem with the clutch and air conditioning system, but the pilot did not want to take any chances. So instead of landing in Almora, we returned to Dehradun,” Dhami told TOI. Once in Almora, the chief minister attended the Jan Ashirwad rally of the party where he announced that the government had plans to provide rail connectivity to the district. “A proposal would be sent to the Centre in this regard,” he said. The chief minister also made a slew of announcements such as the annual Shravani fair in Jageshwar temple would be named a state fair and that parking facility would be provided in Almora. He also said that 500 posts would be opened in medical colleges in the state. The CM said that governance issues should be solved at patwari level and that he has given instructions to officials for the same. The CM also said that over 20,000 vacancies have been opened for unemployed youth in the state. The age limit for applying to government services has also been extended by a year due to the pandemic. Union minister of state for defence and tourism Ajay Bhatt also said the Centre and CM Dhami had done “excellent work in the state”. “Today the opposition is saying that we have three chief ministers in less than five years. But we are like an army and our commander is Modi (PM Narendra Modi). He (Modi) named Dhami and we are with him. Every decision of the government will be in the interest of the people,” he said. State party chief Madan Kaushik added that developmental works that were halted prior to 2017 were being completed by the current government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mid-air-scare-for-ukhand-cm-as-chopper-develops-minor-snag/articleshow/85986335.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Hyderabad||ATM gang targeting banks busted||Hyderabad: A gang specialising in forcing cash out of a public sector bank’s ATM/deposit-cum-withdrawal machines by exploiting a technical flaw and then reclaiming the same amount from the bank citing ‘failed transaction’ has been busted by city cops. The three fraudsters — Md Iqbal (27), a businessman from Chandan Hola in South Delhi; Ansari (31), a driver from Sultanpur in Mewat, Haryana; and Md Salam (31), a businessman also from Mewat — were arrested with Rs2.1 lakh and 23 debit cards, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said. The cops tracked them down using CCTV footage and call records. Between 2019 and 2021, about Rs6 lakh was siphoned off by the accused from four machines of PSB at Nallakunta, Saidabad and Vanasthalipuram. The four cases were being probed by the sleuths of South Zone Task Force team along with Nallakunta police. While in 2019 they targeted an old model ATM of the PSB that could be shut down by flipping a switch, in 2021 they zeroed in on deposit-cum-withdrawal machine which they stalled using a few tools. The accused made multiple transactions on all four occasions using debit cards borrowed from several people for a commission. “When the cash loads into dispenser, the accused manually stop the dispenser using certain tools before its action is completed and pull out the cash. Due to incomplete sequence of actions, the machine shows error and the accused report to the bank that they did not receive cash. The debited amount gets refunded into their accounts,” Task Force DCP G Chakravarthy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/atm-gang-targeting-banks-busted/articleshow/85991067.cms||---

The PMC had introduced the facility in 2020 because of the pandemic with 30 tanks. The civic body has urged residents to avoid immersion of idols at public places this year also amid the spread of coronavirus. As per PMC officials, the idol immersion tanks would reach the doorstep of residents. “The details of the mobile tanks would be declared soon. The number of the mobile tank operators would be displayed and publicised widely,” said a senior official of PMC. According to PMC officials, the mobile tanks would serve multiple purposes. They are eco-friendly way of immersion. The initiative would also reduce the number of residents going far away from their houses for immersion. The MNS had last year opposed the move and urged people not to use the immersion tanks. A group of party workers in Vishrambaug had even prevented devotees from immersing idols in the tanks. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-mobile-immersion-tanks-to-reach-23-merged-villages/articleshow/85991072.cms||---

The Union health ministry submitted the new data in an additional affidavit before Bombay high court on Monday in a PIL for streamlining of vaccine supply and access via the CoWin app and said, “Based on tentative vaccine doses, which are likely to be available from vaccine manufacturers in the month, ministry of health & family welfare (MoHFW) makes a state/UT-wise equitable allocation, keeping in mind pro rata population, progress of vaccination and wastage of vaccine.’’ The Centre’s August 27 affidavit set out revised guidelines of National Covid-19 vaccination programme effective since June 2021, saying the Centre procures 75% vaccines manufactured in the country and provides it free to states/UTs with “advance information’’ of doses being supplied. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-gave-extra-vaccines-to-maharashtra-in-aug/articleshow/85991101.cms||---

---||Goa||Durand Cup: FC Goa start with a win||Goalkeeper Naveen Kumar survived some anxious moments as FC Goa started their Durand Cup campaign with a 2-0 win over Army Green at the Vivekananda Yubabharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Tuesday. Army Green made the favourites sweat and could have easily created an upset, if not for their poor finishing. The Indian Super League (ISL) side have registered a strong squad with four foreigners, but head coach Juan Ferrando opted to field only Alberto Noguera in the starting 11. The Spanish midfielder gave them the lead in the 35th minute with a calm finish while Devendra Murgaokar scored the second before the hour mark. Things, however, could be different if Army Green had taken their chances early in the game even as Goa controlled the proceedings. Striker Lallawmkima was in ideal positions but shot wide on both occasions, while right-back Vikas Zanje’s attempted cross deflected and hit the crossbar after it caught Naveen off-guard. Goa took time to get into their rhythm as Noguera started deep in midfield. But when he moved forward, there were openings and Makan Chote found Noguera with a delightful through ball in the 35th minute. The Spaniard broke the off-side trap and calmly chipped over onrushing keeper Sarath Narayanan for the opener. Noguera sat out in the second half as Ferrando introduced Glan Martins, Alexander Romario and Muhammed Nemil, who impressed on his debut for the club. Just before the hour mark, Devendra timed his run to perfection and poked the ball in after a perfect low cross from Romario. Goa kept attacking but it was Narayanan, who produced a Man-of-the-Match performance as he thwarted Lalhmangaihsanga’s header and a powerful shot from Jesuraj. Goa will face I-League outfit Sudeva Delhi FC in their second game at the same venue on Monday at 3pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/durand-cup-fc-goa-start-with-a-win/articleshow/86019527.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||Meerut||Remote Uttar Pradesh village got bridge 2 years ago that led to nowhere||BIJNOR: When the new bridge over the Ganga near Balawali in Bijnor came up in 2019, the 50,000-odd people in the villages nearby were promised it would connect them to three states — Uttarakhand, Haryana and Punjab. Two years on, the bridge remains unused. No one can get there because there is no approach road leading up to it. First, because of a land dispute and then because money ran out. The project was sanctioned in 2015 and launched a year after that with a budget of Rs 40 crore. Travel times would be cut short. Haridwar, for instance, would be 50km closer. It would serve as a bypass for Muzaffarnagar. And it would take pressure off of NH-119 and NH-74. By 2019, it was fully constructed. But then, an administrative confusion held up the last leg of the project — a 200m approach road towards the Haridwar side of the bridge which was “mistakenly” identified as government land while it was a farmer’s land. The owner opposed construction on what was his land. When that dispute was resolved, officials said the budget had run out. “Work on the bridge has been completed. It is a UP government project. When the project was being planned, we had asked for reports on landholding from the revenue department. It had then said that the patch of land where the approach road was planned was government and panchayat land,” PWD executive engineer Sunil Sagar said. “Later, a land dispute cropped up. That is being sorted now. But the budget has gone up from Rs 40 crore to Rs 55 crore because of erosion by the Ganga. The revised proposal has been sent to the state government. Once that is released, the approach road will be completed.” With this, the deadline for the project, which was May 2018 and later moved to 2020, has been pushed back further. “If the bridge opens, a lot will change for us. When we go to Muzaffarnagar or Saharanpur, we have to go to Bijnor or Haridwar now. This would be a direct route,” said Lalit Joshi, a farmer from Nangal Soti village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/remote-up-village-got-bridge-2-yrs-ago-that-led-to-nowhere/articleshow/85986395.cms||Harveer Dabas

Vivek Salian, who was a computer operator, used to request his victims to share their mobiles to make a call to an unwell person. Police recovered mobiles worth Rs 1.75 lakh from Salian, which he sold for Rs2,000 each. Salian stole a Rs16,000 mobile of Delvin D’Souza, who was on his way to office on August 28. The police found the scooter headlight had an image of Jesus Christ. “We got hold of the scooter details through CCTV footage. Finally, we found the picture on his scooter. We followed his trail and kept a watch near Pawar Chawl, and nabbed him,” said DCP (zone X) Maheshwar Reddy. Salian’s arrest helped Andheri police solve at least three such thefts that he had committed under their jurisdiction. “The team of Andheri senior inspector Vijay Belge, assistant inspector Ganesh Pisal and detection staff, with the help of technical support, solved the case within 24 hours after D’Souza was his last victim on August 28,” said Reddy.

---||Agra||Now, proposal to change name of Kasganj to Kalyan Singh Nagar||Agra: Ahead of the state assembly elections, the Kasganj district council has passed a resolution to change the name of Kasganj district to Kalyan Singh Nagar, in memory of former chief minister of UP Kalyan Singh who died on August 21. Kasganj district council president Ratnesh Kashyap said the proposal was unanimously passed during a board meeting on Saturday, and it would now be sent to the state government for final approval. “Kalyan Singh had a close relation with Kasganj district. He always used to refer to Kasganj as his second home. People of Kasganj have a lot of respect for him and, therefore, it would be appropriate for the state government to name the district after him. We will pursue the demand with chief minister Yogi Adityanath," said the district council president. The Kasganj district was carved out of Etah on April 17, 2008, under the Mayawati government. During that time, the name of Kasganj district was changed to Kanshi Ram Nagar. Later in 2012, after change of the government, the then CM, Akhilesh Yadav, changed the name of Kasganj district from Kanshi Ram Nagar to Kasganj again. The state government had already announced the main road leading to Ram Janmabhoomi and five other roads in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Etah, Bulandshahr and Aligarh will be named after Kalyan Singh. CM Yogi also ordered the name of Super Specialty Cancer Hospital in Lucknow and Government Medical College in Bulandshahr after the late CM. Recently, resolutions were also passed by district councils to change the name of Firozabad district to Chandra Nagar, Aligarh to Harinagar and Mainpuri to Mayan Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/now-proposal-to-change-name-of-kasganj-to-kalyan-singh-nagar/articleshow/85986366.cms||Deepak Lavania

The BJP came in second in the election to the KCC Council, winning 23 seats, while the Congress bagged 27 seats in the civic body. “The BJP will get both the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts. There will be no operation or surgery, but the lotus will bloom in Kalaburagi,” Ravikumar said. Pointing out that the BJP had achieved its best result in Kalaburagi in this year’s elections, Ravikumar said, “We have taught the Congress a lesson. The BJP would have done much better if the voter turnout had been higher.” He said that a legislator from Kalaburagi would be allotted one of the four vacant ministerial berths in chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s cabinet. Ravikumar admitted to the saffron party suffering a setback in the civic polls in Kalaburagi owing to the failure to induct a legislator from kalyana Karnataka into the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/will-stake-claim-in-kalaburagi-with-jds-support/articleshow/85986373.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Babus’ nod for Rs 358cr to firm during President’s rule: Maharashtra govt||MUMBAI: Despite three independent committees arriving at a “much lesser” valuation, consent terms were entered into by bureaucrats during President’s rule in November 2019 to pay a “much higher” Rs 358 crore to a road contractor, the state government has told Bombay high court. It was replying to a contempt petition by Manaj Tollway Pvt Ltd, which bagged a four-lane and improvements contract for two state highways in 2013. In December 2019, HC passed a consent decree to pay Rs 358 crore to it. While Rs 1 crore was paid, Rs 357 crore was deposited in HC in the contempt plea. With HC dismissing the state’s review plea against the consent decree in March 2021, Manaj sought withdrawal of the amount with accrued interest and contempt against the state. The state’s reply countered that it, “on its own, deposited Rs 357 crore in the HC to show its bona fide.” Filed by public works department secretary, it said as consent terms were entered into by officers after the new government was formed and without its approval, the state moved for review of the consent decree. It said that out of 41 km of work awarded to Manaj on January 1, 2013, some 32km was made available. “Despite that, not a single km was four-laned by the contractor, keeping the work incomplete, and rendering the road prone to accidents.’’ On March 27, 2015, Manaj served a termination notice and unilaterally stopped work. The reply said valuation by an independent engineer, the then chief engineer and a three-chief engineer committee pegged the cost of work done highest at Rs 197 crore. A ground in the state’s review plea was that on Manaj’s request, then PWD minister had approved a one-time settlement of Rs 184 crore. It was not mentioned in the note to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to Rs 358 crore to Manaj. HC will hear the contempt plea on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-babus-nod-for-rs-358cr-to-firm-during-prez-rule-in-mumbai/articleshow/85993108.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Besides, 67,50,109 state residents have been given the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. This is higher than the national average of the vaccination coverage. Dr KS Martolia, Uttarakhand immunisation officer, told TOI, "We are ahead of the national average in terms of inoculation. While 55.7% of the adult population has received the first Covid-19 vaccine jab nationally, in Uttarakhand, we have been able to administer the first dose to 87.3% of the adult population. Similarly, we have fully vaccinated 28% of our adult population as against the national average of 16.9%." The best-performing district in terms of inoculation is Chamoli where 44.3% of the adult population has received both the doses, followed by Bageshwar (42.9%), Uttarkashi (36.9%), Rudraprayag (35.5%), Almora (35.7%), Pauri Garhwal (35.1%), Dehradun (34.6%), Champawat (33.9%), Pithoragarh (30.8%), Tehri (30.3%), and Nainital (29.8%). In Dehradun, 94.24% of the adult population — nearly 13.45 lakh people — have received the first vaccine dose. “Now, people can get their second dose without prior online booking of the slot. They can just come to a government vaccination centre with their ID and get the second jab. Also, the disabled can call/Whatsapp on 9368530756 and our teams will go to their homes to give them the vaccine shot,” said Dr Dinesh Chauhan, additional chief medical officer, Dehradun district. However, the districts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar have been lagging in the vaccination coverage. While only 17% of the adult population is fully vaccinated in Udham Singh Nagar, just 18.5% of adults have taken both the vaccine doses in Haridwar. When asked about the laggard performance of these districts, Dr Martolia said, “Our teams have worked hard towards breaking the stigma against Covid vaccines in these districts. In Haridwar, 81% of adults have now received the first vaccine dose and in US Nagar, this percentage is 79%.The percentage of fully vaccinated will soon go up in these districts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-ahead-of-national-average-in-vaccination-coverage/articleshow/85986407.cms||Shivani Azad

Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Sanjeev, considering the serious nature of the offences and the possibility that he might tamper with evidence if the relief was granted. The court said that his custodial interrogation was required to ascertain his role as well as of others in the nexus of luring people with providing jobs in Delhi Police. “I find force in the submissions of additional public prosecutor that investigation in the present case remained in infancy due to active non-cooperation of the main accused… a Delhi Police employee,” it said in the order. Sanjeev’s counsel had claimed that he had been falsely implicated in the matter as he, along with another person, had approached the complainant with a request to advance them a loan of Rs 2 lakh to start a new business.

---||Nashik||Active cases in Sinnar more than doubled in 1 month||Nashik: After the number of active cases in Sinnar taluka had dropped to 77 on August 4, the figure has more than doubled to 175 in the past month The number of active cases had dropped to 77 from over 500 during the peak time of the second wave in April. Thereafter, the number had increased to 195 by August-end before dropping to 155. “During the past seven days, the number of active cases rose from 155 to 175. Most of the cases in the taluka are from Dapur, the surrounding villages and the industrial belt of the Sinnar town,” said Dr Mohan Bachchhav, the health officer of Sinnar taluka. The health department is concerned with the rising cases in the region, most of which are from the villages bordering Nashik – Ahmednagar districts. The Ahmednagar district still has a very high presence of the infection even though the cases across Nashik district are steadily on the decline. Nandur Shingote is a major agriculture market inviting people from the adjacent areas. Being the last village in Nashik district, before the borders of Ahmednagar district begins, people from both the villages along the border in both the districts often cross over for their daily work. Bachchhav said a significant number of the cases are in Nashik city, but since their Aadhaar cards have the addresses related to Sinnar taluka, the count of these patients is added to Sinnar taluka. The officer, however, said measures were being taken to prevent the spread of the infection by way of increasing testing and tracking in the villages of Dapur and the industrial areas. “As the cases in the Sangamner taluka of Ahmednagar district increase, the cases in Sinnar also show the same trend. We have, however, intensified the testing and tracing of Covid patients. This is likely to yield results in a week,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-cases-in-sinnar-more-than-doubled-in-1-month/articleshow/85984233.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Varanasi||With 38 FIRs in their name, couple now face action under Gangster Act||Varanasi: Becoming a billionaire in a span of 10 years after starting as a travel agent and then switching over to real estate business and opening a company to attract investment from people from backward regions of several states, Vikas Singh, his wife and other accomplices are in the eye of a storm as 38 FIRs of fraud have been lodged against them after their arrest on August 30. Moreover, the men in khaki are now exploring options to book them under the Gangster Act. A special investigation team (SIT) probe into their affairs has hinted that the company owned by this couple had garnered over Rs 10 crores from investors by giving them lucrative offers in the name of booking plots for them in Varanasi, although they could neither purchase the promised land nor showed any interest in refunding the money. It is the first case in which SIT has been formed to investigate the allegations of fraudulent deals in the city following introduction of the commissionerate police. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh on Monday said, “This company and its owner couple Vikash Singh and Ritu Singh had come on the radar of police when about a dozen cases of fraud were registered against them. They had managed withdrawal of around six cases by returning the money of the people invested for booking their plots as per the offer of their company Neelgiri Infracity.” “But, after the couple stopped returning money of the investors on failing to allot them plots, the number of cases lodged against them started accumulating not only in the district but also in neighbouring states,” said the CP adding, “Chetganj police succeeded in arresting the couple on August 6. A manager of the company was also arrested in the same connection.” Following their arrest, many white-collared persons tried to build pressure on cops for their release, but to no avail as they were not only sent behind bars but on receiving more complaints, the police lodged more FIRs against them. The CP said that till Sunday, 38 cases of fraud had been registered against the couple and their company. When police started investigating their case, it came to light that Vikas had started his career as a travel agent 10 years ago. “Later, Vikas switched over to real estate business and formed Neelgiri Infracity company. He mainly focused on people in backward regions of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and also east UP. He attracted investments in the name of booking plots and also gave offers for foreign tours to big investors. He also sent many of the investors on foreign tours,” the CP said. However, this company failed to fulfill the promise of allotting land to investors even after years of given time, said police adding, after which FIRs were lodged against them in other states as well. The CP said that following their arrest it came to light that Allahabad unit of the enforcement directorate (ED) was also investigating after registering a case against them under sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “In view of the gravity of the cases I formed a SIT under assistant commissioner of police (Chetganj) Nitesh Pratap Singh for detailed probe into the matter by consulting all agencies, including Varanasi Development Authority, regional transport office, income tax, ED and others concerned. The SIT comprises SHOs of Chetganj, Sigra and Jaitpura police stations while ADCP Varuna zone Prabal Pratap Singh was asked to supervise its investigation. “The beginning of probe by SIT is exposing that the couple not only owned an office in one of costliest commercial areas of the city, but Vikas had also purchased a building in posh Mahmoorganj area and eight cars,” said the CP adding, “Vikas had also ensured getting a Jaguar car from Shimla.

The middle layer, which fuels an organisation’s leadership pipeline, is caught between two extremes — from being excessively used to risking redundancy. With leaders directly connecting with the lower levels, could there be a reduced dependency on the middle layer? Experts are divided on this matter and believe that if middle managers bring strong enough value to their role, they would continue to be a key link in the organisational hierarchy. Here’s how: Middle managers break down the usually larger-than-life vision of the leader into simpler actionable tasks to be executed by employees to help the organisation meet its targets. But this layer is facing challenges of a different kind since the onset of a WFH/work-fromanywhere culture. As they have several people reporting to them, the skills of middle managers have not been put to such tests before. Mohua Sengupta, managing director at Mashreq (Bangalore) and Mashreq Remote working campuses (India, Egypt & Pakistan), says, “In the pre-pandemic office environment, huddling brought the teams closer and made team management easier. Right now, with distributed workforce, all employee engagement and huddling has become virtual. It needs much more focus, time and capability on the part of the middle managers, engage andencourage their large teams of direct reports virtually.” Sengupta describes the current situation as one that provides “a great training bed” for middle managers. “While organisations will still need to support them with additional training on how to manage distributed workforce in challenging times, I am hopeful that, a few years down the road, we will have a much stronger set of senior managers, who are much better prepared to face the world, thanks to this pandemic,” says Sengupta. Randstad held a workshop dedicated to the middle management layer on how to work around the challenges of a remote work system. Anjali Raghuvanshi, chief people officer at Randstad India, says although leaders are now directly connecting with people through digital town halls for cascading the vision, strategy and direction of the organisation, the line manager plays an important role in dealing with people directly and get the job done. The challenge, however, is to ensure targets are met. Despite challenging circumstances, targets seldom get revised downwards. It’s a tightrope for line managers, especially when organisations also state that ‘no meeting days’ are sacrosanct. Middle managers are being trained to trust their team. “When leaders speak on these matters, middle managers gain confidence in demonstrating similarly,” says Raghuvansh. Anne Soumya, director HR, The Adecco India, says mid-managers should not feel threatened and stripped of authority but learn to embrace the empowered workforce they can leverage to achieve never-seen-before results. “There is no denying that this type of role is challenging since it requires being both an effective leader to direct reports and a proactive supporter to the top management. As organisational hierarchies become more flexible and virtual, multi-faceted middle managers will increasingly become channels to build better relationships, engagement, and collaboration,” says Soumya. S Venkatesh, group president - HR, RPG Group, says organisations will reshape themselves across the hierarchy. “Even so-called ‘senior’ roles and leadership positions will get affected. The business model and the way we execute it to the benefit of customers and all other stakeholders will be reimagined and, therefore, the roles that will be needed will also have to be similarly reimagined,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/why-middle-managers-matter-in-new-normal/articleshow/85994566.cms||Namrata Singh

Since he fell in low water level, he sustained injuries and was rescued by sea link staff, fishermen and police. Prima facie, the victim, Rahul Gatia, was upset as he did not have a proper job. Police received a call at 3.17pm about a man jumping into the sea. Mobile vans were sent near pole number 27, from where the man was said to have jumped into the sea. A fire brigade team also arrived at the spot. “We saw the man in the water. Sea link supervisor Chetan Kadam and another employee, Vivek Sawant, had also reached the spot. They went from the Worli jetty side, where the water level was three-four feet. Some local fishermen also arrived there. We provided a portable stretcher to them. They removed the man from the water, where he sustained injuries, and kept him on the stretcher. He was taken to the Worli jetty,” said senior inspector Anil Koli of Worli police station.  A police team also reached the jetty where water was removed from Gatia’s stomach. Since a mobile van could not have been taken to the jetty, Gatia was taken to Poddar Hospital on a motorcycle. After first aid, he was shifted to the Nair Hospital. While talking to him, police asked his name and family details. He gave his mother’s number and said he stayed in Shanti Nagar at Walkeshwar. His mother was informed about it. Gatia is undergoing treatment and is out of danger. Police said Gatia earlier did deliveries but had no job during Covid, so he was frustrated. He again got a job for deliveries. He would keep worrying about the job and it could be the reason for him taking such a step, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-upset-over-unsteady-job-delivery-man-jumps-off-sea-link-rescued/articleshow/85991208.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||Several beneficiaries flout post-vax 30-minute waiting norm: Hospitals||Pune: Many Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries were flouting the mandatory 30-minute waiting norm at the inoculation site after taking the jab. The deputy medical director at a city-based hospital said. “Till the time the guideline to wait for half-an-hour after vaccination is in force, people must follow it because Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI), like anaphylactic reactions, giddiness and collapse, can occur during this period.” The ministry of health and family welfare has mandated half-an-hour waiting after Covid vaccination for monitoring AEFI. But many beneficiaries wait for about 5-10 minutes and leave the site without informing the authorities, sources in hospitals claimed. Dr Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “We have heard such reports from various hospitals. The adverse effects can come immediately after vaccination, within 30 minutes. The delayed side-effects can show till up to one or two days, which too should be reported. Reporting rate of delayed side-effects is also low because many citizens are getting symptomatic treatment from family doctors when the side-effects show, without reporting them. Ideally, these effects should be reported to the centre, so that we can have an updated registry of adverse events.” Dr Patil said the correct practice was to note the beneficiary’s temperature, pulse and oxygen levels after vaccination also, though the government guidelines on vaccination did not say this. This was done when healthcare workers were being vaccinated initially during the drive, he said. He said many times vaccination side-effects like low blood pressure and low pulse rate might spring out of fear of the jab and associated anxiety, which could best be tackled if beneficiaries remained in a medical set-up for some time after the shot. The vaccination in charge at another private hospital said, “Some beneficiaries claim that with models like drive-in and doorstep vaccination in place, the 30-minute wait period post-vaccination is unlikely to be followed diligently and hence, they should also be allowed to go. They give many reasons. There have been increasing instances lately of people leaving earlier than the mandated time, especially as vaccination is now a common affair.” Most people opting for paid vaccination were educated and had easy access to the internet, which they used to find answers to any side-effects they might experience after the jab, he said. Pune Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad told TOI, “Government centres in rural areas mandatorily make people wait for half-an-hour after vaccination. Nurses have been told to keep a tab on ‘in and out’ times of beneficiaries in the waiting areas. They are told to sit in the waiting rooms for 35 minutes from the time their vaccination certificates are generated.” Prasad said in some people were hesitant to wait for long some centres because of the risk of crowding. “We are constantly spreading awareness about AEFI and how delayed side-effects, beyond a regular fever, should be reported to primary healthcare centres,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/several-beneficiaries-flout-post-vax-30-minute-waiting-norm-hospitals/articleshow/85991180.cms||Neha Madaan

The health workers said their latest three-month contract, or in some cases four months, started on July 1 and should have ended on September 30. However, they were told to leave without any prior notice on August 31. Almost 85-plus nurses and some other staffers appointed at the Sassoon hospital said they had not been paid salaries for the last two months. A nurse appointed on a contract basis at the Sassoon hospital said, “I joined in May 2020 and worked through the worst Covid waves seen by the district. Now, despite two months remaining in our four-month contract, they are throwing us out.” A nurse hailing from Latur said, “We feel cheated. Had we worked in a private hospital, at least our salaries would have been timely and after a year, they would have given us some increment.” A contract health worker under the PMC said they could not seek help from the labour court and other avenues as the contractual labour force was unorganised. A senior official said, “When the Union government says that there is no need to continue their services as the Covid situation is under control or don’t release the grant, we have no option but to let them go.” In Pune district, 594 people were appointed on contract basis. “We have paid them July salaries while the August salary will be credited by Wednesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-warriors-protest-against-premature-termination-of-contract-irregular-salary/articleshow/85991225.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Nagpur||After relaxations, cases dipped for nearly a month before a small rise||Nagpur: It has been nearly a month since Nagpur district administration eased restrictions for non-essential commercial establishments due to consistent drop in test positivity rate (TPR), sharp dip in Covid deaths and increased vaccination coverage.It was believed that the increased outings and socialising by people would lead to a spike in two weeks following the relaxations. So far, the relaxations have seemingly not led to increase in Covid-19 cases though a small spurt in the last three days has rung alarm bells among the medical fraternity and administration.After the district task force meeting headed by guardian minister Nitin Raut on Monday, it has been decided to reimpose restrictions in view of the projected third wave. The TPR since September 1 remains at 0.15%, which is almost same for the corresponding period in August. The weather variations have also led to an increase in seasonal flu cases, from which a very low percentage ave tested Covid positive so far. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik, a district task force member, said that it didn’t take much time for cases to jump from single digit to 13 on Monday. “The third wave is a multi-factorial issue. Everything will depend on adherence to Covid norms and vaccination. “For the last 10 to 15 days, people believed nothing is going to happen. Now, between August 1 and October 30, nobody knows when cases will start going up. Large-scale genomic study will have to be done to understand the threat of local mutations,” he said.Dr Sarnaik agreed that breakthrough infections have taken place but said that most of them were not serious. He emphasised on aggressive contract tracing in the coming. “We have to find infective persons in the chain. In the US, Delta variant caused breakthrough infections. But 95% of them had mild disease due to vaccination,” said Dr Sarnaik.VHA convenor Dr Anup Marar said that the announcement by guardian minister heralding the onset of third wave leading to further restrictions was essential looking into the slow increase of cases. “It took a month for cases to go up after relaxation of restrictions. The scenario was similar between the first and second wave. The increase though looks gradual, cases may suddenly shoot up. The surge should not catch us unawares as happened during the second wave. “Hence imposing restrictions and logistics readiness will be required since citizens are not yet serious and show laxity in complying with Covid appropriate behaviour or even in getting vaccinated,” he said.He further said that Covid waves will continue to happen and citizens should understand that Covid-appropriate behaviour is here to stay. It will not only prevent Covid but also safeguard us from many other infections,” he said.Nagpur district dataDate --------------------------cases-----------deaths------------------testsJuly 1 to 14 | -----------------310-----------13-----------------91,112August 1 to 14 | -------------79-----------2------------------62,671Sept 1 to 6 | -------------42-----------0------------------26,805||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-relaxations-cases-dipped-for-nearly-a-month-before-a-small-rise/articleshow/85986461.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

For the first time, the Nashik west forest department has put up 100 Ganesh idols for sale to raise awareness about the eco-friendly celebrations and offering medical plants. “Nashik deputy conservator of forests Deepak Garg came up with the idea of offering medicinal plants for those who buy Ganesh idol from us. It is a non-commercial programme in which, art students prepared the idols,” said Seema Musale, the range forest officer. The idols are put up for sale in the stall set by the forest department at Mahatma Phule Kaladalan in Shalimar. The officer said the idols were made of Shadoo clay and the natural colours were only used for the decoration. The idols come in two sizes and are rationally priced for the citizens, who wish to switch to eco-friendly way in their celebration. The aim at presenting the saplings of amla, bel, tulsi, shatavari, gulvel, aloe vera and others is to popularise these plants among the masses who can plant them at their homes and in the gardens so that they can benefit from the same. “Most of these plants are immunity boosters and they are the best in the current times of pandemic. People need to understand the value of the medicinal herbs and hence this experiment,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/forest-depts-initiative-to-promote-medicinal-plants/articleshow/85984353.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Agra||North Central Railway flags off first Kisan Rail from Agra to Assam||AGRA: In a major boost to farmers of western UP, North Central Railway (NCR) flagged off its first Kisan train from Yamuna bridge railway station under Agra division on Monday. The train loaded with 270 tonnes of potato left for Changsari station in Kamrup district of Assam at 4:30 a.m The train with 12 parcel vans will be reaching its destination at 5 p.m on Tuesday. The Kisan Rail service was started in August 2020 as an initiative to increase farmers’ incomes by transporting perishable agri-products. Its aim is also to expand farmers’ reach to markets at far off places. Chief public relations officer of NCR Shivam Sharma said, “This year, there has been a bumper crop of potato in Agra region. In order to facilitate the farmers sell their produce in deficient regions, NCR took the initiative to run the special Kisan Rail. Presently, four trips of this train are scheduled to run, one on every Monday, till September.” For farmers, the initiative of Kisan Rail is both a time and money saver. By using the Kisan Rail, farmers will have to effectively pay 50% less charges than normal parcel rates. “The scheme is a government of India initiative in which 50% subsidy on transportation is given to farmers at the time of booking of their perishable produce, including fruits, vegetables and dairy products.” Sharma said. Divisional railway manager Anand Swaroop said, “The NCR is making efforts in consultation with various stakeholders, farmers and state agencies to identify the need of farmers to carry their produce to mandis across India so that many more services can be provided by it. The NCR is committed to running more trains in other routes in coming days.” Divisional commercial manager, railways, SK Srivastava said, “The initiative of providing reliable speedy movement of goods using the vast network of Indian Railways may bring a change in thinking in the transportation of fruits and vegetables from the region and boost local economy. Also, the end-user stands to benefit in terms of cheaper and fresher produce in sufficient quantity.” Agra region accounts for over 75% of potato production in UP. Potatoes from Agra, Firozabad, Mathura, Mainpuri and adjoining districts are supplied to other states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. The tuber produced in Agra remains in high demand in the north eastern states. Potato producer Rajveer Lawaniya said, “Assam is among the largest consumers of potato from Agra in the northeast. Indian Railways has taken a commendable initiative by starting Kisan Rail from Agra to Assam. It will reduce the transportation time from six days to 24 hours. At least, 50% of the transportation cost will be saved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/north-central-railway-flags-off-first-kisan-rail-from-agra-to-assam-with-270-tonnes-of-potato/articleshow/85986466.cms||Deepak Lavania

Members of District Covid-19 Task Force, though, backed the decision saying precautions are a must as developments are alarming.“So, more than 10 cases is a threshold?” asked infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “This means the administration is expecting Zero Covid situation in the district, which is impractical and impossible theory,” he added. He said it would be better to find unvaccinated pockets and target vaccination. “This is how UK and other nations fought the pandemic. We must achieve more than 90% vaccine coverage. As far as new cases are concerned, 1% positivity rate in population of 25 lakh is acceptable,” he added.Intensive care specialist Dr Mahesh Shah said the virus will remain here, and normal life should be allowed until very high number of cases are detected. “WHO has said that 5% test positivity means spread is under control. We are having less than 1% and still going for lockdown, which is an administrative decision and not scientific decision,” he added.This is most appropriate and timely decision, said Dr Prashant Joshi, senior member of the Covid task force. According to him, cases are increasing, which is not a good sign. “It won’t take much time to multiply once it starts. The public has an impression that there is no Covid now. Very few are following Covid appropriate behaviour. People are enjoying being careless,” he added.Dr Joshi also suggested that scientific steps like genome sequencing of new patients should be taken up on priority.Dipen Agrawal, convener of Sarkar Jagao Vanijya Bachao Samiti (SJVBS) and president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry & Trade (CAMIT), said the administration was jumping to conclusion regarding onset of third wave. “On behalf of business community and employees, we request minister Raut to first undertake in-depth discussions with all stakeholders, consider submissions and review the decision to implement strict lockdown in Nagpur district,” he said.A senior member of the state Covid-19 task force said it’s time to be more careful for at least four weeks of September. Authorities said various stakeholders will be consulted in next three days and restrictions imposed in scientific manner.At present, Covid-19 positive patients in Nagpur are admitted to MLA Hostel Covid Care Centre. In case they develop any symptoms, they are shifted to AIIMS Nagpur. At present, AIIMS has 19 patients. While one of them has a non-invasive ventilator (NIV), one is requiring oxygen support. All others are admitted in Covid ward and doing well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/restrictions-return-docs-in-task-force-back-move-others-question-reasoning/articleshow/85986465.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

An inquiry has been ordered while two police personnel including the SO have been sent to lines in this connection. As per the details, the deceased Sagar Gupta lived with his family in Rajendra Nagar area of Orai. He committed suicide on Friday after he was thrashed by the family members of his wife Pooja Soni. They allegedly had a love marriage. According to Sagar’s father Rajendra Gupta, he had approached the police after his son was attacked but they did not help him. Almost 24 hours after Sagar committed suicide, on Saturday Kotwali police booked him under section 323, 504, 506, 386, 420 IPC on a complaint filed by Pooja. In her complaint Pooja stated that she and Sagar worked in the same office and in July he forcibly took Pooja to registrar office for marriage. Later he also demanded Rs 2 lakh and threatened to kill her. After the matter came to light, SP Jalaun ordered an inquiry in the entire matter by the additional SP. SO of Kotwali Orai and a constable have been sent to lines. DIG Jhansi range Jogendra Kumar said, “The FIR was expunged immediately after it was found that the accused is dead. It seems to be a human error that the case was lodged after his death. We have sent the SO and Dewan to lines and an inquiry has been ordered.” Meanwhile, a series of videos surfaced on Monday in which SO Kotwali along with few other officials were going to Sagar’s house on Sunday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-booked-a-day-after-his-death-in-jalaun/articleshow/85991257.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena slams Javed Akhtar for comparing RSS with Taliban||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday slammed lyricist Javed Akhtar on his comments comparing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) with the Taliban.  Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, "India is a democratic country. Taliban’s depraved mentality will never be accepted here. People here struggle and fight back. Opposition parties in our country have seen an emergency also.” In an editorial headlined “There would be differences with respect to Sangh…yet…”, the Sena mouthpiece said "linking Hindutva with the Taliban is disrespectful to Hindu culture.” It said people who think the ideologies of RSS and VHP are similar to Taliban’s must introspect.  According to reports, Akhtar said he saw an “uncanny resemblance” between Taliban and RSS. "Just like the Taliban want an Islamic State, there are those who want a Hindu rashtra,” he was quoted as saying by NDTV. Criticising him, Saamna said, "Most of the population of the country is secular and respects each other's religious views. We cannot accept the 'Taliban ideology'. In spite of the fact that India is home to a majority Hindu population, it is a proud, secular country...Under the veil of democracy, people may try to bring dictatorship. But they have a limit.” Saamna also praised Akhtar saying, “whenever fanatic and seditious ideas have erupted in the country, Javed Akhtar has torn the masks of those fanatics. He has sung 'Vande Mataram' irrespective of threats from fundamentalists. But we do not accept a comparison with Taliban.” Police have increased security outside Akhtar's residence. The decision was taken in the wake of BJP MLA Ram Kadam’s demand for an apology from him. Kadam had said no film involving Akhtar’s will be allowed to be screened until he apologises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-slams-javed-akhtar-for-comparing-rss-with-taliban/articleshow/85991338.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||Mask must rule forgotten too soon, over 45k penalized||Nagpur: The drop in Covid cases has led the people to drop guard and flout safety protocol. A large number of people can be seen moving without face mask and blatantly flouting distancing norms.During a tour of the city, Team TOI came across a glaring fact that mask compliance has gone down. Almost no compliance was found in grocery stores, vegetable and other shops alike.Even in marketplaces like Sitabuldi, Sadar, Jaripatka, Gandhibagh, Mahal, it has become common to see people not wearing mask or wearing it inappropriately.Officials said ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour in markets is becoming a huge challenge, especially when people themselves indulge in careless behaviour. The official said when the Covid cases were at the peak this year, mask adherence and distancing were the most important tools that helped in bringing the cases down.“Now that the cases are on the decline, people have stopped adhering to the safety protocol. Though fines are still being collected, people seemed to be least bothered,” said an official from the nuisance detection squad.From June 2020 to August 31, 2021, the NMC’s nuisance detection squad had penalized over 45,500 citizens for venturing out without face masks. The NDS team also recovered Rs1.94 crore as fine from them.“That we have overcome the adversary...is just another illusion. Like a predator, the virus is waiting for a moment of lapse to rear its head again. We must remember that the virus has destroyed lakhs of families and hence a responsible, Covid-appropriate behaviour should be the norm,” said general physician Dr Sanjiv Ukil.“The Covid threat is far from over and it is very disappointing to see people moving around without mask, or not following Covid distancing measures,” said Dr Ukil.“The coronavirus, like an imposter, is changing face every moment to be more lethal. Please use mask for your own sake. You have a family waiting for you. An irresponsible act of yours is a threat to yourself and the society at large. This is the crucial time for a little bit more cautiousness as we have largely succeeded in controlling the pandemic. History repeats whenever we do not learn from it. So, pick up your mask, what are you waiting for?” he said.Unmasking The NumbersZones---Without mask cases----Fine collected (in rupees)Laxmi Nagar---6,908---31,45,000Dharampeth---7,049---30,30,100Hanuman Nagar---4,884---21,64,800Dhantoli---3,436---12,66,800Nehru Nagar---3,504---14,83,200Gandhibagh---2,895---12,80,400Satranjipura---2,573---10,96,000Lakadganj---3,193---14,07,800Ashi Nagar---4,663---19,78,100Mangalwari---5,816---23,61,100NMC head office---660----2,58,000Total---45,581---1,94,71,300||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mask-must-rule-forgotten-too-soon-over-45k-penalized/articleshow/85986471.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Vijayawada||Vijaywada: POP replaces costly clay in idol making||VIJAYAWADA: Despite huge demand, availability of clay Ganesh idols is very poor in the city. Due to high price of clay idols, people are opting for cheaper, plaster of paris (POP) Ganesh idols. Worshipping clay Ganesh idols is a tradition during Ganesh Chaturthi. But many now worship colorful POP idols which pollute water and cause environmental damage. With a series of campaigns taken up by Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, civic bodies and NGOs, many are considering installing clay idols. As the state government has banned celebrations at pandals, people are set to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at their homes with small idols. There is huge demand for idols ranging from 1 feet to three feet in the city. There are only a limited number of clay idol sellers in the city and the cost of clay idols is ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 4,000 for one feet to three feet idols. “We have decided to install a clay idol this time. Only limited models were available; the cost is too high. Government should encourage clay idol makers and promote them on a huge scale,” said K Narayana, a buyer. Clay idol sellers said they have suffered huge loss as the government has prohibited pandals and public celebrations. “POP idols are very easy to make. But a lot of skill is needed to make big clay idols. We make them at our workshop in Hyderabad. We have sent a few artisans for training and they will start working from next year,” Durga Prasad, an idol maker from Fakirgudem, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pop-replaces-costly-clay-in-idol-making/articleshow/85991293.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Mumbai||Cobbler charged with murder acquitted, court says victim’s fatal injuries accidental||MUMBAI: A 40-year-old cobbler who spent over two years in jail for killing a man after he fell down and suffered head injuries in a scuffle has been acquitted after the court found that the when the accused held the victim’s neck by bending his arm, he did not intend to kill him. Acquitting Sunil Marathe for the murder of Siraj Sayyad, the court said, “It is clear that the deceased sustained the internal head injuries due to his fall on the ground, but the accused cannot be said to have voluntarily caused the said hurt, nor can he be said to have intended to cause the death..,” the court said. The court further said that the internal injuries sustained were merely accidental, even though it resulted from the scuffle. “One cannot lose sight of the fact that it was not the accused who rushed to the deceased to assault him, but the other way around,” the court said. The court said that even if Sayyad fell down on the ground after he was held by neck, it was a matter of common phenomenon that in most scuffles, holding by neck with arms around is without any intention of causing death. “ At the time of scuffle, no prudent person can predict that the victim would fall down on the ground and sustain any injury, much less death...” the court said, adding that the cause of death was internal head injury and not asphyxia. Marathe was arrested in 2018 and granted interim bail due to the COVID-19 pandemic in May this year. Sayyad and the accused were residents of the same locality. On December 25, 2018, around 10pm, a group of friends were sitting at Shanti Nagar Naka in Andheri (East) when the accused passed the area. Sayyad called him, but the accused asked him to come to him. When Sayyad went to the accused, the duo allegedly had an argument after which there was a scuffle. The accused allegedly pressed Sayyad’s neck by bending his arm and threatened to kill him. Sayyad fell down as soon as the accused let him free. When he became unconscious, he was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead. The accused was booked for murder. In court, he claimed that Sayyad was drunk and fell on his own. Six witnesses, including Sayyad’s friends and cousin deposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-acquits-man-charged-with-murder-says-death-accidental/articleshow/85993196.cms||Rebecca Samervel

As NMC’s water works department and OCW are doing nothing to resolve the long pending issues, I am facing residents’ wrath,” said the corporator.As the protests were on, NMC’s executive engineer Manoj Ganvir and senior officials from OCW reached there and soon the situation turned tense. Residents expressed anguish against the officials for their casual approach in resolving the water related problems. Pande also showed several letters pertaining to these issues submitted to the authorities for many months and yet nothing has been done so far.After nearly four-hour-long discussions, the officials assured the residents that their complaints will be resolved in three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-stage-protests-over-impure-water-supply/articleshow/85986478.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Discharged now, the woman has regained her original look but will have to wait for another two months for fixing permanent dentures. Till then, she would be on liquid diet.Dr Chandrashekhar Bande, consultant head and neck cancer and facial plastic surgeon, designed and patented the implant.The multidisciplinary team of doctors from the hospital, including infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, oral surgeon Dr Ashish Maheshkar and prosthodontist Dr Prajakta Thool, decided to opt for complete resection under the supervision of anaesthetist Dr Jagdish Bhalerao at the hospital.Dr Bande said, “There are some more similar cases but not of this severity. We needed 15 to 20 days along with technical team to design the prosthetic as the patient’s facial and jaw and functions. As per available literature, one reconstruction surgery has been reported from Europe on an 84-year-old. This is the first rehabilitation for any patient in Asia and first on a mucormycosis patient in the world.”The patient had a history of diabetes, hypertension and hypothyroid. In conventional cases, a part of knee bone (fibula grafting) is used to reconstruct the jaw. Considering the age and condition of the patient and potential post-surgery re-infection complications, this option was not feasible. Fibula grafting would have resulted in poor facial aesthetics and caused emotional distress, said the doctors. The reconstruction was performed using advanced 3D printed titanium implant customised for the 52-year-old teacher.According to the hospital, the reconstruction surgery was performed on August 18 and after two weeks of monitoring, she was discharged with stable condition and no strains of mucormycosis.In April this year, the teacher had tested Covid positive and was admitted. On May 11, she was diagnosed with the black fungus infection. Due to her critical condition, a marginal mandible resection surgery along with resection of infected region in the lower jaw was performed by Dr Bande. Later, the team decided to opt for complete resection.The procedure was done to prevent further spread of infection to vital organs such as eyes and brain. Unfortunately, just a month after the first surgery, the patient was again diagnosed with black fungus infection. The CT scan images showed mucormycotic osteomyelitis in the complete lower jaw.Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration) at the hospital, said, “Such complicated cases require a multidisciplinary approach which can only be possible at a multispecialty tertiary care hospital like Alexis.”About Artificial CRB * Artificial CRB customised complete mandible designed and patented by Dr Chandrashekhar Bande* Ideal reconstruction provides a solid arch to articulate with the upper jaw, restoring swallowing, speech, mastication and aesthetics* The complete lower jaw was reconstructed using advanced 3D printed titanium implant customised for the patient* Dr Bande and the team collaborated with LUCID Implants* Team of engineers, surgeons and biomedical designers at LUCID used sophisticated computer software and advanced 3D printing technologies to design and manufacture customized full mandible implant as per patient’s facial anatomyThe case* In April this year, a 52-year-old teacher from Wanadongri tested positive and was admitted* On April 21, she was discharged but within days reported severe toothache in her lower jaw, followed by excessive swelling, trauma and hallucinations* On May 11, she was diagnosed with mucormycosis infection* Dr Bande performed a marginal mandible resection surgery along with resection of infected region in the lower jaw * Later, Dr Bande and team decided to opt for complete resection * Just a month after the first surgery, the patient was again diagnosed with black fungus infection* The CT scan images showed mucormycotic osteomyelitis in the complete lower jaw * The immediate action was to completely replace the lower jaw with a functional implant to prevent further spread of infection||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reconstruction-surgery-gives-new-jaw-to-52-yr-old-double-mucor-hit/articleshow/85986520.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The vaccination was underway even at the time of filing this report and was likely to cross the 90,000 recipients by the end of the day, said the health department. The health department had set a target of administering Covid shots to 1.02 lakh recipients across all age groups during a mega drive on Monday. For that, as many as 376 health teams were assigned duty at over 400 vaccination sites in the district. At MLN Medical college, as many as 2032 recipients of all age groups were given jabs on Monday. Nodal officer (Vaccination), MLN Medical College, Dr Utsav Singh told TOI that a total of 2032 recipients including 49 international passengers, 230 women at Pink booth and 143 recipients at Abhibhavak special booth were vaccinated. The fact was that all the vaccination booths were crowded since the beginning of vaccination and there were long queues of recipients in both rural and urban areas. Cops were also spotted regulating the crowd of recipients in the urban area. Nodal officer and additional chief medical officer Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the Monday mega drive received an overwhelming response and the portal showed that over 71,000 recipients were administered doses by 6pm.

Enthused by it, the camp there has now been converted into a vaccination centre. Nearly 2,000 have benefited from it.The Mangalwari zone deployed a mobile vaccination van for coverage of slum areas. On Monday, 71 beneficiaries were given the first dose in Taj Nagar slums.Last week, vaccination drive was carried out at Anjuman English/Urdu Primary School by zonal medical officer Ateeque ur Raheman Khan and his team. Over 110 beneficiaries including staff, parents of students and others were vaccinated there.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said community-wise hesitancy is not seen much now. “Some are waiting for a particular vaccine brand. Some have other reasons for not taking the jab till now. Even camps in slums have revealed that many were taking their first dose,” he said.Consulting cardiologist Dr Shoeb Nadeem said vaccine hesitancy is across class of people having different education levels. “We presume uneducated or poor socio-economic class must be reluctant. But it is not the case. Many among the educated class and well to do groups still do not want to take the vaccine,” he said.Dr Nadeem added that many who have not taken the vaccine also include people on blood thinners. “Anti-platelet drug users can safely take the vaccine even while continuing the medication. Another class of heart patients is the one which is on anti-coagulants. They need doctor’s advise, but can get jabbed after evaluation,” he said.Cardiologist Dr Aziz Khan said vaccination is the only protection from severe disease. “People should shun all doubts regarding vaccines. They must immediately talk to a doctor. Now, the third wave of Covid is anticipated. Even if you test positive, vaccination will help decrease severity of the disease,” he said.Dr Khan added that people are worried about side effects and common myths. “Some are falling prey to rumours of clotting and heart attacks. Complications are rare after vaccination,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-reaches-out-to-minority-institutes-many-take-1st-jab-now/articleshow/85986531.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||South Kolkata Covid clusters under cop-KMC lens||KOLKATA: The pockets in the city, which had emerged as Covid hotspots during the first and the second wave, are reporting a marginal rise in cases once again. Though the situation isn’t alarming, Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Kolkata Police are keeping a close watch. The actual numbers, though, remain miniscule when compared to the two earlier waves. An internal survey by the KMC health department recently found a slight increase in Covid positive cases in Behala, areas in the Garia-Patuli belt, Jadavpur-Baghajatin belt, Bansdroni and a few localities off EM Bypass. Civic officials at the boroughs concerned have been asked to keep a special vigil surveillance on these areas ahead of a festive season. A KMC-KP joint surveillance team has been set up to enforce Covid protocols and ensure that cases do not surge. There will be special monitoring over markets and shopping complexes to ensure that people do not hang around without masks. “The marginal rise in Covid positive cases is not a major threat. But we need to be careful. Hence, we are intensifying our vigil at the markets and malls that are located in the vicinity of these neighbourhoods,” said a KMC health department official. Most of the localities that have recorded a marginal rise in Covid cases share their border with South 24 Parganas. “Owing to their proximity to Sonarpur and Maheshtala, which till recently had containment zones, the chances of people travelling into these neighbourhoods is always high. Also, with the festive season kicking off with Ganesh Puja this week followed by Vishwakarma Puja thereafter, there are chances of crowding,” said a police officer. According to a KMC official, the civic vaccination centres in the Garia-Patuli belt, Tollygunge and some localities off Bypass are also drawing many people from Canning, Joynagar, Dakshin Barasat and Baruipur. “This is an area where we need to be extra vigilant. We can’t refuse people coming from districts for taking vaccines.

---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC rejects Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Trust plea||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust against proceedings initiated by the state government to take over the land of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University in Rampur for failing to adhere to certain conditions on which the Trust was granted the land in 2005 for construction of educational institution. While passing the order, the court said that encroachment of land and construction of a mosque inside the university premises is not justified. MP Mohammad Azam Khan is the president of the trust while his wife Dr Tazeen Fatima is the secretary and son Abdullah Azam Khan is an active member of the Trust. Dismissing the petition filed by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal said, “It is a case where large part of land has been purchased as well as certain part of land belonging to tenure holders and gaon sabha has been encroached upon by a former cabinet minister of the state for establishing an educational institution pursuant to an Act which has come up in the year 2005. The finding has not been assailed by placing documentary proof that the plots in question were purchased by the Trust and does not belong to the gaon sabha or the tenure holders who have initiated proceedings under Section 134 of the UP Revenue Code.” The court further added, “In the present case, permission for transfer of land in excess to 12.50 acres was granted solely for establishing an educational institution. The establishment of a ‘mosque’ was against the permission granted on November 7, 2005. Thus the Trust violated the conditions that clearly provided that in case of violation of any of the condition, land excess of 12.50 acres will vest in the state government after affording opportunity of hearing. Neither in the reply before authority concerned nor before this court petitioner Trust could justify the action for establishing a ‘mosque’ which was in clear violation of the condition laid down in the permission order dated November 7, 2005.” The petitioner Trust had sought quashing of March 16, 2020 report submitted by sub-divisional magistrate with regard to constructions over the land as well as for quashing the order dated January 16, 2021 by the additional district magistrate (administration) Rampur for vesting of the land in the state. On argument of the petitioner’s counsel that the mosque was built for staff of the university the court observed, “The argument that the campus had residential premises for teaching as well as non-teaching staff, a mosque was constructed for them cannot be accepted as it goes against the permission granted by the state.” The court said that no interference was required in the order passed by the ADM (Administration) Rampur (to initiate proceedings under Section 104/105 of the UP Revenue Code, 2006 for vesting of University's land in UP Govt, i.e., taking over the land given to the Trust. “From the order impugned, I find that the revenue authority, after considering not only the report dated March 16, 2020 but also the reply of the petitioner, as well as the representation of the State, had in depth recorded finding as to the violation of law and condition by the Trust in setting up the educational institution. The order impugned has rightly been passed in the proceedings,” the court said. It is to recall that in 2005, the state government enacted Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, 2005 paving way for the creation of the university. Thereafter, the state government granted permission to Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust to acquire 400 acres of land against the ceiling of 12.5 acres (5.0586 hectares) for the establishment of the university while imposing certain conditions one of which was that the land will be used only for educational purposes. As per law, if such restriction/ condition is violated, the permission granted by the state government stands withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-plea-against-up-govtmove-to-take-over-jauhar-varsity-land/articleshow/85991334.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||GVMC submits Yeleru draft DPR to Andhra Pradesh government||VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has received the draft detailed project report (DPR) for laying a separate pipeline from the Yeleru reservoir in East Godavari to Vizag city. The civic body submitted it to the state government, which will take a final call on funding, project components, technical parameters, etc. As per the draft DPR, the 126-km pipeline from Yeleru to Visakhapatnam (excluding the nearly 20-km area from Tallapalem near Anakapalli to Kanithi Balancing Reservoir in Visakhapatnam) is estimated to cost about Rs 3,500 crore. According to the GVMC officials, the water levels in Yeleru reservoir can be maintained at its full level as Polavaram project, once completed, will also feed Yeleru reservoir. Moreover, the GVMC will not have to acquire any land for the project as the pipeline is proposed to be laid along the existing Yeleru canal. The GVMC had earlier entrusted a private agency with the responsibility of preparing the project report. But it was later handed over to the Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited, a public sector undertaking under the ministry of jal shakti, after there was delay on the part of the private agency. But contrary to the earlier proposal of laying a pipeline from Polavaram (180 kilometres), the draft DPR is prepared for only some 126 kilometres (Yeleru to Tallapalem). Vizag city has been battling with a chronic water supply shortage with increasing households and industrial activity, and the civic body hopes that the project would be a permanent source of water for the city. The pipeline project will serve the needs of the city as well as en-route requirements in the urban and rural parts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam districts. Vizag city has about six to seven water sources with Yeleru reservoir, located some 150 kilometres from the city, supplying a lion’s share of water to the city. However, the GVMC is realising only some 50% water being drawn through the Yeleru left main canal (YLMC), an open canal, due to water pilferage, seepage, evaporation, accumulated silt and other factors. On the other hand, Polavaram, which is under construction, is only about 50 kilometres from Yeleru reservoir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-submits-yeleru-draft-dpr-to-state-govt/articleshow/85991369.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Agra||Will back protesting farmers till govt withdraws bills: Akhilesh||Agra: A day after the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat, which hosted a large turnout of protesting farmers from across the country, former UP CM and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said his party “fully supports” the farmers and that the government should resume negotiations with them. “The insult to farmers will not be tolerated by the nation. I will back them till the government withdraws the three farm laws,” Yadav said in Agra, where he was attending a private event. “Farmers are annadatas (providers of food). The Centre should listen to their demands, respect them and resume the dialogue with them to resolve the crisis.” At the mahapanchayat, farmer leaders had said they would use their protest platforms to mobilise support against BJP, which is in power, for the upcoming UP and Uttarakhand assembly elections. “People will vote for change and the transformation will be historical,” Yadav said. His party will form alliances with smaller ones for 2022, he added. “The gathering of farmers in western UP and that of teachers in eastern UP (a public meeting of his party’s teachers’ wing which he addressed at Bhadohi) has shown that BJP... will not come back. It is the voice of the people,” he had tweeted earlier. About his uncle Shivpal Yadav, who broke away and formed the Pragatisheel Samajwadi (Lohia) party, he said the party “respects him and his associates and the Jaswantnagar seat (which Shivpal has been winning in an unbroken streak since 1996) will be left uncontested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/will-back-protesting-farmers-till-govt-withdraws-bills-akhilesh/articleshow/85986570.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The bail granted for six months earlier had ended on September 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) opposed his plea for extension saying the medical reports he cited disclosed no major illness. The NIA, in its affidavit, said, “The medical reports filed by Rao doesn’t disclose any major ailment which necessitates treatment in Hyderabad, and forms no ground for extension.” The NIA said any modification to the condition imposed would directly destroy the basis on which the court had passed its order. The HC will continue to hear the matter on September 25, due to paucity of time on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-extends-varavara-raos-bail-till-sept-24/articleshow/85993256.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Airport scanner on Mu variant, flyers from 7 nations||Kolkata: The Kolkata Airport authorities will attend a meeting called by the state health department officials on Tuesday to discuss possible changes in Covid testing rules at the airport for the passengers arriving from Bangladesh, South Africa, China, Botswana, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe, where the Mu variant of the virus has been detected. In a guideline issued last week, the ministry of health and family welfare (MoFHW) has sought mandatory pre- and post-RT-PCR tests for international passengers from these seven countries in addition to the existing norms for travellers through the flights originating from the UK, Europe and Middle East. However, it will be up to the state concerned how the guidelines will be implemented. Among the countries mentioned, Kolkata has direct connectivity with only Bangladesh, the UK and Middle East. While passengers from the UK and Middle East are required to have a negative RT-PCR report before boarding a flight and thereafter a mandatory RT-PCR test upon arrival in Kolkata, the same rule may be applied for the passengers from Bangladesh, said an airport official. Flight connectivity between India and Bangladesh resumed only on Sunday. Since September 3, states like Karnataka and Maharashtra have already made it mandatory for passengers from these international destinations to get tested at their own cost upon landing in the airports. “We will be meeting the state’s Covid Mission Directorate on Tuesday to discuss the proceedings. We will act as being advised by the state health department authorities,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director. An official of the state health department said multiple stakeholders along with Kolkata airport authorities will be present at the meeting to decide on international travel norms. “We are likely to come out with a specific guideline on international arrivals at the Kolkata airport,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-scanner-on-mu-variant-flyers-from-7-nations/articleshow/85988993.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Sources said it is not feasible to test such a large number of patients every day. “Initially, PGI was testing every 10th patient visiting the OPD but after the patient inflow increased, testing stopped. Now, social distancing and masking have been made mandatory,” said a faculty in PGI. Tests will also be stopped at GMCH 32 as number of patients in OPDs increases. “We are conducting RAT tests on all patients during OPDs but if the patient numbers increase, we have to think of further regulation other than tests which cannot be done on all,” said medical superintendent, GMCH-32 Prof Sudhir Gupta. Moreover, neither of these hospitals have mandated at least one dose of vaccination. Public health experts feel that even after vaccination, there are chances of mild to moderate infection. “That is why, we ask all to not to stop wearing masks as that still remains a strong protective shield against Covid,” said a public health expert. PGI has not made vaccination mandatory. “Though patients are advised to undergo vaccination, it is not mandatory but RT PCR is required for any admission to hospital for medical or surgical treatment,” said director PGI, Prof Jagat Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-stops-covid-tests-on-opd-patients/articleshow/85988981.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kochi||Authorities to prepare traffic diversion plans, route maps||Thiruvananthapuram: With the Smart Road projects getting underway in the city, Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCTL) and city corporation are planning to prepare elaborate traffic diversion plans and route maps. The work is set to begin on major roads under the Kerala road fund board (KRFB), public works department (PWD). Execution of the project on some of the major routes like Palayam-Vellayambalam and MG road is likely to throw up challenges in traffic diversion. SCTL and corporation will hold meetings with stakeholders to fix specific timelines and schedule of work on each stretch so that it wouldn’t lead to traffic snarls across the city. SCTL CEO Vinay Goyal said that the plan was to complete works in small parcels. “If we undertake work simultaneously, it would call for large number of diversions. So, the idea is to set short timelines for small stretches so that snarls are kept minimal. In the meantime, we need to make sure that the deadlines are met,” said Goyal. The work on Manaveeyam stretch has already started and traffic has been halted along the road. Goyal said that a special internal committee has been constituted to monitor the progress of the work and to make sure that the artistic creations on Manaveeyam Road are not disturbed. Corporation has received instructions from the office of LSGD minister to prepare route maps in consultation with stakeholders and city police to avoid traffic hassles during peak hours. The Smart Road work is being implemented by multiple agencies and coordination has been a huge challenge for SCTL. The Smart Road project envisages development of urban roads as smart roads. It will have features like pedestrian footpath/safe pathways, junction improvements, stormwater drains, utility conduits and underground ducts for electrical, KWA and communication lines. Besides landscaping, streetscaping, provision of smart street furniture, creating and developing basic conveniences along the roads are also included under scope of work. It also includes development and remodelling of existing/new stormwater drainage system. The project covers 36.94km of smart roads (including 7.40km of white topping surface) (KRFB & PWD roads) within the Thiruvananthapuram area-based development (ADB) area. Under the project, 21 roads under KRFB, 37 stretches under PWD and three roads under PWD-NH will be developed as smart roads. Initially, SCTL had planned to award the entire work for 36km to a single firm. However, the participating firms had quoted excess amount during bidding. The project will now be awarded as three packages as work will be done for separate stretches with lengths 13.9, 16.6 and 6.43km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-to-prepare-traffic-diversion-plans-route-maps/articleshow/85986601.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The 30-year-old woman Kajal Dafda was detained the murder of her husband Nilesh whom she killed by slitting his throat multiple times in their house in Mangal Dham in Timbavadi area of Junagadh. Police said the relations between the couple were strained for the last few months and Kajal was fed up with his regular drunken fracas at home.  On Sunday evening, Nilesh again got drunk and quarreled with Kajal. She was unable to bear the domestic violence and went to her mother-in-law, who lives in the same area, taking along Nilesh. She told her mother-in-law about Nilesh’s behaviour. She was advised to call Nilesh's friend Vishal to their home as he would listen to him. Kajal returned home and called Vishal. “After a brief conversation, Nilesh, who was heavily drunk, slept off and Vishal left. But Kajal was still simmering with rage and decided to kill him. She took a knife and slit Nilesh's throat,'' a senior police official said.  After killing Nilesh, Kajal stayed at home the whole night. In the morning, she went to her mother-in-law's house and informed that Nilesh had committed suicide. Her sister-in-law Hetal called the police which noticed that the wounds on Nilesh’s throat was obviously not of a suicide victim. “We grilled Kajal and she confessed to the crime,'' said Pradeepsinh Jadeja, deputy superintendent of police, Junagadh, told TOI.

Pro-vice chancellor Sanjay Dudhe confirmed that the deadline was extended following several demands. The earlier deadline was September 4. He added that even online admission for NU’s various departments was extended till September 20. Dudhe said that they have received many complaints from the students that due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, they couldn not fill up the forms. “Moreover, graduation results of a few courses were delayed. Considering their difficulties, we have decided to accept their applications till September 20. Even the University Grants Commission (UGC) has extended the admission deadline till September 30,” he told TOI. He pointed out that even the number of applications received from students for both UG and PG admissions has reduced significantly. “Despite nearly 99% result in Std XII, the applications for UG courses have declined. It’s difficult to fathom where the students are going. This may be one of the reasons that the colleges wanted an extension in filling up admissions forms,” he said. Earlier, the Vidarbha Youths Organization had protested against NU’s decision to exclude its affiliated colleges from the online PG admissions process stating that rural area students were suffering.

While demanding a roll-back of this move which is feared to break the backbone of the vast majority of dairy cooperatives, Milma has planned a protest programme at Palayam Martyrs Column on Tuesday. Similar protest programmes will also be simultaneously undertaken at all the primary milk cooperative societies across Kerala. Minister for animal husbandry and dairy development J Chinchu Rani will light the protest flame at the programme. Opposition leader V D Satheesan will preside. A memorandum will also be submitted to all the MPs from the state, urging them to put pressure on the Centre to give up the move. If implemented, the move to impose tax on milk cooperatives will deal a crippling blow to millions of dairy farmers across the country as they will have to ultimately bear the burden, said Milma chairman K S Mani and convener N Bhasurangan told a joint press conference here. As per the circular, apart from procurement and distribution of milk, the income from all allied products, including cattle feed sales, would be taken into account in calculating the tax. This would bring almost all the milk cooperatives under the ambit of income tax. Besides casting a huge financial burden, this would also cause a lot of procedural difficulties to their functioning, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/milma-protest-today-seeking-i-t-exemption/articleshow/85986613.cms||---

The state now has a reasonably good stock and health officials are hopeful about keeping up the vaccination momentum. Officials said they will target between five to six lakh doses daily. On Monday, nearly seven lakh doses were administered across the state till last reports came in. The 24 lakh plus-doses on Monday arrived in three shipments. All the vials have been stored in the state’s central family welfare store at Bagbazar. Sending of the vials to district vaccine stores will begin on Tuesday. Sources at the Bagbazar depot said that North 24 Parganas and Kolkata will get the biggest shares with 3 lakh and 2.2 lakh doses respectively. The state is expected to get about 1.3 crore doses in September. This was the second lot while the first shipment for the month had arrived on September 4 when the state got 5.1 lakh doses. Depending on the present stock, health officials said they could conduct an impulse vaccination drive on any of these days that would see 10 lakh and above doses being administered across Bengal. “We are yet to finalize the decision on that. Meanwhile, we are stressing for a regular but sustainable range of 5-6 lakh doses daily,” said state family welfare official, Ashim Das Malakar. Till Monday 4.4 crore plus doses had been administered in Bengal, of which 3.15 crore are first shots while the rest are second doses. For the last few days, close to 4 lakh doses have been administered daily on an average. “We can hike the number of sites close to 5,000 again like we did last Tuesday and target 10 lakh plus doses any day,” said a health department official. Covishield second-dose norm easedPeople from India, travelling abroad for medical treatment, or foreign nationals who need to return to their own countries can now get the second shot of Covishield before the mandatory 84-day gap. They will have to provide visa, confirmed tickets and documents to support such travel to take the second jab before 84 days. The state health department circulated this on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/24-lakh-jabs-arrive-highest-to-reach-kol-in-a-day/articleshow/85989025.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||State Cong keen on joining Bhowanipore contest||Kolkata: The Congress in Bengal wants to field a candidate against Mamata Banerjee in the Bhowanipore assembly bypoll, state unit president Adhir Chowdhury said after a Pradesh Congress Committee meeting on Monday. The Left Front has called a meeting for Tuesday to discuss the “emergent situation”. “Leaders gave their opinions on this issue,” Chowdhury said. “It was decided in the meeting that we will write to AICC stating our proposal to contest the Bhowanipore poll.” Back in June, the Congress leader had written to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi suggesting the party not field any candidate from Bhowanipore as a “good gesture”. Chowdhury said: “I had earlier expressed my personal opinion that as a gesture of courtesy, Congress should not field its candidate against Mamata Banerjee, now the incumbent chief minister. The situation has changed and we have had to think over the issue afresh.” He added that “we had a word with the Left Front. They have decided to contest the bypoll”. A section of Pradesh Congress leaders said Chowdhury, like former state unit presidents, had left it to the party high command to take the decision. “Many from the Congress ranks have already joined Trinamool. Those who remain are diehard anti-Trinamool. Chowdhury is aware of the mood at the grassroots and doesn’t want to antagonize the ranks,” a Pradesh Congress leader said. The leader pointed to the likely gap between the state Congress “proposal” and the “decision” to be taken by AICC. “A host of Congress leaders in Delhi is soft towards Mamata Banerjee, given the big picture of the battle against BJP,” a party leader said. Chowdhury also announced that Congress would fight the three elections in Bengal along with the Left. “What has pained me is that our candidate from Samserganj pulled out of the fray. We are not going to field a candidate there,” he said. Left Front partners prefer to “wait and watch” before taking a decision on Bhowanipore bypoll. “The seat was allotted to Congress during seat sharing among Sanyukta Morcha parties. The Left would in that case support the Congress candidate. But what will happen if AICC decides against fielding a candidate from Bhowanipore. The Left Front has to keep its candidate ready. I will raise this point in the Front meeting tomorrow,” RSP secretary Manoj Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-cong-keen-on-joining-bhowanipore-contest/articleshow/85991499.cms||Rohit Khanna

Leader of opposition and senior Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla has written to mayor Ravikant Sharma asking for withdrawal of the sewage cess. He stated that if the cess was not rolled back, they would not allow the general house meeting. “The BJP won with a thumping majority in the last MC election in 2016, but the BJP has completely let down the Chandigarh public and stabbed them in the back. The BJP councillors have time and again introduced new taxes and when the water tariff hike agenda was brought, we, the Congress party’s councillors warned you and opposed the agenda as it would be torturous for the public of this city. But unfortunately all our demands fell on deaf ears and we finally had to walk out from the MC house and the water hike bill was passed. And then once again the bills were hiked three times and sewerage tax 30%. We continued to raise this issue and brought it to the public domain,” Babla wrote to the mayor. He added, “We warn you that if you do not withdraw the sewerage tax before the coming general house meeting, we will not allow the house to run smoothly and raise this anti-public move with full strength. We just want to remind you that in 15 years’ of running the house by the Congress party, not a single tax was levied.” Sources said that with the MC elections nearing, both Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) are planning to raise issues like water, sewage and parking to take on the BJP. Both parties will also hold a series of protests and public gatherings to attack the BJP. MC elections are scheduled in December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congs-babla-writes-to-mayor-demands-rollback-of-hiked-sewage-charges/articleshow/85989041.cms||---

They were charged with sections pertaining to unlawful assembly, rioting, obstruction and violation of Covid-19 protocol. Police said that they were going through the video footage to find out more people involved in the case and that no arrest has been recorded so far. Rajeswari S Pillai, consultant of Express Global Logistics Private Ltd, the firm that was transporting the cargo, said that residents and trade union members had blocked the vehicle in the previous week also. The cargo transporting steel plates was not allowed to go for two days and on the third day, the firm had to pay them Rs 7,000 before the vehicle could be let in. She said that they had also threatened the officials and said that they won’t let any vehicles to go inside Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) campus if the company was not ready to give the money. “I am going for a case because I don’t want it to happen again. I am ready to give wages for labour, if they are working. But I cannot simply give them ‘nokkukooli’,” said Pillai. She recalled a similar incident happened last year when a cargo was transported to Vattiyoorkavu. The trade union members of the spot had demanded ‘nokkukooli’. People who gathered on Sunday demanding ‘nokkukooli’ of Rs 10 lakh dispersed after two hours and the cargo entered the VSSC campus via South Thumba gate.

The 701km expressway, connecting Nagpur to Mumbai, runs through 10 districts in the state. The construction work for the project, which is being implemented by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), is being carried out at a hectic pace. According to the state highway police’s plan, Aurangabad district will have the highest number of TAPs (4), followed by three each in Nashik and Wardha. The remaining seven districts — Thane, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Buldana, Amravati, Washim and Nagpur — will have two TAPs each. “The plan has been submitted to the MSRDC. The senior highway police and MSRDC are coordinating to set up these 24 TAPs,” said the highway police officials. State highway police sources said their personnel deployed at each of these TAPs will be equipped with speed guns and night-vision gadgets to monitor the movement of vehicles. “CCTVs installed along the expressway would be connected with the TAPs and the state police headquarters to monitor the real-time movement of the vehicles,” said an official. According to sources, each TAP would come up on about an acre of land. Apart from the construction of the TAP office, space would also be required to park ambulances, towing vans and vehicles damaged due to mishaps. “There is a provision to construct homes for the highway police personnel on the TAP premises as well,” said a highway police official. The identification of land for the TAPs in each of the 10 districts would be done jointly by the authorities of the highway police, MSRDC and the district administrations. “We have requested MSRDC to identify the locations from where both the stretches of the expressway — Mumbai to Nagpur and Nagpur to Mumbai — can be swiftly accessed by the highway police,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/samruddhi-mahamarg-24-taps-to-monitor-traffic-flow/articleshow/85984739.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Kochi||Kottukal to get ‘Pachathuruthu’||Thiruvananthapuram: The district’s first mangrove planting project as part of Pachathuruthu scheme was launched at Kottukal panchayat here on Monday. The scheme aims to plant acres of mangroves in and around the Karichal backwaters, which runs along three panchayats, including Kanjiramkulam and Karumkulam. Mangroves which grow only in waterlogged soil play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion as well as filtering heavy metals and toxins from water and soil. “At present, we have around 1,000 mangrove seedlings ready to be planted along the coastal stretch. It is difficult to get mangrove seedlings. We had to get the plants from C Divakaran, a farmer and environmental activist in Kasaragod, who donated some from the one lakh seedlings that he cultivated himself. Once planted, they are pretty much self-sustaining,” said D Humayun, district coordinator of Haritha Keralam Mission (HKM). The mangroves will be planted and maintained under the guidance of HKM, panchayat leadership and in partnership with the rural employment guarantee scheme. In addition to the environmental benefits, the Pachathuruthu project was also part of a larger scheme to bring tourism and employment to the panchayats involved, said Athiyannur block panchayat president M V Manmohnan. “This will definitely benefit residents. For years, the waterbody and the nearby areas have been clogged with waste heaps and pollutants. We are trying to make everything as environment friendly as possible. In future, the project will encourage boating and attract tourists,” he said. “We don’t aim just to have a few mangrove plantations. The larger aim is to create a tourism sector that spans the Karichal lake area. We had planned for this and the panchayat had already set aside the funds required for the project at the beginning of this financial year,” added Humayun. The inauguration was attended by HKM technical officer Haripriya Devi, environmental activists C Divakaran and Prakashan master and Kottukkal grama panchayat president Jerome Das. Currently, in the district, Pachathuruthu has been set up on nearly 39 acres of land. On these plots, authorities have planted 12,598 trees, 8,166 bushes, and 821 climbers. Also, the authorities envisaged a system to have frequent revisits to these green spaces, and if required replantation is done. The district also has the credit of setting up the first green grove on the premises of a police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kottukal-to-get-pachathuruthu/articleshow/85986653.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mangaluru||Dakshina Kannada on alert after Nipah death in Kerala||Mangaluru: With the Nipah virus resurfacing in Kerala once again and a boy succumbing to the infection on Sunday, an alert has been declared in Dakshina Kannada district too. Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra appealed to people to be cautious in the wake of the infection reported in Kerala. “A 12-year-old boy died of Nipah virus infection in Kozhokode district of Kerala on September 3. Since Dakshina Kannada district shares its border with Kerala and a large number of people commute for health and education purposes, a Nipah alert has been announced. Officials concerned should take all necessary precautionary measures,” the DC said. Nipah is a zoonotic virus transmitted from animals to humans and can also be transmitted directly between people. It can cause a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis besides fever, headache, cough and throat pain. Wash hands using detergents frequently and stay away from bats and pigs that cause the spread of virus. Do not use fruits that were partly eaten by birds and animals. Inform the health department immediately if any person was found experiencing symptoms of Nipah, the DC said. 258 Covid-19 cases in DK Dakshina Kannada reported 258 fresh cases of Covid-19 with a test positivity rate of 2.3% on Monday. With two more fatalities, the district’s death toll increased to 1,596. The district has 2,136 active cases. Meanwhile, Udupi reported 53 positive cases of virus infection and one fatality that took the district’s death toll to 458. The district has 1,417 active cases. Liquor ban on border villages In the wake of an increase in Covid cases in Kasaragod district, DK district administration extended the ban on sale of foreign liquor and toddy in 19 border villages. Accordingly, 26 foreign liquor outlets and five toddy shops located within 5km of the Kerala border in Mangaluru, Bantwal, Puttur and Sullia taluks will remain closed till September 13. In a previous order, those shops were not allowed to open from August 31 to September 6. Review weekend curfew decision Former minister and Mangaluru MLA UT Khader urged the government to withdraw the weekend curfew in Dakshina Kannada. He said the weekend curfew has not brought down Covid-19 cases as people were holding social gatherings on weekdays instead of weekends.  Further, he slammed BJP MLA D Vedavyas Kamath for submitting a memorandum to chief minister Basavaraj Bommai seeking to withdraw the weekend curfew. “The MLA is also a part of Dakshina Kannada district’s taskforce, and he has the powers to take a decision regarding weekend curfew. Hence, Kamath submitting this memorandum is ridiculous,” he added. BOX Covid test must for hotel, restaurant staff The MCC has made tests for Covid-19 mandatory for all staff in hotels and restaurants in the city. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar stated in a release that a decision to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for staff in hotels and restaurants was taken following a surge in Covid-19 cases across the city. “It will be mandatory for the staff of hotels and restaurants in MCC limits to undergo Coivd-19 test. For public convenience, all the Urban Healthcare Centers have been conducting Covid tests in the evening. The general public, including staff of hotels and restaurants are hereby requested to make optimum use of the Covid testing facilities,” the commissioner stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dakshina-kannada-on-alert-after-nipah-death-in-kerala/articleshow/85986692.cms||---

One of the victims, Utkarsh Shukla (23), was the nephew of Anoop Shukla, a prominent local BJP member associated with the state cooperative society. Utkarsh and three of his friends -- Rohit Pal, Umang Kumar and Rana Thakur -- were returning home from Sitapur when they met with an accident on Sunday night, said Lakhimpur Kheri police. Utkarsh was driving the SUV at a high speed as there was little traffic on the road. Suddenly, they came upon a herd of cows.

The highway was severely damaged due to landslides last week. Torrential rain in the Ajanta hill range on August 31 night caused damage to the 8km ghat section of the national highway at Chalisgaon in Jalgaon and Aurangabad districts. Aurangabad NHAI project director, Arvind Kale, told TOI the debris at all 11 landslide spots has been cleared and over 100 trucks stuck in the ghat section have been towed away. “The road repair work is on in the ghat section. We are also reconstructing the broken protection wall and drainage lines in that section. These are time-consuming tasks and cannot be carried out in a hurried manner,” he said. He said NHAI is likely to initially allow light motor vehicles to use the road after September 15, by when a major portion of the repair work is expected to be done. “The movement of heavy vehicles like trucks on that road is unlikely to be allowed before the last week of this month. The repair work has to be fully completed,” he added.  NHAI authorities said there is a possibility of intense rain in that belt within the next 5-6 days. “We have to act judiciously in allowing movement of vehicles as there is a possibility of more rain in the ghat section this week. We have to keep the safety of the motorists in mind,” added NHAI officials. After the landslide incidents last week, Jalgaon collector Abhijit Raut and SP Dr Pravin Mundhe had visited the affected spots at Chalisgaon to make assessment of the damage. According to Jalgaon police, till the time the ghat section is opened for movement of traffic, vehicle movement will continue to ply through Chalisgaon-Nandgaon-Aurangabad Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nhai-vehicles-to-be-allowed-on-dhule-aurangabad-nh-after-sept-15/articleshow/85984923.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Man killed by wife’s kin four years after love marriage||RAJKOT: Nearly four years after he married the love of his life, a 25-year-old diamond polisher was brutally murdered after being kidnapped, allegedly by his wife’s relatives as they had never approved of their marriage. The incident happened in Gadhada taluka of Botad district on Monday. Body of victim Jaysukh Bhalia, a resident of Limbali in Gadhda taluka, was found about 15 km away from his village on Monday morning. Police said Jaysukh was brutally beaten and his head smashed with a heavy stone. According to the complaint filed by Jaysukh’s friend Ashok Sankalia (25), four persons had abducted Jaysukh on Sunday evening when they were going on his motorcycle from Itariya to Limbali. Ashok said that four included Vijay Zapadia, brother of Jaysukh’s wife Sheetal, his cousins — Mavji Zapadia, Subhash Zapadia and one unidentified person. The accused, all residents of Nani Kundal in Babra taluka of Amreli, are on the run. “When I was going to drop Jaysukh to his village, the four relatives of his wife came in a car and waylaid us. They started beating us with sticks and pipes and forced Jaysukh into the car and fled,” Ashok stated in his complaint. After the attack, Ashok approached the Gadhada police and filed a kidnapping complaint. However, on Monday morning the police found Jaysukh’s body with several injury marks and head smashed about 15 km from the place where he was kidnapped on Sunday night. Police later added IPC section 302 (murder) to the abduction complaint lodged by Ashok. Jaysukh is survived by his wife Sheetal and a two-year-old son. Both Jaysukh and Sheetal belong to Nani Kundal village in Babra. While Sheetal’s father is a well-to-do farmer, Jaysukh comes from a humble background. They fell in love and got married four years ago and shifted to Limbali village where he started working as a diamond polisher. “Sheetal’s family was not happy with her marriage to Jaysukh. So the young couple had moved to Limbali. We are investigating as to why Jaysukh’s in-laws attacked him after four years,” said police officer investigating the case. All the accused in the case are absconding and police teams are searching for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-killed-by-wifes-kin-four-years-after-love-marriage/articleshow/85989220.cms||---

The department teams conducted surprise checks at the two stores in the wake of complaints. Assistant deputy commissioner (G) Komal Mittal said the two seed stores, Thuha Pesticides and Seed Store, Zirakpur and Rohit Fertilizers, Kurali were found selling sub-standard seeds in violation of prescribed norms. “To ensure supply of quality agrochemicals and seeds to farmers, the chief agriculture officer has suspended the license of two seed stores of the district under Section 7 of Seed Act, 1966. We also found evidence of seed stores selling spurious seeds to farmers, which is an act of cheating,” Mittal said. According to her, the department of agriculture and farmers' welfare is conducting regular checking of pesticide, fertiliser and seed stores throughout the district to ensure supply of quality agrochemicals and seeds to farmers. During the drive, irregularities were found in Thuha Pesticides and Seed Store, Zirakpur and Rohit Fertilizers, Kurali. Their licenses have been suspended and further action has been initiated against them. Pointing out that quality seeds helped increase crop productivity, Mittal waned against sale of spurious agrochemicals or seeds in the district.

So far, a study of over 15,000 beneficiaries on their preferences for small-scale units and businesses has been conducted in Huzurabad, where a pilot project is being implemented. According to the current plan of action, after their identification, village-by-village Gram Sabhas will be held, with banks pitching in to adopt. Under the Dalit Bandhu scheme, there will be a priority list of people who will be linked to business ventures in the prorgramme. “At this time, the idea is to deposit the money directly into accounts with the help of bankers, with the poorest of the poor receiving priority,” official sources said. There were initial concerns if the benefit amount directly goes into the existing accounts and banks were asked to open new accounts for this purpose. Following the completion of this process, top-level officials will engage in an event at a Gram Sabha to kick off the money distribution. In an important step, officials have estimated that, in addition to the Rs2,000 crore, an extra Rs420 crore will be required in Huzurabad for the scheme’s execution. They are also looking for government tenders and auctions where Dalits can be provided reservations in the state. The excise department has already begun studying the proposal to provide reservations to Dalits in the new liquor shop auction to happen as part of the new policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-govt-asks-banks-to-pitch-in-dalit-bandhu-scheme-and-adopt-villages/articleshow/85993889.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP MLA alleges Rs 1,000 crore scam in coastal road project, BMC denies claim||Mumbai: MLA Ashish Shelar on Monday alleged a Rs 1,000-crore scam in package one of the Mumbai Coastal Road and demanded an inquiry by a special investigation team into the “irregularities” in the project. But BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal told TOI, “All allegations are absolutely baseless; they were made on a day when 1km of tunnel length got completed under Malabar Hill.” Shelar claimed that he had complete details of the Rs 5,291-crore package one of the project for which L&T is the contractor. “Between October 2018 and December 2020, the state government and BMC have been defrauded of Rs 684 crore. The fraud and illegality pertains to 33 lakh tonnes of reclamation-filling material which was not taken from licensed quarries causing a loss of Rs 437 crore to the state...material of poor quality was procured and the BMC charged an additional Rs 48.4 crore for it,” he alleged. In violation of traffic norms, the contractor ferried material in overloaded trucks and a charge of Rs 81 crore has still not been recovered, Shelar alleged, adding that 35,000 bogus trips to ferry material have been shown. The BMC’s loss on account of levy due to overloading is Rs 18 crore, he claimed. Most of the reclamation material was washed away during the recent cyclone and the contractor claimed a loss of Rs 18 crore from BMC, he said, adding that since December 2020, an additional 23 lakh tonnes of material has been used for package one alone. In a point-by-point rebuttal to Shelar’s allegations, BMC, in a press release, said that the stones have been taken from quarries approved by the consultant and the royalty is paid directly by the quarry owner to the state. “...Tests are carried out regularly to check the quality of the material, hence there is no question of additional payment. With regard to the penalty levied by traffic police, it has nothing to do with BMC.... The BMC has not made any payment for losses on account of the cyclone. For the period October 2018 to December 2020, the total value of the work done is Rs 684 crore, which has been paid to the contractor. It is not correct to say that a fraud of Rs 684 crore has been committed.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-mla-alleges-rs-1000-crore-scam-in-coastal-road-project-bmc-denies-claim/articleshow/85991591.cms||---

She secured 26 votes out of 51 to seal the unprecedented victory giving a lease of life to the BJP which was struggling to lose out to Congress candidates in four districts out of six. Devi’s statement claiming herself to be among the ablest person for the top post during the election campaigns drew the attention of the BJP since the beginning of the polls. Soon after the result, Devi started lobbying for the top post with the Congress leaders while BJP had a close watch on her.“The party was waiting for the right moment to play its cards. The party leaders learnt that Congress is not interested in Devi as the candidate. They at the behest of the Poonia made an offer to become BJP’s candidate last evening. The offer was discussed with senior leaders who agreed considering that it will be a major setback for the Congress to lose Jaipur,” said a source in the BJP.The BJP ward members were informed in the morning about the decision by the senior party leaders. They were assured of a respectful position in the party for supporting the parachute candidate. Thereafter, Devi formally joined the party before filing the nomination. “Devi was forthcoming to join the BJP and claimed to bring 2-3 more ward members who are close to her will join the party. By then, Congress got alerted and averted at least two ward members to join the BJP. Still, Jaki Kumar Tatiawal who was out of the reach of the Congress cross voted to stamp the victory of BJP,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-cash-in-on-rama-devis-aspirations-to-stun-congress/articleshow/85991588.cms||---

The party, which got absolute majority in 14 zila parishads (ZP), has formed its board in 25 ZPs with the help of independents and others.It has also turned the tables around by electing three zila pramukhs against the majority at only one zila parishad in Sirohi. The party didn’t find any difficulty in electing its ZP in Bharatpur where it emerged as the largest party. The Congress elected 40 ZP and two each by independents and Ratriya Loktantrik Party (RLP). BJP outsmarted the Congress by making an early move to keep independents with them even before the results were announced. “Soon after the result, the state unit swung into action by reaching out to all independents by mobilising their senior district and community leaders,” said a BJP source. It is also learnt that at all four places, independents and RLP candidates elected their pradhan with the help of BJP. The party lobbied hard to keep the Congress at the bay at all possible ZPs. The mood in the BJP has turned from sombre on Saturday to jubilant with the victory registered during the day. BJP national in-charge for Rajasthan Arun Singh termed the victory on Monday as the ‘Congress sinking ship.’ “Even after misusing the government machinery, the ruling party lost miserably due to its internal fight.

Senior civic officials said the 145 centres are capable of inoculating the beneficiaries in the city. These centres have been spread out in all the six divisions of the civic body at its various hospitals, dispensaries, health centres etc. “We feel that at present the number of vaccination centres in the city is adequate. If there is a need, in the long run, we would certainly explore the possibilities of coming up with more centres,” said a civic official. According to the NMC official, apart from the existing vaccination centres run by the civic body, there are several private hospitals in the city that provide paid vaccination. During the weekly Covid review meeting held last Saturday, district guardian minister Chaggan Bhujbal had asked both NMC and Nashik Zilla Parishad to explore possibilities of establishing more vaccination centres both in the city and in the rural areas, Currently, there are over 245 vaccination centres in the district, including over 145 in the city. According to NMC sources, to operate a vaccination centre the minimum requirement of staff, including the inoculators, is four to five. “NMC is making judicious use of its healthcare workforce at its disposal to cater to the ailing at its various health facilities. If additional centres are opened more workforce will be required, which can be avoided at present as there is no requirement,” said the sources. According to the authorities, the top brass of the civic body is keeping a close tab on the vaccination front daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-unlikely-to-set-up-more-vaccine-sites-soon/articleshow/85984952.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The city has around 344 bridges and officials said there is an increasing need for such routine inspections to be done. Currently, a tender to inspect bridges in the island city has been floated and municipal officials said that there are plans to float a tender to appoint an agency to inspect bridges in the entire city. “This was a long-pending proposal but much needed to be done. As there is no adequate manpower and also machinery is needed to appoint an agency to conduct not only routine inspections at least twice a year, but also detailed inspection as and when required,” said a civic official adding that separate agencies would be appointed for inspection of bridges in the city and suburbs. After the collapse of Himalaya Bridge at CSMT in March 2019, the BMC had appointed VJTI to conduct a structural audit of all 24 skywalks.Besides, it had called for a re-audit of all bridges in the city. Bridges in suburbs were re-audited by the same firms which had audited bridges in the city. Officials said that the plan is to have routine inspections of all bridges done. “There were recommendations received from an expert committee for an expert agency to be appointed too,” said a municipal official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-plans-to-appoint-bridge-audit-agency-in-mumbai/articleshow/85993380.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Rajkot||Banni grassland to be cleared of encroachments||Rajkot: Gujarat’s biggest anti-encroachment drive is currently on at Kutch’s Banni grassland, which accounts for almost 45% of state’s pastures. Encroachments, mostly pastoral and agricultural farms, on 540 hectares were cleared in the first five days. Still, the drive is in its early days with more than 8,000 hectares still to be freed of encroachment. The drive, a joint operation by the forest and revenue departments, is being carried out on the directives of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). In May, the NGT issued orders to clear encroachments on the Banni grassland. Apart from ordering formation of a joint committee, the NGT has set a deadline till November to clear decades-old encroachments on the grasslands. The NGT came following a petition filed by ‘Maldharis’, the local nomadic pastoralist community. The petition was filed by ‘Banni Pashu Uccherak Maldhari Sangathan’. The joint committee has identified encroachments on 8,760 hectares. But the petitioner organization claims that around 18,000 hectare grassland is encroached. M U Jadeja, deputy conservator of forests, Banni grassland division, said that it is Gujarat’s biggest anti-encroachment drive. “We have cleared 540 hectares of land in just five days. Locals have created erected fencings on the grassland. Earlier, they used to tither animals here but now they are also cultivating the land during the monsoon. This should be an open land for grazing. It’s a huge task and this activity is expected to last for the next three months,” Jadeja said. The joint teams of revenue and forest department started removing agriculture encroachment for four days starting from August 23. The drive was again carried out from September 2 to 4. The departments have decided to carry out the drive for 20 days in a month. “We had removed encroachment in Misriyado village before the NGT order came. After the order, we are removing encroachment in Pirandiyara village. Many Maldharis have started farming on this land,” said Vivek Barhat, mamltadar of Bhuj.  As many as 48 villages — having 19 gram panchayats and home to around 8,000 families — are located inside the reserve area. Thousands of acres of land has been encroached upon and fenced by local people in the last few decades. Sources in the forest department said that some portion of the encroached land is yet to be identified. If the task is not completed by the end of November, the department will NGT for the extension of the deadline, they said. A voluntary organization ‘Sahjeevan’, working for the ‘Maldharis’, is running a pastoralism center in the area. “This area was declared a protected forest in 1955 but the forest department has not settled the rights of locals. As per law, the claims of the local residents have been approved but they were never awarded the titles of the land. If this seven-decade old issue is solved, it will also help in stopping encroachments,” Ramesh Bhatti, program director of the pastoralism center, said. Banni is one of the biggest grasslands of Asia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/banni-grassland-to-be-cleared-of-encroachments/articleshow/85989269.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Special judge Vimal Kumar Yadav sent Daga and Tiwari to judicial custody till September 20 as the investigation in the matter was still ongoing. “Both the accused persons are in CBI custody, the recoveries from them have already been made. It is stated that no further recovery seems to be there. The material produced by the CBI for the perusal of the court reflects extraction of data and it has been orally submitted that the said data is voluminous and is being analyzed and the accused persons are confronted with the same simultaneously. However, the analysis has not been completed. Therefore accused persons could not be confronted with the entirety of the record,” the court said. The court further observed that it was admitted on the last occasion by the CBI that extraction of data would not take much time and despite the fact that the electronic devices, from which the data was to be extracted, was recovered about four days ago. “In these circumstances, when the accused persons have remained in CBI custody for 4 days, there appears no reason to further extend their CBI custody as nothing new showing the nature of data extracted and the confrontation of the same is before the court,” the court said in the order. In the CBI’s FIR, it is alleged Tiwari had entered into a criminal conspiracy with Daga and unknown persons and disclosed case-sensitive and confidential documents to Daga for the purpose of subverting CBI’s investigation in a case being probed against Deshmukh, in lieu of undue advantage and illegal gratification. On August 29, a report that was allegedly part of a preliminary inquiry conducted by CBI got leaked in the media. The report purportedly mentions that the probe agency had concluded that “no cognizable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-lawyer-cbi-inspector-sent-to-judicial-custody/articleshow/85991622.cms||Usha Das
---||Mumbai||26-year-old is a major, at liberty to be with transgender friend, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court has allowed a 26-year-old woman to “go with” a transgender friend after she informed the judges that she does not want to go with her parents. The HC said she is a major and her friend is willing to take care of her. “Since the girl is a major, she would be at liberty to act as per her wish,’’ said the HC bench of Justices S P Deshmukh and N B Suryawanshi in Aurangabad on Friday. The order was in a petition for habeas corpus (produce the body from illegal detention) filed by the 29-year-old transperson born a female and identifying as a male. He is an arts graduate who resides in a shelter in Mumbai called Transgender Welfare, Equity and Empowerment Trust Foundation. He filed the petition before the Aurangabad bench of the HC, saying the woman was being illegally detained by her parents within the jurisdiction of that bench. Her parents were “pressurizing’’ her to get married, his petition alleged. He also said he was earning a living while educating himself with added skills for better employment opportunities and the HC noted the girl too “appears to be resolute”. The two had met in June 2019 while he worked in another state and she was based in Aurangabad, preparing for a Masters of Technology programme. They became friends through mutual interests. In the pandemic, she moved in with her parents. The petition said the duo met in February 2021 in Parbhani and travelled to Uttar Pradesh via Mumbai and she informed her parents she had left home voluntarily. On her father’s complaint, police took her back to her parents’ house. The petition added she again left home in April and the two decided to execute a “partnership deed” in another city to live together as consenting adults. Her father filed a missing person’s report later in June. She was in Rajasthan at the time where a local court directed her to return to her parents’ house. While being taken back to her parents on June 22, she wrote to a women’s rights NGO, said the petition. Since the girl expressed apprehension for her safety, the HC directed the police chief of Aurangabad to “protect the girl up to the destination she wishes to go.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/26-year-old-is-a-major-at-liberty-to-be-with-transgender-friend-says-bombay-hc/articleshow/85991602.cms||---

Today, the public gave a befitting reply and their mouths are shut, said Gehlot while reacting to panchayat poll results. He claimed that the people had rejected negative politics and appreciated good governance, Covid management and public welfare programmes of the state government.

---||Jodhpur||Leela Maderna wins Jodhpur pramukh seat amid rebellion||JODHPUR: Zila pramukh seat of Jodhpur has gone to the Congress. Leela Maderna, wife of former minister Mahipal Maderna who is an accused in the Bhanwari Devi abduction and murder case, was elected as Jodhpur zila pramukh amid high drama leading to intervention of chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Leela, who won the election for the sixth time, was nominated for the pramukh post by the ruling party after Congress swept 21 out of 37 seats in the panchayat election. Her nomination irked other two strong contenders, Munni Devi Godara, daughter of former Pali MP Badriram Jakhar, and Neha Choudhary, who was elected unopposed. Both Godara and Choudhary, along with another rebel candidate Lela Devi, filed nominations as independent candidates. This bewildered the party leaders and Congress election strategists. A party source said irked by this rebellion, the chief minister spoke to these candidates and admonished the strategists for failing to tackle the rebellion. Leela personally met and requested the reble candidates to withdraw their nominations. One of the three rebels, Lela Devi, withdrew her nomination. Godara and Choudhary, however, stood their ground, thereby triggering fears of cross voting by them to defeat Leela Maderna. All the party leaders heaved a sigh of relief when the results were declared in the evening and Leela was declared the winner with all 21 votes, including those of Godara and Choudhary. Badriram Jakhar expressed resentment during ticket distribution, accusing Osian MLA Divya Maderna of intervening in the affairs of Bhopalgarh, his stronghold. Tussle between both Jakhar and Maderna family is public knowledge and his desperation to get the zila pramukh seat for his daughter Godara too was well known.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/leela-maderna-wins-jodhpur-pramukh-seat-amid-rebellion/articleshow/85991637.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||In 4 years, most ‘She Toilets’ now defunct across Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: ‘She Toilets’, which were set up across the city exclusively for women about 4 years ago with much fanfare, are now either defunct or inaccessible. The effort has been flushed out and the money gone down the drain as residents allege that civic authorities have done little for their upkeep. Developed on a public-private-partnership model, each unit of ‘She Toilets’ cost Rs 7.3 lakh with two seats, eco-friendly lighting and flushing, and an improvised septic tank. It could be accessed by inserting Re1 or Rs 2 or Rs 5 coins. But in most areas now they are either locked up or do not function. “Lack of access to clean public toilets is a major challenge for women. When these ‘She Toilets’ were installed, I had thought we would no longer have to face the troubles of the usual public toilets that lack basic facilities for women. But that hope didn’t last long. The ‘She Toilet’ near Tolichowki has been locked up for a while now,” said G Manjula, a vegetable vendor who sits in the market from 6am to 7pm. While in Film Nagar, Shaikpet, Yousufguda and Kalyan Nagar, the local vendors running eateries attached to these ‘She Toilets’ said most were shut due to lack of water or technical glitches. “The last time I inserted a Rs 5 coin, but the machine didn’t respond. A local vendor said it was not working due to lack of water,” said Fatima Hussain from Film Nagar. Even those set up near tourist places such as Charminar and Golconda remain dysfunctional. SN Surya Kumar, GHMC deputy commissioner for Charminar zone, said, “They have stopped working due to some technical issue, but it will be fixed soon. There is no issue of water supply here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-4-years-most-she-toilets-now-defunct-across-hyderabad/articleshow/85993935.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Dehradun||HC gives state another week to file inquiry report into 'corruption at workers' board'||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday gave the state government another week to file the preliminary inquiry report into alleged corruption at the Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board. The state government informed the bench of Justices Manoj Tiwari and Alok Kumar Verma that a preliminary investigation into the alleged corruption is complete and the same will be submitted before the court, but it needs a week’s time. The court then listed the case for further hearing after a week. As reported by TOI earlier, a PIL has been filed in the HC by a Kashipur resident, Khurshid Ahmed, alleging that the board gave a contract of Rs 50 crore to a private firm for building a hospital in Kotdwar and paid Rs 20 crore in advance without getting permission from the state government. The petition further said the money was released even though the land for the hospital is yet to be identified. In December last year, an inquiry was initiated. The committee submitted its report in March which found that Rs 20 crore were indeed siphoned off. However, the report is yet to be made public. In another instance, the board issued advertisements to procure sewing machines, cycles and other toolkits for the labourers. Corruption allegations surfaced in this case too. When a complaint was made to the governor, the board was dissolved and a new chairman appointed in October. The new chairman Shamsher Singh Satyal conducted an inquiry and reportedly found the involvement of several officials and politicians. The government soon dismissed him and appointed another official for the inquiry. Now, Singh has approached the HC pleading that he should be made a party in the case since he is still the chairman of the board and knows about the alleged corruption. The board is an umbrella organisation created in 2000 for the welfare of the workers and to enforce various labour laws in the state. The board is also involved in ensuring minimum wages, equal work equal pay and several other rights of the workers. Its members include labourers, masons, electricians and plumbers involved in governmental and non-governmental projects. The board comes under the department of labour in the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-gives-state-another-week-to-file-inquiry-report-into-corruption-at-workers-board/articleshow/85986782.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Jaipur||Leaders who betrayed party will face action, says Dotasra||Jaipur: Congress suspended zila parishad member (ward no. 17) Rama Devi for six years from the party after the latter filed her nomination for zila pramukh with BJP’s support on Monday. The Congress got a wafer-thin majority (27 out of 51 wards) in the Jaipur zila parishad elections. With Rama Devi another member also cross voting, the Congress lost in the race for zila pramukh in Jaipur by just one vote. Now both the parties have won in three zila parishads but the BJP is far behind in the pradhan posts. PCC chief Govind Singh Dotasra said that some Congressman turned traitor and defeated the party in Jaipur. He said the party would take action against those leaders who had turned party's victory into defeat in Jaipur. He said report would be sent to the AICC against those leaders who had played spoilsport and action will be taken against them. Dotasra said the party was able to elect its pradhan in 50 out of 78 panchayat samitis (with one Independent supported) while BJP had to satisfy with 25 while independents won in 3. He said Congress captured 22 panchayat samitis from BJP while in 9 panchayat samitis Congress pradhan elected unopposed. He added that in 10 of the 25 panchayat samitis, BJP nominee won by a single vote. He said even then the saffron party is celebrating it as a major victory for the party. He accused BJP state chief Satish Poonia of stooping too low as he claimed victory in Jodhpur terming it as defeat of chief minister Ashok Gehlot despite Congress’ Leela Maderna elected zila pramukh. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas alleged that the BJP used money power to buy two members elected on Congress symbol and undermined the mandate of the people. He said those who humiliate people’s mandate would be taught a lesson by the people in 2023 elections. The spectacular victory of the Congress in the panchayati raj elections proved once again that in Rajasthan, from the village poor and farmers to the common man, like the chief minister Ashok Gehlot and the Congress government, said Mahendra Chaudhary, party deputy chief whip in the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/leaders-who-betrayed-party-will-face-action-says-dotasra/articleshow/85991626.cms||---

This year the festival will commence on September 10 and conclude on September 19. To ensure smooth flow of procession and hassle-free immersions, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has deployed its staff at 170 focal points as well as 28 artificial ponds in the city.

The fan club account with over 1.1 million followers was centered around BTS’Jimin. The restrictions imposed on the account came amid China’s campaign to clamp down on “irrational behaviour” exhibited by fans. Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a “national rejuvenation” with tighter Communist Party control of business, education, culture and religion. The BTS fan account was banned from posting on Weibo after images circulated online last week of a customised airplane from Jeju Air with images of Jimin on it. The airplane was part of the club’s plans to celebrate his 26th birthday in October. The stunt drew swift criticism online for its excess. Weibo said on Sunday that the group has been banned from posting for 60 days after it was found to have raised funds illegally. “Weibo firmly opposes such irrational star-chasing behavior and will deal with it seriously,” it said. The fan club began raising money in April with over $150,000 raised in the first three minutes of the fundraising activity and $360,000 in the first hour. Weibo also banned 21 other fan accounts for 30 days for posting “irrational star-chasing” content. They were mostly centered around members of K-pop bands NCT, EXO and Blackpink.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/weibo-bans-k-pop-fan-clubs-over-funds-for-bts-plane/articleshow/85994847.cms||---

---||Dehradun||‘Firms approaching IIT-R to buy paper made out of pine needles’||Roorkee: The scientists of IIT-Roorkee, who claimed to have developed first of its kind (functional) paper for fruits and vegetables packaging in the country, said that offers were pouring in from paper manufacturers to get commercial exploitation of their research. They said that their research had been published in an industrial research journal in May this year and since then, around half a dozen packaging material companies in the country have approached them for technology transfer. The scientists at department of paper technology (DPT) of institute used pine needles, which are the leaves of chir pine trees generally found in abundance in Uttarakhand, in developing the said functional paper that enhances the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables by at least a week more than their regular shelf life. According to them, fruits in storages emit ethylene gas which generally causes early ripping of the fruit. To retard the ethylene gas process, they incorporated some functional property in cellulose content before final making of the paper. It is pertinent to note that cellulose, which is found over 41 percent in pine needle waste, is one of main ingredients used in paper making. "Wood is generally used for paper making. But pine needles is in itself a non-wood item. Use of pine needles does not even only create a situation of deforestation but offers an eco-friendly and sustainable approach in using the raw material to the packaging industry of the country," maintains 35-year-old professor Kirtiraj K Gaikwad at DPT which operates from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh. A research paper authored by Gaikwad and his PhD research scholar Avinash Kumar has been published in May issue of an international research journal; Industrial Crops and Products. "Since then (from May) we have been getting offers from packaging industries from Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Maharashtra like states for technology transfer. As process of patenting of our technology is in pipeline, we negotiate the aspirant buyers after that,"added Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/firms-approaching-iit-r-to-buy-paper-made-out-of-pine-needles/articleshow/85986867.cms||Tapan Susheel

Most people complain that the door-to-door garbage collection is not functioning properly. JMC-Heritage ward 10 councillor Rajat Bishnoi said garbage vehicles come once in four days. Though hundreds of complaints have been registered, there has been no change in the situation. Similar complaints have also come from In Amber zone wards 1 & 2 where vehicles are not coming to collect trash at all. In other parts of Walled City, which is supposed to be a heritage site, garbage depots are back to their original place. People are forced to throw garbage on roadsides, where trash gets piled up before being picked up by sanitation workers. JMC-Greater ward 7 councillor Santosh Aggarwal said there was a need to improve the situation. In her ward, the vehicles come for five days and then there is no garbage collection for 15 days at a stretch. The condition is no different in other parts of Murlipura zone where all the councillors are fed up with the sanitation condition. Complaints have been filed and she said the firm responsible for garbage collection responds by saying that they are not being paid by the corporation. JMC-Greater deputy mayor Puneet Karnawat said the company responsible for garbage collection is not working efficiently. “We want to change the company and get someone better but due to legal glitches, we cannot. But the condition is really pathetic around the city. We are thinking of finding a solution to it,” said Karnawat. In ward 45, people have threatened to agitate over the issue. Things improved for a few days but after some time, affairs are back to normal. Councillors say that there is no use in fighting everyday with the company officials as the condition is not getting improved and the public is facing inconvenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/garbage-collection-system-inefficient-residents-cry-foul/articleshow/85991715.cms||---

After identifying nearly 75 locations, including the Central Park, Jawahar Circle, Nursery Circle (Vaishali Nagar) and SMS Hospital parking, the civic body has decided private companies to set up the charging stations. A senior official said, “The JDA will lease out its land situated on prime locations to these companies for establishing charging stations. The last date to submit EOI is September 27.” Earlier, Rajasthan Electronics & Instruments Ltd (REIL) and Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) had shown interest to establish these stations. Earlier, EV chargers were proposed to install by REIL under the FAME Scheme of department of heavy industry, ministry of heavy industries & public enterprises, government of India with the objective to promote electric mobility by creating charging infrastructure and creating awareness. Official informed, the city will have two types of charging stations - fast and slow. The fast-charging stations will take 60 minutes and slow charging station will take 6 hours. “For slow charging stations, 800 square feet land will be required and at least 10 vehicles can be charged at a given time. Similarly, fast-charging stations will be set up in 460 square feet and its capacity will be six vehicles. However, it would also depend on the size of the vehicle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-invites-firms-to-install-electric-car-charging-stations/articleshow/85991704.cms||---

They also alleged that the interview process for allotment of plots went on after the election commission’s model code of conduct came into effect on February 26.The government submitted that Sidco has proposed to allot 43 plots for which 267 applications were received. Interviews for the applicants were conducted on February 19, 22 and 26. The interview process was concluded by 2.30pm on February 26 and the screening committee selected 111 applicants as eligible for allotment of plots.Since there were only 43 plots, a lot system was conducted in the presence of the members of the screening committee and allotment orders were dispatched to them. The entire process was completed before 4.30pm on February 26 when the model code of conduct came into effect. Hence, the government submitted that it is wrong to say that the interview was conducted even after the announcement.The government also submitted that Sidco’s proposal to conduct it in the presence of shortlisted candidates and by videographing the same has been approved. Sidco will follow this new procedure in all the future allotments.Justice J Nisha Banu took note of the government’s submissions and observed that since the lot system has been conducted in the presence of the screening committee consisting of officials from various departments, the question of favouritism or secretive selection does not arise. Hence, the judge dismissed the petitions, by observing that the allotment orders need not be interfered with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sidco-plots-hc-dismisses-pleas-on-irregularities/articleshow/85989413.cms||---

Teachers will protest outside the deputy commissioner’s office on September 9 if the deputy DEO is not removed from the post, they said. Teacher Supandeep Kaur, who was allegedly reprimanded, is deputed at Government Primary School in Sahnewal and is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital. Dharamjit Singh from Master Cadre Union said, “The teacher was admonished so badly that she suffered a shock. We want the deputy DEO to resign and if no action is taken, we will make it a state-level issue and approach political parties for intervention. Secretary, education, Krishan Kumar also visited Ludhiana on Saturday, but turned a deaf ear to this horrible incident. They are highlighting the achievements of the education department, but suppressing our demands.”When called up for a comment, DEO Jaswinder Kaur said she was attending a meeting chaired by the ADC. The incident A vaccination drive was going on at the Sahnewal school since August 1. It was arranged by the civic body officials “without the permission of the school authorities”. Of the over 600 students enrolled, 400 were present on the day. While there were hardly five rooms for the students, the vaccination drive saw over 200 people visiting the school, leading to a great rush. Children were made to sit outside in the sun for hours. After the school hours got over, Supandeep and her colleague Ramandeep Kaur asked the area municipal councillor to arrange for a person to oversee the vaccine drive and ensure the safety of the school furniture and other equipment. In response to this, the councillor told both the teachers that they could leave the school in the evening after completion of the drive. In the meantime, DEO Jaswinder Kaur, deputy DEO Kuldeep Singh and office clerk Harminder Singh Romi arrived and threatened both the teachers that they would initiate a departmental inquiry against them and transfer them to a remote location. Sapandeep was snubbed so badly that she fell unconscious, said teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/teachers-seek-dy-deos-removal-else-will-protest-outside-dc-office/articleshow/85986899.cms||Mehak Jain

Children were told to sit outside to follow social distancing and Covid protocols. The paucity of space and rooms in government schools makes it difficult to manage public. Therefore, vaccination drives for the public should not be organised there.”Another teacher Ranjit Kaur said, “Vaccination drives and Covid sample collection create a lot of hustle and bustle on the school premises. If the Covid sampling is for students and vaccination for teachers, then it is still justified. However, vaccination drives for the public must be organised at other public places like common parks, temples and community health centres or hospitals. We face difficulty in arranging space for the drives and ensuring sitting arrangements and water facility for the public. Schools have to deploy their teachers and Class IV employees to manage the drives. Either the municipal corporation or the health department should provide these services.”Another teacher said, “The government schools are not provided any special funds to organise vaccine camps, which hassle both staff and children. The public comes in contact with children and can be carrier of infection. This issue must be taken up with the authorities so that the vaccine drives can continue without affecting the studies of children.” ‘We have limited location options’District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said, “We have received a letter from the government to organise camps at various locations, including schools. First, that letter has to be withdrawn, so that drives are not held in schools, but we have limited options in terms of locations. On Sunday, vaccination sessions were held at 300 sites, including schools, and no issue was witnessed anywhere. Due to one single site, we just cannot do this. The issue was between camp organisers and school authorities, which has been sorted out. We have never received any such complaints before from any school authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/vax-drives-should-not-be-held-in-govt-schools/articleshow/85986955.cms||Mehak Jain

At present, only 50 guests are allowed, due to which people have started switching to nearby states for destination weddings, causing losses to the state’s wedding industry. The All Wedding Industries Federation members went to meet chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday to give him a memorandum of their demands. The OSD of CM, Devaram Saini, met them and listened to their demand of withdrawing the limit of 50 guests for weddings in the state and demanded to increase the number to 400 guests. General secretary of the federation, Bhawani Singh said, “At present, there is a guideline of 50 guests for marriages in the state, due to which marriages and other events are not being held in the state, whereas in other states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh etc. the guideline states a limit of 200 to 400 guests. This is why people from Rajasthan are getting married in nearby states. This shifting of business of the state to other states, along with the loss of four lakh traders of Rajasthan’s wedding industry, the state government is also losing revenue. Hence, we are requesting for a change in the guidelines.” The state government has unlocked the business of the entire state, has also opened schools, colleges, cinema halls in which hundreds of people gather, but 50 guests are still decided for weddings. Federation members said that many people are now vaccinated in the state, due to which the risk of Covid infection has also reduced. So, the government is being urged to eliminate the limit of 50 people and issue a guideline of 400 people so that marriage venues for weddings, tents, catering, confectionery, DJ sound etc. do not face any further losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raise-guest-limit-to-400-demands-raj-wedding-industry/articleshow/85991743.cms||---
---||Dehradun||In U’khand, both BJP & Cong rift-ridden||Dehradun: With assembly elections just a few months away in Uttarakhand, several incidents in the past couple of months in both Congress and BJP, have exposed the ongoing infighting within the two main political parties. For the ruling BJP, changing three chief ministers within three months added fuel to the fire and gave the Congress an opportunity to start highlighting this as a "weakness". After the party elected Puskhar Singh Dhami as the new CM, displeasure among senior party members and MLAs came to the fore. Recently, BJP MLA Umesh Sharma Kau had a heated exchange with party members at a public event in front of health minister Dhan Singh Rawat. Another ruling party MLA Deshraj Karnwal had a public tiff on Sunday with Roorkee mayor Gaurav Goel. Reacting to the incidents, BJP spokesperson Manvir Singh Chauhan told TOI, "State president Madan Kaushik has taken cognisance of both the incidents and ordered an enquiry." Sources told TOI that former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat is trying to shift his constituency from Doiwala to Raipur making incumbent MLA Umesh Sharma Kau uncomfortable. Former CM Harish Rawat has meanwhile claimed that several BJP MLAs are not happy with the ruling party and are "planning to switch sides". The infighting within the Congress has seen a brief pause since Ganesh Godiyal was named as the state party chief although the differences amongst the state top brass has been no secret either. Earlier, it was the factions led by Pritam Singh, Harish Rawat and Indira Hridayesh, which were at loggerheads. After Hridayesh's demise, both groups of Rawat and Singh remained engrossed in the fight for supremacy. The tussle between the two led to more than a month's delay in naming a new leader of opposition and state chief. It was only after Singh was named leader of opposition and Godiyal - said to be close to Rawat - was made state president, both sides have maintained peace and are participating actively in the party's 'Parivartan Yatra'. "Difference in opinion is a healthy sign for democracy and the country's politics. Our leaders may hold different opinions, but the determination to serve the state and its people remains the same,"Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana alleged. Meanwhile, political analysts said that with in-fighting in both parties apparently evident, the chances of more defections cannot be ruled out as disgruntled ticket-seekers in both parties will shift stables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-ukhand-both-bjp-cong-rift-ridden/articleshow/85986938.cms||Kautilya Singh

Dr Sudhendu Patel, a city-based internal medicine specialist, said that about 20-25% of patients in the OPD are advised to get admitted when their fever does not subside with medicines, and they develop secondary infection or report further complications. “Last year, chikungunya cases were more, and dengue were negligible, but this year both are occurring in equal measures. Those with immunocompromised conditions are more at risk. A few of the patients also reported encephalitis as a complication,” he said. TimesViewThere is an alarming rise in dengue cases. Authorities need to undertake massive awareness campaigns to fight the problem.Under-construction buildings and schools must be checked for mosquito breeding. People must be educated about getting rid of water accumulation, which is commonplace due to the persistent spells of rain. Such measures are vital to prevent dengue from spiralling out of control.Dr Vivek Dave, a critical care specialist, said, “The classical symptoms we see include intense bodyache, high-grade fever and, in several cases, joint pain. We recommend fluid therapy, analgesics, and rest as the effective way to deal with the infection. Those with co-morbidities may report rapid deterioration. So, one must consult doctors quickly after onset of symptoms.” Dr Hardik Mehta, an intensivist, said that compared to the past years, 2021 reports about 25-30% more cases of vector-borne diseases. “Stagnation of water due to erratic monsoon along with high number of infrastructural projects could be some of the reasons for the rise. Secondary complications have also increased among patients this year,” he said. “We need to study whether reduced immunity due to Covid infection has a role to play in more severe diseases this year.” Experts said that out of total OPDs, about 40% patients are of vector-borne diseases, whereas the rest are comprising of seasonal flu and other ailments. While the diseases are reported from almost all areas of the city, the western city areas have reported more prevalence, they added. Hospitals have witnessed up to three-fold rise in the cases in the past fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/water-vector-peril-20-in-opd-need-hospitalization/articleshow/85991778.cms||Parth Shastri

The trio had been operating from a photography studio in Tilak Nagar, Tibba, for the past three months. They had a licence to make Aadhaar cards in Assam. The probe pointed out that the accused had made more than 450 Aadhaar cards. The police had recovered forged stamps, 16 Aadhaar cards and other equipment from the possession of Raj Kumar, 48, of New Subhash Nagar, Raj Kumar Sunny, 42, of Bajra village and Vinod Kumar Bhalla, 42, of Tilak Nagar, Rahon Road. They were operating from Vinod’s photography studio.On September 5, the city police had busted a similar racket with the arrest of two —Jora Singh and Gursewak Singh of Samrala. Certificates for Aadhaar card enrollment / update, receipts, 74 Aadhaar cards, five voter cards, three fingerprint impressions made using adhesive, three laptops, one fingerprint scanner, one eye scanner, pen drives and two printers were recovered from them. They were using the ID of a Telangana Aadhaar enrolment centre.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “In both the cases, the accused tampered with the system of UIDAI and used genuine IDs to issue Aadhaar cards on fake identity proofs. In August, we had written to the Unique Identification Authority of India to share details of the Aadhaar cards issued by the accused using Assam ID, as criminals use such people to get forged ID proofs. However, the authority refused to share any details.”“This is a matter of serious concern, as in many frauds and crimes, miscreants use forged ID proofs. Moreover, Aadhaar card is an important document. In both the cases, a man named Kuldeep Singh of Munidya Kalan is the kingpin. He had arranged IDs of Assam and Telangana for the accused. Also, Bihar resident Kapil Kumar provided them all the technical support. We have booked Kuldeep and Kapil and are trying to trace them. We suspect more such rackets must be operating in Punjab with the help of Kuldeep,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/uidais-refusal-to-share-data-is-hindering-probe-say-police/articleshow/85986976.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat, three northeast states more vulnerable to dengue occurrences: ICMR||AHMEDABAD: In India, Gujarat and three northeastern states are at the greatest risk of high repeat incidence of dengue. This observation is derived from a mammoth survey that began in January 2014, in which 2.11 lakh dengue cases across India were analyzed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. By early 2018, the institution had collected details of IgM antibodies or NS1 antigen against the dengue virus from 51 Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) spread across India. ICMR-NIE epidemiologists found that across almost 85% of Gujarat’s area, the dengue incidence rate was between 29 and 54 cases for the same geographical location between January 2014 and early January 2018. The scientists had used the Kriging technique to draw a heat map for the country, clearly marking out the areas with a high dengue incidence rate. As for the northeastern states, the study suggested that Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur are highly vulnerable to frequent dengue outbreaks. The epidemiologists who worked on the project included Vasna Joshua, K Kanagasabai, R Sabarinathan, M Ravi, B K Kirubakaran, and V Ramachandran of the ICMR-NIE. Using a method called the Kulldorff Space Time Scan Statistics, the researchers found eight significant clusters, mostly districts, which had high dengue incidence rates in the country. Apart from vast swathes of Gujarat, these districts included Nagpur (Maharashtra); Jhunjhunu (Rajasthan); Gadag and Dakshin Kannada (Karnataka); Kancheepuram and Sivaganga (Tamil Nadu); Ernakulam (Kerala); and Malda (West Bengal). “Our analysis had certain limitations. It was based on the data collected from patients seeking care at medical college hospitals,” the researchers said. “[The data was] reported by the health authorities covered under VRDLs and might not have included all the cases of dengue fever spread over the entire country.” This caveat was issued by the researchers in a special note of the paper published in the ICMR’s own publication called “Journal of Vector Borne Diseases”, in the September edition this year. The paper added that of the 2.11 lakh cases that were analyzed for IgM antibodies or NS1 antigen against the dengue virus, 60,096 (28.4%) were positive for the antibodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/study-gujarat-prone-to-repeated-dengue-strikes/articleshow/85991797.cms||Paul John
---||Goa||Goa: Navy’s indigenisation reflects atma nirbharta, says President Ram Nath Kovind||DABOLIM: President Ram Nath Kovind, the supreme commander of the Indian Armed Forces, presented the President’s Colour to Indian Naval Aviation at INS Hansa here on Monday. Kovind said the Navy has not only rendered “exceptional service” to the nation, but also underscored India’s vision of being the “preferred security partner” and “first responder” in the Indian Ocean region. He said the strides towards indigenisation showed the “atma nirbharta” in the defence sector. Paying tributes to the pioneers of naval aviation, Kovind said that the President’s Colour is a tribute to the men and women of the Indian Navy who have accomplished the assigned task, sometimes at the cost of their own lives. Unity in diversity: The President’s Colour was placed on an altar fashioned from drums and was consecrated by military religious teachers. The altar was made by members of the naval band“The Indian Navy has invested significant effort in meeting all regional commitments and furthering our diplomatic engagements with friends and partners in the Indo-Pacific,” said Kovind. “With missions like Operation ‘Samudra Setu’ and ‘Mission Sagar’, the Navy was a key instrument of India’s Covid outreach, delivering assistance and support to our maritime neighbours and partners in the Indian Ocean region.” Kovind went on and said, “The prompt and effective deployment of the Indian Navy in this time of crisis has underscored India’s vision of being the preferred security partner and first responder in the Indian Ocean region.” Governor PS Sreedharan Pillai, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command Vice-Admiral R Hari Kumar, minister of state for tourism, ports, shipping and waterways Shripad Naik and chief minister Pramod Sawant were present for the event. The president lauded the Indian Navy for the strides towards indigenisation. “I am told that the Indian Navy has actively taken up indigenisation. This is well reflected in the Navy’s current and future acquisition plans, which are powered by indigenisation,” said Kovind. The indigenously-built aircraft carrier, IAC-1, Light Combat Aircraft (Navy), indigenous weapons, sensors and Data Link suites reflect the Indian Navy’s march towards “atmanirbharta in defence sector,” said Kovind. Flag Officer Naval Aviation (FONA), rear admiral Philipose George Pynumootil, said that in line with the Centre’s vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the Indian Navy is steadily increasing the indigenous content in the aircraft. At the same time, Philipose said the presentation of the coveted President’s Colour is the right time for the Indian Navy to take stock of its current capabilities and adapt to the changing nature of operations. “Whilst technologies, weapons, sensors and platforms rapidly get modernised, we need to remember the crucial role of the men and women behind the machine and that the timeless values of courage, integrity, honour and willpower would continue to be the deciding factors in any conflict,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navys-indigenisation-reflects-atma-nirbharta-prez-kovind/articleshow/85991809.cms||Newton Sequeira

This observation is derived from a mammoth survey that began in January 2014, in which 2.11 lakh dengue cases across India were analyzed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. By early 2018, the institution had collected details of IgM antibodies or NS1 antigen against the dengue virus from 51 Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs) spread across India. ICMR-NIE epidemiologists found that across almost 85% of Gujarat’s area, the dengue incidence rate was between 29 and 54 cases for the same geographical location between January 2014 and early January 2018. The scientists had used the Kriging technique to draw a heat map for the country, clearly marking out the areas with a high dengue incidence rate. As for the northeastern states, the study suggested that Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur are highly vulnerable to frequent dengue outbreaks. The epidemiologists who worked on the project included Vasna Joshua, K Kanagasabai, R Sabarinathan, M Ravi, B K Kirubakaran, and V Ramachandran of the ICMR-NIE. Using a method called the Kulldorff Space Time Scan Statistics, the researchers found eight significant clusters, mostly districts, which had high dengue incidence rates in the country. Apart from vast swathes of Gujarat, these districts included Nagpur (Maharashtra); Jhunjhunu (Rajasthan); Gadag and Dakshin Kannada (Karnataka); Kancheepuram and Sivaganga (Tamil Nadu); Ernakulam (Kerala); and Malda (West Bengal). “Our analysis had certain limitations. It was based on the data collected from patients seeking care at medical college hospitals,” the researchers said. “[The data was] reported by the health authorities covered under VRDLs and might not have included all the cases of dengue fever spread over the entire country.” This caveat was issued by the researchers in a special note of the paper published in the ICMR’s own publication called “Journal of Vector Borne Diseases”, in the September edition this year. The paper added that of the 2.11 lakh cases that were analyzed for IgM antibodies or NS1 antigen against the dengue virus, 60,096 (28.4%) were positive for the antibodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/study-gujarat-prone-to-repeated-dengue-strikes/articleshow/86000708.cms||Paul John

The family members of the deceased Shivsingh Tomar alleged that he was tortured in police custody after his arrest and refused to accept his body for cremation. However, after the intervention of senior police officials and assurance of a thorough investigation, Tomar’s family accepted his body which will be taken to his native place in Muraina, Madhya Pradesh, for cremation. Tomar, who works as a security guard at a diamond unit was arrested on September 1 under Prohibition Act and later released on bail the next day. “On September 3, Tomar went to get back his mobile phone and cash from the cops. After returning from the police station Tomar’s health deteriorated and was taken to NCH where doctors claimed that he had suffered brain haemorrhage,” Tomar’s nephew Satish told TOI. Tomar was put on ventilator on September 3, but he did not respond to treatment and succumbed on Monday, said Satish. He alleged that his uncle was tortured while in police custody.

Jai alleged that his brother Shakti had shown bruises and injury marks inflicted by his wife and children. “The complainant also alleged that on August 30, Shakti had told him that he was upset with the behaviour of his family members,” the officer added. The complaint has alleged that Shakti’s wife Suman Kanwar wanted to get the job of his brother after the death, which prompted her to take his life. Police suspect foul play and family dispute. “We have registered a case of murder. Prima facie the complaint does not appears to have much substance.

The rains started in Ahmedabad city from late Monday night with thunderstorm. Areas such as Paldi, Satellite, Bopal-Ghuma, Thaltej, Ghatlodia, etc. reported light to moderate showers accompanied by lightning as the citizens scurried to get home ahead of the start of curfew hours. On Monday, the state recorded 50% of its seasonal rainfall, even as there is only a fortnight to go before the start of monsoon withdrawal. Experts said that the next few days will be crucial to determine the rain deficit of the year. As sowing is already done in over 90% of the farming area, the rains will give it a new lease of life, they added. “The low-pressure area in Bay of Bengal has resulted in a strong weather system which is coming towards Gujarat. The system is likely to give a good rainfall to several parts of central and western India. Thus, it’s very likely that majority of the state regions would receive good rainfall this week,” said a senior Met department official. The rains started on Monday with Surat city getting 84mm rainfall till 10pm, followed by 78mm in Suigam in Banaskantha, 72mm in Navsari, 70mm in Kotdasangani in Rajkot, and 57mm in Palsana in Surat. Almost all districts of south Gujarat and some parts of central Gujarat and Saurashtra are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rains from September 7 to 10, mentioned IMD forecast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-gets-thundershowers-rain-likely-for-next-4-days/articleshow/85991833.cms||---

The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Justice BR Gavai also sought a response from the Bar Council of India and Supreme Court Bar Association on a plea to declare virtual court hearings as a fundamental right for the litigants. As reported by TOI earlier, Uttarakhand HC had issued an administrative order through registrar general, Dhananjay Chaturvedi, on August 16 saying that the high court will abandon virtual hearing from August 24 and function only through physical mode. The notification added that no request for a virtual hearing will be entertained by the court. The decision, however, has been challenged by a lawyers’ body called All India Jurists Association and legal journalist Sparsh Upadhyay demanding that access to virtual courts for applicants, advocates and journalists should be declared a fundamental right.

It is, however, permitting the traditional fair on the D B Marg and the matoli bazaar at a designated area near Royal Foods. The corporation has “strictly prohibited” the sale and purchase of plaster of Paris idols due to damage caused to the environment and is permitting two from a family to pick up idols from ‘chitrashallas’, and two to three from a household for immersion during the permitted time from 5pm to 10pm. Ganesh committees have been advised against using firecrackers and fireworks to avoid pollution. CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate said flowers and garlands should be deposited in containers and placed at each immersion site and not be disposed of in water bodies. He added that processions will not be allowed while bringing idols to the immersion point. No special stalls will be erected anywhere in Panaji for sale of firecrackers and fireworks except those permitted by the corporation. When asked how the corporation would enforce all the guidelines, Monserrate said it is up to police who will have to start imposing fines on defaulters. He added that the corporation will have a separate meeting with the police department on this matter. “People should act responsibly. We don’t want to be stuck in such a situation where cases spike and people are admitted to hospitals. Due to this we are encouraging everyone to be safe during the festival,” he said. The traditional fair on the promenade along the Mandovi from the ferry point till the forest department will be held from September 7 till September 10 with social distancing, while the matoli items will be sold near Royal Foods, corporator Pranay Mainkar said. “The traditional fair will have only traditional items like furniture, utensils and matoli items. Clothing and food stalls will not be permitted,” Mainkar said. The corporation will be allotting around 200 stalls for the fair. The forms with a fee of Rs 500 each are being given on a first come first serve basis and spaces are being allotted at Rs 100 per sqm per day, with a standard size of 4 by 2sqm. For the matoli bazaar the rate per day is Rs 60 per sqm. Mainkar said the forms will be scrutinised, but Monserrate said vendors will be allotted spaces on a first come first serve basis to avoid issues that cropped up at the fair in the past. “We have set numbers and will allot them to whoever comes first. We will not sit and decide who gets it and who doesn’t. There were a lot of issues last year, which should not happen again. The system is transparent,” he said. Panaji mayor hits out at MadkaikarCCP mayor Rohit Monserrate on Monday hit out at former mayor and corporator Uday Madkaikar for his statement that the city was lagging behind in development. Monserrate said Madkaikar should have raised the issue when he was mayor. He alleged that the mayor’s office during Madkaikar’s tenure didn’t put forward a single application to the director of municipal administration as a result of which Rs 10 crore funds were lost. The money could have been used for the public, for playgrounds, footpaths or areas for seniors to relax, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-fireworks-immersion-processions-for-ganesh-chaturthi-ccp/articleshow/85991820.cms||---

The state common entrance test (CET) cell that conducts the entrance examination for professional courses in Maharashtra had recently announced a registration link for appearing for the entrance test and candidates claimed that they were not able to fill up the forms because they did not meet the criteria. However, the CETcell officials stated that the rule was not for 2021-22 academic year admissions and the issue was still in court regarding the age eligibility. The proposal by the Bar Council of India for capping the age limit for law courses to 20 years for the five-year course and 30 years for the three-year course is pending. The Student Helping Hand, a non-governmental organisation working in the field of education, said that there were many individuals who would loose out on studying the law courses. Kuldeep Ambekar of the NGO said they have been getting many complaints from candidates who were trying to register for the exam and they could not fill up the form because they were overaged. “We tried speaking to officials at the the CET cell but they denied any such claim by the aspirants, .” The issue regarding the age capping has been around for about four to five years but there is no such order on the same yet. When contacted officials at the CET Cell, Jayant Patil, exam coordinator, said that, “There is no such notification regarding the capping of age limit for law courses. Students should not worry about it and fill up the forms. The government has not issued any such instructions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/law-aspirants-foxed-by-age-bar-in-cet-form/articleshow/85989520.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Jaipur||Two Congress members cross-vote, BJP wins Jaipur Zila Parishad||JAIPUR: In a high-voltage election to the post of Jaipur zila pramukh on Monday, cross-voting by two Congress zila parishad members helped rival BJP win the board. The ruling Congress, which holds a thin majority of 27 of the 51 seats, had to watch helplessly as party deserter Rama Devi won the post of Jaipur zila pramukh defeating its own Saroj Devi Sharma by the barest of margins. BJP won the election, which was held at the Jaipur Zila Parishad office amid tight security, by one vote after bagging 26 votes to 25 of Congress. A last-minute defection by Congress zila parishad member Rama Devi to BJP altered the equation completely in favour of the saffron party. Devi, who won as zila parishad member on Congress symbol from Ward No. 17, was fielded by BJP as candidate for the zila pramukh post. Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki’s aide, Jaiky Kumar Tantiyawal, who had won from Ward No. 18 as Congress candidate, too, voted in favour of BJP, taking the Congress tally down to 25. Prakash, who is a staunch Pilot supporter, had earlier said that it would be his responsibility if Kumar didn’t vote in favour of Congress. An altercation ensued between BJP and Congress workers outside the zila parishad office when Jaiky was brought to the election centre by BJP supporters. Later, the police had to resort to lathicharge when some Congress workers blocked the vehicle, which was supposed to be taken by BJP members and Jaiky. Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi and deputy leader of opposition in state assembly Rajendra Singh Rathore were present at the time of voting. Later, they drove away in the same car in the presence of mediapersons. After winning the post of zila pramukh, Rama Devi told reporters, “I switched over to BJP as the party’s state president Satish Pooniaji reposed faith in me to discharge the responsibility of a zila pramukh. I approached the BJP as their ideology suited my way of looking at various issues. They (BJP) didn’t come to me. I will work towards the development of the Jaipur district.” Earlier, the Congress had suspended Rama Devi's primary membership for six years after she filed her nomination paper as a BJP candidate. Before filing her papers, she was inducted into BJP by party president Satish Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-cong-members-cross-vote-bjp-wins-jaipur-zila-parishad/articleshow/85991909.cms||---

Around 57 mm of rain was recorded in the morning hours. The water started receding as the rain stopped later in the day and the roads got clear. However, waterlogging in Limbayat’s Mithi Khadi, Ayodhya Nagar Road in Adajan, Katargam and underpasses in Udhna and Dindoli created problems for the commuters. In Mithi Khadi, the waterlogging resulted due to overflowing rivulets. “There was waterlogging at the underpass but it got cleared soon. It did not create major issues in the movement of commuters,” said a Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) official. Residents of Ayodhya Nagar road claimed that due to waterlogging in the morning hours they had to face issues while leaving for work. “Waterlogging in this area is not common but this time it created a problem. Locals in the area could not go out for work,” said Gita Brahmbhatt, a resident of Adajan. Meanwhile, residents in Mithi Khadi claimed that they had to face problems while going to work. Mithi Khadi is the key area through which thousands of Limbayat residents go to work daily. A large number of workers engaged at the textile market and other industries faced inconvenience due to waterlogged railway underpasses and the Mithi Khadi area. “Businessmen like me face a lot of problems due to waterlogging in this area. In the past we have complained to the local authorities as it is a regular problem during monsoon,” said Imran Khan, a garage owner in Mithi Khadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/morning-downpour-leads-to-waterlogging-in-surat-city/articleshow/85989587.cms||---

At an event to mark teachers’ day, Sawant said that many new courses are set to be offered at the higher secondary school and college level from as early as next year, which can offer vertical mobility to Goan students to pursue higher education. “I held two meetings recently with education officials, and I have mainly stressed on two things: that we should focus on career-oriented education, and have a state-centric syllabus,” he said. “Already, a committee has been formed to work on the syllabus. The courses taught from the primary to the college level should offer students vertical mobility. Our department has started thinking on these lines.” Sawant suggested that a subject offered at the school level should offer potential to be pursued at the higher education level. He also said that the implementation of the new national education policy would be taken up from the next academic year. “There may have been delays due to the pandemic, but next year, we are preparing to implement the new education policy in a big way. The committees on school education and higher education have already submitted their report and we will provide the additional manpower required to implement their recommendations,” he said, addressing teachers after felicitating ten state teacher award winners. The CM said that especially in rural areas, students are unable to receive the required career guidance and that teachers need to step in. “Only a teacher can offer the best career counselling. I have seen that there is still a lack of career guidance, especially in villages. Teachers should think of it as their responsibility to provide career guidance to a student. It is not only those who are capable of becoming doctors, lawyers or engineers who should get career guidance, even a student who fails Class X should get career guidance,” Sawant said. He said that today, various skilling programmes are available even to a student who has cleared Class VIII under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushalya Yojana. Sawant also said that recruitment of new teachers has been expedited. “There may have been some delay, but we have already fast-tracked the process for aided and government schools. We have also fast-tracked promotions of existing teachers. We will try to complete this process at the earliest,” said Sawant. Sawant said that some difficulties were being experienced in conducting and accessing online classes in Goa, but teachers have gone out of their way, with some visiting students’ homes to teach in rural areas without connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/school-syllabus-being-made-career-oriented-cm/articleshow/85991885.cms||---

---||Trichy||Legal hurdles put a dead end to water ATMs in Trichy||Trichy: Two years after Trichy Corporation established two water ATM facilities in the city to distribute purified water at a nominal cost, legal hurdles have derailed the project permanently. The civic body has now considered to utilise the facility for other purposes including a bank ATM.The corporation had identified 70 locations under the community drinking water system to establish water ATMs run by private firms under the design, build, operate, finance and transfer (DBOFT) scheme. Initially, space in the Main Guard Gate and old passport office were identified. Private players had established reverse osmosis (RO) units while the corporation provided space. However, the civic body, citing a court order against opening of facilities supplying water on a commercial basis, kept the two centres closed. “The civic body can at least use the space and investment made for other purposes. Safe and purified water at a subsidised price was a good move,” R Raveendran, a resident of Big Bazaar street said. The centre was supposed to refill 20l water can for Rs 7. The civic body said that opening the facility will make the vicinity vulnerable to water stagnation and hygiene issues. “Converting as a bank ATM was one of the viable options we have. A decision is yet to be taken,” a source with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/legal-hurdles-put-a-dead-end-to-water-atms-in-trichy/articleshow/85991868.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Trichy||Street schools help keep rural students engaged||Trichy: The alumni of Thayanur panchayat union primary school near Trichy are conducting street schools so that children studying in rural schools are taught basics of the syllabus. Around 200 children have got permission from their parents to get training from the alumni and graduated homemakers for about two hours every day. The classes are being conducted at the rate of 20 students per centre in open space either in the backyard or terrace of the houses.Street schools concept was conceived by R Rajamanickam, an alumnus of Thayanur panchayat union primary school, after he got requests from neighbourhood kids to help them in academics during the lockdown. As online coaching classes are still a distant dream for many rural kids studying in lower classes, and with their parents occupied in work, kids were found disengaged from their routine learning. “Once I started coaching my neighbour’s kids after completing my work, more kids started to join us on the terrace for coaching. Then we coordinated with the school, other alumni and homemakers in our village to hold similar classes,” Rajamanickam, an employee of TNPL said. The alumni have been hosting street schools in 10 locations in Pallakadu, Melakadu and Kizhakadu hamlets, each located within 1km of the other. Classes are conducted between 5pm and 7pm or based on the availability of the tutors. Drawing, storytelling and elocution training are also offered to keep the rural kids engaged.Parents in Thayanur have also come forward to enrol their children who are studying in other schools. Basic maths and science were explained in Tamil by the tutors. “Social distancing and facemask is ensured and we monitor the conduct and quality of coaching too,”said G Maheshwari, headmistress, Thayanur panchayat union primary school. An examination has also been planned to review the performance of the kids. The school education department said that they are considering expanding the street school drive in other villages where online teaching is unviable. A few NGOs on hearing their success story has come forward to offer financial support to homemakers working as street school teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/street-schools-help-keep-rural-students-engaged/articleshow/85991844.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Bhopal||CBSE guidelines out, MCQ-based exams for Class 10 & 12 in first term in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Like engineering students, CBSE school students of Class 10 and 12 in Bhopal will have MCQ-based questions in the first term in November and December. This is not a only a new experience but a radical shift from the usual pattern of evalutaion, keeping both students and teachers on their toes.  Schools have begun organising orientation classes to clear the doubts of students and parents. CBSE had issued comprehensive guidelines for schools to conduct the exams. The paper will now have case-based MCQs and MCQs on assertion-reasoning type. The second one is the one that will need more effort to get used to. Learning by rote will not work. Unless one has clear knowledge of concepts, it is difficult to atempt assertion-based questions. The tests will be of 90-minute duration and cover only the rationalized syllabus of Term I only (around 50% of the entire syllabus) Exams will be conducted under the supervision of External Center Superintendents and Observers appointed by CBSE. The responses of students will be captured on OMR sheets which, after scanning may be directly uploaded at CBSE portal or alternatively may be evaluated and marks obtained will be uploaded by the school the very same day. The final direction in this regard will be conveyed to schools. Marks of the term-1 will contribute to the final overall score of students. “Preparing for MCQ is completely different from theoretical exam preparation. Du to fear of third wave of Covid, I am not able to attend classes. In such a situation, preparing for the exams is dicey,” said Prashant Mishra, a class 12 student. Teachers said there is a lot of uncertainty regarding academics. “CBSE guidelines itself suggest that anything could happen. Instead of focusing on academics, students and parents are spending more time on the scheme of the examinations,” said a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cbse-guidelines-out-mcq-based-exams-for-class-10-12-in-1st-term/articleshow/85989598.cms||Ramendra Singh

They have also appealed to launch mobile DPCs which will be helpful to farmers owning more than 10 acres, as it will also avoid crowding at DPCs during the peak season. In a memorandum sent to the chief minister and various agriculture department officials and the district collectors of Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai districts, Arupathy P Kalyanam, the general secretary of the Federation of Cauvery Delta Farmers Association stated that the moisture content in paddy will go up to 25% due to rain from the normal 18% to 22%. At present the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) is procuring paddy with a maximum moisture of 17% to 20%. “The government should issue orders to the concerned authorities from TNCSC to procure paddy with 20% moisture without any price deduction, he added.“The equipment will help to dry 2 tonnes grains within two and half hours. The dryer should be made available for rent with 50 per cent subsidy,” Kalyanam further stated. On mobile procurement centre, he said, “Such procurement centres will be very helpful to farmers those who have raised kuruvai on more than 10 acres. This would also help avoid crowding in DPCs. Mobile purchase can be done from two farmers having 5 acres at a time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-seek-portable-paddy-dryers-at-centres/articleshow/85991913.cms||---
---||Pune||Microglitches spotted in stable millisecond pulsars||Pune: The upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) has confirmed an unexpected event in millisecond pulsars which are cosmic clocks. Pulsars are pulsating radio stars which function like lighthouses in space. They are ultra-dense dead stars with a radio flash once every rotation. This flashing radio signal or pulse ticks has unmatched stability in their periods and shapes and helps detect extremely low frequency gravitational waves. A group of nearly 40 astronomers, under the banner of Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA), has been monitoring a set of pulsars for the eventual detection of nanoHertz (nHz) gravitational waves. It has provided for the first time clear evidence of unexpected changes in a millisecond radio pulsar using the uGMRT. These changes have attracted the attention of astronomers across the globe. Bhal Chandra Joshi from National Centre for Radio Astronomy, who is part of the research, said millisecond pulsars are not expected to show such behaviour and this star-clock may not be good enough to search for gravitational waves. “The stable shape of their pulses is regarded as their fingerprints and is crucial to extract their clock-like pulse which ticks very precisely. Measuring these time ticks for a collection of pulsars is necessary for the momentous detection of nanoHertz gravitational waves in the near future,” Joshi said. Another member of this research, Jaikhomba Singha from IIT-Roorkee, said among the set of pulsars being observed, PSR J1713+0747 is one of the most reliable clocks. “Ongoing observations between April and May 2021, and thereafter, revealed strong evidence of a fingerprint change in this star disturbing its rhythm and clock behaviour,” Singha added. Earlier this year, InPTA became a part of the international pulsar timing array (IPTA) consortium, an international collaboration for spotting the elusive nanohertz gravitational waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/microglitches-spotted-in-stable-millisecond-pulsars/articleshow/85989974.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 42 hospitals get 7 days to shift patients||AHMEDABAD: The civic body on Monday gave a seven-day shutdown ultimatum to 42 hospitals in Ahmedabad which are operating without building-use permissions. The seven-day period is being given to shift patients from these hospitals to other facilities. The AMC has also cancelled the ‘C-Form’ validity certificates of these hospitals. “Patients require a copy of a hospital’s C-Form to file medical insurance claims,” said a senior AMC official. “Patients who are being treated at these hospitals will have to inform their medical insurance companies about the development.” A senior AMC town planner said: “Following the Supreme Court’s directions of August 27, we will have to seal the hospital premises after seven days. There is no respite this time.” The notice was issued by the AMC’s town planning department. The SC had earlier noted: “In an effort to save people from the pandemic, we are killing them by fire.” The SC made the observation while staying a Gujarat government order allowing private hospitals and nursing homes in the state to comply with the ‘building-use certificate’ requirement only by March 2022. A bench of Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and Justice M R Shah had said: “The building use permission is meant to ensure that a structure meets the norms under the law for the desired purpose.” The bench went on to say: “You cannot have a nursing home operating from the fifth floor of a building without any lift.” Last year in August, eight persons were killed in a fire at Shrey Hospital in Ahmedabad while in November 2020 five were killed at Uday Shivanand Hospital in Rajkot. This year in May, 16 Covid patients and two nurses were killed in Patel Welfare Hospital fire in Bharuch. Another fire had occurred at an ICU of a hospital in Surat in the same month; no casualties were reported. “The SC had made fire safety audits and fire safety NOCs mandatory for all hospitals,” said the senior AMC official. “The process of fire NOC renewal has to be put in place too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/42-hospitals-get-7-days-to-shift-patients/articleshow/85992008.cms||---
---||Trichy||Farmers urged to use green manure||Trichy: The agriculture department has launched a drive to enrich the soil by motivating farmers to use green manure in their fields before raising samba paddy crop in the district. Green manure would bring down the use of chemical fertilizers and also enhance productivity, officials said.“Farmers from the district are preparing their land to take up samba paddy cultivation as most of them have prepared nurseries. There is also good rainfall in several parts of the district. Before commencing transplantation of nursery, farmers should utilise the climate for raising green manure such as sunhemp and dhaincha on their barren land,” said M Murugesan, joint director of agriculture, Trichy district.Green manuring improves soil structure, increases water retention capacity and decreases soil erosion. Growing green manure on barren land reduces weed proliferation and growth. It also helps in the reclamation of alkaline soil, he added. Green manure is also less expensive than chemical fertilizer. “It draws nitrogen from the atmosphere and helps rejuvenate soil with low nitrogen conditions adding substantially to the yield of the next crop,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-urged-to-use-green-manure/articleshow/85991919.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC warrant against accused in Pehlu Khan lynching case||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court issued bailable warrants against the accused in the Pehlu Khan lynching case on Monday. The warrants have been issued against the six accused who were acquitted in the case by the Alwar sessions court on August 14, 2019, giving them benefit of doubt based on the police probe. Those let off by the sessions court were Vipin Yadav, Kalu Ram, Dayanand, Ravindra Kumar, Yogesh Kumar and Bheem Rathi. Three of the nine accused are minors. The government and the family of Pehlu Khan's son had appealed against the acquittal. The division bench of Justice Goverdhan Bardhar and Justice Vijay Vishnoi issued bailable warrants to secure their presence in the court returnable within eight weeks. Khan, 55, and his sons were transporting cows, after purchasing them from a cattle fair in Jaipur, to their home town Nuh in Haryana, when they were waylaid near Behror by self-styled cow vigilantes and beaten up on the accusation of smuggling cattle. Khan died from his injuries in a hospital after two days. The ADJ court ruled that the video footage of the incident that went viral on the social media could not be treated as admissible evidence in the absence of its certification by the forensic science laboratory. Besides, Khan’s sons reportedly could not identify the accused and the prosecution could not prove that they were the ones visible in the video.The court also found contradictions in the cause of death as variedly caused by heart attack and injuries inflicted during the attack. The man who recorded the video on his mobile phone did not testify, which created doubts about the identity of the accused. After registering the murder case, the police had also lodged cases for cow smuggling against Khan, his sons and other companions. Following the acquittal, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had accused the BJP government for tardy investigation. He called for an appeal against the lower court ruling in the high court. The state government set up a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the police lapses in investigation and decided to pursue the case in the high court. The state assembly also passed a Bill against mob lynching on August 5, 2019, making Rajasthan the second state after Manipur to have a dedicated legislation that criminalises lynching as a special offence. But it is still pending with the governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-warrant-against-accusedin-pehlu-khan-lynching-case/articleshow/85991963.cms||Joychen Joseph
---||Trichy||Govt urged to speed up power supply for agriculture sector||Trichy: Farmers have appealed the government to provide power connections to those who have registered for their motor pump sets several years back. Since lakhs of farmers are waiting for power supply from 2003, the government should give priority to small and marginal farmers who rely only on groundwater. “Around 4.2 lakh farmers who registered for power connection since 2003 are still waiting. For the last six years, it was being told that Tamil Nadu was a power surplus state. However, it seems that power connection was not provided to the farmers who are waiting for years,” they stated.“Officials from Tangedco announced that 25,000 connections were allotted for ordinary and self-financing schemes and another 25,000 for the tatkal scheme during the last tenure. However, till now that has not happened,” farmers said. For the first time in the history of the Tamil Nadu assembly, a separate budget was presented for the agriculture sector by the DMK government. “However, the budget has no word about allotment of free power connection for the year 2021-22,” secretary of the Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said. Farmers have to remit Rs 25,000 and Rs 50,000 under the self-financing scheme and Rs 10,000 for the normal scheme. The then AIADMK government had introduced the tatkal scheme. As per the scheme, farmers have a remit of Rs 2.5 lakh for a 5 HP motor connection, Rs 2.75 lakh for a 7.5 HP motor, Rs 3 lakh for a 10 HP power supply and Rs 4 lakh for a 10 HP motor. However, after the implementation of the tatkal scheme, the government ignored the normal and self-financing scheme, Vimalnathan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/govt-urged-to-speed-up-power-supply-for-agriculture-sector/articleshow/85991928.cms||---

However, we cooperated with the health team. On September 1, when the school was functioning, a local resident came with a health team. When they saw all classes were occupied, they left without saying anything. Minutes later, deputy DEO Kuldeep Singh, along with clerk Harminder Singh Romi, reached the school,” the complaint added.“The deputy DEO started scolding the school head teacher for not accommodating the health team for organizing the vaccination camp. Our head teacher told him nobody approached them for the camp. We already have insufficient classrooms. There are five classrooms, besides two under-construction ones, for 610 students. On the orders of the deputy DEO, we vacated a classroom as he asked us to make those students sit on the floor. The official insulted the head teacher and a man accompanying him, who owes allegiance to a political party, threatened to transfer her. Clerk Harminder Singh Romi made fun of the head teacher over transfer threats,” said a teacher.“Following this, our head teacher suffered a paralytic attack and collapsed. A written complaint has been given to the commissioner of police to take action against the official. A copy of the complaint has also been marked to the CM, the Chief Justice and the education department,” she added. The joint commissioner of police (headquarters) said he is looking into the complaint against the deputy district education officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/school-staff-send-complaint-against-dy-deo-to-police-chief/articleshow/85987130.cms||Payal Dhawan

Pathan said that the security of more than a dozen survivors and witnesses has been withdrawn over the past fortnight. “Of these, five are from Gulbarg Society and other five or six are witnesses in other key cases,” Pathan said. He had complained about the withdrawal of security to top state police officers last week. Speaking about the meeting, Pathan said, “A K Malhotra informed me that the case is more than 18 years old and protection cannot be provided to me and some others all our lives. I asked the officer who would be responsible if I am attacked. I also intend to challenge the withdrawal of security in the Supreme Court,” Pathan said. However, the security of prime witnesses in key 2002 post-Godhra riot cases has not been withdrawn. For instance, the security of Firozkhan’s brother Imtiyazkhan and father Saeedkhan – prime witnesses in Gulbarg Society case – continues. Earlier, the SC had directed the state government to provide protection to all witnesses in key 2002 communal riot cases in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/security-withdrawn-gulbarg-survivor-meets-sit-member/articleshow/85991982.cms||---

---||Delhi||Fruits of labour: How Rs 1,000 seed money has sprung new ideas||NEW DELHI: Fabricating a Bluetooth speaker, refurbishing mobile phones, selling paintings, handicrafts and jewellery — the seed money of Rs 1,000 given to students of a Delhi government school has been put to good use. Each of the projects undertaken as part of the entrepreneurship mindset curriculum has returned a profit in six weeks. The projects Divine Creation and Tap & Draw have logged profits of over Rs 20,000. In both these, the students employed their talent for sketching and painting into an earning proposition. Mayank Shukla, who is in Class XII at School of Excellence, Khichripur, said there were five of them, two of them good artists, who worked on Tap & Draw. “We made portraits on demand and used social media to reach customers. We gave a 20% commission to those who got us the maximum customers,” said Shukla. After his father suffered a heart attack, Abhishek, one of the artists, had been making portraits to pay school fees. Sheeza Ali made crafts and Sakshi Jha, dark chocolates for Home2Creations. Ali said, “Sakshi got infected with Covid, but eventually we managed to log sales.” Jha added, “We make the stuff ourselves for now, but have identified some housewives we will teach these arts to so they can support their families.” The success of Craft Cottage, which sold handmade trinkets, has given Muskan Soni the dream of a jewellery export career. While the Ionalts projects had students providing subscriptions to various platforms and special educational platforms to people at lowered prices, the Ink Family project customised textile printing and earned the nine group members a profit of Rs 3,830. Yash Patwal explained, “People want their identity reflected on their T-shirts and we did that for them. We want to use the profits to buy books.” An octet was involved with the Mobisite project on refurbishing phones. Sukh Sagar said, “I knew the basics of mobile phones, but I learnt in depth from the local dealer. People in the locality supported us and gave us their devices.” They have refurbished 12 phones so far. Those in the Speaksters project visited a workshop and learnt how to assemble Bluetooth speakers. Priced at Rs 299, the speakers make earphones redundant and can be a solution for online classes. Yash Gupta said, “Instead of using plastic cases, we used wooden ones.” The projects had a mentor, mostly students of Delhi Technological University who helped the schoolkids understand marketing and business operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fruits-of-labour-how-rs-1k-seed-money-has-sprung-new-ideas/articleshow/85992015.cms||Shradha Chettri

And Jabalpur that was the first district of Madhya Pradesh to report covid-19 cases in March 2020, has again reported maximum new cases in these past 7 days. And in 6 of these 9 districts less 75% of the eligible population has received even the first dose of vaccine. Overall between August 30 and September 5 a total of 104 new covid-19 cases were reported as per the state health bulletin released by directorate of health services. Maximum 23 new covid-19 case were reported from Jabalpur alone and only around 73% eligible population has received even the first dose of vaccine in Jabalpur. Besides these 23 cases, 9 new cases were reported on September 6 also. Thus in past 8 days 31 new covid-19 cases were reported in Jabalpur district. In the eye of the increasing covid-19 cases, district collector Jabalpur Karamveer Sharma has appealed to the people to remain alert. Citing using mask and vaccination as the most effective tool to fight covid-19, Sharma has urged the people to wear mask and reach out to the nearest vaccination centres for getting themselves vaccinated. And to speed up vaccination, district collector Jabalpur has ordered to carry out vaccinations on all seven days of the week in urban as well as rural areas of the district. Apart from Jabalpur it is Bhopal and Indore where next majority of the cases were reported in the past 7 days. A total of 22 new cases were reported from each of these districts. However while around 90% of the eligible population has been covered with atleast the first dose of vaccine in Bhopal, in Indore 100% eligible population has atleast received the first dose. After Jabalpur, Indore and Bhopal, it is Sagar district where 11 new covid-19 cases were reported in seven day period between August 30 and September 5, but only around 67% of the eligible population has even received the first dose of vaccine in the district. After Sagar, it was Dhar district where 6 cases were reported during the same duration but only 54% of population has been vaccinated with even the first dose in the district. Sources said that given to the past history of the speed at which the virus spreads, vaccination is the only way out, it is due to this reason that now vaccination is being carried out on all seven days of the week, as government has set a target of vaccinating every eligible individual with at least the first dose by September end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-in-past-7-days-jabalpur-reports-max-cases/articleshow/85987197.cms||Amarjeet Singh

She was virtually addressing the annual VG Patel Memorial Lecture at the Gandhinagar-based Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII). Connected from Raj Bhavan, she said that higher education institutions can play a critical role in making students self-sufficient by offering courses that are at the intersection of innovation, business skills and entrepreneurial mindset. She added that strengthening entrepreneurship education is key to achieving self-sufficiency and job creation. “This will not be easy in a country like India, where job security has been celebrated for decades. But certainly, a strong beginning has been made and heartening results are also coming about,” she said. Patel mentioned that she had recently attended a vice-chancellors’ meet in Lucknow organised by EDII to discuss the significance of entrepreneurship education in higher learning institutions that had received encouraging feedback. She added that the country needs to orient more students towards choosing entrepreneurship as a career. She also emphasised on entrepreneurship training involving all sections of society. “It is important to equip students with knowledge on business skills and entrepreneurial competencies to escalate their confidence. It is also desirable to expose them to business ideas and help them identify ones which can be incubated,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/entrepreneurship-education-must-for-job-creation-guv/articleshow/85991994.cms||Ankur Tewari

The top layer of the road has been damaged in long stretches and the road is peppered with many potholes. “When it rains, rainwater fills the deep potholes. A two-wheel rider just escaped from being hit by a bus during the Saturday’s rain,” said S Manickam of TPK Road.A 300m stretch of the road is badly damaged and when buses going to places such as Thirupatchethi and Thirupuvanam stop here, it causes traffic jams, said B Meenakshisundaram, a resident of South Marret Street.Residents said that they have been raising this issue with the civic body, but it has been replying that the road would get a makeover when the Periyar bus stand work is over. “This is actually a violation of human rights, because people can put up with the inconvenience for three months, maybe six months, but more than two years is unacceptable,” said N Chandran of Anupanadi.Sekhar, a shopkeeper, said that the heavy vehicles bringing construction materials to the bus stand work site also deepened the grooves on the road.Corporation sources said that the road would be re-laid once the Periyar bus stand work is completed. “Proposals in this regard have been sent to the government for approval. Temporary rectification works will be taken up shortly in Marret Street area,” said corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/potholed-city-road-puts-motorists-at-risk/articleshow/85989649.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Akola Municipal Corporation tries escape route on amended Tree Act||Nagpur: Even as the state government has amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975 authorizing state tree authority to grant permission to fell trees above 200, municipal corporation officials have been finding escape routes. In the latest case, the Akola Municipal Corporation (AMC) issued a public notice inviting objections from people before granting permission to fell trees. It also included permission to fell 199 trees for the widening of NH-161 between Akola-Washim-Hingoli-Nanded. To a question how the figure of 199 trees only was arrived, Akola tree officer Pradeep Rajurkar said, “As per amended rules, to fell 200 trees for any project requires the state authority permission hence, we have listed out 199 trees. We have not granted permission. The call will be taken by the tree authority headed by the municipal commissioner.” NHAI project director Rakesh Jawade said, “We have sought permission to fell around 300 trees within the Akola municipal corporation limits.” “If there are 300 trees that need to be felled, why the tree officer invited objection for 199 trees only. You have to read between the lines. This has ostensibly be done to bypass the new amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975. We will file our objections on Tuesday with the tree officer,” said environment activist from Akola Sheikh Mohammed Sheikh Makbul aka Munna. Munna alleged that at least 19 trees more than 50 years of age were felled outside the Akola municipal limits from Prabhat Kids till Chandur Fata. Here too, the amended Act has been violated. The state environment ministry has already ordered an inquiry into the felling of over 153 ‘heritage’ trees recently in Akot Municipal Council limits. “The Act mandates the authorities granting permission to declare 50-year-old trees as heritage trees. If at all these trees are felled the project proponent will have to plant trees equal to the age of the felled ones,” says Munna. When pointed out, Akola municipal commissioner Nima Arora said, “The felled trees are not within municipal limit. No permission has been granted to fell the trees. The proposal will have to be sent to the state tree authority. We will cancel the said notification issued in local daily inviting objections.” Munna alleged to misguide the people, the notice stated that the 199 trees that are proposed to be felled are between Patur and Medshi. “The stretch between Patur and Medshi is not in the jurisdiction of AMC. Then why the notice mentions about it,” he asked. Tree officer Rajurkar said, “Patur-Medshi is the name of the highway, hence we made a mention about it.” Munna says, the NH-161 is between Akola-Washim-Hingoli-Nanded and not what is mentioned in the public notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/akola-municipal-corporation-tries-escape-route-on-amended-tree-act/articleshow/85989670.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Madurai||Sales staff hail govt’s ‘right to sit’ move||Madurai: The announcement by minister for labour and employment C V Ganesan in the assembly that an amendment would be made to give employees of shops, commercial establishments and industries to sit and work, ‘the right to sit’, would bring dignity to more than 90% of the state’s workforce.Managing trustee of Justice Shivaraj Patil Foundation S Selva Gomathi, who has been crusading for the cause for more than a decade, said that this was something that would ensure dignity in the workplaces for all. “I work with garment workers, who usually have family members working in shops. They used to express their concern about the problems being faced by those working in shops, who had to stand continuously for more than eight hours,” she said. The ‘right to sit’ movement in Kerala has been an inspiration.While the Kerala government made the amendment to the Labour Act to give workers the right to sit three years ago, the Tamil Nadu government did not take it up. Many campaigns were organised demanding the same during important days such as March 8. For the current assembly election, the workers had submitted a memorandum, in which one of the demands was the ‘right to sit’. Workers, mostly women, sent just more than 5,000 postcards to chief minister M K Stalin after he assumed charge on May 7, and now this has borne fruit, she said.Karpagam, who works in a fancy store in Anna Nagar, says that there are five women in the shop and they look forward to their recess time to go to the toilet, the only place where they can sit except during lunch breaks. “We are told that we will have to keep standing, and it is harrowing when we have our periods,” she said.Gomathy said that during their campaign, they had also spoken to male workers, who had to stand continuously during work hours. Standing wearing tight clothes affected them physically and mentally and their family relationships suffered. Women developed varicose veins on their legs due to the long hours of standing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sales-staff-hail-govts-right-to-sit-move/articleshow/85989662.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha govt plans up to 27% seats for OBCs in urban, rural body polls||BHUBANESWAR: The reservation of seats for backward classes in the local body polls in the state will range from zero per cent in some districts to a maximum of 27% in others, according to a government plan to amend the relevant laws limiting the overall quota to 50%. The state government on Monday introduced the Odisha Municipal Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021, which proposes to keep the overall reservation in the urban local body elections up to 50% to comply with court directions. It is likely to introduce the Odisha Panchayat Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021 to cap the quota in the three-tier panchayat polls at 50% on Tuesday. According to the bills, the maximum limit of quota for the OBCs will continue to be 27%. This will, however, be subject to the condition that the overall reservation for all categories (SCs, STs, OBCs) put together will not exceed 50% to comply with court directions. A senior government official said the quota for SCs and STs will be decided on the basis of their population percentage, according to the 2011 census, in any ward, panchayat, block and district. In districts such as Puri where the percentage of SCs (19.4%) and STs (0.36%) is remarkably less, the OBC quota can touch the upper limit of 27%. In scheduled areas with predominant tribal population such as Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangapur and Rayagada, the OBC quota will be zero. Introducing the municipal amendment bill, urban and housing development minister Pratap Jena said in view of the judgement passed by the Orissa HC (in the Subash Chandra Biswal versus the state of Odisha) on April 18, 2018, and the SC judgement in the K Krishna Murthy case, there is no scope except for amending the relevant provisions of the Odisha Municipal Act, 1950 and Odisha Municipal Corporation Act, 2003.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-govt-plans-up-to-27-seats-for-obcs-in-urban-rural-body-polls/articleshow/85989045.cms||Ashok Pradhan

---||Madurai||Enforcement of Covid-19 SOPs a challenge in schools||Madurai: Though Covid-19 cases have been reported among students and teachers from many districts ever since the school reopening, Madurai has not reported a single case, district health officials said. However, ensuring adherence to Covid-19 safety norms remains a challenge for schools, parents and officials.The district health officials said that general health check-ups are being carried out in schools, but not a single Covid-19 case has been reported so far. Officials from both health and school education departments are monitoring the adherence to Covid-19 safety norms by schools. “Covid-19 SOPs are in place. However, despite the best efforts of teachers, it is difficult to monitor children continuously and ensure that they maintain social distance and wear masks properly. We keep reminding them but students are also not used to wearing masks for long hours so they tend to move it down or remove it sometimes,” said a math teacher.As Covid-19 cases are low in Madurai district, schools fear there is a complacency among students and even parents. “We keep insisting them wearing masks and sitting apart in schools and have them practice hand hygiene. However, immediately when they leave school, they can be seen hanging out with friends as usual and even eating out. Many also use public transport, which often gets crowded as well,” said the principal of a private matriculation school. Almost all staff in schools in Madurai have taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, family members of many students are yet to take the vaccine.“When we spoke to school teachers, they said all Covid-19 safety measures are followed and asked for our cooperation. However, my daughter tells a different story. I’ve asked her to strictly wear her mask properly but she says most of her classmates don’t follow it properly and remove it especially when speaking in class. During break times also, Covid-19 safety precautions are not as strictly followed,” said R Geetha, parent of a Class XII student. Another parent, M Rajesh, said that rather than lack of awareness, a complacent attitude has developed. “There are many students including my daughter who have lost their family members to Covid-19. They know how scary the disease is. However, nowadays even adults are not properly following the safety measures. This must change,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/enforcement-of-covid-19-sops-a-challenge-in-schools/articleshow/85989701.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Delhi||Covid deaths: 1,241 families in Delhi get Rs 50,000 each||NEW DELHI: Delhi government disbursed a one-time ex gratia of Rs 50,000 each to 1,241 families under the ‘Mukhyamantri Parivar Arthik Sahayta Yojana’ by Monday evening. The scheme is aimed at helping families that lost a member to Covid. The districts have completed verification in 5,911 of 6,230 families that applied. As and when the verification is carried out and cases approved, the ex-gratia amount will be released in those cases too. CM Arvind Kejriwal had launched the scheme on July 6 this year. The verification of the cases picked up speed after chief secretary Vijay Dev recently directed senior officials to monitor the scheme and ensure the verification in all cases applied was done at the earliest. Sanjeev Khirwar, who is both principal revenue secretary and divisional commissioner, is monitoring the implementation of the scheme. Earlier, Delhi high court had directed Delhi government to speed up the disbursal process. The process has been further streamlined and over 5,000 verifications were completed last week alone. By Monday, verification of 5,911 out of 6,230 cases had been completed. A government official said the disbursal in approved cases was likely to be done within two working days. The applicants initially faced problems with uploading and preparing documents like death certificates and surviving kin certificates. Hundreds of survey teams were then created at the district level to help the families apply. The offices concerned have been directed to dispose of every application within three working days. “In some cases, there were a few glitches initially. For example, some applications were in the name of the deceased and a few other families were out of town,” disclosed an official. An online link has been integrated with the existing e-district website of Delhi government and the same portal is also being used for day-to-day monitoring of the scheme. The scheme is still open and eligible families can still apply. Rs 50,000 is given as ex gratia for a family losing a member to Covid, while a Rs 2,500 pension is created for kids orphaned by the loss of parents to the infection. So far, 6,230 applications have been received for ex gratia payment and 3,670 applications for the pension. Around Rs 4.2 crore was disbursed on Sunday in 837 cases. Among the 11 districts, New Delhi district was allocated Rs 14 crore and remaining districts, Rs 12 crore each on July 9 for payment under the scheme. An additional amount of Rs 15.5 crore available under this head is also being allocated among the districts. “A proposal for allocation of additional funds to the tune of Rs 30 crore has already been approved and granted by the finance department for immediate release as the ex gratia component of the scheme,” said a finance department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-deaths-1241-families-get-rs-50k-each/articleshow/85989686.cms||AlokKNMishra

The positivity rate, meanwhile, was recorded at .06%. Delhi is yet to record a single death due to Covid in September so far. The low number of cases can also be attributed to fewer tests (54,611) conducted on Sunday. A total of 14.12 lakh patients have recovered from the disease in the city. The death toll, meanwhile, stands at 25,082. Despite a fall in daily Covid cases over the last few days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has cautioned that chances of a third wave are quite real, while asserting that his government was preparing on a “war-footing” to combat it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/32-fresh-cases-no-covid-deaths-in-sept-so-far/articleshow/85989702.cms||---

More than 41 lakh of the approximate 1.5 crore eligible population in Delhi, or every fourth eligible citizen, is now fully vaccinated. Till 6pm on Monday, 1,42,66,435 vaccine doses had been administered in Delhi, including 1,01,49,595 as first dose and 41,16,840 as second. This means that 67.7% of all eligible Delhiites have received at least one jab, while 27.4% are now fully vaccinated. As with the overall vaccination programme, it is once again the youth leading those getting the second dose. Although the approximately 92 lakh individuals in the 18-44 age bracket were the last to become eligible for inoculation from May 3, they have already received more than 81 lakh, or nearly 57%, of the vaccine doses administered till 6pm on Monday. The age breakup of vaccine doses administered till Sunday, shows 58 lakh people in the 18-44 age group have received at least one jab, with more than 12.5 lakh having got both. In comparison, the individuals aged 45 years or above and who have received at least one dose number nearly 35.3 lakh, including 22.4 lakh who are now fully vaccinated. This is apart from the 2.2 lakh healthcare workers and 3.5 lakh frontline workers who have received both the doses. As the government vaccination sites are closed on Sundays, only 2,291 first dose and 6,062 second ones were administered. In the latter group, 5,036 were in the 18-44 age bracket and 971 were aged 45 and above, apart from 55 healthcare and frontline workers. In a similar way, Saturday saw 16,007 individuals aged 45 years and above receiving the second dose, while those in the 18-44 category far outnumbered them at 47,256. Friday saw 12,977 of the former and 32,710 of the latter being administered the second dose, while the figures for Thursday were, respectively, 14,351 and 30,883. When comparing the total number of doses administered, those aged 60 years and above account for 21,68,684, which is 15.2% of all vaccines administered in Delhi till date. Those in the 45-59 years category have received 39,78,473 doses, which is nearly 27.8% of all doses administered. The youth has been the wheel of the vaccination drive in Delhi, in spite of not only becoming eligible later but the inoculation drive for this age group being halted a few times in May and June due to vaccine shortage and when people eligible for their second vaccine dose were given the priority. Taking the total numbers into account, North-West district has administered the highest number of both the first (12,31,105) and second doses (4,77,474) among the 11 districts of the capital. It is followed by South West (4,69,849) and West (4,66,685) districts when it comes to citizens who are now fully vaccinated. In contrast, North-East district logged the least number of second doses of vaccine being administered at 2,04,977.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/every-fourth-eligible-person-in-delhi-is-now-fully-vaxxed-north-west-district-leads-chart/articleshow/85989719.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The assessor appointed by the Union urban ministry has rejected NMC’s request for reassessment in water+ ranking. In mid-August, the ministry had declared the water plus and ODF++ results. NMC retained the ODF++ certificate for the second consecutive year, but failed to get the prestigious water+ certificate for treating and reusing sewage water. The assessor has submitted six explanations on why NMC failed in water+ assessment. It found solid waste accumulated in the stormwater drains. Also, stormwater drains were found choked at the time of on-ground assessment. Even bar screens (or trash arresters) were not placed at strategic locations. The report further stated that open nullahs and drains were visible and their outflow points were mixed into water bodies. Open discharge and dumping of untreated faecal sludge and blackwater was also found in the city. NMC’s another main contention to seek revaluation of water+ certificate was treating around 320 MLD, which is more than 50% of sewerage water generated by the city, generating revenue through the sale of treated water to a nearby thermal power station. However, the assessor claimed that the documents submitted by NMC were insufficient during desktop assessment of the city. “No appropriate document for 100% operation and maintenance costs of sewer networks, sewerage treatment plants are being recovered through dedicated revenue streams or user charges,” the assessor clarified. It also pointed out that NMC did not submit the documents verified, signed and endorsed by a chartered accountant. With this development, it has become clear that NMC has been disqualified for the seven-star rating and it is only entitled for five-star rating with ODF++ rating. In 2020, NMC with 18th in all India ranking and did not get any star ratings despite having ODF plus certificate due to poor sweeping in many areas, including the prabhag of former mayor Nanda Jichkar.

---||Lucknow||Retired Col reminisces how Sainik School Lucknow cadets conquered 19,688 feet high Mt Deo Tibbaa||LUCKNOW: On September 6, 1969, a group of cadets of Sainik School Lucknow studying in class eight and nine, climbed atop 19,688 feet mountain Deo Tibba peak in Himachal Pradesh. They became the youngest lads to achieve the feat, a record which no one could break for many years. Sainik school Lucknow cadets climbed were the youngest mountaineers to climb above 19,000 feet.The expedition is claimed to be the brainchild of school's principal lieutenant colonel BK Das and mountaineer Major PPS Cheema, who took the proposal to the state government to promote youth power. In fact, this was the first mountaineering expedition sponsored by the UP government led by CB Gupta. The event made the group of juveniles the role models for their peers. Years later, out of the contingent of nine, one became lieutenant general, another major general, a brigadier, three colonels, a deputy inspector of general of police, a captain (army) and another an entrepreneur. "It all began in 1969 with 18 cadets volunteering to be part of expeditions. Of these, 14 were shortlisted and sent to Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) for a 21-day special adventure course. The NIM recommended nine cadets and two others as reserves," said colonel (retired) TBS Pangtey, who was the first in his team to reach Mt Deo Tibba on September 6. “After NIM course, we were put through a strenuous physical regime in Lucknow under our physical training officers (PTO) W A Ahmad and J S Bajwa. After two-hours of morning physical work-out, we were made to run 12 km upto Banthra from school with 18 kg above weight (bricks). Our diet regime too was increased with extra eggs, butter, milk, non veg, paneer and fruits. All demands on the dining table were fulfilled for us. We only had to sweat all of it out under the looming presence of our relentless PTOs,” said colonel (retired) T B S Pangtey, who was the first in his team to reach Mt Deo Tibba on September 6. Settled in Lucknow, Pangety of Kumaon retired in 2009 from 13 Sikh light infantry.  “On August 28, our group left for expedition. On reaching Charbagh railway station we were awestruck at the gathered crowd who came to send off us. Over 100 of our school mates, senior officers of army and dignitaries representing the UP government as well as a large number of the general public were present at platform number one. The bevy was led by our principal. We were at a loss, how to behave, as none of us had ever faced this tumultuous send off in our life. A series of hand shaking and best wishes were bestowed on us. We stood with blank faces, exchanging hesitant smiles among us,” said Pangety, who was in class eight when took the expedition. The group was assisted by expedition leader Major P P S Cheema, lieutenant B S Sandhu the deputy leader of the team, captain K P S Bahadur, the doctor for the expedition, Suresh Juyal the nursing assistant and photographer N P Singh and his assistant Surjit Singh. Later during mountain trekking the group was joined by sherpas. “After reaching the advance base camp at 17,000 feet, we were informed that weather conditions will deteriorate for the next three days, therefore Major Cheema after consulting Captain Bahadur and Lt Sandhu, took a decision that only those will continue to climb Mt. Deo Tibba who are physically and mentally fit. Four of us including A K Jaiswal (entrepreneur), R Chand (retired as Major General) and L K Singh (retired as Army Captain) were selected and we continued our journey. Among the cadets I was the first to reach the peak along with Lt Sandhu, sherpa Norbu and medical assistant Suresh Juyal, later with a gap of 10-20 minutes the remaining three joined me along with other sherpas. We were tired, but the feeling of reaching the peak and hoisting the flag gave a sense of synergy. The journey to peak not only made our bond among the group stronger, but made us leaders for the future,” said Pangety. According to Pangety after the expedition, Captain (navy) Mohan Singh Kohli, the renowned mountaineer and Padma Bhushan who took eight men on the top of Mount Everest in 1965, told the team that they were the youngest mountaineers to climb above 19,000 feet. The other team members included A K Mishra (retired as Lt. General), A K R Tripathi (Brigadier), Sunil Mathur (retired as colonel), A K Shukla (DIG Uttarakhand police) and S K Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/retired-col-reminisces-how-sainik-school-cadets-conquered-mountain/articleshow/85992102.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Barapullah missing links to be plugged||NEW DELHI: The East Delhi district administration has finally issued a declaration for acquiring the two remaining land patches due to which the third phase of the Barapullah project remains stuck. An elevated flyover is being constructed in this phase to provide connectivity between Mayur Vihar Phase I and Sarai Kale Khan. Revenue department officials said the land would be acquired in three phases and the hearings and the award for the land would be issued in the next step. If things go as per plan, the construction work in the remaining two patches can start in the next five or six months. The 3.5km-long corridor will be linked to the existing flyover near Sarai Kale Khan. A senior government official said that the declaration was issued on August 27 and notices to individual owners would be issued. “Normally, the subsequent process can take up to one year, but we are targeting to expedite the award process in the next four months for this crucial infrastructure project.” The land acquisition process begins after the preliminary notification, which is followed by the declaration, both of which have been completed, the official added. “In the next step, we will issue notices and the collector will hold hearings with the stakeholders. By September, all records will be updated,” he said. “The notice process will require a three-week period. In the third month, hearings will be held and the process will be completed by the fourth month.” The process of land acquisition was started by Delhi government in 2015 after Phase III of the Barapullah project was launched. The construction of the elevated road started in April 2015 and should have been completed by October 2017. A Public Works Department official said that even after the handover of the land patches, it would need at least 18 months to complete the missing links. “The elevated road has been connected to Sarai Kale Khan and Mayur Vihar Phase I, but the 790m missing links are present due to the land acquisition issues,” the official added. PWD will need to make four foundation bases in the Yamuna floodplains for which a total of 8.5 acres of land is required, officials clarified. Barapullah Phase III will improve connectivity among east, south and New Delhi and decongest Nizamuddin Bridge, Bhairon Marg and Ashram Chowk on Ring Road. It is likely to cut the travel time between east and south Delhi to about 20 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barapullah-missing-links-to-be-plugged/articleshow/85989747.cms||Paras Singh

---||Delhi||Four more aides of jailed conman held in Rs 200 crore extortion case||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has caught four close aides of conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar after arresting his girlfriend, actor Leena Maria Paul, in a Rs 200-crore extortion case. The accused have been identified as Kamlesh Kothari, Sameul, Arun Muthu and Mohan Raj. The arrests were made on Sunday, a day after the cops arrested Paul. Chandrasekhar was recently arrested from jail along with seven others, including a bank manager, for their alleged involvement in the case. TimesViewTraders and businessmen have suffered serious losses due to Covid-19. Efforts should be made to improve their lot, facilitate the revival of their businesses. The opposite seems to be happening. The authorities concerned must look into the matter and ensure that they don’t suffer.According to senior police officers, Kothari had allegedly helped Chandrasekhar and Paul buy a bungalow in Chennai using their illegal hawala money. Sameul is the actor’s manager while Muthu used to help the couple acquire luxury cars. Raj was a long-time advocate of Chandrasekhar. On Monday, Paul, Raj and Muthu were sent to 15 days’ police custody while Kothari and another accused, Jeonel Daniel, to seven days’ custody. Sameul has been remanded in judicial custody. According to police sources, Raj has been Chandrasekhar’s lawyer since 2014. He had allegedly received money from Chandrasekhar, which he then used to transfer to the actor. Paul was called for questioning to Delhi by Enforcement Directorate and EOW two weeks ago. Police said the accused needed to be taken to several places. The accused allegedly ran several shell companies indirectly and a huge nexus of hawala money. Police are looking for two more suspects, who were allegedly engaged to collect the hawala money. The illegal hawala money had been used by the couple to procure properties in Tamil Nadu, Mumbai, Kerala and Karnataka. To find out about all such purchases, police have to take them to all these locations. Kothari was reportedly tasked to utilise the money in buying luxurious properties. Police officials also need to scan undisclosed bank accounts of the actor. According to the police, Paul had called Muthu on WhatsApp on August 11. The officers suspect that some money were also exchanged on that day. The actor is fond of luxury cars and the couple were arrested in 2015 on charges of cheating and forgery. At least 15 luxury cars were then seized from their farm house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-more-aides-of-jailed-conman-held-in-rs-200cr-extortion-case/articleshow/85989775.cms||---

---||Nagpur||CP had shut down red-light area in Buldhana as ASP||Nagpur: Prior to the red-light area of Ganga Jamuna, city police chief Amitesh Kumar, an IPS officer of 1995 batch, had taken similar measures at Chikhli in Buldhana as Assistant SP in 1999. The latest decision of Kumar to stop sex rackets at brothels at Ganga Jamuna had stemmed primarily from the complaints of local residents and also due to the input about a sudden spurt in the footfalls at the red-light area after the second wave of Covid. Kumar’s controversial decision to stop prostitution at Ganga Jamuna’s brothels has now stirred a hornet’s nest drawing sharp criticism from a section of civil society. On the other hand, he had earned accolades from the population affected by the red-light area from the adjoining areas and many political leaders too. While Kumar was lauded for his bold initiative to apply the special enactment of Immoral trafficking (Prevention) Act in an innovative manner, the unresolved issue of the livelihood of the sex workers and their dependents have raised disturbing questions about his abrupt actions which had kicked-started from August 11 without prior intimation. Kumar said from Monday onwards he would be conducting announcements from the public address systems at Ganga Jamuna offering help to any sex workers who may need any kind of assistance, including offers of rehabilitation. “The decision to close down the sex rackets at brothels at Ganga Jamuna had come from the local residents during the peace committee and Moholla committee meetings,” he said, stating none can be identified as an individual complainant to jeopardize their safety. “Even NGOs met me requesting police protection after sharing inputs regarding minors to rescue them,” he said. Kumar, recalling his action as a young IPS officer at Chikhli where he had stopped red-light area, said he can still remember the name of one Taj who was the kingpin of that area whom he had reigned in. “I have worked in three commissionerates and four times as district SP but never came across a red-light area as big as Ganga Jamuna as the unit in-charge,” said the top cop. According to a female sex worker, many of the protesting local residents were their clients for several years before discontinuing their visits. “We also have families to feed, including our senior citizen members. Our children go to schools and their future is now jeopardized,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-had-shut-down-red-light-area-in-buldhana-as-asp/articleshow/85989828.cms||Soumitra Bose

Additional sessions judge Praveen Singh sent Paul and two others to 15-day police custody. Two of the five arrested were sent to police custody for seven days, said additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, appearing for the cops.The court allowed the accused persons to attend legal interviews every day for 15 minutes with their lawyers and their respective lawyers would be informed every time they were taken out of the capital. During the hearing, Shrivastava had sought their custody for 28 days, saying the accused persons had to be taken to Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu for further investigation. He had contended that the probe agency had to investigate alleged hawala transactions and shell companies in the said case. To this, the court said that if 28 days police custody was granted in one go, then the court would be “shirking from its duties”. “One of the accused is a pick-up boy. What will you do with his custody?” the court questioned.

The complainant’s counsel Arjun Sheoran stated that the state government informed the HC that the mobile phone of the accused (Yuvraj) has been received. Now the court has asked the investigating officer (IO) of the case to file an affidavit to confirm if it is the same phone in which the alleged video was prepared, he said. The HC has now adjourned the hearing of the case for next week. Till then the interim relief granted to Yuvraj against any coercive action in this case. Yuvraj was booked by Hansi police on February 14 under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, on the complaint of a local resident for using word “bhangi” in a video. According to the complainant, “bhangi” refers to a caste listed in the Scheduled Castes notified by the government of Haryana and the phrase used — ye bhangi log ko koi kaam nahi hain” — would be encompassing the whole community. It cannot be said that there is no violation of the aforesaid provision of the Act of 1989, he stated. Yuvraj’s counsel has been arguing that the term (bhangi) was not intended to hurt the sentiments of any community or any person, but was a friendly comment made to his friends and colleagues who are not part of the “respected Dalit community”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/offensive-remark-yuvrajs-mobile-phone-received-hc-told/articleshow/85989815.cms||---

On Monday, senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, withdrew the earlier plea to file a fresh application. Objecting to the allegation, special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for Delhi Police, said, “An interim application that has been filed has strong allegations to say that the objections taken by the prosecution is dilatory tactics. All objections are legal objections, which go to the root of the matter.” He added that “to paint the prosecution by saying it is dilatory tactics is not fair”.To this, Pais said he had anticipated the objections and submitted that he might be allowed to withdraw Khalid’s regular bail application with liberty to file a fresh one under appropriate sections. The case will be heard again on Wednesday.When Pais asked judge Amitabh Rawat to let him continue with the arguments so that a day’s time was not wasted, the judge said that if the previous bail application was withdrawn, then as per procedure the prosecution had to file a fresh reply stating that it did not want technical issues to come later on in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/khalid-to-file-fresh-bail-plea-in-uapa-case-claims-prosecution-using-dilatory-tactic/articleshow/85989840.cms||Usha Das

So far, relief amount of Rs 109.89 crore has been distributed to 1.27 lakh flood affected citizens in the state. Urban development and housing minister Bhupendra Singh was present in the programme. Revenue minister Govind Singh Rajput virtually attended the programme. Chouhan further said that the last two months have been difficult in the state. While on the one side there were floods, about one and a half dozen districts have also been affected by scanty rainfall. Coronavirus crisis also existed. It was a testing time for us citizens and the government. The government tried to get people out of trouble under every circumstance. He said that funds have been provided to the flood affected people for various types of damage under a special scheme. Relief funds have been provided to people promptly and with transparency so that the damage caused to them does not derail their life. With the beneficiary list having been pasted and publicly displayed in the Panchayat Bhawan, irregularity of any kind was ruled out. Chouhan said that before granting the amount, the option of claim/objection was also given regarding the beneficiaries. Action is being taken under a separate Revenue Book Circular for loss of agricultural crops. It is also necessary to carry out reconstruction works in time after the damage caused to power substations and roads by floods. For this, the work should be completed in consultation with all the collectors, public representatives and members of the Crisis Management Group. Repair of canals should also be done on war footing. Chouhan said that the vaccination work to protect against Corona has reduced in the flood-affected districts to some extent. Now it is necessary to expedite this work. A megae vaccination campaign will be conducted on September 17 on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The chief minister also interacted with some beneficiaries after distributing funds at the function. All the beneficiaries, whom the chief minister talked to, told him that they have received immediate assistance of Rs 5,000, Rs 6, 000 for damage to utensils and clothes and the first installment for house construction. Apart from this, 50 kg of grain or flour has also been made available immediately during floods. Chohgan urged the beneficiaries to ensure quality in construction of houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/flood-relief-to-affected-people-on-priority-chouhan/articleshow/85987374.cms||---

Total 1,04,738 doses were administered in a single day, the highest so far in the state capital since the rollout of the campaign in January this year. Lucknow also topped among all the 75 districts in Monday’s drive. Though there were complaints of chaos, overcrowding and mismanagement from several booths, the drive was by and large smooth with no complaint of any adverse effect till the evening. TIMES VIEWSuch mega drives have galvanised the mass immunisation programme in Lucknow. Average daily vaccinations have also gone up in comparison to initial months. Authorities should involve more NGOs and resident welfare associations, education institutions and religious/spiritual institutions so that the vaccination campaign can reach the remotest of places in the city and villages including slums.Earlier, 93,436 persons were jabbed in a day in the district on August 27. Monday’s feat took the number of doses administered in Lucknow till date to over 29.5 lakh, which is the highest in the state. “The state government had set the target of administering 86,700 doses in Lucknow on Monday, but we managed to inoculate more than a lakh people,” said district magistrate Abhishek Prakash. Among those vaccinated with the first or second dose on Monday, 53% were in the 18-44 age group, 31% in the 45-59 years category and 16% elderly aged 60 years or above. Now, 8.1 lakh people in the 36 lakh adult population of the state capital are fully vaccinated with the two-dose course, while 13.3 lakh beneficiaries have taken a shot and are waiting for the second. “The record was achieved with the help of 103 special camps set up in schools, colleges, religious and work places and residential localities,” said district immunization officer Dr MK Singh. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma inaugurated the special vaccination camp at La Martiniere College and law minister Brajesh Pathak at City Montessori School, Rajajipuram branch. A TOI reality check at several centres found basic amenities including rooms and staff for post-vaccination observation were missing at many centres. People had to stand in queues for 4-5 hours. However, functioning was smooth at most of the centres set up at schools, higher education institutes, religious places and residential areas. People praised the organisers for the preparations. (With inputs from Pragati Shukla, Shubhangi Dwivedi and Kritika Mathur) Last minute cancellation of centreMany persons went back disappointed as the vaccination centre at Munnu Lal Dharamshala in Chowk was cancelled due to a death in the organiser’s family. “The tragedy occurred late on Sunday night, hence we could not inform people. The vaccines reserved for the camp were diverted to other centres,” said DIO Dr MK Singh. Only 1 new Covid caseFour Covid-19 patients recovered in the past 24 hours, while only one new case was reported. The active cases dropped to 24 in city. Meanwhile, the health department’s drive found larvae of the Aedes aegypti mosquito that causes dengue in desert coolers of seven houses in Faizullaganj. “Anti-larva spray has been done in the locality”, said officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/top-shot-city-surpasses-1l-target-in-single-day-vax-drive/articleshow/85992172.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Court frames charges in vandalism case||NEW DELHI: A city court on Monday framed charges in a shop vandalism case saying the statement of the prosecution witness could not be brushed aside merely because there had been delay in recording as he had not only categorically given the account of the incident, but named/identified the accused people to be allegedly part of the riotous mob. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav framed charges against Ashraf Ali and Parvej under requisite sections, saying, prima facie, there was enough material on record to frame charges against them in the case. “Though, there is no CCTV footage/video clip of the incident available on record, however, at this stage, we have the statement dated April 21, 2020, of prosecution witness Ajeet Kumar Tomar, vide which he has not only given categorical account of the incident, but also named/identified the accused to be part/member of the riotous mob taking active participation in the rioting activity. At this stage, his statement cannot be brushed aside/discarded merely because there has been some delay in recording, thereof, or the complainant has not specifically named them,” the court observed. It noted that it found substance in the submissions of the special public prosecutor that the rioters had broken down almost every CCTV camera in the vicinity and damaged the DVRs thereof on February 24 and February 25, 2020, and as such, it was quite possible that on this account no CCTV footage was available in the matter. The accused, meanwhile, had claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter. According to police, the incident pertained to setting ablaze Mohd Rashid’s shop on February 24 in Shiv Vihar allegedly by the riotous mob due to which his documents pertaining to MCD were also ruined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-riots-court-frames-charges-in-vandalism-case/articleshow/85989866.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Dengue cases on rise: Fogging claims are just hot air in city?||Ludhiana: As the number of dengue cases is witnessing an increase in the district, many opposition parties and residents have raised questions over fogging. While municipal corporation officials say fogging is being done as per schedule, residents and political parties beg to differ. “I live in Ludhiana (west) constituency and haven’t seen fogging in Sarabha Nagar, Haibowal, and Sunet. If they had done it, residents should have seen it. I lost my mother to dengue. Fogging is being done only on papers,” said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Ahbab Grewal. He alleged that MC, controlled by the ruling party leaders, was a den of corruption and it was playing with people’s lives. BJP’s district president Pushpinder Singal said, “Fogging is not being done anywhere and the government is stuck in Sidhu and Captain tussle. Ministers are busy amassing money and bureaucrats are not listening to them. In the name of fogging, they get slips for 60 litres of diesel. We have told the mayor about it.”Shiromani Akali Dal district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “I have only seen pictures of fogging at a couple of places on social media. Earlier, it was done regularly. When I was a councillor, we would do it every week. But under the present government, work is done only on papers. Lack of preventive measures can lead to disease outbreak at a larger scale.”However, Ashwani Sharma, Congress’s district president (urban), said it was the responsibility of the councillors to ensure fogging. “A councillor and residents have to sign papers for fogging. Machines have been given to them for the purpose and they get fuel for it daily. Fogging is being done daily in all areas,” he claimed. Many residents also echoed the opposition’s views. “They haven’t done fogging in our area even once. Since dengue cases are witnessing a rise, we are scared. They should have also cleared the bushes as mosquitoes breed in water collected in spaces between them,” said Bikramdeep Singh of Barewal Road.Despite repeated attempts, mayor Balkar Singh couldn’t be contacted for comments. Health officer of the MC Dr Vipul Malhotra, however, maintained that fogging was being done as per schedule. “We have 12 big machines and 95 small ones which are with councillors and used for fogging in their areas,” said Dr Malhotra.‘No fogging in my ward’The leader of opposition in the MC, SAD councillor from ward 46 Harbhajan Singh Dang, said insufficient fogging was being done and people were falling ill. He added that in his ward, it was not done and he had raised the issue with the authorities. “Now we have decided to meet the mayor at Zone D office on Tuesday and give him a memorandum. We will tell him that if fogging is not done within 10 days, we will have to take some other action. It is the job of the MC to do it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dengue-cases-on-rise-fogging-claims-are-just-hot-air-in-city/articleshow/85987401.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Lucknow||Bibliophiles get a new hotspot at Metro station||LUCKNOW: Looking for an option where you can catch hold of literary stuff on history, governance/policy, science, fiction or on many other topics and languages, than the newly opened Uttar Pradesh Book Promotion Centre (BPC) at Vishwavidyalaya Metro station is the place to be. With a collection of over 2,000 books, the BPC, by National Book Trust, India, is set to be a new hub for book lovers in the city. It was inaugurated by the basic education minister Satish Chandra Dwivedi on Monday. Excited with the opening of the book store, young readers from various colleges and students of Lucknow University and Isabella Thoburn College shared that for them the place is a ‘bonus library’ apart from the libraries at their institutes. “The best section was of new arrivals, something that we don’t easily get at our institutes. Just look at the collection they have from the book Magical Mandu, the story of a beautiful fort and what happened with its walls by Swapna Dutta, to books by Prem Pal Sharma and Mahesh Dube. Almost every new creative work is on the shelf,” said BA student Pankhuri Srivastava. LU student Priyanshi said, “It’s difficult to find books in regional languages but I was happy to see that not only books in Bhojpuri which is my language but also books in other languages are available here. “I will come with my kids to get some books from the children’s sections. I had a look at a few books in the children’s section which were unique. Concepts like ‘what is blood or planets’ were told in an interesting story form that will not only make children’s science concepts clear but will also reduce the rote learning culture,” said a woman. “BPC will offer book lovers a Readers’ Corner, Authors’ Corners, Young Writers Mentorship Scheme, Panchayat Libraries, Mobile Exhibition Vans and much more in the coming days. It will house books in more than 55 Indian languages and dialects, on science, social science, art and culture, education, competitive exams, biographies,” said deputy director, National Book Trust, Amit Singh.  As part of the inaugural offer, book lovers will be given a special 25% discount on all NBT books from September 6 to 10. During Hindi Pakhwada (September 1-30), 20% discount on books in Hindi and other Indian languages will be provided. Happy with the opening of the BPC, the education minister said, “I am happy that now the city has BPC where our young readers, especially university students can read books and purchase one at a low price. The hub will turn out to be a centre of reading and research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bibliophiles-get-a-new-hotspot-at-metro-station/articleshow/85992214.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Bhopal||Eye on Madhya Pradesh bypolls, Kamal Nath lures tribals ahead of Amit Shah visit||BHOPAL: Ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah’s proposed launching of the Janjaati Abhiyan later this month, former chief minister and LOP Kamal Nath on Monday addressed a large gathering of tribals in Barwani. Congress called it the Adivasi Adhikar Jan Aakrosh rally to protest the increasing atrocities against the tribal community in the state. “You don’t need to be afraid. Congress party is fighting for the benefit of tribal communities and we are standing strong on every count,” Nath said addressing the public meeting. The former Union minister said, “Indira ji took me to Chhindwara and said, go and serve the tribal community. I am following that instruction till now serving the tribal people.” In the 2018 assembly elections, Congress secured 31 out of total 47 tribal reserved seats in the state. One tribal seat, Jobat in Alirajpur, is also going for bypoll. Speaking at the rally, former chief minister Kamal Nath said that situation in the state is peculiar. “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had promised he would give one lakh jobs per year and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would generate two crore jobs per year. I want to ask, where are those jobs?” Kamal Nath said. He alleged that both Modi and Chouhan are good at acting. The senior Congress leader said that CM Chouhan should go to Mumbai and start acting like actor Salman Khan. Veteran leader Kamal Nath alleged that the district administration stopped thousands of persons from coming and joining the public meeting. “This is an attack on the self-respect of tribal society and violation of democratic rights,” Kamal Nath alleged. Nath said that when Congress returns to power after the 2023 assembly elections, then people of the state will take an account of these officials. Nath reminded that as MP, he represented the tribal dominated Chhindwara constituency. He claimed that during the Covid crisis, it was only Chhindwara district where there was no shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir injections. “Shivraj Singh Chouhan government should have accepted the Chhindwara model and make preparations to combat Covid,” Kamal Nath said. He accused the state government of having completely failed at managing the Covid crisis and claimed that at least 2.5 lakh people lost their lives to the virus infection in the state. Attacking the BJP government he said, “Shivraj government has been formed by deceit. We could also have saved our government with bargaining but could not have run it that way. We stand with truth and follow principles.” He said that in 2023 assembly elections, people will again vote the Congress with huge majority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/eye-on-bypolls-nath-lures-tribals-ahead-of-shah-visit/articleshow/85987458.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Safe’ subject search leads to surge in demand for Eng, physics, BCom||Kolkata: English seems to be the subject in demand at Presidency University and Lady Brabourne College with an increase in applications by 1,900 and 870 than that last time at the two institutes, while at Jadavpur University, physics is the most sought after, with 1,070 more applications being submitted than last year. Maulana Azad College is witnessing a stiff competition in zoology and microbiology, the two departments having received 1,095 and 874 more forms than last session, while applications for BCom Honours at Goenka College for Commerce and Business Administration has increased by 2,203. At Asutosh College, journalism and mass communication has turned out to be the most in-demand, with a rise in applications by 1,050. A comparison of applications with last year’s figures by some colleges and universities hinted at the sought-after subjects this time and the race for them. Amid the deluge of applications, some subjects saw a dip in demand this time. For example, the number of forms submitted to Presidency for philosophy has gone down by 60 compared to last time and in mathematics by 30. “The number of overall applications has gone up from 37,935 in 2020 to 52,379 this time, which is a jump of around 33%. A few hundreds to over a thousand more forms have been submitted in almost all subjects this year,” said a college official. Principals and vice-chancellors pointed out that applications to undergraduate courses were the highest this year, logging more forms than that last several years. At Presidency University, the total applications have increased from 52,725 in 2020 to 58,002 in 2021. Jadavpur University has received 60,154 applications in arts and science faculties, with the maximum rise in science subjects. At Seth Anandaram Jaipuria College, applications for BCom Honours has increased by almost 900. “In English, political science and economics, 1,900, 998 and 700 more forms have been submitted. Last year, the number of applications in sociology was 1,656, while this year, it was 1,901 and in chemistry, the rise has been from 6,533 to 6,833,” said a head of the department, a member of the admission committee at Presidency. Many colleges reported stiff competition to get a seat in botany, zoology, microbiology, bio-chemistry and industrial chemistry. “We have received a large number of applications, in subjects like zoology, microbiology and industrial chemistry,” said an official at Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira. At Asutosh College, applications in journalism and mass communication has increased by 1,050, in English by 570 and microbiology by 512. Close to 8,75,000 students have cleared their Class XII exams from state board, CISCE and CBSE. But with exams being cancelled this year due to the pandemic, the different boards and councils used their own formulae to calculate the candidates’ final scores, based on which most institutes are admitting students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/safe-subject-search-leads-to-surge-in-demand-for-eng-physics-bcom/articleshow/85990053.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The report does not mention any trace of liquor but found dangerous levels of faecal matter and E coli in the water,” a senior police officer said. The officer said they did not register any complaint as the issue is now with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. On why a complaint was not lodged for negligence causing harm to human lives, he said, “The mistake was not intentional as civic body personnel were repairing the sewer during which sewer water entered the water pipeline.” On Thursday, residents of about 40 houses in Sarkhej, in the municipal South West Zone, complained that for the past month, their tap water was smelling of country liquor. As proof, one of the residents collected a can full of turbid water from the morning municipal water supply and submitted it to visiting water supply officials. The locals alleged that some of the dwellings nearby were known to brew country liquor and empty their waste into drains which would contaminate their water supply. After this, Sarkhej police swung into action, took samples of the water but did not find any liquor in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/not-liquor-sewage-sullied-tap-water-in-sarkhej-report/articleshow/85989937.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Study finds Sakkardara Lake in bad shape||Nagpur: Water monitoring of city lakes undertaken before immersion of Ganpathi idols has found Sakkardara Lake in “extremely poor shape”. According to the study conducted by Green Vigil Foundation along with EarthEcho International, the water level of the lake is quite low and most of its area is covered by water hyacinth. “This has caused a dip in dissolved oxygen levels dropping to 3.0 mg/l. Turbidity was reported as 55 JTU and pH as 7.8. It is very important to clean Sakkardara Lake immediately to save it,” said Mehul Kosurkar, deputy team leader of the foundation. The EarthEcho water monitoring programme is being conducted since 9 years. Water of Telangkhedi, Sonegaon and Gandhisagar lakes too are tested. Done thrice every year, in February, pre and post immersion, it analyses the impact of the Ganesh festival on the lakes. As per a release, EarthEcho International publishes a book which includes data of water quality of various waterways of different countries across the globe. Green Vigil’s data has been published for the last 9 years. Sheetal Choudhary of Green Vigil said as there was no immersion last year, “the water quality of Futala, Gandhisagar and Sonegaon Lake was found to be in better condition compared to the previous years”. Kosurkar added that a lot of Krishna idols with ‘nirmalya were immersed in all the lakes. “There is focus only on Ganpati visarjan, but we need to protect our lakes during other festivals like janmashtami, teej and devi visarjan too,” he said. Along with beautifying lakes, conserving the lake ecosystem is of utmost importance, said Surbhi Jaiswal, Green Vigil, team leader. “The only oxygen supply to our lakes is by atmospheric diffusion only. To maintain dissolved oxygen level in our lakes, we need to install artificial oxygen supply like fountains,” she said. Green Vigil has urged citizens to install clay idols only and immerse them at home or in nearby artificial tanks erected by NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/study-finds-sakkardara-lake-in-bad-shape/articleshow/85989929.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Feeding strays: Societies across Ahmedabad aim for balance||AHMEDABAD: To feed or not to feed a stray dog? Residential societies across Ahmedabad have been battling this dilemma for a while now, leading to squabbles, fights and more recently, scuffles too. The recent case in point is the scuffle between two women at a Vejalpur-based society reported last week. The issue, however, has been a topic of discussion, heated exchanges and even spats not just on society WhatsApp groups, but in reality too between dog-feeders and others bothered by stray dogs. While some societies have imposed a ban, some have not, some have gone to the extent of forming special committees to address dog-related issues and even defined regular feeding zones. Devyani Ahluwalia, canine nutritionist and a resident of a society near Vaishnodevi Circle, said, “I love dogs and have been feeding strays for five years now. But not everyone likes them and many are often scared, which has led to multiple disputes in the past. In our society, an informal committee was formed to address dog-related disputes between residents. We now feed most of the dogs outside the gates, but some who were born in the society are cared for inside.” Residents including regular dog feeders have alleged that spaying of dogs by relevant civic authorities has suffered and been neglected due to the pandemic due to which the population of dogs is on the rise. Some societies on the other hand have defined dedicated areas, either within or outside the society, where stray dogs are fed. “We have a dedicated place in an open ground outside our society where we feed all the strays. Typically, a time of the day like early morning or mid-afternoon or even late evening is chosen to feed the dogs so that there is lesser movement of people and dogs would not run towards humans,” said Kumar Abhishek, a power-sector professional, who has been feeding stray dogs in Ahmedabad for about three years. Abhishek opined that societies must also make an effort to pool money and vaccinate the strays regularly and ensure they’re spayed properly so that their population can be kept under check. In certain other areas, however, societies have simply termed the stray dogs as nuisance and made it mandatory for residents to feed them outside. Sandra D’Souza, a Vastrapur resident said, “Our society committee has made it very clear that residents who want to feed stray dogs may do so outside the main gate and not within the society, and some of us who want to do so take the necessary precaution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/feeding-strays-societies-aim-for-balance/articleshow/85992350.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||AIPEF opposes proposal to shift 33KV transmission system to Transco||Patiala: The All India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF) has opposed the proposal of the Union ministry of power to handover 33KV transmission system assets to Transco and the formation of a joint venture company with Power Grid to improve finances. V K Gupta, spokesperson of AIPEF, said the federation on Monday had written a letter to Union power minister R K Singh, giving its detailed comments on the direction of ministry to the states. The letter mentions that by bringing the 33KV system under transmission and forming a joint venture company with Power Grid is the encroachment of the central government on a state subject. He said the Union power ministry had written to the chief secretary and the principal secretary (power) of Punjab, and other states on September 1, saying that the 33KV transmission system might soon be merged with the transmission network in a phased manner to improve its working. The letter says in case the state government is not in a position to provide financial assistance to the transmission company, it should form a joint venture with Power Grid for mobilising financial resources, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aipef-opposes-proposal-to-shift-33kv-transmission-system-to-transco/articleshow/85989899.cms||---

Police had to resort to baton charge in order to disperse them. One student suffered injuries on his head. The police are conducting a probe. The DAV student president Nikhil Sharma alleged that some members of the ABVP are deliberately targeting his supporters for the past three days. The college administration, however, said that they haven’t received any formal complaint yet. According to police, the members of the two groups - ABVP and a rebel faction - were engaged in a face-off during the weekend. A heavy police force was deployed near the college campus on Monday. Incidentally, the rebel faction was earlier a part of the ABVP and a majority of its members had been associated with the student organisation in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dav-college-students-clash-1-hurt/articleshow/85987469.cms||Mohammad Anab

The special investigation team (SIT) has tracked down six mosques that are located right on the India-Pakistan border in Kutch district. “Lakhs of rupees from the donations and even hawala funds were diverted to these six mosques that also run madrasas. The villages in which these mosques are built are very close to the Pakistan border. We questioned the administrators of these mosques and they admitted having received funds from Salahuddin Sheikh who is one of the key accused in the conversion rackets,” a senior police official said. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh confirmed that their team is investigating the role of these mosques in Kutch in connection with the hawala as well as religious conversion racket. “We are investigating the matter,” he said. “We have statements of those who received the funds on the behalf of these mosques. Sheikh used to send funds to them through Afmi Trust. We are investigating as to why he sent lakhs of rupees to the mosques located on the Indo-Pak border in Gujarat as well as Rajasthan. We have learnt that the money sent to these mosques for some social cause was reportedly re-routed to Sheikh and then dispatched to different states,” a police official told TOI. The mosques in Bhuj that are under the scanner include Mohammadi Masjid in Mota Dinara village, Masjide Salim Akli, Masjide Bilal and Masjide Amin in Khavda village, Masjide Aisha in Jakaaria Vaas and Masjide Aksha in Nakhatrana village. “We are investigating the activities of these mosques, their visitors and how they use the funds. It is possible that they may be either receiving or sending money illegally across the border too. Mosques located so close to Pakistan border getting huge funding by donation and hawala money itself indicates something fishy,” an official said. Sheikh is suspected to have sent Rs 5-10 lakh every month to these mosques in Bhuj while Rs 35 lakh were given to two mosques in Vadodara. A UK-based businessman sent Rs 60 crore by hawala to Sheikh via Dubai. He had also sent Rs 19 crore in form of donation. Some of the money was sent to Gujarat and the rest was routed to the other states by Sheikh’s bank accounts. Custody of UK bizman sought The cops are now in the process of issuing a red-corner notice for the UK-based businessman who sent Rs 80 crore to Salahuddin Sheikh in the last five years. “Once we get the custody of Sheikh and gather strong evidence, we will issue the notice to get custody of the UK-based businessman,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/six-mosques-on-indo-pak-border-in-kutch-under-scanner-police/articleshow/85989994.cms||Tushar Tere

The 50-year-old wife of Manoj Mishra, a railway employee, died of Covid in May this year. Mishra lodged several complaints alleging negligence and fleecing by the staff of a non-Covid hospital in Uthretiya on the city’s outskirts where his wife was admitted. When no action was initiated on his complaints, Mishra approached the chief minister and UP assembly Speaker. Following this, the chief development officer Lucknow, who is also the incharge of the Integrated Covid Command Centre on Monday wrote to the chief medical officer again to initiated a probe into the case and submit the report within three days. In July, CDO had asked the CMO office to initiate a probe but no action was taken. Mishra claims the hospital had charged him over Rs 8 lakh for a period of 10 days, including Rs 4.40 lakh as hospital charges and Rs 4.32 lakh for medicines. This, he claimed, did not include the cost of Remdesivir injections which were not available with the hospital and had to be bought at exorbitant rates outside.  Widower of another Covid patient also told TOI a similar story of neglect and fleecing at the hands of the hospital. “Everyday the hospital asked me to submit Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000. My wife, who was otherwise healthy, continued to suffer medically. I shifted her to another facility but she died,” he said on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-death-hosp-faces-inquiry-for-negligence/articleshow/85992252.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||World||No country will interfere in Afghanistan affairs: Taliban||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban on Monday asserted that it will not allow any country, including Pakistan, to interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs as it confirmed that ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed met the insurgent group's de-facto leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Kabul, amidst efforts to finalise a government in the war-torn country. The questions of interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs were raised after the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Hameed dashed to Kabul on an unannounced visit last week. Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said that the group will not allow any country, including Pakistan, to interfere in Afghanistan's affairs, Afghanistan's Khaama news reported. Lt Gen Hameed was the first high-ranking foreign official to visit Afghanistan since the Taliban seized the Afghan capital in mid-August. During a press conference in Kabul on Monday, Mujahid confirmed that the ISI chief had met with Mullah Baradar during his visit to Kabul, BBC Urdu reported. The Taliban has assured Islamabad that Afghan territory will not be used against Pakistan, he said. Earlier, Pakistani media reported that a delegation of senior officials led by Lt Gen Hameed was in Kabul at the invitation of the Taliban, but the insurgent group said that Islamabad had proposed his visit. On Sunday, the Taliban said that the Pakistani spy chief was in Afghanistan to improve bilateral relations between Kabul and Islamabad. Ahmadullah Wasiq, deputy head of the Taliban's Cultural Commission, said that the Taliban leaders talked with Lt Gen Hameed about bilateral relations and the problems of Afghan passengers at the Torkham and Spin Boldak passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan. "This Pakistani official has come to solve Afghan passengers' problems at the border areas, especially in Torkham and Spin Boldak. They wanted (his visit to Kabul) and we accepted,” Wasiq was quoted as saying by TOLO news. Pakistan on Thursday temporarily closed the Chaman border crossing - the second-largest commercial border point with Afghanistan after the Torkham commercial town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – due to security threats. At his press conference, Mujahid noted that the recent delegation to Kabul said the crossings had been closed due to security concerns linked to release of prisoners inside Afghanistan, and requested checks for those seeking to enter or leave the country. Citing sources close to Hizb-e-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the channel said that Pakistan's intelligence chief also met him and discussed the current situation in the country. In a short video clip circulated in the media last week, Lt Gen Hameed was seen trying to respond to questions by a journalist who first asked: “Will you be meeting senior people in the Taliban?" "No, I'm not clear…" the ISI chief said and looked towards Pakistan ambassador to Kabul Mansour Ahmad Khan, who was standing by his side, to respond to the question. In response to another question, Hameed smiled and said: "Don't worry, everything will be okay." Hameed's visit to Afghanistan came amidst mounting pressure on the Taliban to form an inclusive government acceptable to the international community. The insurgent group is struggling to give shape to a broad-based and inclusive administration acceptable to the international community. It was the first high-level visit of any Pakistani official to Afghanistan since the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, in a move that surprised both their foes and friends. Since then, the Taliban have been trying to form a government but so far have held back the announcement. Pakistan was often accused by the Afghanistan government of giving the Taliban military aid, a charge denied by Islamabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/no-country-will-interfere-in-afghanistan-affairs-taliban/articleshow/85995001.cms||---

The promising gynaecologist and a corona warrior, whose lungs were badly damaged after contracting Covid-19 in the line of duty during the second wave in April, is survived by her husband and a five-month old baby girl whom she gave birth through an emergency caesarean surgery while on ventilator support. “We have been informed by the doctors at KIMS Hospital that Dr Sharda Suman passed away on September 5 night,” said Prof PK Das, head, anaesthesia department, RMLIMS. Dr Sharda was treated under Prof Das when she was hospitalised at the institute here. Dr Sharda was airlifted to KIMS hospital on July 11 and had been waiting for a lung transplant since then. Though all the tests required for the transplant were done successfully, the lifesaving surgery could not be performed as she developed a complication, Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), in her trachea and foodpipe. TOI tried to reach Dr Sharda’s husband, Dr Ajay Kumar, who was looking after her at KIMS Hospital, on Monday, but could not get any response. However, when TOI called him earlier on Saturday to get an update on her health, he had informed her lung transplant had been delayed because of TEF in which abnormal track was formed between food pipe and trachea. “This poses the threat of any liquid or food taken through the mouth going directly to the lungs. Stomach reflexes can also enter the lungs. Under such a condition, a lung transplant cannot be done. Though the condition had started developing when she was under treatment in RMLIMS, it aggravated with time after arrival in Hyderabad. Specialists here hope that medication would resolve it soon,” he had told TOI over telephone. Their five-month old daughter was with her paternal grandmother in Sant Kabir Nagar district. Dr Sharda had contracted Covid-19 on April 14. She was also eight months pregnant then. She was put on a ventilator at the institute itself. In July first week, when doctors said that only lung transplant could save her life, her husband Dr Ajay Kumar and senior RMLIMS officials met UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to seek financial help. The CM had immediately directed officers to sanction Rs 1.5 crore for the transplant. Subsequently, she was taken to KIMS, Hyderabad. All this while she was constantly on ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) support. Health experts told TOI that tracheoesophageal fistula develops in some patients who remain intubated for a long time. During intubation for ventilation, a tube is inserted in the trachea to maintain oxygen supply, while another goes through the food pipe to the stomach for feeding. Both the tubes have balloons at their tips which are inflated through pressurization so that body secretions do not harm lungs and stomach. At times, use of tube for a long period causes swelling in the trachea, which then gets stuck in the food pipe leading to formation of a fistula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rml-doc-loses-battle-for-life-as-rare-condition-delays-transplant/articleshow/85992294.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The girl’s liver was transplanted to two patients, whereas her pancreas and kidneys were transplanted on Sunday and Monday. In her death, she gave a new lease of life to four, said State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO) officials. Dr Pranjal Modi, the convenor of SOTTO and vice-chancellor of Institute of Transplantation Sciences (ITS), said that the case was unique as the parents were illiterate. “It was a moment of great grief for them as they were losing their daughter,” he said. “But when the doctors counselled them that she can save others by donation, they agreed readily. Their consent forms have thumb prints instead of signatures, a rare occasion for us.” He went on to say: “The rise in awareness is surely improving the cases of cadaver donations in Gujarat.” A part of her liver went to a six-year-old child suffering from Wilson’s Disease and another to an adult patient, said SOTTO officials. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-death-teen-organ-donor-saves-four/articleshow/85990050.cms||---

Fishermen operating near the Cortalim creek had approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stating that their fishing rights are being violated by the alleged illegal structures constructed by different shipyards to dock barges for repairs. “The Authority directed CoP to identify the offending structures on the site which have appeared on the survey plan and fix responsibility of constructing those on parties concerned at the ground by doing field inspection and local enquiry,” the GCZMA said at its meeting held last month. The complainant had said that barges brought for repairs are being anchored blocking the Cortalim creek, obstructing the water channel and disrupting fishing rights. The complainant also said that there is industrial pollution of the creek taking place due to dumping of metals, debris, rust and chemicals from the ship building and repair activities. The complaint said that the creek has also been illegally encroached on to carry out these activities. Based on the matter before the NGT, the GCZMA carried out a site inspection and placed it before the tribunal. A survey was also carried out of the area where the alleged illegal activity was being carried out and blatant and serious violation of CRZ notification 2011 were noticed back in 2016. Accordingly, showcause notices were issued to the violators, who told the GCZMA at its subsequent hearings that the activities were being carried out foreshore and the alleged offending structures were existing prior to 1991. The alleged violators also disputed the maps of the directorate of land and settlement records which had been referred to by the officials. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, at different meetings of the GCZMA, the authority deliberated on the legality of the structures in question near Cortalim creek in relation to CRZ norms. Further discussions are set to take place on this aspect at subsequent hearings. Four shipyards are defending the allegations made by the fishermen.

What exists is one culture, and the rest can simply merge into it, said secretary-general of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) Milind Parande. “The Hindu cause has to be prime,” he added. “The confluence of Ganga and Jamuna rivers takes place at Prayagraj (Allahabad). If you see, there Jamuna completely merges into the Ganga and simply vanishes. It has to be the same for the country. Everything else has to merge into one large Hindu culture,” said Parande. He was addressing a press conference in the city on Monday. Parande also said that idol of Lord Rama would be installed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple at Ayodhya by December 2023. The work is in the foundation stage and donations to the tune of Rs3,200 crore have received for the cause so far. The temple even today is open for pilgrimage, he added. Later talking to TOI, Parande said that the single culture means Hindu culture, which is related to a geo-cultural identity. “By merging into the Hindu culture does not mean that Muslims may not follow their religion,” he said. “They can follow their faith, but have to respect the sentiments of Hindus, which is majority community in the country. They should refrain from cow slaughter, not protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and live peacefully without causing riots,” he said. “The post-poll violence in West Bengal is one example where they used their brute force of majority. What will happen if the Hindus use their brute force of majority,” he asked. There is need to change the history curriculum, which glorifies the Mughal kings, Parande said as he hit out at The Empire web series on Babur. Parande said VHP is a social organization and works for the betterment of Hindus and does not tend to harm anyone and also does not believe in violence. “VHP has also been actively working on bringing back women into the Hindu fold after they were converted to Islam through love jihad,” he said. Nearly 1,000 are re-converted each year, he added. On question about lyricist Javed Akhtar’s Taliban-RSS comments, which have raked up a controversy, Parande said strict action should be taken against him. “Javed Akhtar is a man of repute and a person like him should not make such comments. One such person brings disrepute to the entire community. Now it is up to the community members to denounce him,” he said. On the alleged ‘Hijab Day’ incident in Nagpur, Parande said strict action should be taken against the organizers. “Their apology is not enough and they should be punished. They are apologizing now because they lack the power. Tomorrow if they get the might, same thing would be forced upon us,” he said, referring to last week’s incident in which some women had allegedly tried to make walkers on a street in Civil Lines wear Hijab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-place-for-ganga-jamuni-tehzeeb-hindu-cause-has-to-be-prime-vhp/articleshow/85990057.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ahmedabad||‘16 years of hearings punishment enough’||AHMEDABAD: A local court handed down a minor punishment — sitting in the courtroom for one day — for the black-marketing of railway tickets after observing that the accused regularly attended court hearings for 16 years and this itself was punishment enough for him. The accused’s behaviour of religiously attending proceedings for 16 years paid him at the end of the trial. There were in all 62 hearings and adjournments during the course of the trial. The case involved Ashok Bhumihar (39), a resident of Delhi Darwaza, who was caught buying railway tickets from the reservation counter on March 25, 2004. Railway police force lodged a complaint against him under Section 143 of the Railways Act, which provides for ‘penalty for unauthorised carrying on of business of procuring and supplying of railway tickets’. It entails punishment of up to three years and a fine of up to Rs 10,000. Bhumihar was booked because he was found in possession of tickets without a licence to sell them. The accused denied the charges and claimed that he had bought the tickets for relatives. However, the court did not believe him and held him guilty of black-marketing. The court awarded him punishment on September 3 but rejected the prosecution’s demand for harsh punishment. While holding him guilty, additional chief metropolitan magistrate B R Rajput said, “Because of such persons, railway tickets are black-marketed and poor and needy passengers do not get reservations on trains and cannot travel in proper conditions. If this black-marketing is not stopped, many passengers will have to continue to face hardships on daily basis.” However, the court was lenient on Bhumihar. It ordered him only to sit till the rising or the court (TRC) and pay a Rs 5,000 fine. The court said, “This is a 2004 case and the accused remained present for the hearings on a regular basis. His presence in court for 16 years is punishment enough.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/16-years-of-hearings-punishment-enough/articleshow/85992352.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Inter cadre posting: Vij says objection ignored, CMO says he was consulted||Chandigarh: A day after Haryana government appointed IPS officer ADGP Kala Ramachandran as the transport department principal secretary, an IAS cadre post, state home minister Anil Vij reiterated that it had been done without taking approval from the department of personnel and training (DoPT). Headed by Prime Minster Narendra Modi, DoPT is the coordinating agency of the central government that takes care of matters related to over two dozen all India services, including Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS). “We have already written on file that the inter cadre posting should be done after taking the prior permission from the appropriate authority. Rest, the CM office can take decision on its own as well,’’ said Vij. Holding home department portfolio, Vij is the minister incharge of IPS cadre in the state. When contacted, a senior functionary in CMO denied Vij was overruled. Speaking on the condition of his name not being printed, the senior officer said, “So far as the current posting is concerned, Vij sahab was taken into confidence. Though, he had given comments on file, later during interaction he had agreed to it. Hence the orders. The CM never interferes in his ministers’ functioning. However, being head of the government, he has bigger perspective and can see certain issues different. Rest, the CM and home minister are best of friends, cabinet colleagues and party colleagues.” However, is not the first instance when the chief minister’s office (CMO) has ignored Vij’s opinion on issues related to his own departments, home and health. First major confrontation between CM Manohar Lal Khattar and home minister Vij was over the control of CID department. Traditionally, state police’s CID wing used to be part of home department and the CM would usually keep the portfolio with him. When Vij was given home department portfolio, he asked the CID head to report to him. Finally, the issue was resolved by separating CID from home and the CM taking control of it. Then during the the second wave of Covid, Khattar took direct control of all the pandemic related issues even as the health department remained with Vij. More recently, extension to then Haryana police chief DGP Manoj Yadava in February became a bone of contention. Vij had been asking the additional chief secretary for home to prepare a new panel of officers to be submitted to UPSC for final selection but the CMO gave an extension to Yadava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/inter-cadre-posting-vij-says-objection-ignored-cmo-says-he-was-consulted/articleshow/85990085.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Somnath donations pass pre-Covid levels||AHMEDABAD: The famous Shiva temple at Somnath town in Veraval district has seen its donations surge in the month of Shravan, surpassing the pre-Covid level contributions in a similar period. So even as the footfalls have fallen this time as compared to the month of Shravan in 2019, the donations have surged to Rs 6.50 crore, from Rs 6.41 crore in 2019. “There are still a few days for the month of Shravan to end, and we expect the donations to reach Rs 7 crore by then. This year in the festive month of Shravan we have seen 9 lakh footfalls which is much lower than the 25 lakhs in the Shravan of 2019,” said Vijaysinh Chavda, general manager, Somnath Temple Trust. In the pre-Covid times the temple saw an average of Rs 4.5 crore to Rs 5 crore from donations a month with the month of Shravan contributing the highest amounts. On Monday, about 45,000 devotees visited the temple. Somnath Temple is the first among the twelve Aadi Jyotirlings of India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the chairman of Somnath Temple Trust. The post had fallen vacant earlier this year following the demise of BJP strongman and former chief minister of Gujarat Keshubhai Patel. The existing temple, considered to be the seventh one, is built in the Kailas Mahameru Prasad style and India’s first deputy Prime Minister. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is its pioneer. The design is by Prabhashankar Sompura who is remembered as the architect of the present-day temple. His son, Chandrakant Sompura’s design has been adopted by Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra for construction of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya. The ‘treasury of God’ at the famous temples of Gujarat has seen a revival in the past few months with the number of Covid-19 cases going down and lockdown restrictions being relaxed. Donations that had dried up during the Covid-19 crisis are again rising to pre-Covid levels at the four temples including Somnath temple in Veraval, Dwarkadhish temple Dwarka town, Ambaji temple in Banaskantha and the Ranchhodrai temple at Dakor. The donations received from devotees at four of the famous temples in Gujarat showed a total average drop for the financial year 2020-21 of about 37% as compared to the year previous. The collections had dropped from Rs 119.35 crore for the year 2019-2020 to Rs 74.91 crore for the financial year 2020-21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/somnath-donations-pass-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/85992358.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Kolkata||Virtual confusion protest hits campus||Kolkata: The stiff competition for undergraduate seats, coupled with a supposed miscommunication about virtual reporting on the part of Jogamaya Devi College, led to an agitation by candidates, who gathered at the institute gate on Monday, demanding admission. After the state government notified that no student be allowed to visit the campus during admissions, some institutes replaced physical counselling with virtual reporting. Most colleges have been calling more students than seats for virtual reporting so that unwilling candidates—those who would not turn up —can be weeded out. But given the stiff competition this time, all the students have been turning up for reporting at some colleges, leading to protests. The principal of a college said, “The entire process is being held online, and it’s all running on programming. Students have to understand that college authorities have nothing to do here.” According to the agitating candidates at Jogamaya Devi College—the girls’ institute at Asutosh College—a confusion had been created as double the number of students had been called for virtual reporting in some subjects, and that they were denied seats despite having received confirmatory messages. Among the 50-odd students who staged a protest was Anjali Shaw, who had applied for microbiology and her name was reportedly 34th on the merit list. “I got a message from the college on September 3, where it was written I had been selected and I should submit fees to take admission. But when I tried to submit the fees online, the seats were booked,” she claimed. Principal Sarbani Goswami said, “The rush has been huge this time after 100% candidates passed HS. We have received 8,000 forms, with a huge demand for subjects like, political science, geology, geography and microbiology. Double the number of students were called for virtual reporting. If all seats are taken up, what can we do?” But she added, “There might have been a miscommunication over admission messages. But we can’t take more students than seats.” This is the second round of admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/virtual-confusion-protest-hits-campus/articleshow/85990186.cms||---

According to a state government directive, the teachers have instead been asked to extend ‘emotional support’ to kids attending government schools since classes resumed from September 1. There are close to 1.6 crore students enrolled in 1.59 lakh primary and upper primary schools in the state. Director general school education Anamika Singh has instructed all basic education officers to ensure that teachers do not burden children with studies or tests, written or oral, to avoid stressful situations. Singh stated that not only had children had a long break from studies, but were also witness to the deadly coronavirus which had had adverse effects on their learning. In such difficult times, teachers have been asked to emotionally strengthen kids by means of activities and games so that they adapt themselves to the academic environment, stated Singh, who is also the basic education secretary, in her order. The fresh set of instructions on functioning of schools also called for two hours of compulsory teaching for children in classes 1 to 5, with one hour each dedicated to Hindi and mathematics. In the remaining school hours, teachers will engage kids in various sporting activities and motivate them to spend time reading books in the school library. For upper primary classes (6 to 8), teachers have been asked to focus on Hindi and mathematics in addition to science and English. According to the directives, for the first two weeks, teachers must narrate didactic stories to children to help them adapt to school surroundings. This, said Singh, will make them feel part of the teaching-learning process. She has also asked teachers to use formative ways to assess the skills of students and update it on the Prerna portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/taking-it-slow-no-tests-for-school-kids-in-near-future/articleshow/85992394.cms||Isha Jain

The patent has been granted for 20 years in accordance with the provisions of the Patent’s Act. This is the 15th Indian patent granted to PAU and second to principal microbiologist G S Kocher. The team also included his doctorate student Ritika from the department of microbiology and H S Oberoi, scientist, Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering Technology(CIPHET), Ludhiana. According to Kocher, the present invention relates to a fermentation process for enhanced glucose production from sweet sorghum bagasse (SSB) using an acido-thermophilic cellulase consortium produced by aspergillus fumigatus. Since, the process uses thermophilic fungus, refrigeration during enzyme production and/ or hydrolysis is not needed which is energy and cost saving. Further, Kocher said this invention is in line with the biofuel policy, 2018, of the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, whereby higher emphasis has been laid on agricultural lignocellulosic residues as substrate (2G) for bioethanol production as more funding and incentives to start-ups have been provided.

Konkan division is second on the list with 114% normal showers followed by Amravati (105%), Pune (89%), Nagpur (88%), and Nashik (78%). As per official data, the state as a whole has received an average of 917mm rainfall till Monday morning, which is 107% of the normal rainfall from June onwards. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre in Aurangabad, said timely arrival of monsoon coupled with favourable weather conditions over Bay of Bengal have resulted in surplus rainfall for Marathwada. “The favourable weather system during the onset of monsoon over Arabian sea saw Marathwada getting expected showers. While a considerably long dry spell was observed in August across many parts of the region, low pressure area over Bay of Bengal during the recent past again revived the monsoon conditions, largely benefiting the eastern parts of Marathwada,” he said. Aundhkar said the entire region, including western parts of Marathwada along with Nashik and Ahmednagar that fall in upstream areas of Jayakwadi dam from Aurangabad district, were expected to get adequate showers in near future due to the possibility of favourable conditions of monsoon over the Western Ghat section. Among eight districts of Marathwada, Beed has registered the highest 161% of normal rainfall (692 mm) since June 1, followed by Jalna (159%, 779 mm), Aurangabad (132%, 607 mm), Latur (118% 660 mm), Osmanabad (129%, 588 mm), Nanded (124%, 841 mm), Parbhani (122%, 765 mm) and Hingoli (114%, 768 mm).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/marathwada-gets-131-of-normal-rainfall-highest-among-6-divisions/articleshow/85995039.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC relief for IAS officer Vipul Mittra in 19-year-old case||AHMEDABAD: In a relief for senior IAS officer Vipul Mittra, the Gujarat high court has quashed the special CBI court’s order of rejecting a closure report against the officer on charges of corruption, cheating and criminal conspiracy levelled against him when he was posted as deputy chairman of the Kandla Port Trust (KPT). The case was hanging for nearly two decades with the CBI court twice rejecting closure reports filed by the investigating officer. Five persons working with KPT, which has now been renamed as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Port Trust, were booked in 2002 by CBI for causing loss of Rs 8.27 lakh to the trust in purchase of all creel blankets. Mittra’s name was not mentioned in the FIR. It was during the course of investigation that his name cropped up because he was working as deputy chairman when the purchase orders were placed during 1998-99. After investigation, the probe agency filed a closure report in 2004, but the court at Mirzapur rural court campus in Ahmedabad rejected it in 2012 and ordered the investigating officer to probe the charges further. The officer filed another report in 2012 requesting the court to close the case with a remark, “CBI maintains its earlier stand that, this case is required to be closed due to lack of sufficient evidence to attribute criminality to the accused persons.” The second report was also rejected by the lower court in 2016 and the judge ordered the IO to probe into Mittra’s role as well as to obtain prosecution sanction against him from the competent authority. In 2018, Mittra approached the HC against the CBI court’s stand. His advocate submitted that for a long time Mittra’s name did not figure even in investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-relief-for-ias-officer-mittra-in-19-year-old-case/articleshow/85992413.cms||---

The MSME department will set up a centralised facilitation centre for better coordination among district centres. “This year, goods like carpets, rugs, textile, footwear, glassware, iron, steel, aluminium, rice, sugar, milk, flour, plastic products, silk and artificial flowers have been exported to different parts of the world,” said a government spokesperson. According to the report, export of footwear and toys went up from Rs 147 crore and Rs 26 crore respectively in April-May last year to Rs 742 crore and Rs 120 crore this year.

The department is also constructing two flyovers at Gounder Mills (GN Mills) and Periyanaickenpalayam. A 10.1km elevated corridor on Avinashi Road and a flyover at Ukkadam – Athupalam stretch is also under construction. “To decongest city roads, the state and national highways departments are constructing flyovers, spending crores of rupees. The flyovers will occupy the lion’s share of road space. It will be difficult to find space to build elevated tracks for metro rail. The Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will have to build tunnels that are 100 feet deep for metro lines. It would cost more than five times compared to pillars,” said an official.“If metro rail tracks are to be built at ground level, it would at least three-metre-wide space on both sides of the pillars on Avinashi Road and Trichy Road. Then, commuters won’t be able to cross the roads and CMRL will have to introduce traffic signals for commuters. It would only create chaos,” he added.Activist K Kathirmathiyon also shared a similar view. “I have little confidence in the metro rail project. It will be very difficult to implement the project on the proposed routes. The city has been extended to Thudiyalur. Within 10 to 15 years, the entire Mettupalayam Road will have houses along it and Thudiyalur will become the city centre. So, the state government should implement the project in semi-urban areas and revise the route plan,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/metro-rail-project-wont-be-an-easy-ride-highways-dept-officials/articleshow/85990192.cms||---

CMC chief officer Violet Gomes had issued the NOC on April, 20 to the developers to carry out hill-cutting. The council has decided to withdraw the NOC following strong criticism in the town. Cuncolim locals led by Jorson Fernandes had lodged a complaint with CMC in July against the rampant hill-cutting and demanded immediate issuance of stop work order. CMC had subsequently issued a show cause cum stop work order to the party. Fernandes said that the hill, which is facing threat from private developers, is a ground water aquifer according to the Goa State Biodiversity Board and needs to be protected. “This will completely lead to the destruction of ground water aquifers, which is cruel and grave to the environment,” he said. Reacting to the latest decision of the council meeting to revoke the permission, Fernandes said that the resolution moved should have a strong preamble with sufficient and satisfactory reasons to revoke the NOC issued by CMC. Councillor Rahul Dessai and John Dias had witten a letter to CMC to initiate action against the chief officer. Dias said that chairperson Laxman Naik didn’t allow the discussion on the issue stating that the letter should be signed by one-fourth of the council members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cuncolim-council-to-revoke-noc-for-hill-cutting/articleshow/85990251.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As part of the conciliatory efforts taken by the state leadership, AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar has called off his scheduled visit to meet the leaders here. The meeting was scheduled ahead of the UDF meet to settle the house in order as the UDF constituents had alleged that crisis in the Congress was affecting the front. Chandy and Chennithala reached the KPCC headquarters in the morning and had a closed door discussion with Sudhakaran and Satheesan. Soon before the meeting to pacify the disgruntled leaders, Sudhakaran sought an explanation from Kasaragod MP Rajmohan Unnithan for criticizing Chandy and Chennithala in public. This was one of the major complaints of the leaders, that the KPCC leadership was not acting against those who were openly flaying Chandy and Chennithala. “We had a detailed discussion and all the issues have been sorted out. There is no more discord among us. All the demands of these leaders will be incorporated and considered during the revamp of the district committees and also in the KPCC,” Sudhakaran said after the meeting. It was Sudhakaran’s first meeting with Chandy and Chennithala after party high command announced the new DCC presidents. As part of peace-making efforts, opposition leader V D Satheesan had met Chandy and Chennithala at their homes on Sunday. It is learnt that the meeting by Satheesan was part of the measures to bring these leaders to the UDF meeting, which was scheduled on Monday. Due to the serious differences these leaders are having with the KPCC leadership, there was a fear that they might stay away from the UDF meet. The meeting Satheesan had with the two leaders paved the way for further discussions. The opposition leader said there were no issues which could not be sorted out. “The KPCC president and I planned the meeting with the senior leaders at their homes. It has been welcomed by the rank and file of the party. We are on a mission to rebuild the party with unity. For this, the leadership will be going ahead with the support of all senior leaders,” Satheesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kpcc-chief-oppn-leader-hold-talks-with-chandy-chennithala/articleshow/85990258.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana to relieve 116 doctors on September 30||CHANDIGARH: In a major setback to Haryana’s preparedness for the anticipated third wave of Covid-19, the state health department has decided to do away with the services of 116 medicos from September 30. The decision has been taken consequent to the health department’s new guideline of bringing down the age of superannuation of Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) doctors to 58 with immediate effect. Till now, doctors who attained the age of 58 were given an extension of service, as consultants, in the health department with same service benefits. With this new circular released by health department on Friday, doctors, once they attain the age of superannuation, would be re-employed only after they are officially relieved and after filling an online proforma. The HCMS association has decided to take up the issue with state home minister Anil Vij. “This system of automatic extension is prevalent even at the Centre... Imagine the plight of those on extension who did not even apply for the retirement benefits due to automatic extension. It is well known that only those in need of job opt for extension, else they would have resigned after a particular period,” said Dr Jasbir Singh Panwar, president of HCMSA. Service rules stipulate that either party serves a notice of three months ahead of relieving or resigning from the job. But, in this case all 116 doctors will be relieved on September 30, he added. When contacted, Vij cited the change of rules but claimed that all those on extension will have the job security. “What we have done is that instead of giving one-time extension, it (extension) will be given every year. Besides, they will be deployed at places where their services are really needed. Now, most of the consultants want Panchkula or choice postings, which is not possible. Hence postings will be done on basis of requirement,” he said. Panwar claimed that most of the doctors who will be relieved are specialists and have undergone training for the third wave. He also rued delay on the part of government for creation of sub cadre of specialist and other demands. “Even though the chief minister and the home minister have given a go ahead, the files have been lying with the administrative secretaries for the past year and half,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-to-relieve-116-doctors-on-sept-30/articleshow/85990217.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Power subsidy for M’wada industries resume: CMIA||Aurangabad: The state government has finally resumed power subsidy for industries in Marathwada and other backward areas of Maharashtra. While the subsidy was discontinued from January, the industries have received the necessary grant corresponding to May in the latest billing cycle. Confirming the same, the Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA), said the backlog of subsidy is expected to get disbursed on the part of government in subsequent billing. “The release of Rs 130 crore by the government towards the monthly power subsidy is a much-needed relief for industries from Marathwada, Vidarbha and other backward regions of the state. While industries were struggling to stay afloat during the current pandemic, withholding of subsidy had added to woes of the industries,” CMIA secretary Satish Lonikar said. Claiming that Maharashtra does not have competitive power tariff for industries as compared to some other states of the country, Loniar said the power subsidy should be supplied in an uninterrupted manner in the future. While the subsidy concerned was discontinued from January as the sum of Rs 1,200 crore provided by the state government for the year 2020-21 was exhausted, industry players said they have no clarity on why the funding in question was resumed from May instead of February. “We will request the government to also release the power subsidy for missing three months,” CMIA officials said. TOI in past highlighted outcry from industries over the discontinuation of the benefit even as the pandemic condition said to have wreaked havoc. The power subsidy in question was introduced in 2016 for areas classified as ‘industrially least developed’ by offering subsidized power tariff of 50 paise to 75 paise on per unit consumption of electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/power-subsidy-for-mwada-industries-resume-cmia/articleshow/85995040.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Nagpur||HC gives pan kiosk owner caught with liquor bottles chance to reform||Nagpur: In a relief for a poor pan kiosk owner from Chandrapur, who was caught with liquor bottles in his pocket while there was prohibition in the district, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court quashed his prison term and waived off a fine of Rs25,000 while holding that he should be granted a chance to reform. Justice Rohit Deo, however, maintained his conviction under Section 65 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949, pronounced by the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) on May 10, 2018, in a case registered by Chandrapur police station in 2015. He was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years and imposed a cost of Rs25,000, which was later upheld by the Chandrapur sessions court. As per the HC, it didn’t appear that the petitioner was involved in illegal liquor trade. “The liquor, which he possessed, is more likely to be for personal consumption than for sale. Considering that he has no propensity, as such, to indulge in criminal activities, he is entitled to an opportunity to reform,” the judge said. Petitioner Kamlesh Thombre was intercepted by the police on September 9, 2015, in front of his pan kiosk at Babupeth in Chandrapur where he was found to be in possession of two foreign liquor bottles of 180ml each in his pockets. After seizing the material from him, an offence was registered, and a charge sheet filed. After he was convicted by JMFC, he challenged the order in sessions court where the sentence was upheld on August 29, 2019. He then knocked the HC’s doors through counsel Mir Nagman Ali praying for leniency. While granting him benefit of ‘Probation of Offenders Act’, Justice Deo directed the petitioner to enter into a bond, to permanently reside within the territorial jurisdiction of the district probation officer and to submit his phone number and permanent address to him. He was told to undertake not to be involved in any criminal or otherwise undesirable activities. “I have perused the material on record. While I have no reason to disagree with the finding of fact recorded concurrently, in my considered view the punishment is extremely harsh. The report of the probation officer concerned was called, where he recommended grant of probation. The incident took place in 2015. He has a family to support, including a wife and two children, where the elder is an engineering student,” the judge said while partly allowing Thombre’s plea.

Having seen her mother’s struggles, Nimita Rana wanted to pay her family back. After finishing her bachelors and masters from M S University’s Faculty of Commerce, she had set her eyes to clear CMA finals and try her luck with civil services as well. She had cracked the intermediate level of cost and management accountancy (CMA) and was simultaneously preparing for Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams. But on Sunday, this 26-year-old promising young professional from the city breathed her last at state-run SSG Hospital after falling prey to dengue that has started to raise its ugly head in the city. Nimita also left behind a baby boy, who too is struggling for life inside the ICU ever since his birth. “Even after her marriage last year, she was focused on her studies. She was going to appear for the CMA final this month. She had already tried her luck with the Gujarat Gaun Seva Pasandgi Mandal to find a suitable job so that she can earn and support the family,” said her elder brother Rohan Rana. Although Rohan — who has done his diploma in plastic engineering from CEPT, Ahmedabad — had started earning after bagging a job at Mundra, his sister always wanted to make a contribution. After her father Rajendra passed away in 2010, Nimita’s mother Mamta took upon herself to raise the two kids. “After delivering newspapers every morning, my mother sells newspapers on the roadside near Kashiba Children Hospital. It is because of her and my brother that I could study,” Nimita had told this correspondent in 2019, adding that she would work further to clear CMA with flying colours to support her family. “We had earlier taken her to Thakorbhai hospital. Later, she developed fever and was referred to SSG Hospital where her platelet count had also improved. But she passed away a day after delivering the baby,” said the heartbroken brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dengue-kills-mothers-big-dreams/articleshow/85990283.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Pune||Hit by truck, scooterist falls 30ft into Katraj Ghat gorge||Pune: A 40-year-old scooter rider, who fell into a 30ft-deep gorge after being hit by an oncoming cement concrete mixer truck in the old Katraj Ghat section, was rescued by fire brigade and police personnel on Monday afternoon. Alim Mujawar from Kondhwa sustained multiple fractures to his legs and injuries to back and shoulders. He had hit tree branches before landing on the grass in the valley, police said. He was taken to a private hospital, where he was reported to be in a state of unconsciousness on Monday evening. The truck driver initially fled the spot and later surrendered before the police. A police officer said he told investigators that the accident occurred because the steering wheel of his vehicle had jammed. “We have detained him and are verifying his claims by RTO experts,” the officer said. Before hitting the scooter, the truck had hit a car that was ahead of the two-wheeler. The police said that no one in the car was injured. The truck was headed for Katraj from Khed-Shivapur, while the car and Mujawar’s scooter were moving in the opposite direction. The police said the truck driver lost control in the ghat section and first hit the car and then Mujawar’s scooter. “Mujawar was heading to the Dargah at Khed Shivapur from his Kondhwa residence to offer prayers,” sub-inspector Avinash Dhame of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said. The officer said, “Mujawar was riding his scooter on the left side of the road. As soon as the truck hit him, he was flung into the air and then fell into the gorge. His scooter got stuck in the retaining wall of the road and was completely damaged. A few passersby saw the incident and called up the police and fire brigade.” Firemen Ananta Jagade, Ramesh Mangade, Tejas Mandavkar, Shivdas Khutwad and others climbed down about 30 feet and found him in an unconscious state. “We shifted him to a private hospital for treatment. The accident triggered a traffic snarl in the area. The police arranged a heavy duty crane and shifted the truck,” Dhame said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hit-by-truck-scooterist-falls-30ft-into-katraj-ghat-gorge/articleshow/85990272.cms||---

He congratulated the state government and people of the state for leading the country in administering the first dose and he hoped it would follow suit even when it came to the second dose. He said the state was able to achieve this target due to effective implementation of the vaccination drive and public awareness. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur participated in the main function organised at Peterhof, Shimla. BJP national president and MP Jagat Prakash Nadda and Union minister of information and broadcasting Anurag Singh Thakur participated in the programme from New Delhi. Modi said he had seen Himachal struggle for meagre facilities and it was now on the path of rapid development. He said Himachal had become the first state in India to have administered at least one dose of Covid vaccine to its entire eligible population. Not only this, in the case of second dose also, Himachal had crossed almost one third of the population. This step of Himachal Pradesh has made us realise the importance of self reliance, he added. He appreciated the arrangements made by the state government, despite hilly terrain. Himachal has ensured the fastest vaccination, without wastage of the vaccine. The PM interacted with Dr Rahul of Dodra Kwar civil hospital inShimla district, Dayal Singh of Thunag in Mandi district, Nirma Devi, an ASHA worker from Malana in Kullu district, Nirmala Devi from Hamirpur disrict, Karmo Devi from Una, and Nawang Upasak from Lahaul-Spiti. The CM said it was due to the “dynamic leadership and farsightedness” of Modi that India had successfully produced a vaccine to deal with the pandemic in a short duration. “Due to these efforts, Himachal Pradesh has achieved the target of vaccinating 100 percent of its adult population with the first dose of Covid vaccination,” he said. He said till September 3, 55,28,648 people had been inoculated with the first dose of Covid vaccine and 17,92,715 people had been inoculated with two doses of vaccine. ‘Back research on landslide warning systems’ PM Narendra Modi suggested the state to use drones in land survey and encourage research related to early warning system regarding landslides. He laid emphasis on importance of organic farming and said farmers of the state, like the soldiers of Himachal Pradesh, were playing a vital role in protecting soil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/for-modi-himachal-is-champion-of-covid-vaccination/articleshow/85990248.cms||---

Among the crimes was the June 29 incident at Kalyaninagar, in which the woman had drugged and robbed valuables and cash, totally worth Rs8.08 lakh, from her ailing NRI woman (73) employee. The domestic help is currently in police custody till September 12, as ordered by a Pune cantonment court. Between January 17 and August 4, the Wanowrie police had registered three FIRs relating to theft of cash and valuables worth lakhs of rupees from senior citizens’ houses. All these incidents involved a woman, who was then unidentified. Assistant inspector Jaywant Jadhav on Monday said, “We checked nearly 300 CCTV cameras installed at three housing societies and other places and identified a woman with her face covered. The flat owners confirmed that she was the same person employed by them.” He said, “An analysis of the footage revealed that the woman was clad in different attire but used footwear of a particular colour. We identified the routes used by her and traced her last location up to the Pune railway station area. We conducted searches and took the woman into custody from a lodge after identifying her from the footwear.” Jadhav added, “The woman, who claims to be suffering from various ailments, admitted during questioning, to have committed thefts at the residence of elderly people by mixing sleeping pills in their meals or water since 2018. She showed us the places where she had committed crime.” Senior inspector Deepak Lagad said, “The woman is from Tamil Nadu and speaks broken Hindi. Her modus operandi is that she would meet women during morning/evening walks and seek their help to find a domestic help’s job. She would tell them that her husband was subjecting her to cruelty.” The officer said, “In the three cases in Wanworie, we found that the flat owners had hired the woman without verifying her credentials.” Investigations revealed that the woman would work for two to four days and would then go missing after committing thefts. “We are in the process of recovering the stolen property,” he said. On Monday, the police had summoned some jewellers for questioning after the woman revealed that she had sold the stolen articles to them. Pune Saraf Association president Fathechand Ranka, who was present at the police station, told TOI, “The woman has given false and misleading information to police. The jewellers are all from Camp area and have nothing to do with them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/domestic-help-held-cops-crack-9-cases-of-robbing-employers/articleshow/85990320.cms||Asseem Shaikh

He also alleged that IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty was linked to hundreds of benami accounts in the bank which has used for parking unaccounted money and laundering of black money. Jaleel alleged that as many as 862 fake benami bank accounts were created using 257 customer IDs by former bank secretary V K Harikumar for Kunhalikutty to facilitate illegal financial dealings, parking unaccounted money and laundering of black money amassed through corruption Jaleel alleged that through the benami accounts created by Harihumar, illegal transactions of Rs 114 crore have been conducted during the last 10 years. “The huge financial irregularity was unearthed when the IT department conducted a random examination of the 257 customer IDs. If the entire customer IDs in the bank are examined, then it will expose one of the biggest unaccounted money scam in the entire country,” Jaleel said. Jaleel said that Kunhalikutty and his team had turned the AR Nagar Cooperative Bank to their Swiss Bank in the state. He alleged that going by the dates and year of the transactions it could be suspected that the benami transactions could be the money amassed through corruption in Travancore Titanum Industries when Kunhalikutty and former IUML minister Ebrahim Kunju served as industries ministers. Jaleel alleged that the possibility of funds amassed through financial irregularities in Malabar Cements, KMML and other public sector firms could not be ruled out. He said despite being a primary service cooperative bank, there were 50,000 members and 80,000 accounts in AR Nagar bank. He also said that the Rs 3 crore deposit made by Ashique, son of P K Kunhalikutty, violating Foreign Exvhange Management Act is under the lens of RBI. Jaleel said that the inquiry has found that the addresses of customers have been deleted from the computer software of the bank. He said that the cooperative department probe had found that 12 employees of the bank had illegal deposits of Rs 6.8 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/rs-1021cr-black-money-dealings-in-ar-nagar-bank-jaleel/articleshow/85990348.cms||---

Unnat Vanzara and his brother Urvesh went from Savli while their friends Jay Patel and Naimi Shah joined them from Vadodara city. As they were about to enter Lanchhanpura village, they were stopped as four locals had blocked the road by placing their bikes in the middle of it. When Vanzara asked them to move their vehicles, they were asked why they had come to Lanchhanpura in the evening. On explaining, them that they were going to the river bank, the four hurled abuses at Vanzara and got into heated arguments that they were illegally entering the village. After altercation, they moved their bikes but threatened Vanzara that on returning they would have to face consequences and followed their cars. A while later, the four accused reached with wooden sticks and attacked the four friends. The four friends sat in their cars, but Vanzara and Urvesh were dragged out and beaten up. In the melee, Vanzara’s gold necklace worth Rs 45,000 was stolen and Rs 5,000 cash from Urvesh’s pocket went missing. The two brothers somehow managed to escape and sped out of the village. But the four accused followed them for a distance and even banged their wooden sticks on their cars, damaging them. On reaching Rasalpur canal road, the four accused turned back as Vanzara’s father Ranjit had reached there to help them. While they were escaping in their cars, Vanzara had called him to narrate the incident. Later, Vanzara lodged a complaint of assault, robbery and wrongful restraint at Savli police station. Police said that Vanzara’s father identified three of the four accused while they were turning back and based on his statement Sanjay Chauhan, Ashok Parmar and Arvind Zala have been named as the attackers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-friends-on-picnic-robbed/articleshow/85990335.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Women given prominence, key posts under BJP rule: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said that the recent appointment of three women judges in the Supreme Court was a key pointer to the style of working of the BJP government at the Centre. Speaking at the working committee meeting of UP BJP Mahila Morcha, Yogi said during the regime of PM Narendra Modi, the country has seen the appointment of maximum number of three women governors, besides the key Union finance ministry allocated to a woman (Nirmala Sitharaman). “The country also saw the commendable performance of former foreign minister, Late Sushma Swaraj, and Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan (during Modi 1.0 government),” he said. Yogi asserted that the axis of politics and governance changed after PM Modi came to power and his government has addressed issues pertaining to poor, farmers, youth and women and has brought them in the mainstream of political discourse. “These sections have been the core of all central schemes conceptualised since 2014,” he said in the presence of national president of BJP Mahila Morcha, Vanathi Srinivasan, who is MLA from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. UP BJP Mahila Morcha president Geeta Shakya presided over the meeting. The CM emphasised that the malpractice of Triple Talaq which crippled the society for years was a reflection of how rights of scores of women were suppressed. Yogi said the party needs to reach out to women affected by triple talaq, against which the Centre brought a law, and get them associated with the development of the country. Adding that 56% and 54% women got elected as zila panchayat chairpersons and block pramukhs, respectively, in UP, Yogi said taking cue from the Centre, the state government has also introduced measures for women’s safety and self-reliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/women-given-prominence-key-posts-under-bjp-rule-cm/articleshow/85992542.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Residents protest tree-chop civic solution to ease Metro deadlock||Kolkata: There’s fresh trouble for the priority Ruby-Kavi Subhas stretch of the New Garia-Airport Metro corridor. This time, 23 trees have come in the way of the construction of staircase, lift and escalators for the upcoming Kavi Sukanta Metro station at the Abhishikta crossing. Residents have protested even as KMC has issued an NOC to axe 14 of them and transplant the rest. Hectic construction has been going on at the Avishikta crossing as RVNL finally got a go-ahead in February this year. Even as track-laying is on along most of the 5km section, there is a 120m gap at the Avishikta crossing that RVNL has now started filling up by constructing two piers. Work at this point was stalled for nearly two years as the design of the proposed Ruby flyover clashed with one of the Metro piers. Just while RVNL was desperately chasing the 2022 deadline to commission the section, some residents of Abhishikta wrote to state environment and forest departments that the trees lined up at the boulevard next to the service road shouldn’t be axed. KMC had allowed felling of 14 trees and transplantation of nine others. Sanghamitra Bhattacharya, a paediatrician and resident of Abhishikta II, said: “We have no faith on how the trees would be transplanted. Why can’t this particular access to the Metro station be scrapped? There are three other entrance and exit points.” RVNL has been conducting meetings with the residents to sort out the issue. There’s yet another one scheduled on Tuesday. An RVNL engineer said: “We have explained to the residents that the design of the Metro station’s access has been finalized and we would be doing compensatory plantings. But the residents refuse to understand.” Currently, the third rail is being installed along the portions of the viaduct that has been completed. The 32km Line 6 will link Kavi Subhas (New Garia) and Biman Bandar (airport) stations. The corridor covers 24 stations, but RVNL is desperately trying to complete the five stations of Phase 1 — the section between Ruby crossing (Hemanta Mukherjee station) and the terminal Kavi Subhas station. Among the five stations, construction of entry points of three — Kavi Subhash terminal (New Garia), Satyajit Ray and JN Nandy — are over. Kavi Sukanta (Avishikta crossing) has one entry point completed. The remaining are due to come up once the 120m viaduct gap is filled in the next two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-protest-tree-chop-civic-solution-to-ease-metro-deadlock/articleshow/85987919.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Chennai||Can TN Right to Service Act solve problems of delay in govt work?||By Jayaram Venkatesan, S Pradeep & A Madhuvanti Thousands of senior citizens and women line up at taluk offices every day seeking status of their application for old age pension, widow pension and other services. An interaction with them shows the lack of transparency and accountability on part of the revenue inspector and tahsildar to deliver services within the stipulated time. There are more than 50 departments in Tamil Nadu providing hundreds of such services to the public. An online survey conducted by us on citizens’ experience in accessing government services revealed that the most important problems faced by them were bribery (48%), delay in services (28%), lack of transparency and clarity on list of documents needed for applying (11.5%) and lack of transparency about officials responsible (10%). Revenue and registration department tops the chart in bribery. At least 93% said that bribe was demanded from them for delivering service and 82% were dissatisfied with the experience of accessing service. Only 29% of the people have said that the present e-seva centres have helped them access services hassle-free. A survey by Transparency International released in 2020 also revealed that India tops the charts for bribery in Asia. A systemic solution is needed, wherein power is directly placed in the hands of people to seek accountability from officials who delay service expecting bribe or for other reasons. It is in this context that the announcement of the government in the inaugural session of the assembly that they are committed to passing the Right to Service Act gains importance. Guaranteeing every citizen the right to obtain government services within a stipulated time and ensuring accountability wherever this guarantee is violated is the crux of the solution to this delay. The law has to have the citizen at the core, otherwise any watered down version will make it another redundant legislation. With this in mind, Arappor Iyakkam has put together a model draft with inputs from citizens as well as incorporating features of laws in other states. At the outset, it is necessary to have a transparent citizen charter. The list of services with stipulated time, eligibility criteria, fee amount, procedure of application, officials responsible needs to be mentioned clearly in the citizens charter which needs to be displayed in each government office and online portal. This will provide clarity and ease of operations for citizens. To ensure accountability, a unique trackable acknowledgement number should be issued to each applicant to help them keep track of the status of their service. This number has to be trackable through an online portal/ call centre. For clear communication, the designated officer should ensure approval/ rejection of application within stipulated time. And in case of rejection, the applicant should be informed in detail the specific reason for the same. Only a swift appeal process will help the public gain trust in the system. Rejection or non-delivery of service needs to be disposed of by the first appellate authority, who will be a higher official within the same department within 15 days of the receipt of the appeal. Since 84% of the people prefer grievances on service related issues to be investigated by an independent commission, a Tamil Nadu right to service commission needs to be set up for second appeals. The commission should consist of a chief commissioner and at least 10 commissioners. The chief commissioner and other commissioners should be selected by a panel comprising the chief minister, opposition leader and chief justice of the high court. This will increase the chance of a person of high integrity to be placed at the top. The commissioner needs to directly hear both sides and dispose of the appeal within a period of 30 days. Wherever a citizen is eligible for service, the disposal of the case needs to be done only after ensuring the compliance of service. Punishment for delay in services must include financial penalty from the official’s salary and recommendation for disciplinary action. Habitual offenders need to be recommended for termination of services. And citizens should be eligible for compensation wherever citizens face delay. Many states that have passed the Right to Service Act have only done lip service with appeals being heard by the higher authority of the same department. Only a few states like Punjab, Maharashtra and Assam have commissions which also don’t have the necessary independence and powers in recruitment and functioning. It is important for the government to deliberate and take feedback from the public as well as the assembly before passing this bill. A consultation with citizens running from pillar to post for services before placing in assembly is crucial for a successful law. Tamil Nadu Right to Service Act has the potential to be a cornerstone in addressing long standing issues of bribery and delay in accessing government services. But it can only happen with political will. (Jayaram Venkatesan is the convenor of Arappor Iyakkam.

He is survived by his wife and an infant daughter, whose birthday is on September 24. Prima facie probe revealed that Jamadar’s motorcycle was hit by a speeding truck, said Zol. The truck driver did not stop after the accident. Jamadar was pronounced dead at a hospital. Ashok Ghosale, the brother-in-law of the deceased, said Jamadar, who had completed an ITI course, worked with an auto firm for 10 years before he was laid off with other workers. He had taken a flat on rent and was finding it difficult to pay EMIs. A few months ago, Jamdar had joined a food delivery company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/food-delivery-partner-killed-in-accident/articleshow/85990315.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Theatre hosts Kite Runner to raise funds for Af refugees||Kolkata: ‘The Kite Runner’, the novel by Khaled Hosseini which chronicles the tumultuous events of Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion, was staged as a play in the city after a gap of seven months at Minerva theatre on Sunday to raise funds for refugees from the ravaged nation. Adapted in Bengali by Kavya Kala Manan and Debantara Arts, the 130-minute play was performed in a packed hall. Sumit Kumar Roy, who directed it, said, “This is a story of events that happened two decades ago and we are watching them unfold again. Women have no rights and children have no future in Afghanistan.” Roy felt staging ‘The Kite Runner’ was necessary at present. “We wish to get as many call shows as possible, though it’s difficult due to the pandemic. But this was too big an occasion to miss,” Roy said. Antara Chatterjee, who conceptualised the adaptation, felt it was time to stand in solidarity with the people of Afghanistan. “Our producer Debasish Chatterjee agreed to donate the proceeds from the tickets — priced at Rs 100 and Rs 150 — to the Khaled Hosseini Foundation that works with UNHCR, the UN refugee agency for refugees and displaced people of Afghanistan,” said Roy. Students from Jadavpur University, Presidency University and Rabindra Bharati University attended the show. “Minerva has 380 seats. But due to the Covid protocol, we could accommodate only 180. Several had to return. But this has filled me with hope,” said Saptarshi Chowdhury, a Presidency University student who has acted in the play. The organizers also placed a donation box at the venue and Rs 2,000 was collected, which, too, will be given to UNHCR. Staged in 2019 for the first time, the set requires regular maintenance. The group’s 30-odd actors and crew also faced challenges due to Covid.“But we rallied together and are hoping for more shows,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/theatre-hosts-kite-runner-to-raise-funds-for-af-refugees/articleshow/85987905.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray assures relief to farmers as per 2019 policy: Raju Shetti||KOLHAPUR: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday assured the delegation led by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana leader Raju Shetti that a gazette notifying compensation to the farmers as per the relief extended after the 2019 floods will soon be issued. After the five-day protest by villagers along the Panchaganga river concluded on Sunday at Narsinhawadi, Thackeray invited Shetti for discussions. The discussion was held at the CM’s office for over an hour. Shetti demanded that the farmers affected by floods in Panchaganga and Krishna rivers in July should be compensated as per the 2019 policy. Thackeray had earlier made an oral announcement that the compensation will be granted as per 2019 policy, but there was no official gazette notification issued regarding the same. “The CM said he will keep his word. He will take up the issue with the state cabinet and issue a notification in this regard for implementation. We said we trust his assurance, but for us, the option to hit the streets again is open if the CM fails to fulfil his promises. We also brought it to his notice that an announcement made by him to pay the farmers Rs 50,000 as encouragement grant for paying back loans regularly has not been fulfilled yet,” Shetti said. Shetti also demanded that the funds available with district collector to implement Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA) should be utilised for employing the daily wage workers to remove the damaged crops from the fields. “For farmers to remove the damaged crops and level the fields around Rs 10,000 per acre will be required which is not available with them. In Kolhapur, Sangli, the funds for MNREGA remains unutilised,” said Shetti. Build dams for flood managementShetti suggested that between the stretch from Mahabaleshwar and Amboli of Western Ghats, small capacity dams should be built totalling 100 TMC to accommodate excess rain water. The dams needs to be exclusively used for flood management. Shetti suggested that the CM should take up the issue with central water commission which is the implementing authority for Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal involving Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cm-assures-relief-to-farmers-as-per-2019-policy-shetti/articleshow/85995043.cms||---

While the state’s daily overall testing count is well over 40,000, the rate of testing in 13 districts has slipped below the state’s average tests per million population. Of these districts, 10 in the last seven days tested less than the national average, which is less than Punjab’s average testing. The test per million population data of the last seven days of the state health department reveals that against the state average of 1,326 tests per million, Ferozepur conducted only 622 tests during the past week, 671 in Moga, 783 in Mansa, 948 in Fazilka, 1,115 in Sangrur, 1,138 in Patiala, 1,141 in Tarn Taran, 1,165 in Fatehgarh Sahib, 1,168 in Amritsar, 1,251 in Hoshiarpur, 1,253 in Mohali and 1,287 in Ropar. Punjab has a capacity of conducting over 45,000 RT-PCR tests in a day. Not only that, out of 13 districts, the tests positivity in seven districts was much higher than the state’s overall weekly positivity rate of 0.09%. Mohali, which recorded the highest positivity rate of 0.37% during the last seven days, conducted just 1,253 tests per million population. With a positivity rate of 0.23%, Pathankot emerged as second worst performing district having a positivity rate more than the state’s average. The other districts recording higher positivity, including Ropar (0.16%), Bathinda (0.16%), Faridkot (0.14%), Hoshiarpur (0.12%), Amritsar (0.11%), Patiala (0.11%) and Jalandhar (0.11%). Drop in testing in a large number of districts has left experts worried as more samples have been found positive for the fast-spreading highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.6.17) of Covid-19. As per the latest data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), the count of samples testing positive for variants of concern has gone up from 2,072 to 2,363. Of total 1,014 samples are of Delta variant that accounts for about 43% of total variants of concerns detected in the state. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar attributed the decline in the number of tests to lesser number of fresh cases surfacing on daily basis. “Due to drop in positive cases, the number of contacts also come down, leading in drop in testing. Besides contacts, symptomatic people and random testing is done,” said Dr Bhaskar. On average, Punjab traced 17.5 contacts of infected individuals in the past week. He said the districts lagging in testing have been directed to ensure improvement in the rate. Inoculation pace picking upThe pace of Covid vaccination has slowly picked up in Punjab as the state has matched the national average of fully vaccinating 11.9% of the total population. Over 37% of the eligible population has been provided with the first dose. However, Punjab is yet to catch up with the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana where 26.5% and 15.1% elgible population, respectively, has been fully vaccinated. In Mohali district, 27.4% has received both the jabs, while in Hoshiarpur 20.5% of the eligible population is fully immunised, 18.8% in Pathankot, 18.5% in Jalandhar,16.8% in Nawanshahr and 15.9% in Gurdaspur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ahead-of-potential-third-wave-testing-drops-in-several-districts-in-punjab/articleshow/85990338.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Foot over bridge to go after Lake Town subway opens||KOLKATA: The subway at Lake Town crossing on VIP Road which is almost ready and will be inaugurated before the Pujas, is the first subway on VIP Road to have escalators going both ways at either end and is the first subway made by PWD in the city in the box jack pushing technology. This technology has enabled authorities to set it up below the busy VIP Road without any interference with the traffic movement on the surface. PWD officials said the subway corridor is ready and escalators are getting final electrical and technical touches. The authorities are also working on another subway at Dum Dum Park crossing, which will take a few months more to be completed. “The Lake Town subway is getting ready for a pre-Puja opening. We are also trying to finish work on the other subway as early as possible,” said Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose. Officials said once the Lake Town subway is opened, the existing footbridge over VIP Road at Lake Town crossing — which is the pedestrian lifeline to enter Salt Lake from Lake Town and which is now in poor structural condition — will be shut and gradually dismantled. “The decades-old Lake Town footbridge, which has incurred reduced capacity for pedestrian load, will be made defunct after the subway is opened and will be slowly dismantled. Pedestrians who now use the footbridge will then use the subway,” said a PWD official. Officials said the subway has been set up using advanced box-jacking technique, which required no traffic disruption or diversion on the surface. “No traffic restriction was required on the busy VIP Road stretch while tunnelling for the Lake Town subway. There was also minimal damage to the surface,” said an official. The same technique is being followed for the Dum Dum Park subway. Both subways will be about 68m long, 6.5m wide and 2.7m high. The combined construction cost of the two underpasses has been pegged at Rs 26 crore. The authorities had started setting up the two subways from January 2020, but work was delayed due to the pandemic. Earlier, in 2018, the authorities had set up two subways at Golaghata and Sreebhumi crossings. According to previous traffic estimates, on an average, close to 100 people cross the VIP Road at Lake Town crossing every minute during peak office hours and the subway will help to significantly reduce this pedestrian traffic on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fob-to-go-after-lake-town-subway-opens/articleshow/85987965.cms||Suman Chakraborti

This is for the first time in the state that farmer have themselves recorded the video using drone camera and submitted to the authorities. Ramasgaon villagers in Ghansawangi taluka of Jalna district unanimously said that the district administration and agriculture department takes its own time to carry out panchnama of crop and the farmers cannot wait indefinitely for the same. Moreover, due to the overflowing river, hundreds of acres of farmland have become inaccessible in this area, which is in the assembly constituency of state health minister Rajesh Tope. Farmer Mauli Dhande told TOI, “Soybean, bajra crop standing on hundreds of acres has been ruined. Almost none of the farmers having land on the banks of Godavari river have been able to go to their farms.” He said the farmers decided to rope in a drone camera owner, who otherwise used these devices for videography during marriage ceremonies. The videographer readily accepted the offer as he too was facing losses due to frequent lockdowns and was in need of business. The villagers pooled in money and paid him. The villagers said that the river water has entered the farms of Banegaon, Shewta, Bhola, Patodi, Mudregaon, Antrawali villages over the past three days. Another farmer, Rohan Bhalekar, said that he had sown cotton on five acres and the rain have caused total damage. “Now, he has evidence of crop loss recorded in video and plans to seek full compensation,” he said. The villagers from these villages have reached out to the district administration to consider these videos as proof for losses. Farmer Sharad Kedare said that by the time revenue department reach their farms, over 80% would have been washed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jalna-villagers-use-drone-to-record-crop-loss-on-godavari/articleshow/85995053.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Aurangabad||Karad assures funds for water supply scheme in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad on Monday assured central funding for the upcoming new water supply scheme for Aurangabad. Karad, a former mayor of Aurangabad, on Monday held a meeting with the authorities from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP) and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), during which he reviewed the progress of the scheme. “If the civic administration submits a proposal for release of funds under the second phase of AMRUT scheme, I will ensure the required flow of fund,” a release issued by AMC said quoting Karad. Launched by the Narendra Modi government in June 2015, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (ATAL) aims to establish infrastructure that will ensure adequate robust sewage networks and water supply for urban transformation. Stating that he will be instrumental in getting all necessary NOCs, including those from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change for the new scheme, Karad said improvement in water supply of Aurangabad was necessary for city’s all-round development. MJP executive engineer Ajay Singh and AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey earlier made a detailed presentation on the new water supply scheme for Aurangabad that has a financial outlay of Rs 1680.5 crore. Pandey said the new scheme will increase the supply of water from existing 120 MLD to 135 MLD to projected population of 33.17 lakh by 2052. Singh said the work of laying down the new water-supply scheme for Aurangabad would be over in next three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/karad-assures-funds-for-water-supply-scheme-in-aurangabad/articleshow/85995061.cms||---

Students can access e-learning platforms through necessary technology interfaces available at these Shiksha Ghars. All Covid protocols will be strictly followed at each centre, said IHA chairman Satnam Singh Ahluwalia. Some research shows that, on an average, students retain 25%-60% more material when learning online compared to 8%-10% when learning in a classroom. “The pandemic has brought new challenges to inclusive education. The low- and lower-middle-income families have been disadvantaged during temporary school shutdowns. The Shiksha Ghar is an attempt not to lose these kids to frustration and despondency,” said Sujata Pyne, president, Rotary Club of Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngos-set-up-e-learning-centres-for-needy-kids/articleshow/85987987.cms||---

Even as the university authorities have approached the cybercrime department with a request to investigate, the email has created quite a flutter as it is the second instance where specific circles are receiving fake email in Vyas’ name. “After it came to my notice, I have already warned everybody through social media platforms that such a fake email in my name is in circulation and they should remain alert,” Vyas told TOI. University authorities said VC’s email account has not been hacked nor is there any data breach of the official contacts. “Some miscreant has created a new email account that seems to be that of the VC. The email that many in the university circle have received is not from the official email id of the VC. So far, it could be traced to Nigeria,” said Dr Viral Kapadia, deputy director of MSU’s computer centre. Interestingly, the officials believe that it is the handiwork of some insider, in all probability, someone from the Faculty of Arts. “Most of the recipients are teachers of the Faculty of Arts and even the timings of sending the emails are not uniform. So, it seems this is the work of someone who is trying to gather email ids of teachers and sending the emails to whomever he or she can,” said Kapadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/another-fake-email-of-msu-vc-in-circulation/articleshow/85990381.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Preventive detention can’t be easy substitute to deal with law & order problems, rules Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Preventive detention that impinges on the prized personal liberty of a citizen cannot be resorted to as an easy substitute for dealing with ordinary law and order problems, the Bombay high court has ruled, quashing the detainment of a Pune resident. An HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar last week set aside the preventive detention order, which did not specify a period, passed on March 2, 2021, by the Pune district magistrate. It found “no material which would justify the inference that the activities indulged in by the petitioner were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”. The Supreme Court has held that “public order” is a far wider concept than “law and order”. “Public order is the even tempo of life of the community taking the country as a whole or even a specified locality,” it had said. Nilesh Ghaywal had been detained under the Maharashtra prevention of dangerous activities of slumlords, bootleggers, drug-offenders and dangerous persons Act (MPDA), 1981, on the grounds of committing crimes using deadly weapons and having “created a reign of terror in the jurisdiction of Koregaon Park (in Pune) and… Bhigwan police station (Pune rural area)”. His advocate Satyavrat Joshi cited another SC ruling to argue that “stray acts” are not subversive of public order. “Disturbance of public order is to be distinguished from acts directed against individuals which do not disturb society to the extent of causing a general disturbance of public tranquillity,” the SC had said in a 1970 judgment. Joshi also submitted that the authorities claimed to have recorded in-camera statements of two witnesses as “the persons were not willing to come forward due to fear of reprisal”. He argued that an FIR lodged against Ghaywal by a person alleging kidnapping and death threats and the two alleged confidential statements do not make out a case about disturbing public order. Joshi also pointed out Ghaywal had been granted pre-arrest bail in the kidnapping case. Additional public prosecutor M H Mhatre justified the detention in public interest and said the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority cannot be tested by the HC in its writ jurisdiction. The HC said an act by itself or its gravity is not the determining factor in disturbing of public order. “It is the propensity and potentiality of the act of disturbing the even tempo of life of the community that renders it prejudicial to the maintenance of public order,’’ said Justices Shinde and Jamadar. “It is trite that disorderly behavior of a person in public or commission of an offence is bound to affect the peace prevailing in the locality to some extent and may also bear upon law and order, but every such act of disorderly behavior or commission of offence does not necessarily jeopardise the maintenance of public order. This proposition governs the case at hand with full force,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-preventive-detention-cant-be-easy-substitute-to-deal-with-law-order-problems-rules-hc/articleshow/85992604.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Pune||App training of returning officers for society polls||Pune: An app developed by the Maharashtra State Housing Societies Federation will help train returning officers who will be appointed by the managing committees to conduct elections. The state government is soon expected to announce polls in cooperative housing societies with less than 250 members. “Earlier, these people had to be called to one place for training. Now, these members appointed by the committee can download the app, get training and be certified to conduct these elections,” Suhas Patwardhan, vice president of the federation, said. The app and the booklet cover all the rules and regulations and the member to be nominated by the society as the registrar can update himself/herself and get a certification to conduct the elections without any hurdle. “These members will have an idea about how to conduct these elections. Members from the cooperation department too would be there to help conduct these elections,” office-bearers for the federation said. Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had indicated that societies will be allowed to hold elections. The state government had earlier decided to postpone the elections till August 31 Officials from the department of cooperation said the orders were expected soon. “Societies can take forward many of the pending decisions. Redevelopment is a major issue that can be undertaken once the new body is elected,” Patwardhan added. A decision regarding elections in bigger cooperative housing societies too is pending and work has slowly commenced on readying voters’ lists for the process. “The new order will help housing societies that had put off their elections last year due to the pandemic,” Patwardhan added Many housing societies had raised several issues from budget sanctioning to renovation and several disputes had emerged because there was no new committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/app-training-of-returning-officers-for-society-polls/articleshow/85990400.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Bagul said the Metro bridge would obstruct the decorated floats of Ganesh mandals taking the bridge on the day of the immersion of the idols. “These decorations are usually 45ft high and may get stuck beneath the Metro viaduct that will be about 20ft above the bridge. A similar issue will be faced on Karve Road,” Bagul said. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) has started construction of a viaduct crossing the Lakdi bridge from above. The Ganesh mandals, during the immersion procession, travel on the Lakdi bridge towards Deccan Gymkhana after reaching the Alka Talkies Chowk. A MahaMetro official said some Ganesh Mandals had approached them on the issue and a meeting will be held with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporator-seeks-meeting-on-height-of-metro-viaduct/articleshow/85990390.cms||---

For mobilizing funds, the state government is misusing the police force in the state and the end result is that the police force is slapping fines for everything, he added. “Police are torturing and threatening innocent people to meet the target set by the government. The police are forced to collect the money in terms of petty fines from the common man,” claimed Satheesan after the UDF meeting on Monday. RSP satisfied after talks He said that there were no differences among the constituents in the UDF and all partners in the front have pledged their support to the new leadership in the Congress. Earlier in the day, Satheesan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran had a meeting with RSP leaders to settle the issues raised by the UDF’s constituent. RSP leaders had alleged that Congress leaders had played spoilsport during the last assembly election in seats contested by RSP candidates. Apart from this, RSP had also alleged that it was given the most-difficult seats. During discussions, the KPCC president assured that strict action will be taken against all leaders who had worked against UDF candidates. “Such leaders will not be given party posts after the revamp,” said Sudhakaran after the meeting. RSP state secretary AA Azeez said the party is satisfied with the discussion it had with Congress leaders and the leadership has assured that all the issues raised by them would be considered and resolved, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cops-slapping-fines-to-meet-govt-target-says-satheesan/articleshow/85990420.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||AAP faces dilemma in Punjab over CM face as Bhagwant Mann’s supporters get anxious||CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab is facing pressure from within to announce a chief ministerial face ahead of the assembly elections due in early 2022, with supporters of the party’s Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann demanding that he be declared the party candidate. Even though the party has distanced itself from reports of feelers being sent to prominent Sikh faces, mostly social welfare activists; it has, nevertheless, prompted Mann’s supporters to launch campaigns on the social media and also approach the party leadership in small groups to demand that Mann be announced as the CM candidate of the party. Party’s in-charge of Punjab affairs Jarnail Singh told TOI that there was still time for the next elections and the party will announce its chief ministerial face in due course of time. “The party plans to announce the CM face soon. We will be well in time and make an announcement when Congress does it. The volunteers may be expressing their opinion (about Mann), but the party will make the announcement at an appropriate time.” After keeping a low profile for some months, Mann has now launched a public contact programme in his constituency, in what is being seen as an attempt to showcase his popularity. Asked about the volunteers’ demand for his nomination, he said on Monday, “It is an internal matter of the party. We will abide by whatever decision is taken by the party. But at the same time, it is my right and that of the party workers to convey the sentiments of the people to the party. We will tell you in the coming days.” As he said this to the media, his supporters raised the slogan, “Sadda (our) CM, Bhagwant Mann.” Meanwhile, party insiders say that there are other aspirants for the top post in the state unit. “The narrative set by other parties for representation to Dalit leaders and women faces has given hope to other AAP leaders in Punjab. There are leaders who equally slogged in reaching out to people even during the Covid crisis and wish to lead the party. Mann is already an MP,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity. AAP’s central leadership faces a dilemma over Mann as he has been in the eye of controversy in the past. At a rally in Barnala in 2019, Bhagwant Mann had said that he won’t drink from then on and the party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal had termed it as a ‘sacrifice’ for the people. On August 27, the party’s co-incharge of Punjab affair Raghav Chadha tweeted to reject claims that he had got in touch with a Dubai-based businessman “to offer him any position or ticket.” Mann is currently the AAP Punjab president and was credited with holding back-to-back rallies for the party across the state ahead of the last assembly elections in 2017. The party had managed to win 20 of the 117 Assembly seats in the state. Later in 2019, he was the only party nominee to win a Lok Sabha seat in the state, retaining Sangrur for a second term. On Monday, a group of volunteers from Punjab landed at the party office in Chandigarh to demand that Mann be announced as the CM face. Jagmail Singh, who led the campaign, said indications that the party was in touch with some noted Sikh faces outside the party had made them anxious. “When we go to the people, they question why Mann’s picture is not on the party’s guarantee regarding free electricity. No leader met us today, but we have been asked to wait for two days,” he said. Party insiders believe that Mann would be keen on contesting the assembly elections from Maur constituency in Bathinda, if not Sangrur. During Kejriwal’s Punjab visit in June, he had announced that the party’s chief ministerial face for the assembly elections will be from the Sikh community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-faces-dilemma-over-cm-face-as-manns-supporters-get-anxious/articleshow/85990413.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||Kolkata||Aparna Sen’s ‘The Rapist’, Farooki’s ‘No Land’s Man’ in award race at Busan film fest||Kolkata: Aparna Sen’s ‘The Rapist’ and Mostofa Sarwar Farooki’s ‘No Land’s Man’ are among the seven nominees for the prestigious Kim Jiseok award at the 26th Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). The other films in competition for award are Wang Qi’s ‘The Bargain’, Ilgar Najaf’s ‘Sughra’s Sons’, Ogigami Naoko’s ‘Riverside Mukolitta’, Royston Tan’s ‘24’ and Brillante Mendoza’s ‘Gensan Punch’. The festival will be held between October 6 and 15. According to the BIFF website, Sen’s film narrates a story about an incident that completely disrupts the comfortable life of a couple, who are both professors and anti-death penalty activists. The 76-year-old director has made an insightful portrayal about the problems of gender, class, laws and institutions in India by capturing the devastating aftermath of the incident that the couple faced in the film. Sen’s ‘The Rapist’ stars Konkona Sen Sharma, Arjun Rampal and Tanmay Dhanania. According to Sen: “Apart from trying to explore the reasons why our society turns out rapists in such numbers, and looking into the inequalities in our social system that are responsible for giving rise to criminals, what drew me to this story was the psychology of the three protagonists.” Rabiranjan Maitra, who has edited the film in Kolkata, said shooting of the Hindi film ended in the first week of April in New Delhi. “Soon, lockdown was declared in various Indian cities. The only option to edit and send it to Busan on time was to complete the editing in Kolkata at Eskay Digilab,” he said. According to him, this film is about the social system of looking at the predator and the survivor. “It explores what happens to society when such an incident takes places. Perhaps for the first time, we have an Indian film trying to understand the psyche of a rapist and why he commits such a heinous crime,” he added. Meanwhile, Farooki is currently in Kolkata for the colour gradation of his film by Debojyoti Ghosh at EditFX. “I like to work with Debojyoti,” he told TOI. His film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Megan Mitchell, Tahsan Khan, Eisha Chopra, Kiran Khoje and Vikram Kochhar and has original music by AR Rahman. An English language film with some dialogues in Hindi, Urdu, French, and Bengali, it explores how a charismatic young man goes on an eventful quest to find a place he can call home. Speaking about the nomination, Farooki said: “We make films primarily because we feel increasingly agitated to tell the story. However, when it gets some recognition or love, it always feels good. It feels really good when it’s from Busan.” The film deals with discrimination and hate crimes based on race, religion, and nationality. Farooki was born in Noakhali. “People from this area have been heavily trolled for years. So, from a very early age, I came to realize that I will have to find ways to protect myself from being trolled!” he said. With time, he understood how these complexities “create a hole” in the heart when one can’t be “known”, “accepted” or “feel comfortable” as who one is. “Those childhood feelings informed the existential pain that the central character in ‘No Land’s Man’ feels,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/aparna-sens-the-rapist-farookis-no-mans-land-in-award-race-at-busan-film-fest/articleshow/85988026.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The woman approached the women’s police station in Lunawada and an offence was registered. Teni was out on bail in the murder case of his first wife. The woman claims that she was being harassed and beaten up by her husband, his two sisters and his nephew. The husband allegedly ran a gambling den and used to indulge in gambling. When the second wife objected to this, he used to harass her. The woman alleged that Teni’s sisters and his nephew, who used to stay with them, instigated Teni. Teni even threatened the woman that he had killed his first wife by throwing her into a canal and he would do the same with her. The complainant has claimed that on August 24 she rushed out of her house as she was being beaten, but Teni and others dragged her back to their house. Later that day she managed to escape when the others were not home. The victim went to her father’s home in Lunawada. It was here that she received the Whatsapp message when her father and another person were present with her.

While health teams at some places had to climb uphill for days to reach the beneficiaries, at other places, the teams had to face religious opposition. Snowfall and cold was a big challenge at higher regions and unavailability of internet and mobile connectivity was a problem at remote places. Despite all hurdles and problems, the state finally gave first dose of vaccine to the 18-plus population. “Health teams had to climb for 21 kms in inhospitable terrains to reach Shakti, Maror and Shugad villages in Great Himalayan National Park. The residents were given first dose at their home. The team had to carry meal and vaccines in backpacks. The efforts were made to give first dose only to 66 eligible people of Shakti and Maror villages which do not have road and mobile phone connectivity,” Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg said. Health teams at remote Malana village had to face religious opposition where residents do all the works after seeking permission from village deity through the oracles. Nirma Devi, asha worker from Malana village, while interacting with PM Modi informed him how residents were not coming forward to get the vaccine. Malana village, where even 60-plus population was not vaccinated, was given first dose last week after deputy commissioner visited the village to convince the residents. In tribal Spiti, where vaccination started very late due to long winter season, the residents were reluctant to vaccination due to many reasons, including misconceptions. Nawang Upasak, a monk from Shashur Gompa of Lahaul, told the PM how difficult it was to vaccinate residents due to misconceptions. Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said heath workers of the district had to work extra hard in view of rough terrains. “Initially, the vaccination process was little slow due to snow in the higher regions. Some people were hesitating in getting the vaccine. The religious heads of the monasteries came forward to get the vaccine and also motivated others to do the same. We had completed first dose to 18-plus population a long back,” he said. Similarly, health teams in Pangi valley of Chamba had to put extra effort to reach every single left beneficiary. In Kangra district, Bara Bhangal, which is known as remotest village of the country with no road connectivity, health teams reached beneficiaries with help of a chopper. There are many villages in the state which have no internet or phone connectivity. The health teams had difficulty in tracing, vaccinating and then updating the date on CoWin app. The teams kept manual data of these places and updated the information after reaching back to their stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-health-workers-fought-many-odds-to-achieve-100-1st-dose/articleshow/85990427.cms||---

Water was lifted from the Cantonment water works and tankers were pressed into service to reduce the residents’ hardships. “The fault had developed in the power supply on Saturday and disrupted the filling of overhead water tanks. The restoration work has been completed and supply resumed on Monday. Since the tanks were almost empty, it took some hours to fill the water in the tanks,” a PMC official said. Among the areas that faced water shortage were Janatanagar, Bhatnagar, Yeshvantnagar and Jijamatanagar. The residents said there was no water supply on Thursday last week. They faced water shortage again on Saturday and Sunday due to the fault. “We had sought tankers to meet the requirement of water on Sunday,” local resident Ramesh Chavan. The PMC since early this year has been supplying water from the Bhama Askhed project to the city’s eastern parts, such as Yerawada, Dhanori and Lohegaon, and areas like Vimannagar and Wadgaonsheri on Ahmednagar Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-fixes-water-disruption-snag/articleshow/85990434.cms||---

A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said the administration would hold a survey and demolish the illegal hoardings. “The PMC will issue advertisements, urging the agencies to get their hoardings legalised within a stipulated deadline. Those failing to comply with the order will face action,” PMC additional commissioner Kunal Khemnar said on Monday. The hoardings in these villages were under the jurisdiction of gram panchayats before the merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hoardings-in-merged-villages-under-scanner/articleshow/85990415.cms||---

She has been remanded in 14-day judicial custody. Arun More, a contractor from Mumbai, who is a co-accused in the case, has been remanded in police custody. Vishakha Ghadge, the state coordinator of the women’s development corporation, in the complainet alleged that Sharma-Munde and More had a scuffle with one of the protestors called Baby Tamboli and tried to stab Tamboli’s relative with a sharp-edged weapon. Based on this complaint, Sharma-Munde and More were booked and arrested by Parli police on an attempt to murder charge on Sunday. They were also slapped with sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. After being produced before the court, the lawyer representing Sharma -Munde contested that she is being framed in the case. While the prosecution read out the contents of the FIR of alleged attempt to murder and SC/ST atrocities. Beed SP R Raja told TOI: “In the attempt to murder and atrocities-related case, two people have been arrested. The woman accused (Sharma-Munde) has been remanded in judicial custody by the court, while the co-accused has been remanded in one-day police custody.” At the same time, on the complaint lodged by Sharma-Munde herself, people who obstructed her news conference and tried to manhandle her have been booked on the charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and disobeying orders duly promulgated by the authorities. However, the complainant has refused to sign the FIR. Raja said the police went by the law by accepting complaints from both sides. Based on the contents of the two complaints, FIRs were registered. “We cannot say why the FIR was not signed,” he said. Senior inspector Hemant Kadam added, “The complainant has signed the statement as well as the complaint. However, she has refused to sign the FIR. It is her discretion.” Driver booked under Arms Act; Video of woman allegedly keeping firearm in car probed Meanwhile, the Parli police have booked Karuna Sharma-Munde’s driver and arrested him under relevant sections of Indian Arms Act after a firearm was found in the car on Sunday. Police authorities have refused to comment on the allegations that the firearm was allegedly placed to frame the driver. Kadam said, “The pistol had a magazine, but there were no rounds in it. We have seized the firearm and arrested the driver.” Arrested accused, identified as Dilip Pandit (25), is from Andheri East in Mumbai. He was produced before the court, following which he has been remanded in one-day police custody. Police have reached out to the ballistic experts to ascertain if it was used to fire rounds or commit any other offence. However, police have started a parallel probe into a video depicting a masked woman allegedly placing a firearm wrapped in the car’s boot. The video shows the woman opening the boot — while a mob blocks the car’s way — and soon after placing an object inside, she closes the boot and flees. The video also shows a police officer trying to control a large crowd trying to approach Sharma-Munde’s car. Raja said, “We are trying to get eyewitness accounts.” He expressed confidence in unearthing the truth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/judicial-custody-for-woman-claiming-to-be-dhananjay-mundes-2nd-wife/articleshow/85995062.cms||Mohammed Akhef

In an eight-minute-long video, the man identified as Chirag Patel further said that the district had colleges for undergraduate and ITI courses but there are no employment opportunities despite that, so bootlegging was the only opportunity left. Patel is also heard saying that he will also seek permission from the district authorities to allow him to start the business.“There are four colleges and four ITIs in the entire district, but there is no guarantee of placement after that. If a person who has studied from ITI goes to a bigger city like Vadodara or Halol, the salary would be low, and the cost of living would be high, so the person has to return to Chhota Udepur and live a satisfactory life by doing petty labour work,” Patel said. He has completed his engineering from Vallabh Vidyanagar. He added that the government may talk about starting engineering colleges in the district. “But what is the use of it when people cannot get job within the district. Instead, the government should focus on attracting industries to the district, so the locals get employed,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/frustrated-without-job-collegian-bats-for-bootlegging/articleshow/85990479.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Mahapanchayat momentum will drive BJP out, say farmer leaders||MEERUT: The massive turnout at the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat of farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws, UP’s farmer leaders said, was a sign of political blowback for the government which would dent BJP’s prospects in the 2022 assembly elections. Farmer leaders had on Sunday announced their 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' to get BJP out of power in the two states going to the polls next year. While doing so, they told TOI, they will not be supporting any party but “exposing BJP”. “The massive participation of farmers from Punjab and Haryana, and the considerable representation from states like Rajasthan and Uttarakhand has galvanised UP’s farmers. The fire will spread in UP,” Gathwala Khap leader Bahawadi Shyam Singh, who presided over Sunday’s mahapanchayat, told TOI. “The farmer will now hurt BJP with his vote.” The farmer unions, which came under the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), are planning more mahapanchayats in the run-up to the polls. “Never before has a government been so rigid even when farmers suffered on the roads for nine months, through winter, summer and rains. Farmers are disturbed by this and that is why they turned up in such huge numbers on Sunday,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national general secretary Yudhvir Singh. Sunday’s gathering, they said, kicked off what they plan as a series of such meetings. “We are going to host mahapanchayats across UP. It is high time ... especially with elections round the corner in India’s biggest state,” said SKM leader Jagmohan Singh, a Punjab-based farmer. “We received a rousing welcome in UP. People opened up their homes, caste and religion were put aside. This is the kind of unity we saw in a city that was once hit by one of the worst communal riots in the country a few years ago.” While they plan on shaping political opinion, they do not intend to endorse any political party. “Our fight is against governments where BJP is in power,” said Singh. “But we are not going to support any political party. We will only expose BJP … We had gone to West Bengal as well. We did not support Mamata Banerjee but showed BJP up. We are going to do the same here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mahapanchayat-momentum-will-drive-bjp-out-up-farmer-leaders/articleshow/85985756.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ganesh mandals shrink size of idols, expand health drives||MUMBAI: Age-old Ganpati mandals that have earned a reputation for large idols amid grand settings, are putting the final touches to their downsized moortis in the run-up to Ganeshotsav, which starts Friday. A few organisers, including Lalbaugcha Raja and GSB Wadala, which had called off festivities in Covid 2020, have now adapted to the new reality and resumed with small idols. Ganesh Gully in Lalbaug, Tilak Nagar Chembur and Akhil Chandanwadi, Marine Lines, have designed beautiful 4ft moortis with basic decoration. They will eschew large aagman and visarjan processions. Online darshan is arranged for devotees and no prasad shall be distributed. The 102-year-old Chinchpokli Cha Chintamani will worship the silver sculpture in its office, like it did in 2020. This is the oldest mandal of the Lalbaug-Parel belt and famous for creative large idols and grand palace or temple sets. The 94-year-old Lalbaug Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav of Ganesh Gully will unveil its idol on the morning of Ganesh Chaturthi. Secretary Swapnil Parab said they are focussing on medical and health programmes rather than full festivity. Sahyadri Krida Mandal’s festival in Tilak Nagar, Chembur, is celebrating its 46th Ganeshotsav. “Last year, we organised the utsav in our office at Vrindavan Society, instead of our usual venue of Gol Maidan. Our idol’s size was 4ft and we followed all government directions,” said Jaya Shetty, mandal vice-president. “This year too, our moorti is just 4ft in height and we are not seeking any donation from residents... We plan to organise a blood donation camp.” Sahyadri’s idol will be immersed in a floral bedecked artificial pond that has been created on site. Over in Marine Lines, the Akhil Chandanwadi Ganpati mandal, led by Shiv Sena leader Pandurang Sakpal, has been known for its supersized moortis averaging 15-20 ft. “This year we will install a picturesque 4 ft idol. We have concentrated our efforts on health welfare programmes by arranging for free check-ups for children at SRCC Hospital, Mahalaxmi. We have also conducted eye camps. Our south Mumbai Sena vibhag has vaccinated 25,000 people free of cost already and the next round is scheduled September 16-17,” Sakpal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ganesh-mandals-shrink-size-of-idols-expand-health-drives/articleshow/85992652.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Kolkata||Strand Road opened for vehicles, restrictions on truck movement yet to be lifted||Kolkata: Almost three months after a 250 metre stretch of Strand Road North was shut for the demolition work of Posta flyover, the Kolkata Traffic police reopened the entire stretch temporarily on Monday. This meant vehicles - including route buses - took the stretch lying between Mirbarai Ghat Street Crossing- KK Tagore Street Crossing on Strand Road for the first time since June earlier this year. Even loaded pedal vans have been allowed back and has been asked to stick to the extreme left lane. However, trucks - the mainstay of the area - will not be allowed on this particular stretch as yet. The KMDA and KMC are likely to inspect the road restored by the KMC and submit a final report after which KMDA will officially hand back the road to Kolkata Police. "We will then decide on allowing trucks. Till then, we are allowing private vehicles and buses," said an officer from Howrah Bridge Traffic guard. The KMC engineers said that almost 90 percent of restoration work - including setting up of lamp posts - is now over. "A few lamp posts will be set up as quickly as possible. Work on the road surface is left in just a couple of spots. We are trying to complete the entire work in the next few days. Given that the rains played a crucial role, we have been able to make the road vehicle ready in quick time," said an official. Cops said they were "literally forced" to seek the nod from higher ups to allow restricted movement of vehicles. "With Ganesh Puja this week heralding the beginning of the festive season, Burrabazar is witnessing a huge surge in footfall and business. MG Road was unable to handle all the extra pressure anymore," said an officer at Lalbazar. Earlier, the Kolkata traffic police officers have met both the KMDA appointed agency officials and KMC road department officials in the past two days and the agencies have even jointly inspected the Strand Road. The cops had provided evidence on why this stretch has become uneven - certain places where equipment was set up during the demolition work has been the worst affected - and deep craters have resulted due to the rains. Traffic cops have opinionated that running loaded trucks on such a stretch will invite accidents and frequent breaking down of the axle rod. The cops have also pointed out that at least 20 odd street light posts - that were previously in working condition - have been uprooted for the work along with multiple CCTV cameras fixed to these posts. The KMC said it has worked on all these aspects. "The road has been levelled and the average speed is higher than on normal days as truck movement is not taking place," said a KMC official. The police said they will also finish setting up the CCTV cameras by the end of this week. Such has been the pressure that Kolkata Traffic Police have requested KMC to finish the levelling work and allow vehicles to ply. "We have proposed that they finish the pitch laying work at night when we will divert the vehicles for them,"said an officer. The police said it will take half a day to reset the traffic signal system in the street once KMDA officially hands over the road stretch to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strand-road-opened-for-vehicles-restrictions-on-truck-movement-yet-to-be-lifted/articleshow/85988131.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chandigarh||HC stays former MLA’s conviction in paddy scam case||Chandigarh: In a major relief to former Punjab MLA Mangat Rai, who was convicted by special CBI court Patiala in paddy scam, the Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed his conviction in the case. Rai was sentenced to seven year imprisonment in the paddy scam in which the CBI had registered a case on the directions of the HC. “Though no final order has been passed by the high court qua Hemant Gopal, additional district and sessions judge, who is continuing under suspension for the last around four years yet prima facie, his indictment as per the enquiry report is apparent on record, therefore, this application is allowed, the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence shall remain stayed during the pendency of the appeal and will have no adverse effect on the civil rights of the applicant/appellant, who intends to contest the forthcoming elections of Punjab State Legislative Assembly in February, 2022,” the HC has observed in its order released on Monday. HC passed these orders after hearing an application filed by Rai for staying the operation of his conviction in the rice embezzlement scam. The frmer MLA was convicted on April 20, 2013, by special CBI court, Patiala. At the time the Punjab judicial services officer, Hemant Gopal was presiding officer of the CBI court that convicted him. In his plea seeking stay on conviction, Rai has contended that Gopal, who had passed the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence, is found guilty of grave misconduct by the Enquiry Officer-cum-District & Sessions Judge, Panchkula, vide enquiry report dated March 31, 2018. His counsel further argued that it is an established fact that the presiding judge (Hemant) had accepted illegal gratification of Rs 40 lakh from co-accused Parminder and demanded Rs one crore from the present applicant-appellant and others. However, Parminder was acquitted as he had paid the Rs 40 lakh gratification money, whereas the applicant-appellant and other accused were convicted as they did not pay any amount to him,” Rai’s counsel argued while seeking stay on his conviction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-stays-former-mlas-conviction-in-paddy-scam-case/articleshow/85990443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Mayawati to share strategy for Uttar Pradesh polls with cadre today||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati is likely to spell out the strategy for the upcoming state assembly elections at the party’s last Prabudh Sammelan in Lucknow on Tuesday. The programme named ‘Vichar Sangosthi’ would be held at the 12 Mall Avenue BSP headquarters from 11am. “Behan Mayawati would be chief guest of the programme,” said BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Misra. It would be the first public presence of Mayawati, who had restricted herself to social media or gave bytes to electronic media and news agencies. BSP supporters, primarily Brahmins, from across the state would be attending the event. BSP general secretary S C Mishra started holding Prabuddh Sammelans from Ayodhya in the first week of July and has addressed gatherings in 74 districts. BSP held Prabuddh Sammelans across the state in five phases. At the ‘Vichar Sangoshthi’ on Tuesday, focus would be on the honour, progress and security of intellectuals, most of whom are from the Brahmin community, a BSP leader told TOI. BSP had launched Prabudh Sammelans in the state ahead of polls to woo upper castes, especially Brahmins in a bid to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at Centre and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in UP. Interestingly, chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ had reverberated at the sammelan in Ayodhya on July 23, while Mishra had offered prayers at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi before addressing the event. In the second phase, Mishra offered prayers at Mathura and Vrindavan, the abodes of Lord Krishna. Mishra offered prayers at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in the third phase and then at Chitrakoot Dham in the fourth one, reflecting a sea change in BSP strategy. In a recent interview to TOI, Mishra even went on to clarify that there were no restrictions on party leaders from offering prayers at temples and performing pujas. He even made clear that Mayawati used the term ‘Manuwadi’ for those who draw a line between upper and lower castes. Mishra covered all the districts by September 3, while the event at Lucknow was earmarked for BSP supremo’s address. A senior BSP leader requesting anonymity said Mayawati would send a strong signal to party cadre and would share the strategy to be adopted in the run up to UP assembly polls in 2022. “Our aim is to ensure that our supreme leader Behen Mayawati becomes the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the record fifth time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-to-share-strategy-for-state-polls-with-cadre-today/articleshow/85992645.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Stadiums linked to three CMs out of race to Paris||Bathinda: After its best-ever Olympic campaign in Tokyo, the country wants more medals at Paris in three years but its rural stadiums, even those in the villages of sporting powerhouse Punjab’s successive chief ministers, don’t look like they can produce winners. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s ancestral village of Mehraj is one of the biggest in its area. Its population exceeds 22,000 and the smaller villages could use its multipurpose stadium if a worn-out athletics track, poor infrastructure, and the absence of coaches weren’t a reality. Former nagar panchayat president Harinder Singh said: “We built the stadium, laid its tracks, and covered both seating area and the change rooms but the track has fallen into disuse for want of upkeep and coaches.” Social worker Balwant Singh of Mehraj’s Lok Sangram Manch said: “The big stadium has small infrastructure. A lot many games can be promoted from the CM’s own village, and we can produce players who can represent the state and the country, only if we improve the shape of our stadium. It will also help the state shed the dubious tag of Udta Punjab.” Villager Gurtej Singh said: When Captain Amarinder Singh became CM for the second time in 2017, we had high hopes that he will spruce up the village stadium.” A couple of young players, not wanting to be named, described how they had to travel 40 kilometres to Bathinda to train despite having a stadium at their village. Likewise, Dhaula, the native village of former CM Surjit Singh Barnala, has a nominal statium with a general-purpose ground. “Its small stage is cleaned one or twice a year during the rural games,” said villager Gursewak Singh. Its players have to travel 12 km to Barnala for training. A school-like playground can’t produce international champions, rue the villagers. Compared with Mehraj and Dhaula, former CM Parkash Singh Badal’s native village, Badal, has a lot better multipurpose stadium with a hockey Astroturf, a national-level shooting range, and a Sports Authority of India (SAI) training centre. Badal is just 60 km from Mehraj. When the government changed in 2017, the sporting facilities at Badal also stopped being maintained. Minister speaks Punjab revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar, under whose constituency Mehraj falls, said: “We want to make Mehraj stadium a hub of sporting facilities in the area. There is a proposal to start some academy here. The project is estimated to cost over Rs 10 crore and we hope to start the work soon.” The stadium then would be the best in the entire area, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/stadiums-linked-to-three-cms-out-of-race-to-paris/articleshow/85990490.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nagpur||WCL unions irked over Mahakali mine closure, stop coal dispatch||Chandrapur: Three Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) unions have joined hands and started protests against the decision of WCL Chandrapur management to close down the Mahakali underground (UG) coal mine located in the city. The office bearers of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) rebuffed management’s claims of the mine being unsafe as reason for closure and charged that the mine had been closed following rising per ton losses of coal and to cover up corruption in transfer. Senior CITU leader G Ramanna claimed that the Mahakali UG mine has coal reserve of 5.8 million metric tons of coal and can continue production for at least the next 30 years. However, management closed the mine suddenly from September 2, citing the safety reasons without taking the unions in confidence. “A team of union leaders surveyed the mine and found no safety lacuna. Officials from the directorate general of mines safety (DGMS) neither conducted any safety survey nor submitted any report of safety lapses in the mine, which is mandatory in case of closure of any mine for safety reasons. Procedural section 22 was also not invoked for closure of mine,” said Ramanna. INTUC leader Chandrama Yadav claimed that the delegation of union leaders met the area general manager (AGM) Muhammad Sabir and sought the report of DGMS for mine closure, but Sabir did not present it. Instead, he told the union leaders that the mine was being closed following oral orders from Manoj Kumar, the chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) of WCL. “When the union leaders met Kumar, he gave evasive answers,” Yadav added. Yadav said that as many as 377 labourers from Mana, Durgapur Rayyatwari, Mahakali and Nandgaon UG mines have been transferred out to open cast between January 2020 and March 2021. Out of these, 150 workers are from Mahakali UG mine. Now that the mine has closed, management has served notices to workers, stating that they are being transferred to other UG mines. “They have plans to gradually close down two more UG mines in Nandgaon and Durgapur Rayyatwari Collieries (DRC) and shift all the workers to WCL mines in Pathakheda where new projects are coming up,” Yadav charged. The three unions have served notice to the management, started gate meetings and have gradually closed the dispatch of coal for one day each at four different mines between September 3 and 6. “Our agitation will continue till September 15. If the management does not agree to our demand and restart the Mahakali UG mine, we will close down all 10 coal mines in Chandrapur indefinitely from September 16,” said BMS leader Vivek Satpute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wcl-unions-irked-over-mahakali-mine-closure-stop-coal-dispatch/articleshow/85985795.cms||Mazhar Ali

Each ULB will get Rs 1 crore as per the announcement made by chief minister Basavaraj Bommai during the Independence Day celebrations. Under the scheme, the government has selected over 75 cities and towns that have achieved below 25% pogress in the areas of SWM, disposal, processing and recycling. As per the directorate of municipal administration, Chamarjanagar has achieved 9.69% progress in these areas, Kollegal 15.24% and Hanur TP 17.5%.Dealing with wastes like municipal solid waste of the following types has become a biggest challenge for ULBs: garbage generated from households, offices, hotels, shops, schools and other institutions like food waste, paper, plastic, rags, metal and glass, demolition/ construction debris, including hazardous waste like electric light bulbs, batteries, automotive parts and discarded medicines and chemicals.“The ULBs can make use of funds for waste segregation (into dry and wet waste), to buy tools, machines and equipment for effective SWM, civil works, building road for waste treatment plant, compound wall for such plants, construction of public toilets, to buy motors to pump water, sucking machines, uniform for civic workers, glouse, other protection and safety kits, sewage water treatment, improvement of greenery,” said R Murthy, chief administrative officer of Hanur TP.Chamarajanagar Urban Development Planning director J Suresh said that selection of the three ULBs helps in improving cleanliness, greenery and beautification. “As the state government has approved this project with some conditions, the ULBs can utilise the funds excluding the works taken up under ongoing Swachh Bhrath Mission and Nagorattana Scheme. It must list out the works to be taken up under Amruth Nirmala Nagara Yojana separately,” he said.For effective implementation of the scheme, the government has constituted a district-level task force headed by the DC, the district urban development planning cell director, its executive engineer, and the chief administrative officers of the three ULBs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/three-ulbs-in-cnagar-will-get-funds-to-address-civic-issues/articleshow/85985791.cms||---

The Met department has forecast light rain on Tuesday and very light rain on Wednesday. “However, the rain activity is likely to intensify from Thursday and a ‘yellow’ alert is in place from Thursday to Sunday. Light-to-moderate rain is predicted on Thursday while moderate showers are likely on Friday and Saturday. Light rain is expected on Sunday,” said an official. According to IMD, the “green” alert means no warning, yellow means be aware, “orange” means be prepared and the “red” warning means maximum vigil. The maximum temperature was recorded at 36.2 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal, while the minimum settled at 27.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 92% and 57%. The forecast says the maximum temperature may dip to 31-32 degrees Celsius over the weekend. Safdarjung is currently placed in the excess category as it has received 232mm rainfall in September after two heavy showers in the first two days. The normal mark for the entire month is 125.1mm. In September 2020, Safdarjung recorded a deficit of 84% as it had received just 20.9mm rainfall. Meanwhile, the overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 122 on Monday as against 88 on Sunday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “Delhi’s AQI is in the ‘moderate’ category with lead pollutant PM10 as predicted by SAFAR due to stagnant condition arising from the anti-cyclonic condition — merging of wind from southwest and east sides of Delhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parts-of-delhi-see-light-rain-expect-more-from-thursday/articleshow/85990531.cms||---

Sources said that the bomb threat was received over two weeks ago and police have made sure that there was no actual bomb as the mailer threatened. Although the threat seems to be a hoax, a senior police officer said that they have not formally reached that conclusion yet and a probe was on. An officer said that the mailer has even demanded bitcoins as a payoff. “He has threatened to put bombs not only in the shipyard but other vital installations as well. He has demanded money in his mails,” said a senior officer. South police have registered an FIR under relevant sections of the IT Act for cyber terrorism and Section 384 of the IPC for extortion. City police have sought the assistance of the Cyberdome to track down the mailer. Sources said that on August 24, emails with the threat of a bomb blast were received by at least five officials of the shipyard. The threat was repeated as another set of emails were received by officials last week. Police said that the security has been increased for the past few days after the mails were received. Police conducted a thorough sweep with the assistance of the bomb squad and dog squad and no explosives were found. Coastal police had also deployed a boat for patrolling the lake near the shipyard. The coastal police have been conducting night patrolling to find any possible suspicious developments, sources said. More CISF persons have been deployed following the threat and checking of luggage and vehicle checking and body frisking are being carried out at the entry gates of the shipyard, sources said. Sources said that the emails seem to have been sent from a bogus id. Officials with the cyberdome and cyber cell are trying to track down the IP address from which the emails was sent. Possibility of a cyber attack is also being probed. Police also suspect the involvement of someone who has worked at the shipyard behind the incident. Sources said that the contents of the mail also suggest this. Around two months ago, South police had arrested an Afghanistan national who was working under a contractor at the shipyard using fake documents. In 2019, over 10 computer components of the IAC were found stolen while under construction at CSL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bomb-threat-security-beefed-up-in-kochi/articleshow/85990569.cms||---

The studio initially became known for being one of the first ones to produce action movies, with “J.B.H” also being credited for the introduction of Mary Ann Evans, an Australian actress and stuntwoman, in the Indian film industry. Her stage name, Fearless Nadia, created ripples in Indian cinema. Despite the short life of the Wadia Movietone studios — it was bought out by filmmaker V Shantaram — where he set up the Rajkamal Studios. Evans would later marry Homi Wadia, with the latter going on to set up his own studio, Basant Pictures, until he retired from filmmaking in the early 1980s following a labour dispute. Homi died in 2004, aged 93, while “J.B.H.” breathed his last in 1986. Riyad, who was openly gay and made critically acclaimed films and documentaries,, died in 2003, aged 36. Fearless Nadia, who passed away in 1996 at the age of 88, and the history of the studios would also play a part in the revival of the Wadia family brand in films. “Fearless Nadia will be an important part of the auction,” Chatterjee added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/material-from-wadia-film-stable-to-go-under-hammer/articleshow/85990516.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The latest showers, including very heavy rain in some areas, have increased the combined live storage capacity of the 11 major dams in Marathwada along with key barrages to 185 TMC as compared to 159 TMC stock during the corresponding period last year. With no inflow still from upstream areas of Nashik and Ahmednagar, Jayakwadi major irrigation project, which has a huge designed live storage of over 76 TMC, was showing 46% live stock with receipt of 551 mm rainfall in its catchment since June 1. The water resources department (WRD) authorities said the overall situation of different dams from Marathwada was satisfactory to the extent of fulfilling drinking water needs in several areas till next monsoon. “The overflowing Majalgaon dam that supplies water to Beed and other areas is a sight to behold as the reservoir has been filled to the brim much before Jayakwadi and other key dams from the region.The dams supplying water to other scarcity-prone areas such as Latur and Osmanabad districts were also holding substantial storage by virtue of the latest showers,” a senior WRD official said. Manjra dam that caters drinking water needs of Latur was showing 38% storage, which is considered as substantial going by the average past storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/heavy-rain-in-marathwada-helps-revive-majalgaon-other-dams-in-region/articleshow/85995065.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Visitors throng Kaas; plateau yet to be in full bloom||Kolhapur: Tourist footfall at Kaas plateau, a Unesco World Heritage Site and a biodiversity hotspot, has increased with the start of the flower festival that will continue till October 15. Vast stretches of colourful flowers surrounded by fog-covered hills and spells of misty rain make Kaas a must-visit place during the flowering season. Hiowever, though the festival started on August 24 this year, and tourists from Mumbai, Pune, Sangli and Kolhapur areas have started streaming in, especially on the weekends, the flowering is yet to peak. Maruti Chikane, a member of the Kaas Pathar Samiti, said, “This weekend, almost 5,000 tourists visited the plateau. On the weekdays, we get about 500 to 600 visitors. There are more than 850 varieties of flowering plants here. Of them, 39 species are found only here on the plateau. These flowers have started blooming. Every 15 to 20 days, the colour of the plateau changes according to the flowers in full bloom.” Most visitors, however, were not too happy with the booking charges given that most flowers are yet to bloom. Vaibhav Raut, an engineer from Satara, said, “We visited the Kaas plateau on the weekend and were not pleased. Even the locals are being charged Rs 100 per head despite the fact that the flowering has been low when compared to other years. If we, as locals, are feeling disappointed, then what would the visitors coming from far away places feel?” Some blame the caging of the plateau for fewer flowers being in bloom. Umakant Chavan, an environmentalist, said, “As the plateau has been encircled by iron fencing, grazing activity has come to an end. As a result, seed dispersion is not taking place properly. Also, animal dung acts as a fertilizer for these plants. This too has been affected. Yes, people should not be allowed to trample the plants here, but grazing animals should be allowed in to conserve the floral species.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/visitors-throng-kaas-plateau-yet-to-be-in-full-bloom/articleshow/85995066.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Of the five teams formed to hold further investigation of the Kodanad heist, one each will reinvestigate the FIRs on Kanagaraj’s death in a road accident in Salem district on April 28, 2017, the car crash death of Sayan’s family on April 29, 2017, and the apparent suicide of Dhinesh Kumar at his house on July 3, 2017. “The remaining two teams would concentrate on reinvestigating the prosecution witnesses and other suspected persons in connection with the main murder-burglary case at the Kodanad estate,” sources told TOI. On Monday, however, police questioned Shaji of Thrissur in Kerala for about five hours at the old SP office in Ooty. The inquiry which began at 10.15am, went on till 3.30pm. Shaji is the uncle of Jithin Joy (Accused-10). Earlier, Shaji was shown as prosecution witness (PW) 36 of the 103 witnesses identified in connection with the case by police. However, after 62 witnesses were dispensed with, he became PW23 of the 41 witnesses prosecuted earlier. He was summoned by police to appear before the special investigation team headed by additional superintendent of police Krishnamurthy for re-investigation on Monday. Five special teams have been formed by the Nilgiris police to reinvestigate the case. As part of the further investigation, so far, police have inquired Dhanabal, brother of Kanagaraj, and Natarajan (PW5), manager of Kodanad estate. Earlier, Natarajan’s name appeared in the dispensed list of witnesses and hence he was not prosecuted then. Kanagaraj’s wife and his brother-in-law were questioned by police in Coimbatore last Saturday. Meanwhile, a drone found hovering above the Kodanad bungalow, factory and office created a flutter in the area. Radhakrishnan, supervisor of the estate, lodged a complaint with the Sholurmattam police station in this connection. Sub-inspector Mohamaed Rafeeq conducted an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kodanad-police-to-re-investigate-cases-of-accident-suicide/articleshow/85990545.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: Will continue legal fight to execute Mekedatu project, says minister Govind Karjol||HASSAN: Water resources minister Govind Karjol on Monday reiterated the Karnataka government’s stand on the Mekedatu project, and said that they would continue the legal fight against Tamil Nadu. “The project is aimed at supplying drinking water, and it is not for irrigation,” said Karjol, who was in Hassan to review the status of various irrigation projects in the district. Accusing the Tamil Nadu government of politicising the Mekedatu project, the minister said, “We are ensuring that the neighbouring state receives its rightful proportion of water. They have moved the court for no reason. But we will fight the issue legally and implement the project.” Reacting to the results of the civic polls in Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi, Karjol said, “We have obtained the majority in Belagavi, where we have proven our strength, and the people of the twin cities have also expressed their support for the BJP. We may have miscalculated slightly in Kalaburagi. But we will certainly retain power in the assembly after the 2023 elections.” Karjol visited the site of the water lifting unit for the Yettinahole project in Heggade in Sakleshpur taluk. “The delay in the completion of the project is owing to the difficulties in acquisition of forest land. We will expedite the process. Farmers parting with their land in some places have moved court seeking higher compensation. We have ensured supply of electricity for the first phase of the project, and this will be tested within a month,” he said. The cost of the Yettinahole project, when it was first envisaged in 2012 was Rs 8,300 crore. But the delay has resulted in the project cost spiralling up to Rs 12,000 crore, Karjol said. Arasikere MLA KM Shivalinge Gowda, Belur MLA KS Lingesh and MLC MA Gopalswamy were among those who accompanied the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/will-continue-legal-fight-to-execute-mekedatu-project-says-karjol/articleshow/85985818.cms||---

A 19-year-old youth from a hamlet in Mulegaon Tanda destroyed the illicit liquor den that was run and operated by him and his father for several years. The youth told the police that he does not want any case against him. His father has multiple cases against him for running illicit liquor den. His father is admitted to a hospital for cancer treatment and the youth, along with his mother, had continued the illegal business. After learning that the police are going to crack down on illicit liquor dens and had assured of rehabilitation of those who wanted a way out, the youth himself took a decision to destroy the den. Solapur rural’s superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute launched the first one-of-its-kind Operation Parivartan, not only to completely eradicate the illegal dens, but also to rehabilitate and provide relief to those involved in it. “The youth who destroyed the illegal illicit liquor den had family troubles related to farms owned by his father and therefore they had to take up the illegal business. Also his father is a cancer patient and the family requires money for his treatment. We have assured the youth and his mother that we will resolve the dispute regarding farmland and also ensure the family gets financial support to continue the treatment. We found many such grievances of those who run such liquor dens. We found children, women and elderly people engaged in this business. Through the initiative we are going to bring them out of the illegal business,” Satpute said.  A survey was carried out to find the hotspot villages where these dens are operated in large number. There are 71 such hotspots where action was taken previously, but the dens came up again after few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/operation-parivartan-starts-showing-results-in-solapur/articleshow/85995074.cms||---

Teachers have also been advised to get both doses at the earliest. The university will open for practical and laboratory classes from September 15 for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students. In the order issued on Monday, Vikas Gupta, registrar, DU, said, “The teaching and non-teaching staff of the colleges/ departments/ centres must receive both doses of Covid-19 vaccine(s) at the earliest. It is further advised that all the students entering the college/ department/ university receive at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. However, for hostel residents, although both doses of Covid-19 vaccines are essential, it should be ensured that the residents have at least one dose of vaccine.” The libraries also reopened on Monday. “If sitting arrangements are not adequate for following the Covid SOPs, the libraries may at least allow the issuing of books to the students on a regular basis,” the registrar’s order said. “The college/ departments/ centres may also consider giving prior date-time-slot appointments to the students before allowing them to visit the library to avoid overcrowding.” In the meanwhile, all UG and PG theory classes will continue online. “For the practical classes, a maximum 50% of the working capacity of the classroom or laboratory to be allowed following principles of rotation,” instructed the order. “Only a limited number of experiments, exercises may be selected that are considered essential or important in that semester. Students’ physical presence may be optional and left to them to decide. Since the physical entry of students is voluntary, attendance of the students shall not be compulsory.” Final year students, however, may be allowed to come to the campus for academic consultation and placement purposes, as decided by the head of the institution. It has to be ensured though that no more than 50% of the sitting capacity of a room is filled at any point in time. In case, morning and evening colleges share a common premises, the principals of both the colleges are to work out an appropriate timetable and to share the resources optimally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-need-at-least-1-vax-dose-to-enter-du/articleshow/85990643.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Protest mounts against new mode of selecting asst profs||Thiruvananthapuram: Protest is mounting against the new mode of selection of candidates to the post of assistant professor in universities and affiliated colleges in Kerala. It has been alleged that the new selection norms adopted by the state universities under the guise of following the new set of changes proposed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) would pave way for large-scale corruption and erosion of academic standards. According to the provisions in the UGC regulations 2018, selection of candidates to the post of assistant professor should be carried out based on their performance in the interview. Supporters of the new the UGC norms point out that the unprecedented weightage to interviews would help the selectors to choose the right candidate candidates who possess exemplary teaching skills and academic prowess. Calicut, Sanskrit, Kannur, Malayalam, Cusat and Kerala University have adopted different norms for selection of new assistant professor posts. While Kerala University and Cusat have decided to invite 10 best candidates for the interview to each single post, Calicut University has decided to invite 20 candidates for the interview. Kannur University will be inviting all eligible candidates for the interview whereas MG University has decided to give 100 marks to the academic score of the candidates and maximum 20 marks for interview. The Kerala University syndicate, which recently adopted the UGC norms for selection of assistant professors, did so by overruling the serious concerns expressed by the university academic council. The academic council had recommended the university to invite only top five candidates for the interview. But the university syndicate decided to invite 10 candidates and let aided colleges to invite any number of candidates they deem fit for the interview. “There is no doubt that the selection process would not be transparent when the selection is totally dependent on the marks scored by candidates in the interview. Academic quality of the candidates would take a back seat and managements and politicians would misuse the chance to choose candidates on the basis of their interview score,” said Save Education Campaign Committee chairman R S Sasikumar. He said the decision of some universities to record the interview of candidates is unlikely to ensure transparency as universities are not even ready to share the interview score when it is asked under provisions of the RTI Act. All Kerala Private College Teachers Association general secretary C Padmanabhan said the association was concerned about possible misuse of UGC norms in candidate selection. “Even as we adopt the UGC norms, nothing prevents the universities and college managements from establishing a mechanism wherein the teaching skills and academic quality of the candidates can be ascertained,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/protest-mounts-against-new-mode-of-selecting-asst-profs/articleshow/85990642.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Ludhiana||LIT Auctions: BJP seeks CBI probe as other opponents raise questions||Ludhiana: Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) chairman Raman Balasubramanium and deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma have locked horns over the process of auction of five acres land in Model Town and Dugri Road junction, trying to shift the blame on to the other, the opposition party leaders have lapped up the issue and are seeking a probe into what they are describing a ‘big scam’. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought a CBI probe and a high-level vigilance inquiry, dubbing the auction as multi-crore scam of prime commercial property. And now with the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders too raising questions, the auctions have become a major political issue. Earlier in the day, a delegation led by Sardar Vineet Pal Singh Monga, BJP leader from Ludhiana west constituency and Punjab state secretar of Pradhan Mantri Jankalyankari Yojna Prachar Prasar Abhiyan, sat on a protest outside deputy commissioner’s office and handed over a memorandum to him. While seeking probe, Monga alleged that the LIT in “tacit connivance” with land mafia and caused loss to the tune of crores of rupees to the government, as land with market worth of Rs 350 crore was auctioned for just Rs 98 crore, causing loss of Rs 252 crore to the public exchequer. Notably, soon after questions were raised over the auction, LIT chairman Balasubramanium had claimed that rates of property were not fixed by him, but by a committee under the DC that fixed these rates. He had mentioned that since the area being auctioned was part of the scheme, so a chunk land was not mentioned separately in the agenda of meeting and Model Town extension scheme was mentioned in it. However, the DC claimed that there was a need to mention such chunk even if it was part of the scheme. On August 16, 29 properties of LIT were auctioned for Rs 129 crore, out of which prime land measuring 16,344 square yards was auctioned at Rs 98 crore whereas it is being alleged that market value of the land is around Rs 350 crore. He refuted allegations of any wrong doing into the matter. DC Varinder Sharma, meanwhile, maintained that chunk needs to be mentioned if it is up for auction even as it is part of a scheme. He indicated that in application it is not mentioned that a big chunk of 4 acres, land is to be alienated. The DC did not respond to other allegations, but former officials in the know of the process maintained that all plots in a scheme are not of same rate so prices for each chunk are to be fixed. Former chairman of LIT, Subhash Verma, who headed the trust in 2016 said landmark and dimension of the land is to be mentioned in the agenda. He added that though during his tenure there was no such committee. “Model town extension is a big area and only after they give plot number of property can it be auctioned,” said the former chairman. “DC has said it was not on agenda. Why is he not filing criminal complaint, obviously there is political pressure stopping him from taking action. This is a very big scam. We demand that the probe be done by the central agency. If we come to power, we will not allow such loot of public property,” said AAP spokesperson Ahbab Grewal. “We have brought it to the notice of the high command and very soon we will file a complaint with vigilance department about it,” said SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lit-auctions-bjp-seeks-cbi-probe-as-other-opponents-raise-questions/articleshow/85990602.cms||Shariq Majeed

Somaiya visited several properties that he claimed are owned by Kharmate. The officer is under the scanner of Enforcement Directorate (ED) over money laundering complaints. Last year, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had written to then chief secretary Sanjay Kumar over the alleged harassment of transporters by Kharmate at the checkposts in Nagpur. Kharmate had denied the charges and said everything will be crystal clear after a probe. “We have found properties worth Rs 750 crore that have been amassed by Kharmate. The money in these properties has been invested by Parab. I demand the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and income-tax department to investigate the matter. I am sure Parab will go to jail in this case.” Somaiya visited a farm house being built in Vanjarwadi in Tasgaon tehsil of Sangli district which he claims is worth around Rs 20 crore. Somaiya said Kharmate has properties at several places across Sangli district, including a 120 acre land and an industry on 5-acre land in industrial zone. “How can an officer with the RTO have such properties. I came here to see whether such properties in the name of Kharmate exists or not,” said Somaiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/somaiya-visits-alleged-properties-owned-by-rto-officer-kharmate/articleshow/85995084.cms||---

Many children are said to be down with viral fevers, mainly typhoid, which is forcing them to stay away from schools and colleges after attending classes for a couple of days or so. Teachers and principals said that while there is not much of a difference in attendance percentage recorded every day, they are seeing new students each day as those who attended school in the first couple of days are taking a break citing health reasons. “In the last one week, at least 20 students from my college said that they are down with fever, dengue or typhoid,” said KS Rama Rao, principal of a government junior college and president of Telangana Government Junior Colleges Principals Association. He said that the situation is more or less the same in almost all junior colleges in the state as many are unwell. “Even if a student is having common cold and fever, we are asking them not to come to college as it can be anything from common fever to Covid-19,” he added. The same is said to be the case with school students as they too are citing health reasons for not attending physical classes. “Even now, not many are openly saying what their diagnosis is. All we know is that a student is down with a fever. In our school, quite a few students stopped coming to classes after the first two days,” said M Ravindar, a mathematics teacher. In the state, over 52 lakh students are enrolled from class 1 to class 10 in government and private schools and about 10 lakh students in intermediate first and second year. While the attendance in schools is about 32%, in junior colleges it is about 40%. Apart from health reasons, continuous rains, lack of hostels and fear of Covid-19 are being cited as reasons for the low turnout of students in schools and colleges. Meanwhile, when it comes to professional courses such as engineering, the attendance percentage is not very impressive. Many colleges are said to be asking for at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination to allow students into the campus. “Hardly 15% to 20% are attending offline classes. As it is not compulsory to attend physical classes, not many are revealing the exact reason why they are skipping offline classes,” said V Balakrishna Reddy, president, Telangana Technical Institutions Employees Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/double-whammy-for-students-as-typhoid-keeps-them-at-home/articleshow/85990647.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The city has a major sports infrastructure in Guru Nanak Stadium that houses facilities for various sports like athletics, football, basketball, badminton, table tennis, judo, whereas there is a hockey stadium on PAU campus. A visit to Guru Nanak Stadium revealed a worn-out track for athletics whereas the main stadium also needed repairs. It was also found that chairs, fans, lights, inside the stadium, especially in badminton hall, were missing. Also the paint of the walls had come off. The wall of the main stadium adjacent to the football ground was broken. The condition of hockey stadium at PAU was no different with water leakage problem and washrooms in bad shape. “The hockey stadium is not in a proper shape, even when we collect money and spend on it. The sports department, which looks after the stadium, doesn’t have funds. There are outdated water motors which were installed a long time back and there is leakage in pipes. There are electric poles and lights, but no power connection. The washrooms are in worst condition. Our players are forced to cut the grass themselves. We have met the MC commissioner who had told us that tenders have been issued for its renovation, but we will be happy once the construction starts,” said Jagbir Singh Grewal, who has been national-level hockey player and is caretaker with Malwa Hockey Academy. Grewal said, “Same is the case with Guru Nanak stadium which needs renovation. The track was installed about 20 years ago, but has not been replaced. Around Rs 3 lakh is needed for the purpose. This is despite the fact Asian Games gold medallist Apinder Singh had practised here. Though the district sports officer wants to carry out changes, he doesn’t have funds to do it.” He said many Olympians including Indian hockey team vice-captain Haramanpreet Singh has trained in Ludhiana, and city resident Hardeep Singh is another Olympian (who played for Indian hockey team in 1984 Olympics). An athlete in Ludhiana, asking not to be named, said as the track is damaged, athletes are always vulnerable to accidents and injuries. He said the synthetic track has outlived its utility and needs to be replaced without further delay. The sports department authorities admitted that the sports infrastructure needs revamp. “The maximum age of a track is 10 years, but it has been there for 20 years now and has gone out of shape. Tenders for a new track have been issued. As far as the building-related issues, chairs at Guru Nanak Stadium are concerned, we have made estimates. Several years ago, repairs were carried out ahead of a national event,” said district sports officer Ravinder Singh. “The hockey stadium also needs repair work. So, we have prepared an estimate under Smart City mission. Sprinkle system, water system with new motors etc will be made as part of the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/stadiums-in-ludhiana-need-revamp-too/articleshow/85990655.cms||Shariq Majeed

The officials had a similar plan two years ago as well, but it fell through for various reasons. The officials want to purchase around 250 florescent collars initially so that stray cattle around main roads and highways can be covered first. The officials claimed that those who lift the cattle from roads will be tasked with tying the collars on the cattle left behind. The problem of stray cattle is severe in the city and both cattle and commuters are often put in danger. A resident of Haibowal, Kapil Sood said, “In the nights, the stretch from Jassian Road towards Jalandhar bypass is full of stray cattle. Last week one or two bulls were lifted by some NGO but the rest are still roaming here.” He said at night time it is more dangerous, as cattle charge toawrds the road suddenly, often leading to accidents. Another resident from Civil Lines, Gagandeep Singh said sometimes it becomes a tough task to pass the road, as cattle cross the road in a file. He said in the past several incidents happened where stray cattle hit the commuters hard. He complained that authorities have failed to address this issue. Senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “We have sent a proposal to MC commissioner for approval for the neon collars.” Regarding previous plans he said some NGOs had donated the collars so they had tied them, but in the last one and half year, due to Covid-19, things have not moved according to plan. The stray cattle could be seen roaming on GT Road, Jalandhar bypass, Haibowal, Hambran Road, Chandigarh Road, Bus Stand Road, Daresi and even in posh areas like Model Town and BRS Nagar. The stretches and bridges along Buddha Nullah have also become a haven for these stray cattle. Now, they can be seen on the flyovers as well. Dairy complexes, garbage dumps major cause According to civic officials, dairy complexes at Hambran Road and Tajpur Road are major sources of stray cattle where dairy farmers let their cattle loose when they are not yielding any milk. Most of them stray towards garbage dumps as they can easily find something to eat there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-dark-over-cattle-menace-civic-body-to-buy-florescent-collars/articleshow/85990703.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Minerals, salts in water can help fight seasonal diseases: Experts||Hyderabad: At a time when more and more Hyderabadis are getting affected by typhoid and other seasonal diseases, experts have urged denizens to drink water that has enough minerals and salts in them to help the body fight back. The advice comes on the heels of the National Green Tribunal banning water that demineralizes the precious substance, saying that it was harming public health and environment. According to the order passed last year, any water in which total dissolved solids (TDS) are below 500 milligrams per litre is banned. “Minerals like calcium, magnesium and potassium are present in water and they provide health to the body. Studies have shown that this water, which has a low ph value, could lead to gastric problems, kidney problems, etc,” said professor Subodh Kandamuthan, director, Centre for Healthcare Management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). Some technologies purify water by using pressure to force molecules through a semipermeable membrane and in the process, remove contaminants from the water. “It is important to look at alternatives like adding chlorine and other minerals to water purifiers,” he said. Experts suggest the age-old formula of drinking boiled water. “It is better to drink warm water which boosts immunity and kills germs,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/minerals-salts-in-water-can-help-fight-seasonal-diseases-experts/articleshow/85990666.cms||Amrita Didyala

For students who have already paid the charges, the amount will be adjusted in the subsequent semesters. Vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar also announced that the university will be holding a convocation at the end of this month. In a Facebook live session, Kumar and other university officials spoke about renovation at the hostels and the need for a phased reopening as well. The campus will initially reopen for final-year PhD scholars who have to submit their thesis by the end of this year, the VC said. “Many people might say that schools have started physical classes, but there is a difference between schools and universities. Our university has students from across the country and many of them might be living in areas where Covid-19 is still prevalent. In schools, students are from nearby local areas and are mostly from the same cluster. It is not advisable that we let a large number of people inside the campus and risk spreading the infection,” he said. Students’ queries relating to scholarships were also answered during the session. Scholarship applications can be submitted online, too, the officials said. RP Singh, Rector 3 of the university and a member of the Covid monitoring committee, said, “In the next meeting of the committee, we will be discussing opening up of the campus for terminal year students of master’s courses who have to complete their studies, especially those who need to access labs for practicals or who have to submit their dissertations.” The registrations for the monsoon semester will commence from September 20 and end on October 3, while the classes will begin from October 4. Sudheer Pratap Singh, dean of students, said, “The hostel allotment will be done for students on the day they arrive on the campus. Their documents will be verified on the very first day and they will be allotted rooms. More than 50% of the hostel rooms are vacant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-waives-hostel-charges-convocation-likely-by-month-end/articleshow/85990682.cms||---

It is a first of its kind found in Indian waters and has been named Stygarctus keralensis after Kerala. The species was found and scientifically recorded by a team led by S Bijoy Nandan, professor at the Dept of Marine Biology, Microbiology & Biochemistry along with Vishnudattan N K, Jayachandran P R, Cusat, and Dr JG Hansen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The discovery is an outcome of the ongoing MoES-NCESS study on the ecology and diversity of submarine groundwater habitats of Kerala. “Earlier, there have been a few unauthenticated reports of marine tardigrade by the Zoological Survey of India, whereas the S keralensis discovered now is the first taxonomically described marine tardigrade from Indian waters published in Zootaxa (2021), vol 4985 (3). It is also the first sighting of marine tardigrade from the west coast of India,” said Nandan, dean of faculty, School Of Marine Sciences. Tardigrades are the toughest animals commonly known as ‘water bears’ or ‘moss piglets’ found everywhere on earth, that survived five mass extinctions, found on mountaintops, deep sea to outer space. Tardigrades are related to insects, spiders, and crustaceans and are “lesser known taxa” of invertebrates. These organisms have adapted to environmental stress by undergoing a process known as “cryptobiosis”, where their metabolic activities come to a reversible standstill. It is truly a death-like state: most organisms die by a cessation of metabolism. But they have extraordinary survival instincts that can be fatal to almost all other animals. Nandan said that certain tardigrade species are able to survive in extreme conditions such as exposure to extreme temperatures (few minutes at −272 °C and 151 °C), extreme pressures (up to 6,000 atm, nearly six times the pressure in Mariana Trench), radiation (1,000 times more radiation exposure than other animals), and dehydration (resurrected after 10 years of dehydration state). They can also survive well in microgravity and cosmic radiation, and so was stated to be a useful animal for space research. Tardigrades are thought to survive even complete global mass extinction events due to astrophysical events, such as gamma-ray bursts, or large meteorite impacts. The new species belong to the phylum Tardigrada, which comprises more than 1,300 described species. Among them, only 17% are marine species. Stygarctus keralensis is the eighth species under the genus Stygarctus, which grows up to a length of 130micrometer (0.13mm).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-tardigrade-species-found-in-kerala/articleshow/85990706.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
