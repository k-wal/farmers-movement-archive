---||Mumbai||Mumbai cyclists take to the streets on World Car-Free Day||On a cool Wednesday morning, a bunch of city cyclists headed out for a cause they believe in — creating awareness about cycling as a means of transport. Says Mumbai bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh, who spearheaded it, “On September 22, as the world celebrated Car-Free Day, we wanted to urge the city to avoid using vehicles for the day and switch to bicycles. Our initiative has been relentlessly advocating the cause of cycling as a primary mode of transport, safety for cyclists, cycling infrastructure for the city and more for over a year now.” ‘People need to realise that Mumbai’s roads are also meant for cyclists’ While spreading awareness about the benefits of cycling, they put out the demand for safer roads and better infrastructure The pedal pushers from the Cycle Chala City Bacha group, who organised a ride with Mumbai’s bicycle councillors, marshals and ward riders, reached early. From the start point at Kala Nagar, it was fun from the word go! For the Mumbaikars who participated, they believe going car-free is the only way ahead. Says Aman Rai, software engineer and bicycle councillor from M-East (Chembur and Deonar), “We were about 35 riders from Chembur who joined others from around Mumbai. Once we took off, we put horns on every cycle and added car-free messages and placards to it. The stream of city traffic had begun, so it wasn’t easy to manage with 150 cyclists on the road. It was a good feeling to see people stopping to notice our messages to go car-free. That was the idea, to drive home the message.” Adds Andheri-based UX designer, Shane Albuquerque, “The high point was seeing so many taking part in this ride. It felt good to do this as a community and inspire others to join. The ride was 19 kms long and we planned this for a long time, so it was so good to be able to do that. We hope to plan more car-free events in other areas of Mumbai itself. Our roads are not safe for cyclists and something like this also builds recognition for cyclists — people using other vehicles like cars and buses need to realise that roads are also meant for cyclists. The reason why we have a lesser number of cyclists outside is because people fear coming out on their cycles to ride. So, events like this create awareness.” Sharing memories on a special cyclists’ wall after the rideThe ride culminated at a café, followed by a round of refreshments. The group also enjoyed nostalgic games like slow cycling, double seat race and a lucky draw, and they also put up photos on a special cyclists’ wall to capture memories of the day. How cycles pack potential as the commute solution in the new normalCycles are being regarded as the way forward in the new normal — not only to cut the carbon footprint but also to allow social distancing. Firoza adds, “Cycling is the only sustainable means of transport for our cities. Growing pollution levels, traffic jams and vehicular congestion have become a part of everyday vocabulary for a regular Mumbaikar. Sadly, with these come other terms such as road rage, public health concerns, road accidents and poor living conditions in our city. Cycling not just reduces pollution and congestion, but also ensures fitness and health. We look forward to more capacity building and outreach to cyclists from various social classes, genders and age groups as part of our future plan. It’s time we looked at cycles as the better option.” Read alsoRead AlsoSupriya Sule launches cycling-themed café in MumbaiThe event brought together avid cyclists and was held today, on World Car-Free Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyclists-take-to-the-streets-on-world-car-free-day/articleshow/86457533.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha to impart primary education in 21 tribal languages in schools run by SC/ST dept||BHUBANESWAR: In an initiative meant to protect, preserve and promote the rich cultural traditions of tribals, the Odisha government has decided to come up with textbooks in 21 tribal languages. The SC/ST Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) in association with the Academy of Tribal Language and Culture (ATLC) has been developing these textbooks up to Class V which will be included in the curriculum in schools run by the state SC/ST development department from the 2022 academic session. The books will have topics like folklore, art and craft, music, songs and fables that have enriched tribal communities. They will also contain and document riddles and stories in tribal languages. “Imparting early education to students in their mother tongue is as important as including the values, traditions, mannerisms and cultural practices. It will help in preserving and documenting their culture and help children to easily understand and remember the lessons,” said Premananda Patel, senior tribal domain expert at the SCSTRTI. Patel said for developing content for the textbooks, several teams visited the tribal hinterlands and learnt the practices and lifestyle of these communities. “These indigenous tribal communities are sources of primitive and positive elements, which should be preserved as well as promoted among the next generation. Once the books are ready, it will be the responsibility of the teachers to promulgate this incredible wealth of knowledge among the children,” said Damayanti Besra, an eminent Santali writer, researcher and Padma Shri award winner. Odisha has as many as 62 tribal communities speaking 21 languages of which seven have their own scripts. The major tribal languages include Santali, Ho, Koya, Munda, Bonda, Kishan, Gandi, Desia, Kuvi, Kui, Gabba, Soura, Juanga, Bhumija, Binjhal, Bhuyan, Sadri and Khadia. Experts said imparting education in tribal languages has several challenges, primarily being the shortage of adequate teachers. Besides, residential schools have a varied proportion of students from different tribal communities. To help non-tribal teachers interact and teach in tribal languages, the SCSTRTI and ATLC have also developed workbooks, bi-lingual dictionaries and tri-lingual proficiency modules in the 21 tribal languages. “The books have been developed in such a manner that the transition of children can become easier from their mother tongue to the regional language,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-to-impart-primary-edu-in-21-tribal-languages-in-schools-run-by-sc/st-dept/articleshow/86463363.cms||Minati Singha

---||Cuttack||Orissa HC refuses to stay work on Bagala land||CUTTACK: The Orissa High Court on Thursday declined to issue a stay order on construction activities on the Bagala Dharmasala land in Puri town to rehabilitate tourist lodge owners, evicted from areas within 75 metres of the Jagannath Temple, under a heritage project. The HC was hearing two separately filed interim applications (IAs) that had challenged the parcelling out of the 2.574-acre Bagala Dharmasala land by the district administration to rehabilitate the evicted lodge owners. While Jagannath Bastia, a Puri resident, had filed one petition, the other one was filed by BJP leader Sambit Patra. The two-judge bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice BP Routray said the court had already passed its order on the issue on August 9 in which it directed that “all actions taken in this regard shall be subject to further orders of the Court”. While disposing of the IAs on Thursday, the bench, however, continued hearing on the main petitions. Senior advocate Pitambar Acharya, appearing on Patra’s behalf, centred his argument around the contention that the Bagala Dharmasala land belonged to Shree Jagannath Mahaprabhu under the Amrutamanohi status. He said Amrutamanohi lands are extensive properties endowed to Lord Jagannath but in the possession of maths and other religious and charitable institutions connected with the Puri temple as caretakers and cannot be transferred or sold. “The sale of the land is illegal as the Shri Jagannath Temple Act, 1955, prohibited transfer or sale of the Amrutamanohi lands,” Acharya submitted, citing a Supreme Court order. The court will hear the matter next on December 16. The sale of .34-acre plots of the Bagala Dharmasala land to rehabilitate the lodge owners had come under the judicial scrutiny after the IAs were filed. While the petitions are pending before the HC, fresh allegations of the district administration going ahead with the rehabilitation of more lodge owners in plots measuring 1.93 acres have come up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/hc-refuses-to-stay-work-on-bagala-land/articleshow/86466792.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

Despite public protests, the BMC instructed the idols’ height to be less than four feet. Public address system will not be used at any time of the day during the festival, said the guidelines. The civic body said committees or organisers can conduct the puja in mandaps by following all Covid-19 norms after obtaining permission from the officer authorised by the commissioner of police. It added that mandaps should be well covered on three sides to prevent public participation, while one side will remain open for entry and exit of priests and organisers. The guidelines said, at any point of time, not more than seven people, including priests/organisers/support staff, will be allowed in mandaps and those inside mandaps will follow the Covid-appropriate behaviours. Anyone, who is actively involved in the puja observance, should be fully vaccinated. The BMC also said organisers cannot hold an immersion procession this year and follow the rituals in the BMC-created artificial ponds with participation of maximum 10 people. Fully-vaccinated people can take part in the immersion process, No religious procession, musical or entertainment programme will be allowed during the festival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/covid-scare-bmc-no-to-public-participation-in-puja-festivities/articleshow/86464036.cms||Hemanta Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Decision to allow pharmacists treat patients evokes mixed response||BHUBANESWAR: The government’s order allowing pharmacists to treat people suffering from 12 ailments including malaria, fever, respiratory tract infections, scabies and ringworm in the absence of doctors have evoked mixed response from the medial fraternity, pharmacists and the general public. A section of doctors and pharmacists said such an official arrangement was needed since pharmacists anyway serve patients in the absence of doctors. Many, however, said the government must post at least two doctors in a hospital so that at least one is available on duty at any given point of time. “It is a welcome move since pharmacists anyway were treating patients in the absence of doctors. However, it will be better if the government ensures at least two doctors are posted in a hospital so that at least one is there when the other goes on leave,” said Narayan Rout, president of Odisha Medical Services Association (OMSA), a body of doctors in government service. Nirakar Bhatt, his predecessor in OMSA, however, said the government should focus on recruitment and posting of doctors instead of giving their duty to pharmacists and nurses. Odisha Pharmacists Service Association president Naveen Mohapatra said the government move was long overdue. “In fact, the plan was mooted in 2018. However, that time the government thought with more postings of doctors it would not be required. Many primary health centres have either one doctor or no doctor at all. In such a situation, unless pharmacists are allowed to treat with medicines from government supply, poor patients will have to spend to buy medicines from the market,” Mohapatra said. A government order in 2003 had allowed pharmacists to give certain medicines, which are mostly not in use now. That’s why the latest order specifying medicines and diseases were required, he said. Biswajit Mohanty, a social activist, termed the government decision foolish and dangerous. “Patients’ lives are at risk without prescriptions by qualified doctors,” he said. The government move comes five days before the Orissa high court’s September 27 deadline for the government to come up with a time- bound plan to fill up vacancies of doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/decision-to-allow-pharmacists-treat-patients-evokes-mixed-response/articleshow/86464021.cms||Ashok Pradhan

---||India||Three armed militants killed in Uri sector following infiltration bid||SRINAGAR: A group of five heavily armed infiltrators were spotted in north Kashmir’s Uri sector on Thursday morning, of whom three were killed in a “brief exchange of fire” while the other two managed to flee across the Line of Control. A huge cache of ammunition was recovered near the LoC. This was the second infiltration bid since September 18. At 6am on Thursday, the Army spotted a group of militants in Hathlanga area of Uri and challenged them. A gun battle ensued in which three militants were neutralized. One of the militants has been identified as a Pakistani national while the identity of the other two is being ascertained, General Officer Commanding, 15 Corps, Lieutenant General D.P. Pandey said in a press briefing. The Army had foiled an infiltration bid from across the LoC in Uri on September 18 when six terrorists were pushed back. Since then combing operations had been launched in the area. “The September 18 bid was foiled and the militants were pushed back. The combing operation in Uri has also been called off,” the officer said. The Army’s Uri-based commanding officer said that the three slain militants were carrying a huge cache of arms and ammunition that included five AK-47 rifles, seven pistols, 5 AK magazines, 24 UBGl grenades, 38 Chinese grenades, seven Pakistan made grenades, Rs 35,000 in Pakistani currency and some eatables. Asked if the infiltration bid had any Afghanistan connection, Lt. General Pandey said that the Army was alert as it ‘was anticipating a change in the behaviour of Pakistan in September.’ “We were expecting infiltration ahead of the onset of winter. I would not like to connect this with the geopolitics. We are ready to foil all bids,” he maintained. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir Vijay Kumar, who was part of the joint press conference on Thursday, said, “There is a change in strategy from across the LoC. The elements across the border were feeling frustrated by the prevailing peaceful atmosphere, rising number of tourist arrivals, visits of Union ministers, and the peaceful situation after the death of Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Geelani.” “There is a new trend of hybrid and part-time militants, who are being given pistols to carry out target killings during evening hours. They resume normal activities after a day. Around 97 pistols were recovered from militants, which signifies hybrid militants are being promoted,” Kumar added. Militant killed in Shopian Another militant was killed in a separate operation in Shopian on Thursday. He was identified as Anayat Ashraf Dar from Shopian’s Keshwa. The Army recovered a pistol and ammunition from him. Police officials said Dar on Wednesday night had fired upon a civilian Jeewer Hameed Bhat, who was seriously injured and is in hospital. The police said Dar was an ‘active terrorist’ and used to threaten people in and around his village with illegally acquired weapons. “While laying a cordon, the terrorist fired upon a joint search party. All night he was offered the option to surrender but he did not accept it. All civilians in adjoining houses were evacuated.

Not only the central government, but all security forces deployed in Jammu & Kashmir are continuously framing strategies to deal with the ever-increasing threat from drones," he said. He said that CRPF has also made elaborate security arrangements at all pilgrimage sites, including Shri Mata Vaishno Devi shrine ahead of the Navratras. He also said that CRPF and other troops deployed on highways have increased vigil in view of threat from terrorists. Ranpise was speaking during an event to flag off a cycle rally from Jammu to Delhi being organized as part of the ongoing Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations. The cycle rally will pass through Pathankot, Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Jang-e-Azadi Memorial, Shaheed Udham Singh Memorial, Ludhiana, Sirhind, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Sonipat and reach Rajghat in Delhi on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary on October 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drones-huge-threat-but-security-agencies-framing-strategy-crpf-ig/articleshow/86467842.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The report recommends he is never given a former member’s pass to the House of Commons. The report by the chair of the independent expert panel, Sir Stephen Irwin, published Thursday, was commissioned by the House of Commons to consider sanctions after Vaz was found by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to have breached Parliament’s bullying and harassment policy in his interactions with the clerk. The report found that the former Labour MP’s misconduct "represented sustained and unpleasant bullying, with a real and enduring psychological impact; and that it led to the complainant leaving her career in the House of Commons". It concluded his eligibility to hold a former member’s pass should never be restored and if he currently held one, it would have been appropriate to remove it. The woman he was found to have bullied was the home affairs select committee’s second clerk between April 2007 and October 2008. Vaz displayed inappropriate anger and overly demanding behaviour towards her, the report said. Examples include requiring her to have breakfast with him whilst on trips; disparaging her religion, assuming she was Catholic, in front of others, on a trip to Northern Ireland; telling her she was incompetent; threatening to take photos of her drinking alcohol and pressing her to reveal her age. Vaz stood down in November 2019 after being suspended from the service of the House for six months in October 2019 for causing significant damage to its reputation after being involved in a drugs and prostitute scandal. Vaz issued a statement saying "as a direct result of the protracted and debilitating process" of this investigation he was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy, for which he was hospitalised and is still undergoing treatment. He added he had never seen the report, nor had the chance to question witnesses, nor provide a response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/panels-report-says-keith-vaz-told-house-of-commons-clerk-she-reminded-him-of-prostitutes-he-had-met/articleshow/86467883.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||India human rights record attacked in UK Commons & by group in US||LONDON: India was under attack in the UK Parliament as well as from a Muslim civil rights advocacy group in the US on its human rights record and alleged rights abuses in Kashmir. British MPs — from Labour and the Conservatives — lined up to slam India at a debate in the House of Commons on human rights in Kashmir on Thursday tabled by Labour MP Debbie Abrahams and Pakistan-origin Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi. One Labour MP, Naz Shah, said: "The question on the minds of millions of Kashmiris worldwide and in the region is simply this: how will the butcher of Gujarat settle this unfinished business of Partition?" The Indian high commission in London responded saying it had noted "with sadness" that an "august institution of a fellow democracy has been misused today to level abuse against the elected leader of the largest practising democracy". Simultaneously, CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations) urged Americans to call on US President Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris to "raise the issues of human rights abuses, including religious persecution of Muslims in India", when the meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in coming days. "It is unacceptable for the Biden administration to welcome someone who is responsible for a multitude of human rights abuses and for the persecution of religious minorities," CAIR national executive director Nihad Awad said, adding that Biden and Harris "have an obligation" to press Modi "about his human rights record" and demand a real change in "India counterproductive and anti-democratic actions relating to minority communities". Abrahams, who was barred entry into India in February 2020, is the chair and Qureshi is the vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Kashmir Group (APPGK), which aims to support the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people and highlight alleged abuses of human rights in Kashmir. Vishwesh Negi, minister (press & information) at the Indian high commission in London, told TOI afterwards: "As on previous occasions, the High Commission of India reiterates that any assertion made in any forum on a subject related to an integral part of India needs to be duly substantiated with authentic verifiable facts." Qureshi alleged the everyday reality of Kashmiris was "mass arrests and raids, torture, the suppression of free assembly, the crushing of the Kashmiri press, the decimation of the local economy, the crippling of the education system, the incarceration of thousands of people, the conversion of hotels and guesthouses into detention centres and the gagging of Kashmiri civil society". Labour MP Khalid Mahmood, of Kashmiri heritage, said: "I think all of us should apply to the Indian high commission for a visa to go to Kashmir. When all of us do not get a visa to do that, we should then put forward a motion to Mr Speaker and to the Lord Speaker to ensure that the Indian high commissioner is not allowed in this place at all." Labour MP Imran Hussain, also a British Kashmiri, claimed that Modi government unilaterally revoking Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution was "in direct contravention of UN resolutions and of international law, and a war crime under the fourth Geneva convention". He described it as the "biggest assault" that they had seen on the right to self-determination for Kashmiris. Moving away from traditional UK government policy on Kashmir, Conservative MP Robbie Moore said the MPs could "use our influence to ensure that this terrible situation is investigated, and that our government use their weight and influence to put on pressure to seek a solution". He said he wanted UN human rights officials to get access to both sides of the LoC to find out the facts. But Conservative MP Theresa Villiers said: "We must also recognise the suffering caused in Jammu and Kashmir as a result of terrorism and fundamentalism. Today’s terrorist groups continue to threaten the security of people in Kashmir. They include Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, which the Indian government believe all have clear links with Pakistan."

---||India||No OBC information in 2021 census as 2011 caste data unusable: Government||NEW DELHI: The Centre Thursday told the Supreme Court it has decided not to enumerate Other Backward Castes as part of the 2021 Census as taking a headcount of castes other than Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will be administratively extremely complex and cannot yield complete or accurate information. Opposing the Maharashtra government’s plea for a directive to it to count OBCs in the state, the Centre also said the raw data on the number of OBCs, collected under the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), was technically flawed, unreliable and unusable for any purpose, including quantifying quota in jobs, admissions to educational institutions or elections, and hence it has been decided not to make it official. It said preparation for conducting the Census is at an advanced stage and no change in the criteria is possible now. On counting OBCs as part of the fresh Census, which was scheduled to begin in 2021 but delayed because of the pandemic, the Centre said it decided not to hold ‘OBC Census’ as part of the larger decennial enumeration of the population. “Any direction from the SC to carry out OBC caste enumeration at this late stage would cause confusion and would also tantamount to interfering with the policy decision of the government which has decided not to carry out OBC caste enumeration in Census 2021,” it said in an affidavit. The categorical stand comes against the backdrop of the demand from OBC leaders, including BJP ally and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar as well as BJP’s own like Sushil Kumar Modi, to count backward castes and their numerical strength. Due to the mistakes committed by enumerators, the Centre said, the enumeration of OBCs/BCCs has always been adjudged to be administratively extremely complex. Even when the censuses of castes were taken in the pre-Independence period, the data suffered in respect of completeness and accuracy,” it said. It backed its stand by pointing to the incurable flaws that crept into the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census, a euphemism for the OBC count. “Due to the mistakes committed by enumerators, inherent flaws in the manner of conducting the Census and several such factors, there is no reliable or dependable caste-based Census data available which can be the basis of any constitutional or statutory exercises like reservations in admission, promotion or local body elections,” the Centre said. The Centre said the flaws were glaring from the simple statistics that in the 1931 Census, the total number of castes enumerated were just 4,147 but in the 2011 SECC, these were more than 46 lakh. “Assuming that some castes may bifurcate into sub-castes, the total number cannot be exponentially high to this extent,” it said. “SECC 2011 data suffer from infirmities making it unusable for any official purposes and cannot be mentioned as any official document,” it said and informed the court that Census 2021, preparations for which are in the final stages, would collect data on SCs and STs and not on enumeration of OBCs. Referring to Maharashtra’s writ petition in the SC demanding publishing of 2011 raw data, the Centre said if made public, the data, fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies, would cause huge problems for the state government. “Analysis of SECC data pertaining to Maharashtra showed that out of a total population of 10.3 crore, a population of 1.17 crore recorded ‘no caste’, but the rest of the population categorised themselves into 4.28 lakh different castes. In contrast, the existing castes published in Maharashtra in SCs, STs and OBC categories are only 494,” the Centre said. The published list included 47 castes among STs, 59 castes in SCs and 388 among OBCs. “Considering this, it is apparent that the caste enumeration in SECC 2011 was fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies. A further analysis showed more than 99% of the castes enumerated had a population of less than 100 persons,” it said, adding that 2,440 castes accounted for the country’s 8.82 crore population while 4,26,237 castes cumulatively had 0.54 crore citizens. “For the aforesaid reason, the details available in the record of the census pertaining to castes is not reliable either for the purpose of any reservation, whether in admission, employment or elections to local bodies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-obc-information-in-2021-census-as-2011-caste-data-unusable-government/articleshow/86467967.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The trilateral ministerial would have seen external affairs minister S Jaishankar holding deliberations with his counterparts from Australia (Marise Payne) and France (Jean-Yves Le Drian). But France pulled out on the back of the formation of AUKUS. France has been livid after the announcement of this new security pact which saw Australia cancelling a $66 billion contract with France for diesel submarines. Instead, Australia will now get nuclear submarines built by the UK and the US with a rare transfer of critical technology by the US. France even withdrew its envoys from Washington and Canberra in protest, and cancelled a defence dialogue with the UK. The trilateral is shaping up to be one of the more important mini-lateral groupings in the Indo-Pacific, where three powers bring complementary capabilities to the table. The first meeting of the three ministers was held on the sidelines of the G-7 foreign ministers’ meeting in London in May, which followed a meeting of the foreign secretaries in September, 2020. The first meeting focused on joining forces against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, something that Chinese fleets indulge in rampantly. It is believed that after the Biden-Macron conversation and public contrition expressed by the US, the US-France relationship may improve soon. Australia though may be made to sweat for a little longer, so it might be a while before this trilateral meets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/fuming-france-cancels-meet-with-oz-india/articleshow/86468144.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||Guwahati||Guwahati residents take the plunge to save polluted Bharalu||GUWAHATI: Concerned with the “dying” Bharalu, a tributary of the Brahmaputra river, a group of Guwahati residents have joined hands with the government to save it, and have submitted an action plan to the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) and Guwahati Development Department (GDD). Bharalu flows through the thickly populated Guwahati before meeting the Brahmaputra. According to conservationists, in the last 50 years, the tributary has become akin to a heavily polluted drain, becoming the root cause of severe flooding in the city. Robin Kalita, a former Indian Railway Traffic Service employee, said: “The present condition of the Bharalu has compelled me to do something to save it, which has turned into a dirty and stinking drain. Few like-minded people have joined me in the mission. We have prepared an action plan to revive and save the Bharalu.” The GMC and GDD are yet to respond to the action plan submitted by Kalita and his associates. According to Kalita, the action plan includes spreading of awareness among people, making the river banks encroachment-free and widening of Bharalu. “The common people cannot do anything without the government’s help. We can help the government in creating public awareness and identifying encroached areas. The departments concerned will have to take necessary actions,” he added. Various organisations and environmentalists have raised their voices to save the Bharalu, while many experts have also given suggestions. However, no steps have been taken till date. Conservationist Hemen Lahkar told TOI, “Due to the government’s lackadaisical attitude, the river that was once home to varied aquatic species has turned into a dirty drain, carrying the city’s waste.” “Moreover, the government’s inaction has given an opportunity to encroach the river banks, as a result of which the size of the river has reduced drastically over the decades,” he added. GMC commissioner Devasish Sharma said the city does not have a waste management plant and an integrated waste management policy. “People often throw garbage into the drains, which ultimately opens into the Bharalu, thereby polluting it. The clogged channel results into flooding,” he added. Sharma, however, said the GMC is planning to take some initiative in the matter soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/city-residents-take-the-plunge-to-save-polluted-bharalu/articleshow/86465579.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Assam: Congress condemns firing during eviction in Darrang||GUWAHATI: Opposition parties lambasted the Assam government for carrying out an eviction drive in Darrang on Thursday, rendering hundreds of families homeless during the pandemic. The Assam PCC in a statement said evicting people from their habitations during a pandemic is a violation of the Supreme Court directive. Assam PCC president Bhupen Borah strongly condemned the police firing on resident protesters in the Dholpur area in Sipajhar during the drive, carried out by the Darrang district administration and the police. Two persons died, while several others, including the police, were injured in clashes. “The very act of eviction is inhuman, especially during Covid. The Supreme Court had also given a directive against eviction. Yet the Assam government, led by CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, has remained adamant, behaving in an autocratic manner to evict the residents of Dholpur who have been living in the area since the Seventies,” said Borah.  Before the eviction drive was launched, the Congress said the government should have arranged for their rehabilitation and alternative housing for the families whose houses were razed to initiate a state farming project at Garukhuti in Darrang district. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Assam is on state-sponsored fire. I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state----- no children of India deserve this.” Even as Mangaldoi MP and BJP national general secretary, Dilip Saikia, advised the families, who were served eviction notices, to peacefully shift to the ‘area earmarked for them’, the Congress asked, “Without alternative arrangements for land and housing, where will these poor people go and how will they survive?” Assam is on state-sponsored fire. I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state- no children o… https://t.co/5LT8iPHmYY— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1632400240000Assam PCC has demanded a judicial enquiry and immediate suspension of the Darrang DC and SP. AIUDF general secretary Aminul Islam demanded Rs 50 lakh be paid to the kin of those who died and Rs 20 lakh to the injured. “We demand a CBI probe into the incident. The police could have used rubber bullets and water cannons to control the situation but people were shot at in the chest,” said Islam. “We demand 6 bigha cultivable land and one bigha residential plot to each of the evicted families,” he said. Peasant organization Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) alleged that Assam is on the verge of becoming a ‘police-ruled state’ during the rule of the current tenure of the BJP-led government. The Raijor Dal, headed by Akhil Gogoi, also termed the eviction in the Muslim inhabited areas of Garukhuti as ‘communal prejudice’.  “Evicting families without having plans to rehabilitate them is against human rights,” said KMSS publicity secretary Ratul Hussain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-condemns-firing-during-eviction-in-darrang/articleshow/86465559.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||IIT-Guwahati expels rape accused student whom high court called ‘future asset’||GUWAHATI: IIT-Guwahati (IIT-G) has terminated the student who was accused of raping a fellow student, stating that the reported act of “gross indiscipline” perpetrated by the accused, violating the students’ code of conduct, “had to be strictly dealt” with by the institute. The IIT-G Senate was unanimous in their decision to confer exemplary punishment against the accused as the institute will not compromise on the safety of women in the campus. On April 3, the police had arrested a 21-year-old IIT-G student for allegedly “sexually assaulting” a contemporary female student of the institute on March 28. Subsequently, the accused was suspended by the authorities. Citing that he was a talented student and a future asset to the state, the Gauhati high court had previously granted bail to the accused and had stated that there was no possibility of him tampering with the evidence. At the same time the court had held that there was a prime facie case against the accused. The hearing of the case is scheduled at a lower court on Friday. On September 6, in the presence of IIT-G director TG Sitharam, a special meeting of the Senate was held where it was decided that the final recommendation of the students’ disciplinary committee (SDC) meeting, held on September 3, for termination of the accused student from the institute will be approved with immediate effect. “The Senate upheld the recommendation of the SDC to terminate the rape accused student from the institute with immediate effect,” the minutes of the meeting read. “The Dean of Students Affairs (DOSA) informed the Senate that the student has been granted bail by the Gauhati high court on August 13. The court in the order stated that there was a clear prima facie case against the accused petitioner and the investigation of the case was completed,” the report said. The DOSA updated the Senate about the final recommendation of the students’ disciplinary committee (SDC) meeting, held on September 3, to terminate the student from the institute with immediate effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/iit-g-terminates-rape-accused-student-despite-bail-from-hc/articleshow/86465591.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

Twelve children in SOS Children's Village have tested Covid positive on a single day. The health department sent an emergency medical team to screen all residents of the campus, which is located near the city airport. In the wake of the impending third wave, the government is extremely concerned about the infections among children. “Twelve infected children were detected on Wednesday and sent to the Sarusajai Covid Care Centre,” said a spokesperson of the shelter home. He, however, said seven of them used to live in youth houses outside the campus but under the care of the shelter home authority. Boys are shifted out to the youth houses when they turn 10 plus. About 150 children are residing on the campus at present. There are 16 homes in the village and three youth homes outside the campus. The Children's Village in Borjhar here is one of the largest orphanages in the northeast and remains vulnerable to Covid infection due to the entry of children from various parts of the state. More than 100 tests were done on Thursday but sources said, none were found to be positive. Health department officials, however, could not confirm the health status of the infected children. Since the second wave, a total of 27 children and three staff have contracted the virus in the shelter home. “Despite Covid curbs, we need to bring children for shelter. A screening is done when they come but somehow the virus has penetrated,” the official said. Total restriction has been imposed on the campus and no outsider has been allowed to come in touch with the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/12-children-test-positive-for-cov-at-city-orphanage/articleshow/86465628.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The PCC has alleged that former MPs, ex-MLAs, AICC and Assam PCC, district and block-level committee members worked againt the interests of Congress candidates. Those leaders who did not get tickets to contest took out their anger on the selected candidates and helped directly or indirectly, the rival candidates to win. Reportedly, 15 district Congress committees have already submitted their complaints with documentary evidence. The Assam PCC constituted a high level enquiry committee to look into the matter. “In the show-cause notices, the recipients have been asked to reply justifying what they have done, highlighting the cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them by the committee within a period of 15 days. Copies of allegations will be attached with the show-cause notices,” said Bharat Chandra Narah, MLA and chairman of Disciplinary Action Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-showcauses-212-workers-leaders/articleshow/86465676.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The Centre has asked states and UTs to facilitate vaccination for such people at home under supervision. Special needs will include persons who are bed-ridden or with restricted mobility. “We have written to all states on September 22. This is to ensure equitable citizen-centric approach to vaccination. Any person willing to get vaccinated and who cannot travel to the vaccination centre, we have made this arrangement for them,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Thursday. “Customised citizen-friendly interventions like near-to-home Covid vaccination centres (NHCVCs) for elderly and differently-abled citizens were started in May and detailed SOPs issued in this regard to all states and UTs. So far, 16.13 crore doses have been administered (to this category of vaccine recipients),” he said. While such CVCs (Covid vaccination centres) should continue to be functional, at the same time it must be ensured that other centres are also fully accessible to persons with disabilities as per accessibility standards mandated under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, the government said. “It is understood that there are still some persons who might be bedridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs that may hamper their accessibility even to NHCVCs. It is advised that a line list of such potential beneficiaries and care-givers may be prepared... Subsequently, vaccination of such beneficiaries may be facilitated at their place of residence using mobile vaccination teams,” Bhushan wrote to states and UTs. The measure is expected to increase coverage, mainly among those who may be more vulnerable to infection. For instance, many elderly who are bed-ridden, or patients of diseases under homecare as well as those with disability have found it difficult to reach vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-home-vaccine-for-disabled-people-with-special-needs-gets-government-nod/articleshow/86468181.cms||Sushmi Dey

The dead have been identified as Saddam Hussain and Sheikh Farid. An assistant sub-inspector is admitted to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital in a critical condition. Police initially fired in the air and burst teargas shells to disperse the protesters but as the crowd refused to dissipitate and started attacking the men in uniform, police had to resort to firing. “The police were given a task to evict the encroachers and they were carrying out their work when they were attacked by people with stones and sharp weapons. There was firing from the police. The eviction drive will continue,” Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said. The area covering about 7000 bigha of government land has been allotted for a farming project by the state cabinet and last Monday the district administration had evicted 800 households in the first phase of eviction Monday without any trouble on Monday. Thursday’s drive was meant to evict the remaining 500 households who were served notices on Wednesday. Villagers said they had gathered to demand rehabilitation of nearly 800 families evicted from the land they were living on for decades on Monday. Among the video clippings of the incident doing the rounds, one of them showed a photographer accompanying the police being chased by a villager carrying a sharp weapon. When the police stopped the protester and took him down on the ground, the photographer jumped on the protester’s chest several times and punched him brutally. Assam Police special DG GP Singh said the cameraman has been arrested. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of the two civilians and injury of several others, including police personnel, in the incident by a retired judge of the Gauhati high court. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has called the police action “state-sponsored fire”. He tweeted, “Assam is on state-sponsored fire. I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state - no children of India deserve this.” Assam Pradesh Congress president Bhupen Kumar Borah said, “The very act of eviction is in itself inhuman, especially during the Covid situation.” AIUDF general secretary Aminul Islam said, “The CM is in charge of the home department and today’s act was like that of General Dyer. We cannot accept it. It shows that the CM was taking a sadistic pleasure out of it and he has not shown any sympathy for these people.” The Gauhati high court, on May 10, had kept in abeyance any decree for eviction or dispossession or demolition which was passed by any court, tribunal or authority in view of the pandemic but vacated the order in August on grounds that the Covid situation in the state has improved. Assam additional advocate general PN Goswami said, “The high court order on May 10 in a suo moto PIL deals with a ‘decree’ by a court, tribunal or authority and execution thereof. According to me, eviction of illegal encroachers from government land or inside a reserve forest does not warrant any ‘decree’ from any court or tribunal or authority. Moreover, even such an interim order was vacated by the Hon’ble high court vide order dated August 13. As such, presently the Government is at liberty to evict all illegal encroachers from government as well as forest land.” The BJP government has taken up a series of drives across the state to evict encroachers occupying land belonging to Vasihnavite satras, ancient temples and the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/two-die-as-assam-cops-fire-on-land-encroachers-in-darrang/articleshow/86466135.cms||Prabin Kalita

The allegations came soon after the chief minister announced the joining of 2,891 people from 720 families in a party rally. The CPM state committee member and senior leader Ratan Bhowmik alleged that BJP cadres had been threatening people, especially opposition supporters, for the last four-five days to remain present in the CM’s rally and hold aloft the BJP flag in Kakrabon. Prior to the rally, Deb had attended the inauguration of the synthetic football turf at Chandrapur in Udaipur. The programme was organised by the sports and youth affairs department, but the party had issued directions to the residents of surrounding areas that at least two persons from each family must attend the programme, Bhowmik alleged. “Whether you will vote for the BJP or CPM is not the concern at present, now you have to join us if you want to live peacefully. If you don’t carry the BJP flag, be ready for the consequence — BJP cadres have been threatening the villagers openly for the last few days. But even these terror tactics could not ensure an impressive gathering and from last night, people who didn’t attend were attacked,” Bhowmik stated. He argued Deb had announced that about 12,000 people had joined the BJP from other parties over a month in Belonia and Sabroom of South Tripura, Kailashahar of Unokoti district, Kamalasagar in Sepahijala district and finally in Udaipur of Gomati. But, in none of the places the party was able to release the list of the entrants. Echoing Bhowmik, Trinamool Congress leader Ashis Lal Singh said, “The BJP leaders and MLAs are well aware of the ground situation and the sure outcome of the 2023 assembly poll in Tripura. They thought by using muscle and money power, BJP will win the elections but it is not going to happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/bjp-forcing-people-to-join-debs-rallies-cpm/articleshow/86464083.cms||---

Abonmai, who spoke against the NSCN (IM) in local television social discussion programmes, left his Langol Tarung residence in Imphal West in the morning to attend a community outreach programme of the state government attended by chief minister N Biren Singh. Sources said he was abducted by around 20 unknown persons around 11am from the gate of the ground where the programme was held. Following the abduction of the Naga leader, who also spoke for ushering in peace and unity between the hill and valley in the state, police launched a massive search to rescue him but to no avail. The people of Machenglu, the native village of Abonmai, also launched a search for him till his bullet-riddled body was found near a stone crusher site located between Pallong village and Sonparam, around 29km from Tamenglong district headquarters in the evening. Before long, Tamenglong district police rushed to the spot, retrieved the body and registered an FIR to track down the perpetrators, the police sources said. Abonmei had contested the state assembly elections twice from Tamei seat in Tamenglong district earlier. No group has claimed responsibility for the murder till the time of filing this report even as hordes of civil bodies and well-wishers stongly condemned the brutal murder of Abonmai. Attempts to contact senior police officials for comments drew a blank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/zeliangrong-naga-leader-athuan-shot-dead-in-manipur/articleshow/86464063.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma
---||India||Key trial of 5,000-km ICBM Agni-V in October||NEW DELHI: India will soon conduct another test of its most formidable strategic missile, the over 5,000-km Agni-V, even as work is still in progress to develop multiple-warhead capability for ballistic missiles. The “user-trial in full operational configuration” of the Agni-V missile, which carries a single 1.5-tonne warhead, will be conducted by the tri-Service Strategic Forces Command (SFC) in October, said sources on Thursday. It will be the first user-trial of the three-stage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is now gradually being inducted into the SFC, since the military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh erupted in April-May last year. The operational deployment of the over 50-tonne Agni-V will enhance the deterrence posture against China, which has missiles like the Dong Feng-41 (12,000-15,000-km) that can hit any Indian city. China has also recently gone in for a huge expansion in new missile silo fields for launching nuclear-tipped ICBMs. Agni-V, which will bring even the northernmost part of China within its strike envelope, is operationally better than the earlier Agni variants because it is a canister-launch missile to ensure lesser maintenance as well as swifter transportation and firing. The Agni-V test will come soon after a new-generation two-stage missile called Agni-Prime, with a strike range of 1,500-km, was tested on June 28. The Agni-Prime, also a canister-launch missile, will eventually replace the Agni-I (700-km) missiles in the arsenal of the SFC, which also has the Prithvi-II (350-km), Agni-II (2,000-km) and Agni-III (3,000-km) missile units. DRDO is simultaneously working to develop `multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles' (MIRVs) for the Agni missiles. An MIRV payload will have a single missile carrying four to six nuclear warheads, each programmed to hit a separate target. “It will take another two years for a MIRVed missile to be flight-tested to prove the core technologies. With warheads meant to hit targets hundreds of kilometre apart with different trajectories, such a missile involves complex technologies. The test of the highly-miniaturised Agni-Prime in June included decoys, not an MIRV payload,” said a source. India has also for long modified some Sukhoi-30MKI, Mirage-2000 and Jaguar fighters to deliver nuclear gravity bombs. The new French-origin Rafale fighters being inducted by the IAF are also capable of doing it. But the third leg of India’s nuclear triad is still far away from becoming robust, represented as it is by the solitary nuclear ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arihant armed with only 750-km range K-15 missiles as of now. Countries like the US, Russia and China have SSBNs with well over 5,000-km range submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). India has three more SSBNs under development, with INS Arighat now slated for commissioning next year after some delay. The K-4 missiles, with a strike range of 3,500-km, in turn, will take at least one more year to be ready for induction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/key-trial-of-5000-km-icbm-agni-v-in-october/articleshow/86468298.cms||Rajat Pandit

An affidavit filed by an undersecretary at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) who is discharging his functions in the PM Cares Trust on an honorary basis says the trust functions with transparency and its funds are audited by a chartered accountant drawn from the panel prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. The affidavit was filed in response to a petition seeking a direction to declare the PM Cares Fund a “State” under the Constitution to ensure transparency in its functioning. “To ensure transparency, the audited report is put on the official website of the trust along with the details of utilisation of funds received by the trust,” says the affidavit filed by Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, undersecretary at the PMO. Irrespective of whether the trust is a State or other authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, or whether it is a “public authority” within the meaning of provisions of the Right to Information Act (RTI), it is not permissible to disclose third-party information, the affidavit states. It added that all donations received by the trust are received via online payments, cheques or demand drafts, and the amount received is audited. The audited report and the expenditure of the trust fund is displayed on the website, it said. “The trust functions on the principles of transparency and public good in larger public interest, like any other charitable trust and, therefore, cannot have any objection in uploading all its resolutions on its website to ensure transparency,” it said. The court was hearing a PIL that claimed the PM Cares Fund is a “State” as it was formed by the PM to extend assistance in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. To ensure transparency and accountability, the plea had sought a direction for periodic auditing of the PM Cares website and the disclosure of details of donations received by it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-cares-fund-isnt-a-government-of-india-fund-centre-to-delhi-high-court/articleshow/86468366.cms||---

The meeting will be presided over by Union home minister Amit Shah, sources said. Nitish may leave for Delhi on Saturday. “I think Nitish will attend the meeting of the CMs of the Maoist-hit states convened by Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Sunday. The meeting is to discuss the present situation prevailing in the Maoist-hit districts in the states concerned. Most probably, he will leave Patna on Saturday,” a state minister said. In recent months, Chhattisgarh had seen recurrence of the Maoist attacks on the contingents of central paramilitary force (CPMF). Overall, there are eight states, which have areas of influence of the Maoists in 25 districts. Incidentally, CPI (Maoist) had been banned by the central government way back in 2003, and soon after, the Centre embarked on the two-pronged offensive to contain the Maoist activities. On the one hand, it launched special developmental activities in the districts concerned, and on the other, conducted policing of the areas to contain the Maoists. In Bihar, there were 16 Maoist-hit districts earlier. By 2010, the number reduced to 10. In course, the Maoist activities were contained in the districts like Arwal, East Champaran, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and Nalanda. At present, four districts – Jamui, Gaya, Lakhisarai and Aurangabad – figure on the map of the extremist-hit districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-may-attend-shahs-meet-with-cms-of-red-hit-states/articleshow/86461599.cms||Abhay Singh

The octogenarian, who has penned at least 27 books in Gujarati, and his wife had been living with their son gastroenterologist Dr Kaushal Vyas and daughter-in-law Dr Chintal Vyas in Keshavbaug Society. Vyas, who was already suffering from a myriad of health problems, had undergone a prostate surgery a month ago and his wife had been diagnosed with cancer two months ago. During the wee hours of Thursday, the couple walked to their bungalow in nearby Saraswatinagar society, went to the first floor, and committed suicide by hanging themselves from the ceiling hook. “The incident came to light a while later when the neighbours, noticing the light in their room on, called up Kaushal and Chintal to ask if they had come home,” said police. Dr Kaushal, runs a clinic in Navrangpura, and Dr Chintal, an associate professor of general medicines department in SVP medical college, looked for the elderly couple at home. When they could not find them, they rushed to the Saraswati Society house and found their bodies. The Satellite police found a suicide note in the room where the couple had killed themselves. The octogenarian had stated that the reason behind suicide was his constant illness and he knew that it was the right time to exit the world. His suicide note stated that he had lived most of his life joyfully but since the past few years, he had been living with pain caused by various health complications like irritable bowel syndrome, prostrate, asthma, blurred vision, and pain due to a steel plate that was put in his leg after he suffered a fracture two decades ago. “I have lived for 80 years already and do not want to take 20% more profit out of my life. Now, I feel that my expiry date has come so I am going to leave the stage of this world, so that other can take entry on this stage,” Vyas wrote in his suicide note. “Their latest health issues might have distressed them and drove them to take the extreme step,” said a police officer. Police sent their bodies for post-mortem to VS hospital on Thursday morning and registered a case of accidental death. After conducting the post mortem, their bodies were taken back to their house in Saraswatinagar where relatives, friends and educationists gathered for their last journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chronic-illness-drives-gujarati-linguist-wife-to-take-their-lives/articleshow/86465532.cms||---

In the first incident, four motorcycle-borne criminals intercepted one Ramashankar Raman and looted Rs 9.75 lakh after throwing red chilli powder in his eyes on Thursday. The incident took place on Tinmuhani-Kajra-Pathalia road under Suryagarha police station area in Lakhisarai district. Raman, a deed writer at the Lakhisarai sub registrar office, told the police that he was threatened with dire consequences when he refused to hand over the money to the miscreants. He was accompanied by his nephews Ranveer Kumar and Ranjan Kumar. He was carrying the cash with him after the registration of a plot of land was deferred due to some reason.

The offer for the supplier to the defence and space sectors in India and abroad was in the price band of Rs 165-175 per share and closed on Thursday. According to BSE data, the portion of the offer reserved for non-institutional investors was subscribed nearly 928 times. The part reserved for retail investors was subscribed almost 113 times, while the institutional investors’ category was subscribed about 170 times. In terms of subscription figures, the Paras Defence IPO is followed by Salasar Technologies with 273 times subscription, Apollo Micro Systems with 249 times, and Astron Paper with 242 times. For 2021, the second-most subscribed offer was MTAR Technologies, which is in the defence supplies business too. The issue was subscribed 201 times. So far this year, in addition to MTAR Tech and Paras Defence, Data Patterns, a Hyderabad-based company that is in the same line of business, has also filed to go public. According to industry players, the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative for various sectors of the economy, including defence supplies, is leading to this surge in listing of companies in this segment. Paras Defence has five lines of businesses — manufacturing of defence & space optics products, defence electronics products, electro-magnetic pulse protection solutions, heavy engineering products and critical imaging components for India’s space programme. Various arms of the government and also companies like Bharat Electronics (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) and TCS are its customers. It also supplies products and solutions to companies in Belgium and South Korea, it said in the offer document. According to Astha Daga, senior VP at Anand Rathi Advisors, the lead manager to Paras Defence IPO, a very strong sector outlook coupled with its unique position as one of the leading ‘indigenously designed, developed and manufactured’ category of private sector companies in India generated strong investor interest. Also, due to the relatively modest size of the offering, a strong demand was witnessed. “In addition, market timing has also been very favourable as there were no other IPOs for investors to participate,” Daga said. Defence, according to industry players, has been one of the focus areas for the government and Indian companies are seen as key beneficiaries of the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India schemes. While the same will benefit Paras Defence, the company’s biggest strength lies in its R&D capabilities and relationship with diverse customers, a release from the merchant bankers noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/paras-defence-most-bought-ipo-at-304x/articleshow/86467147.cms||---

On Thursday, the state reported 746 cases and Kolkata reported over a 100. Unlike last year, 5.4 crore people in Bengal have received their shots, 3.8 crore got at least one. The court urged people to take virtual tour of pandals and declined to entertain a government plea for a “stay of operation” of the order. “It is a matter of concern that the state finds the directions onerous,” the order said.

The acute medication grew around 17% year-on-year (YoY) in August on a low base, while chronic therapies rose about 12.5% YoY, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said. After the normalisation of the high growth this year in the months of April (51.5%) and May (47.8%) led by the lockdown-related lower base last year and higher volume growth, the average Indian pharma market (IPM) growth from June to August 2021 stood at 15.2% YoY. In terms of growth drivers, price, new product launches and volume stood at 9%, 5.9% and 2.9% YoY, respectively, which led to an overall IPM size of Rs 1.63 lakh crore in August (July was Rs 1.61 lakh crore). The market had posted a growth of nearly 14% in July. Acute therapies including anti-infectives reported a growth of nearly 17 YoY (June and July was over 20% each YoY), while chronic and sub-chronic therapy reported stable growth at 10.8% YoY (6.4% YoY; 7.8% YoY) and 15.3% YoY (11.3%; 11.2%), respectively, in August 2021. During FY21, Ind-Ra said the acute therapy segment reported negative growth on account of Covid, while the chronic therapy segment reported average growth of 7% in the same period. The contribution of top five therapies to the IPM stood at 58%. These include cardiac (chronic; 13.2% of IPM), anti-infectives (acute; 14.3%), gastro-intestinal (acute; 11.5%), anti-diabetic (chronic; 9.5%) and vitamins (acute; 9.2%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/domestic-pharma-mkt-expands-18-in-aug/articleshow/86467119.cms||---

As a result, the sensex scaled a life-high mark at 59,957 points and closed just a tad off that level at 59,885 — up 958 points on the day. Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank led the gainers, while profit-taking in ITC, Dr Reddy’s and Nestle limited the rise, but only marginally, according to BSE data. On the NSE, the Nifty too closed at a new life-high level of 17,823, up 276 points on the day. Market players said that the statements by US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell that the central bank would slowly bring an end to its bond-buying programme, called tapering, and not raise rate of interest in a hurry, gave clarity among global investors. This, in turn, led to the record-breaking rally on Dalal Street on Thursday. Reports that Chinese authorities were working overnight to limit the contagion of the debt crisis in its real estate sector from spreading to other segments and countries also helped global investor sentiment, they said. As a result, the sensex opened more than 400 points higher and rallied through the session close to the psychologically vital 60k mark in late trades on Thursday. Thursday’s rally also pushed investors’ wealth, measured in terms of BSE’s market capitalisation, to a record high at Rs 264 lakh crore, or about $3.6 trillion — a level very close to that of the UK’s. Last week, India had surpassed France to become the sixth largest country in terms of market capitalisation. According to Geojit Financial Services head (research) Vinod Nair, global markets tempered optimism despite a slightly hawkish tilt by the US Fed that said that the US central bank will begin reducing its asset purchases in November and conclude the tapering process around mid-2022. “However, investors continue to remain on edge, awaiting clarity on the Chinese economy. The domestic reality sector continued its rally sparked by demand revival in the property space,” Nair said. Traders said that the rally on D-Street is expected to continue on Friday after US markets opened strong and continued their rise, boosted by the US Fed’s statement on Wednesday night. In mid-session, the Dow Jones index was up 1.6%, while S&P 500 was up 1.4% and Nasdaq Composite up 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/us-feds-clarity-on-tapering-takes-sensex-close-to-60k/articleshow/86467180.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Colleges, universities start collating students’ vaccination data||KOLKATA: A day after the state decided to vaccinate all eligible students in higher education institutions “with a view of possible resumption of offline instruction in schools and colleges”, several colleges and universities rolled out forms for students. A section of students in Presidency University, Jadavpur University and Calcutta University had been demanding the authorities vaccinate students and initiate the process of resuming in-person classes. The government has asked all higher education institutions to hold a meeting with stake holders and provide details of those who require vaccination. The institutions have been given the option to either arranging for a camp on campus or allow the government to arrange it in other vaccination centres. “The students and other stakeholders should be vaccinated before any decision to resume in-person classes in higher education institutions is taken,” said an education department official. At JU, the authorities have already collected details from students. “Students who cannot come to campus can take the shot from their nearest vaccination centres by providing an university ID,” registrar Snehamanju Basu. Maulana Azad College has started collecting the details, including of students who have just taken admission in UG courses. “Some of the details we want are the vaccination status, if they have taken a dose and the date of first dose,” said an official. At Basanti Devi College the last date to submit the information is September 24. “We have received instructions from the higher education department to submit the vaccination details of students,” said a college official. At Presidency University, the deadline to submit the information was September 23. “As soon as we received the education department nod, we started collecting the information,” said an official. A higher education department official said if the colleges and universities provide logistical support, like space and manpower, the health department can conduct vaccination on campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-universities-start-collating-students-vax-data/articleshow/86465935.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Surat||Surat: 15,000 duped of Rs 1.5 crore with Rs 1,000 tablet bait||SURAT: Frauds amassed around Rs 1.5 crore from nearly 15,000 students promising them tablets worth Rs4,500 for a meagre Rs 1,000 only. Police booked three accused on Wednesday involved in the online marketing gimmick and operating the fraud racket since October 2020. Owner of Yash World Private Ltd, Savan Kheni, his father Thakarshi and partner Ashwin Vaghani were booked for allegedly running the racket from their office in Diamond World Tower at Mini Bazaar in Varachha. The accused were granted seven days’ anticipatory bail by a local court on Wednesday, after which cops can arrest them. The fraud came to light when several people started raising questions, both online and offline, about not receiving the tablet despite paying the amount a few months ago. Initially around 7,000 victims approached the police, but later the number grew to 15,000. “On coming to know that it was a fraud scheme, many people started approaching the police. The accused claimed that they supplied around 15,000 tablets to buyers but later their funds dried up and they could not arrange for more gadgets,” a police officer told TOI. The accused purchased the tablets for Rs 4,500 and were offering it for Rs 1,000 to the students. “They had planned to enter into a contract with Google to run specific advertisements on the tablet for which they were hoping to receive good money. They were supposed to sell at least 5 lakh tablets, only when the contract would come into force,” cops said. The accused confessed of making a mistake in calculating the initial investment. Police booked the accused under various sections of Indian Penal Code including cheating, criminal breach of trust and also sections of Gujarat Protection of Interest Depositors (In Financial Establishments) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/15k-duped-of-rs-1-5-cr-with-rs-1k-tablet-bait/articleshow/86463771.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation survey reveals vaccination hesitancy in 15% households||KOLKATA: The civic body’s door-to-door sample survey on the progress of Covid vaccination has revealed that 15% of households chose to remain unvaccinated. Reluctance among a section of residents to get the jabs prompted the KMC to initiate a survey across 144 wards and convince them. A senior KMC health department official conceded the number of unvaccinated households was quite significant — around 8,250 households among 55,000 surveyed. “This is a matter of concern and we will continue our search for the unvaccinated,” said an official. There are around 6.5 lakh households in the city. However, a source said 5,000 people from those 8,250 unvaccinated households later went to the civic body’s Covid vaccination clinics and took the first dose. According to KMC, their senior officials associated with the mass vaccination scheme were alerted by a section of medical officers managing the vaccination clinics about a sharp decline in the number of first-dose recipients by the end of August. The areas which were then identified as spots where the decline happened include Garia, Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Dhakuria, Kasba and Ballygunge. “One of the reasons why the city’s share of recipients dipped was the presence of a large number of recipients from several suburban areas who had been queuing up from early morning at KMC-run vaccination centres for the first dose,” an official said. The impact of the second wave could have been minimized had a majority of the population been vaccinated then, said experts. It is purely due to vaccination that the transmission of Covid has slowed down, preventing a sharp rise in numbers even as a third wave is apprehended, they added. “Vaccination remains the most effective option in a pandemic like this. Fortunately, we have been able to vaccinate a large enough number, which has prevented the disease from taking on a virulent form. Now, even if the number of affected rises, few will need hospitalization. The mortality rate, too, will be low,” said IPGMER professor Diptendra Sarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-survey-reveals-vaccination-hesitancy-in-15-households/articleshow/86465903.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Patna||Extraction of snake venom in Bihar soon, says minister||PATNA: The state will soon have a snake park for extraction of snake venom for use in pharmaceutical industry, particularly in production of anti-venom – the medication needed to treat the victims of snakebite. The department of environment, forest and climate change (EFCC) is all set to grant permission for venom harvesting with its headquarters in Patna. EFCC minister Neeraj Kumar Singh on Thursday told this newspaper that the department would soon issue formal permission to a request made from a person heading a team of experts for rearing a variety of poisonous snakes and harvesting their venom using the latest technique for use in producing medicines. This team is already engaged in the business in some states and has the expertise. The minister said the site of park and venom extraction unit would be decided soon. The snake park, first of its kind in the state, would be part of ecotourism being promoted by development of natural resources and measures of conservation of biodiversity. The team would have all support of forest department in identifying the areas thickly inhabited by these deadly poisonous reptiles. The team handlers would catch these reptiles alive from different areas and keep them in the park under the monitoring of the forest department for extracting the venom as per the government rules. “Bihar is rich in biodiversity and snakes are found in forests, grasslands, water bodies and old unmaintained buildings,” the minister said. Though all snakes are not poisonous, the very sight of any of these creeping reptiles invokes a sense of fear. The snake park will have only poisonous species and the team will have to ensure that the extraction of poison does not violate the provisions of Wildlife Act,” said Neeraj. Beside anti-venom, the extracted venom is also in high demand for research in medical science. The government is working out the terms and conditions for extraction and use of the snake venom. “Though no survey of these reptiles has been made in recent decades, all parts of the state have snakes. However, the forest areas of North Bihar, especially West champaran, have them in large numbers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/extraction-of-snake-venom-in-state-soon-says-minister/articleshow/86464649.cms||VK Tripathi

Pandey was speaking at an event organised by Bihar Swastha Suraksha Samiti on the completion of three years of ABPM-JAY, popularly known as Ayushman Bharat. “This scheme has given new life to many people and the golden card gives strength to beneficiaries in the hospital,” said Pandey, adding 940 government and private hospitals have been registered under it in Bihar and golden card has been distributed among 30% of the beneficiary families. This scheme was launched by PM Narendra Modi three years ago from Ranchi. It aims to provide Rs 5 lakh health insurance per family per year for economically poor families. Pandey said in Bihar, three lakh people have got the treatment done so far and Rs 300 crore has been spent on them. He said across the country, 28,000 hospitals have been empanelled where beneficiaries under Ayushman Bharat can get their treatment done. “Earlier, poor people had to face hardship in getting the treatment of their relatives done. They had to borrow money or sell their jewellery and land. But now they don’t have to face such a situation. Respected PM had initiated this scheme so that poor do not need to take loans for getting treatment,” Pandey said. Health department additional secretary-cum-CEO of Bihar Swastha Suraksha Samiti, Kaushal Kishore, said there are 1.08 crore families in Bihar which are entitled to get the benefit and so far 30% of them have got the golden card. “We will try to cover the remaining families,” Kishore told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ayushman-bharat-scheme-has-benefited-3-lakh-in-bihar/articleshow/86461750.cms||---
---||Delhi||Cost of Pragati Maidan: You can’t shake off the dust||NEW DELHI: With the approach of winter, Delhi’s anxiety about toxins in its air is peaking. Stubble burning may be a major issue over which the Capital may have no control, but it can surely ensure that construction projects – both government and private – do not throw up dust that only makes the overall picture grimmer. A bumpy ride on a Pragati Maidan stretch, from Minto Bridge to Matka Peer, on Thursday afternoon made it seem that PWD and the private concessionaire executing the redevelopment project have lost sight of the need to ensure that the dust doesn’t stay in the air. With the road very badly damaged, commuters were forced to move through a cloud of dust. Dust pollution is said to contribute as much as 31 per cent of the total PM 10 load in winter and 16 to 17 per cent of the PM 2.5 in Delhi, according to data from a 2018 source apportionment study, carried out by The Energy and Resources Institute.  Dust generally comprises coarser particles, leading to a spike in PM 10 concentration over PM 2.5, which are finer particles. While the Delhi government had last week warned construction sites in Delhi to fix all dust-related violations within 15 days, roadside dust remains a grey area. No dust calming measures were seen on this stretch with every passing vehicle stirring up a dust cloud. People on two-wheelers and travelling in auto-rickshaws were affected the most. “Passing through the stretch (on Thursday) was hell. Due to the under-construction project, the stretch is usually a dustbowl. Anti-dust measures are not always in place. The authorities should give some attention to it immediately,” said Saroj Kumar, a resident of a nearby area. Shubho Dutta, who had taken an autorickshaw to go to his home in Chittaranjan Park, said the dust affected his throat badly, and only his mask gave him some protection. The Pragati Maidan revamp — comprising a 1.2-km long tunnel from Bhairon Marg to Ring Road and six underground U-turns — is likely to be completed in a phased manner. Work on the tunnel is almost complete and its trial run is likely to start soon. The tunnel may be opened to the public by November. The project, which started in November 2017, is designed to reduce traffic congestion in and around India Gate, Ring Road and ITO. A PWD official said anti-dust measures were always being implemented. Later in the evening, they had deployed water sprinkling tankers to make the dust settle down. “Those overseeing the construction site have been instructed to ensure that the dust being raised by the construction work is properly managed and anti-dust measures are taken effectively,” said the official. The Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR (CAQM) had on Wednesday identified dust as a major problem in winter and asked road-owning agencies and civic bodies to set up a ‘dust control and management cell’. It suggested mechanized sweeping of roads, scientific disposal of dust that’s collected, use of dust suppressants and water on roads and proper maintenance and greening of non-paved roads and central verges. A senior DPCC official said dust management is a key area of the winter action plan with sprinkling of water to be carried out on all major roads, including stretches where repair or construction work is taking place. “In addition to construction sites where dust norms will have to be strictly followed, civic bodies and other government agencies will be carrying out sprinkling of water on Delhi roads to ensure minimal dust upliftment,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cost-of-pragati-you-cant-shake-off-the-dust/articleshow/86465653.cms||---

---||Business||Economy should be ‘out of the woods’ in 6 months: TVS chief||Chennai: The Indian economy should be ‘out of the woods’ in the next six months riding on good monsoon, good harvest and a mild third wave said TVS Motor Company’s chairman Venu Srinivasan. “I am confident we will be back by January because so far the third wave has been mild with almost no cases of hospitalisation required,” he said. The pandemic, is acquiring endemic status in India, he said. “By January the pandemic will be behind us as we will know how to live with it and it will become not much different from swine flu, dengue or similar fevers.” The six month period will also allow the rural economy to bounce back on the back of good rains and a good harvest. “The rural consumer was very badly affected by the second wave so they are taking longer to bounce back but they will,” he said. The impact of the second wave on the common man has also resulted in sluggishness in the two wheeler market. Two wheeler dealers have already indicated that there is no festival buzz in the market this year. Footfalls have fallen by 50% from pre-Covid levels, dealers said. “Two wheeler inventory seems to be getting bigger than even pre-Covid levels with hardly any customer walk-ins that are usually witnessed pre-festival,” said Hero Motocorp dealer Nikunj Sanghi. According to Srinivasan, the reason why two wheeler sales have not rebounded is because the consumer segment it caters to is still reeling from the impact of the pandemic. “The two wheeler is a common man product and is bought mostly by those who earn less than Rs 15,000 a month with a discretionary spend of around Rs 1,000-2,000 per month,” he said. “It’s the hawkers, hole-in-the-wall tea shops, small eateries which have been far more affected by the pandemic with one illness wiping off their entire savings. This segment is still to bounce back,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/economy-should-be-out-of-the-woods-in-6-months-tvs-chief/articleshow/86465450.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Besides demand for new homes, there is a growing number of homeowners who want to borrow to expand their houses by adding rooms. HDFC said it is hiring people for new offices that it will open in smaller towns.  The company is also training deposit agents to use the digital platform seamlessly. “About 61% of our retail deposits were on-boarded digitally as of June 30, 2021,” its MD Renu Sud Karnad said. With the upswing in the real estate sector, Indiabulls Housing Finance says it expects improved business opportunities going ahead, and has been hiring more people to create capacity to meet demand. Its chief operating officer Sachin Chaudhary said “Since March 2021, we have hired over 800 employees, of which, about 80% are in the sales team.” LIC Housing Finance says it has expanded its footprint by launching new marketing channels such as Direct Marketing Executives, Digital Offices, Regional Business Development Managers, in recent times. Another housing finance company Shriram Housing Finance said it will be hiring about 350 people in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as part of its expansion. The company’s MD and CEO Ravi Subramanian said that it has placed its agents and staff within the branches of its parent company Shriram City Union, to cross-sell home loans following strong demand in tier 2 and 3 cities. “We will add sales points across 178 branches of Shriram City Union in these two states by December end,” he said. Subramanian said there was more scope of business among the non-metro cities, as people are keen to rebuild and expand their houses with additional rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nbfcs-hire-sales-distribution-agents-amid-rising-rural-demand/articleshow/86465233.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Patna||Award of contracts: Dy CM denies charges against him||PATNA: Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad on Thursday said the allegation levelled against him regarding award of contracts under Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal scheme to his relatives was baseless and part of a political conspiracy. Prasad’s statement came after leader of opposition in state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, alleged that Prasad’s family members bagged contracts in violation of tender norms. Through a written statement to the media, Prasad said none of his family members was associated with the two companies – Deepkiran Infrastructure Private Limited and Jeevan Shree Infrastructure Private Limited – which have got the contracts for piped water scheme. He said of 2,800 schemes implemented in Katihar, his kin Pooja Kumari was involved in just four and that too as per the government’s rule. Prasad said the contract worth Rs 1.87 crore was awarded in November 2019 and it had been successfully completed before he took oath as the deputy CM of Bihar. The deputy CM hit out at Tejashwi, saying the latter was trying to divert the attention of people from FIR lodged against him for duping one Sanjiv Kumar Singh of Rs 5 crore by promising him a ticket to contest in 2019 Lok Sabha election from Bhagalpur seat. Earlier in the day, Tejashwi had lashed out at CM Nitish Kumar and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, alleging the duo were aware of the scams and also involved in it. “Saat Nishchay schemes were tailored to pump money before 2020 assembly elections. Both BJP and JD (U) leaders have got several contracts under the schemes,” Tejashwi said, adding RJD’s Katihar candidate Ram Prakash Mahto had raised this matter in August 2020 and also written a letter to Nitish in February this year. Tejashwi said when Prasad’s daughter-in-law Pooja Kumari got the contract, Sushil Modi was the deputy CM. “Prasad was a BJP MLA then and PHED was under BJP. Prasad’s son-in-law and brother-in-law were associated with the two companies which got the contracts. These companies had no experience of doing government work, which was a required criteria for getting the tender,” Tejashwi alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/award-of-contracts-dy-cm-denies-charges-against-him/articleshow/86461560.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The civic body will also take strict action against those who use and sell tobacco openly for violation of the norms under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007. Vendor licensing authorizes a business to engage in the sale of tobacco products from shops, sidewalk stands, and pushcarts. These are registered with municipalities and adhere to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003. Talking to this reporter, additional municipal commissioner, Rakesh Kumar Jha, said the civic body had a tobacco control cell under which a task force would be formed in the Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankerbagh, New Capital, Patliputra, and Patna City circles. “We need manpower to crack down on the shops that are selling tobacco products without a licence and create awareness about the rules,” Rakesh told this newspaper and added, “The civic body will also ensure that tobacco vendors do not sell items like toffees, chocolates, chips, biscuits, and soft drinks which are essentially meant for children.” According to sources, Socio-Economic and Educational Development Society (SEEDS), an NGO, will provide technical support to the PMC and help it restrict the sale and advertising of tobacco products and raise awareness about the issue. Deepak Mishra, the executive director of SEEDS, pointed out that the Bihar Municipal Act already had a provision of mandatory licence for sale of tobacco products, “but it is not followed”. He added, “Several shops selling tobacco items do not even have the licence to do so.” Deepak further said, “Now that the PMC has decided to enforce the order strictly, we will provide technical support and ensure that the city becomes smoke-free. The violators will pay anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 5,000 as fine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unlicensed-shops-selling-tobacco-to-face-action/articleshow/86461883.cms||Faryal Rumi

In a letter to the union heavy industries minister Mahendra Nath Pandey, the FADA calculated the loss due to closed workshops and dealerships and added that with the announced production stoppage at Ford, a total 170 dealerships will be affected taking the total 5-brand tally to 464 dealerships in all. Of the 64,000 job losses, the highest numbers are due to Ford and GM which accounted for 40,000 and 15,000 job losses respectively. MAN Trucks accounted for 4,500 jobs, UM 2500 and Harley Davidson 2000 jobs, said the letter. Ford is forcing its dealers to first sign Non-Disclosure Agreement before any compensation package is worked out. “Many Ford dealers have directly or indirectly requested FADA to take up the matter for amicable resolution,” said the letter. FADA has already written to the Ford management on this ‘coersive’ action and the letter requested the ministry to set up a task force to monitor the dealer and dealer employee compensation on a day-to-day basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rs-2kcr-dealer-investment-hit-64k-jobs-lost-as-five-mncs-shut-shop/articleshow/86465393.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Sarpanch held for illegal speed-breaker that killed two||VADODARA: A sarpanch of a village in Chhota Udepur district was detained on Thursday for constructing an illegal speed breaker which resulted in accidents that killed two bikers and left two co-passengers injured on Wednesday night. The sarpanch Vikram Rathwa and a tractor driver Bhavsing Rathwa who helped in making the speed-breaker were booked at Chhota Udepur police station for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police said that Vikram and Bhavsing constructed the speed breaker just after a curve on the road at Bharkundafaliya at Achhala village on Wednesday evening. The sarpanch felt that the commuters used to over-speed on that stretch which led to accidents. The duo made a non-standardized speed breaker using lumps of soil and construction waste. On Wednesday late evening one of the deceased Kanu Rathwa (52) and his friend Ishwar Rathwa were returning to their home through Achhala village. When the duo had passed the same road in the morning, there was no speed breaker. On his return journey, Kanu didn’t anticipate the speed breaker and lost control over the vehicle while driving over it. Kanu succumbed on the spot while Ishwar suffered minor injuries on left hand and leg. A while later, a couple — Soniyabhai Rathwa (60) and Zini Rathwa — too met with a similar fate. Soniyabhai did not notice the speed breaker due to the darkness and met with an accident. Soniyabhai was referred to SSG Hospital in Vadodara where he died during treatment while Zini was taken to a local hospital for treatment. As the information about the two accidents spread in the area, a huge crowd gathered at the site. While questioning the locals, police learnt that the sarpanch and Bhavsing had constructed the speed breaker. Later, based on Ishwar’s complaint, an offence was registered against the sarpanch. “We have detained Vikram and he is in quarantine as his Covid-19 test is pending. During preliminary interrogation, he said that he decided to construct the speed breaker as several accidents were taking place on the stretch,” said J K Patel, inspector of Chhota Udepur police station. “A sarpanch does not have authority construct a speed breaker on a public road,” he added. On Thursday evening, senior officials of police department, roads and buildings department and RTO visited the site for inspection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/illegal-speed-breaker-leaves-two-dead-sarpanch-booked/articleshow/86462744.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Dumped post lockdown, pets meet cruel fate||AHMEDABAD/ VADODARA: Confined within four-walls of their home due to Covid-19, a young Vadodara-based couple bought a Labrador puppy to beat isolation blues and keep them company as they worked from home earlier this year. Barely two months later, once their office started, the couple realized the dog was now a liability! The couple approached Stuti Bakshi, a yoga instructor and animal lover seeking help to find alternate pet-parents. “After their office resumed, they couldn’t make enough time to take care of the dog and suddenly it became too much of a responsibility for and therefore they wanted to sell it off,” said Bakshi, who helped to get the dog adopted within weeks of the incident. The Labrador is now part of a family where love isn’t conditional and temporary. This isn’t a lone incident. Out of their new-found love for cats and dogs, often inspired by social media trends or merely to beat loneliness of the post-lockdown work from home life, pedigree dogs and cats were increasingly adopted by people in cities of Gujarat. However, the warmth for the furry friends in many cases turned to be short-lived resulting in many horror stories for pets who were either abandoned or left at rescue centres. Rescuers and trainers, boarding and shelter homes for pets across the state confess to being flooded with requests for rehabilitating dogs and cats. For instance, Ahmedabad-based Jivdaya Charitable Trust (JCT) handled adoptions and rehabilitation of some 66 pets, including 49 breed dogs and 17 Persian cats who were found abandoned in the past year. “The number was not even half of this, a year ago. Many people bought or adopted puppies giving into social media trends. They may love dogs and cats but people fail to understand it’s a lifetime of responsibility and conveniently give them away for random excuses,” said Gira Shah, managing trustee, JCT. Excuses cited by pet-parents to discard their pawed wards betrayed how adopting pets was a fad than a well thought out decision. "People cited reasons, namely the dog suddenly became too big! Someone in the family is not comfortable in a dog or cat’s presence. The pet is too aggressive. The pet has a medical condition and the family is simply unwilling to bear the expenses. Now, these things must be thought out before adopting. People must realise they’re dealing with life and not an object,” exclaimed Shah. In many cases, people simply abandon dogs or give them away because they cannot bear the medical costs. For instance, Luci, a German shepherd pup was adopted by a family in Ahmedabad but soon after it caught parvo infection, the family called for a city-based rescuer citing it can’t afford medical bills. “I brought the pup home and got it treated but unfortunately, the dog didn’t survive. Against merely three to four calls in a month before the lockdown from families wanting to give away their dogs, I’ve now been attending to some six to eight calls every single week,” said Devesh Trivedi, an Ahmedabad-based dog rescuer, who has handled rehabilitation of some 20 dogs this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/post-lockdown-pet-love-proves-short-lived/articleshow/86465643.cms||Niyati Parikh

But a clause that requires the export to be completed before the fishing ban — when hilsa breeds — kicks in on October 4 has queered the pitch. Bangladeshi exporters and Indian importers said it was virtually impossible to conclude the massive transaction within the next 10 days. Earlier, the Bangladesh commerce ministry had mistakenly given time till October 10 to complete the trade. “On Wednesday and Thursday, Bengal received 120 tonnes hilsa. In the next 10 days, we can realistically get a further 600 tonnes. That means export of over 3,800 tonnes of the fish will remain unrealised. This will be a huge disappointment for hilsa lovers. We are therefore urging the Bangladesh government to allow export to resume once the fishing ban ends in the country,” said West Bengal Fish Importers Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood. On Thursday, Maqsood spoke to Bangladesh high commissioner in Delhi, requesting him to speak to the authorities to allow the export of the entire consignment permitted. Maqsood explained that while it was improbable to land 4,600 tonnes of hilsa in harbours within 10 days, Indian importers also needed to apply for the sanitary import permit (SIP) from the Indian agriculture ministry. The permits are issued against the names of export agencies. The first lot of hilsa arrived in markets across the city on Thursday, causing a buzz among buyers. The hilsa weighing between 800g and 1.5kg sold for Rs 1,300-Rs 1,600 a kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangla-doubles-hilsa-bounty-but-date-clause-a-hurdle/articleshow/86466022.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The state cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod to a set of new rules called Bihar Prohibition and Excise Rules, 2021, which has been sent for gazette notification. Cabinet secretariat department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said on Wednesday under the new rule, only that section of the premises would be sealed where the liquor bottle is found. However, if any house or premises is used for the manufacture, bottling, storage, sale, export and import of liquor, the entire premises would be sealed. Also, the storage, sale and consumption of liquor has been permitted within confines of the Army cantonment and military installation area in the state. However, no defence person, including those who have retired, would be allowed to consume liquor outside the cantonment or the military installation area in the state. Besides, trucks loaded with legal consignments of liquor would be permitted to enter the state only through the designated check posts, and then they will have to pass through the state through the designated check post in 24 hours. The cabinet also cleared the rules governing the production of extra neutral alcohol (ENA) and foodgrain-based ethanol at distilleries according to which the production of the two specific items has to be done under the 24-hour CCTV surveillance. Further, the CCTV footage has to be preserved for one month. That apart, the cabinet, giving clearance to the proposal moved by the education department, paved the way for the creation of 8,386 posts of physical teachers cum health instructors at the equal number of government primary schools. Each of them would receive the honorarium worth Rs 8,000 per month and will be subject to increase by Rs 200 per year. Further, for the smooth running of the Bihar State Higher Education Council, the cabinet cleared the creation of 20 posts, including seven to be filled by regular appointment or deputation and 13 others on contractual terms. The cabinet gave its sanction to the one-time removal of the mandatory 75% attendance at various government schools for 2021-22 fiscal, as the students were asked not to attend schools owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. This would benefit 2.10 lakh students. As the mandatory 75% attendance has been removed, the money due to the students against scholarship and various schemes, including related to school unforms and cycle as well as incentives for girl students, would be credited to their bank accounts through the direct benefit transfer (DBT) method. The government’s contributory pension scheme that was meant for its employees appointed after September 11, 2005 would now be extended to all other employees, as per the resolution of the government dated August 31, 2005. The cabinet also sanctioned the payment of increased DA for the employees, pensioners and family pension holders covered by the sixth central pay commission from 164% to 189%, effective from July 1, 2021. Similarly, the DA for the employees, pensioners and family pension holders under the fifth central pay commission has been increased from 312% to 389%, effective from July 1, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-government-relaxes-stringent-provisions-of-prohibition-law/articleshow/86461520.cms||---

Their contract came to an end on August 31, leaving them without work. The renewal of their contract has now brought them relief. On Thursday, the government renewed the contract of 400 such migrant labourers, mostly from Murshidabad. “I became unemployed after our contract came to an end. Now, we will be back on our feet. This brings us a lot of cheer ahead of Bengal’s biggest festival,” said Khudu Shiekh, a mason from Shaktipur who had come back from Mumbai last year. The Mamata Banerjee government had set up the Covid Warriors’ Club to rehabilitate migrant labourers like Shiekh. After a brief training, they were sent to Covid hospitals to assist doctors and nurses. “The Covid warriors helped with feeding, taking care of hygiene and keeping a watchful eye on patients. We are happy they will return to the wards,” said Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BG) medical superintendent and vice-principal Asis Manna. ID Hospital, Medical College Hospital and MR Bangur Hospital were the first ones where these migrant labourers were deployed. Some, who had studied till high school and higher secondary, were trained by doctors in taking blood pressure, monitoring oxygen saturation, and fitting high-flow nasal cannula. During the surge, they had put in extra effort and hours in patient care. So, when their contract ended on August 31, doctors at ID Hospital urged the hospital authorities to appeal to the health department to reinstate them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-renews-cov-warriors-contract/articleshow/86465979.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Lucknow||UP reinvents family planning program: Health staff to educate newly wed couple in front of mother-in-law||LUCKNOW: Rural men can no longer shy away from their role in reproductive health and planning babies with the Uttar Pradesh health department re-inventing its family planning programme. In a novel initiative, the state government has directed the department to call married men to the Saas Bahu Sammelans, a platform where health staff educate newly-wed women about reproductive health and the importance of spacing between children in the presence of their mothers-in-law. Sons attending Saas Bahu Beta Sammelan in Gonda districtWomen who benefitted from family planning share their experiences, clear doubts of others and collect contraceptive pills and condoms. Started in 2010, the sammelans became instant hit as they gave women a chance to enjoy through poetry recitals, singing and activities like Rangoli making after discussion. However, the role of males in family planning remained dismal as not more than three men come forward for 100 women in UP which is home to over four crore eligible couples. A health worker welcoming a son at the saas bahu beta sammelan in Sitapur DistrictOf the total, 20.3% or nearly 80 lakh belong to the 15-24 years age group but account for 32.2% of total fertility as per the Sample Registration Survey of 2017. However, the unmet need of family planning in this group is about 90% and it also accounts for 38% of total maternal deaths in country. A health worker welcoming a son at the saas bahu beta sammelan in Deoria DistrictInternal surveys show that women have little control over their bodies and no role in decisions on wanting to have a baby or not and using contraception or family planning methods. In fact, many women admitted that sexual union was often imposed, and they had to face violence if they asked their husbands to use condoms. In conclusion, men hold the key to family planning decisions at home. Evidence also speaks for this. The report ‘Unintended Pregnancy, Abortion and Post-Abortion Care in Uttar Pradesh’ brought out by Guttmacher Institute in 2018 revealed that over 50% of the pregnancies in UP were unintended. Of these, the majority, estimated at 32 lakh (64%), ended in termination of pregnancy while 25% translated into births resulting in 11 lakh unwanted births, besides additional 2,294 maternal and over 50,000 infant deaths, including 37,000 neo-natal deaths each year. In the order making Saas Bahu Beta Sammelans mandatory, MD, National Health Mission, UP, Aparna U said, “It has been observed that the role of men supersedes everything else in matters of family. Therefore, it is important to make the sons understand the importance of family planning. Thus, the traditional saas bahu sammelans should have the presence of sons as well.” Only men whose wives are present in the sammelan can attend it. The health department will invite husbands of high-risk pregnant women, couples who have never used family planning methods, and those having three or more children. Health experts are all praise for the unique initiative. “Family planning is a shared responsibility and unless men understand their role, the stereotypes will continue to drive their decisions. The new strategy promises to change the picture,” said Prof SN Shankhwar, head of urology department, KGMU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-reinvents-family-plannning-prog-health-staff-to-educate-newly-wed-couple-in-front-of-mother-in-law/articleshow/86467786.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The tables have turned since Zahida Khan became the first girl in Bagdora region (a cluster of 52 villages sharing the same lineage) to have completed her graduation degree in 2015. She has been able to change the mindset of the conservative Meo Muslim community forever. The secondary school in Mirzapur now has 300 girl students. Almost 70% eligible girls from the houses are set to change the destiny of the village. The latest change-maker being Shabnam Khan, who is an engineering final year student at Modern Institute of Technology and Research Centre, Alwar. She has become the first Meo girl from the region to have grabbed a government job by clearing junior engineer (civil) examination. Mirzapur village had zero literacy among its females until the 2001 Census. It touched 9% literacy rate in 2011 and is expected to touch a 30% literacy rate among females in the 2021 Census. In a bid to give back to the society, Shabnam has opened a learning centre in Mirzapur that teaches 30 girls, who cannot afford to study. “I had almost dropped out after my Class 10 exams as my school was a secondary one. My father showed courage and enrolled me in a senior secondary school in Alwar,” said Khan, who is working towards attaining a 50% basic literacy among the women in her village by 2023. Losing her father and elder brother in a span of five years did not affect her strong determination. “My mother had to face taunts from relatives and villagers for supporting my education after losing both earning members. I told her that one day all these people will honour you,” said Shabnam, who is seen as a role model now. The relatives, who attempted to assassinate her character had recently organised a programme to honour her and projected her as a role model for the girls. The Meo dominated village is a part of the Bagdora region, which has poor socio-economic conditions. The region has 52 villages under two tehsils, Tijara and Kishangarh Bas. “The conservative mindset of Meo Muslims shaped by the bloody history of the last 400 years has never allowed the women to step out of their houses without a male chaperone,” said Noor Mohammed, director of Alwar-Mewat Institute of Education and Development. “Formal education was out of the question until a collaborative movement was started involving religious, social and political leaders resulting in the success story of Zahida,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mirzapur-women-take-charge-give-push-to-female-education/articleshow/86467791.cms||Shoeb Khan

Continued rainfall has increased water level in Sukhna lake. One of the three floodgates of Sukhna Lake was opened on Thursday when the water level reached 1,162.65 feet. The gate was closed after some time when the water level went down. UT chief engineer C B Ojha said the gate was opened as a precautionary measure to prevent a flood-like situation in areas like Baltana and Zirakpur. Earlier, the gates were opened on September 21. Before that, they were opened on August 14 and August 9 this year. The two floodgates had to be opened in August last year after water level of the lake breached the danger mark. On September 24, 2018, incessant rain in the catchment area forced officials to open two floodgates. At the time, gates were opened after 10 years. After opening the floodgates, Sukhna Choe carried excess water of the lake to the Ghaggar river. Floodgates were opened last year when water level reached 1,163.4 feet and the gush of water led to flooding in Baltana area of Mohali district. The department decided to release small amounts of water to prevent a repeat, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-opens-floodgates-of-sukhna-lake-for-second-time-in-3-days/articleshow/86465529.cms||---

The petitioner after completing masters degree, joined BL at the Government Law College, Tirunelveli in 2015. After completing the degree, he applied to the Bar Council to enroll him as an advocate. The council informed him that he would not be permitted as the police in their verification report had stated that over 80 criminal cases were registered against him from 2017 to 2019.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to assemble peaceably and without arms are fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Every citizen has the right to comment and have their own views on the policies of governments. The petitioner had taken part in some protests raising voice against the government policies. Nowhere it was stated that the petitioner was involved in heinous crimes or anti-national or anti-social activities.Citing Article 47 of the Constitution , the court said that the duties of the state in protecting the environment are basically the rights of the people. The judges observed that in one of the cases, the petitioner along with other students raised slogans against the government seeking to ban Sterlite. “The protest or demonstration organized by the group of students including the petitioner was actually towards fulfilment of their fundamental duty under Article 48 (A) of the Constitution,” observed the judges.Taking note of the status reports submitted by the Tirunelveli and Tuticorin police, the judges observed that though they have listed out the cases in which the petitioner had allegedly been involved, his name did not find place in the FIRs. Subsequently, all these cases were transferred to the CBI. The petitioner’s name was not found in the chargesheet as well as the supplementary chargesheet filed by the CBI.The judges observed that the court is at loss to understand as to how council had denied the petitioner’s enrollment merely relying on the police report, without getting any report from the CBI and without resorting to any inquiry. The court has no hesitation to hold that the enrollment of the petitioner has been unjustly denied by the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-relief-for-law-graduate-directs-bar-council-to-enroll-him-as-advocate/articleshow/86465586.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The claimants include Jivraj Singh’s widow, three children and his aged parents. MACT member M M Walimohammed, also the extra joint district and additional sessions judge, issued the order on September 14 and a copy was made available on Thursday. Appearing for the claimants, counsel V K Singh had told the tribunal that when Jivraj, then 36, was killed, he was running a business of packing clothes and doubled up as a broker. He used to earn around Rs 6.2 lakh a year. On February 4, 2016, at around 4pm, Jivraj was riding a motorcycle when a truck coming from behind rammed into the bike at Rajnoli village in Bhiwandi. Jivraj was thrown off the bike and died. The insurance company contested the claim, but the tribunal held that the dependents are entitled to compensation. It directed the owner of the truck from Paraivali village in Bhiwandi and Iffco Tokio General Insurance Co Ltd to jointly make the payment. The truck owner did not appear. In his order, the judge noted: “...the registration of crime at Kongaon police station against the offending vehicle driver on the basis of the complaint, drawing up of panchnama, proves the involvement of the offending vehicle and negligent driving on the part of driver… This proves the culmination of death of deceased in vehicular accident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-trader-cum-broker-killed-as-truck-hits-bike-kin-get-rs-87-3l/articleshow/86467220.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

He indicated that a discussion with chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, the local legislator and SCB elected members would soon take place. As the Cantonment area is not under control of the state government and comes under Union Defence Ministry, people are facing inconvenience from road closures to lack of infrastructure, KTR said. “It is happening due to lack of coordination between the Cantonment board and the Telangana government. The Telangana government is building many flyovers in GHMC limits, but in SCB we cannot build them as we don’t have access to defence land to build flyovers under SRDP. Non- implementation of TS-bPASS and allotment of Annapurna canteens in the Cantonment are other issues,” he said. Animal husbandry minister, Talasani Srinivas Yadav also echoed the same thoughts, while addressing a public meeting at Rasoolpura in Secunderabad Cantonment, where he inaugurated 2-BHK housing scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/70-people-want-scb-to-merge-with-ghmc-ktr/articleshow/86465596.cms||Sunil Mungara

With educational institutions in Dakshina Kannada commencing in-person classes for grades VI to X and PU, city buses between Talapady and Mangaluru were witnessing a huge rush during peak hours. TOI had highlighted about various organisations, including Sahayathri, appealing to the chief minister of Karnataka and Dakshina Kannada district administration to resume KSRTC bus services between the Kerala border in Talapady and Mangaluru city. Government buses from Kerala are operating between Kasaragod and Talapady. However, KSRTC buses from Mangaluru division had stopped service due to the surge in Covid-19 cases in Kasaragod district and other parts of Kerala. Due to lack of sufficient number of buses, students and daily commuters from Kasaragod were made to travel in packed city buses from Talapady to Manglauru. Considering the requests of inter-state daily commuters and students from Kasaragod district, the Dakshina Kannada district administration has directed KSRTC Mangaluru division to resume services between Mangaluru and Talapady. DK deputy commissioner K V Rajendra told TOI that he has directed KSRTC Mangaluru division to operate buses by following the Covid-19 protocol. “I have instructed KSRTC officials to resume service between Mangaluru and Talapady,” he said. KSRTC Mangaluru divisional controller S N Aruna said based on the requirement buses will be operated between Mangaluru and Talapady from Friday. KSRTC buses from Karnataka and Kerala were operating between Mangaluru and Kasaragod with a three minutes frequency before the pandemic. After the first lockdown, bus services on the route were suspended. Later, in June and July this year, KSRTC buses from Mangaluru depot were operating between Mangaluru and Talapady. However, since Covid-19 continued in Kerala, the services on the stretch were also suspended again, and only city buses were operating between Mangaluru and Talapady. Students and daily commuters from Kerala are now allowed with RT-PCR negative reports, and they should repeat the tests once in seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ksrtc-buses-between-talapady-mluru-from-today/articleshow/86463312.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Death risk cut by 50% for dialysis patients after first Covid dose, says study||HYDERABAD: A study on impact of pandemic on dialysis patients has shown that even a single shot of the vaccine helped limit infection, hospitalisation and also cut risk of death by 50%. “We found that those patients on dialysis who had taken even one dose of the vaccine had as much as 33% reduced risk of getting Covid-19 compared to the unvaccinated. What was even more notable that the risk of death in case of Covid-19 infection was halved,” said principal investigator Dr Vivekanand Jha. The study by NephroPlus, a network of dialysis centres, was carried out for the first and the second Covid-19 wave across the country. Of the 14,573 dialysis patients who were part of the study during the first wave, it was found that 99% of those infected with Covid-19 had to be hospitalised for an average of 12 days and the mortality rate stood at 23%. During the second wave, the study monitored 17,662 dialysis patients across the country and had a higher mortality rate. “Of these 17,662 dialysis patients, 1,111 or over 6% were infected with Covid-19, but the mortality was a staggering 32.7%. This is far greater than mortality recorded in 2019 within the same period. Age is another important variable that comes to bear in the study. The mean age of Covid-19 infected people was 53.6, with 45% of all affected above the age of 55,” read the study published in the international nephrology journal, Kidney International Reports. The ripple effect on dialysis patients not infected with Covid-19 was also found to be massive. “Due to various factors such as closure of dialysis centres after being converted as Covid centres by government and reluctance to go for dialysis sessions resulting in reduced frequency of treatment, mortality among uninfected dialysis patients increased from 15% to 20% this year compared to previous year. This shows that even those not infected with Covid-19 had poorer outcomes,” the study revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/study-death-risk-cut-by-50-for-dialysispatients-after-1st-dose/articleshow/86465663.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP finalises names to be nominated for Vidhan Parishad||LUCKNOW: In a politically crucial move, the BJP is learnt to have finalised the names of candidates who are proposed to be nominated for the four MLC seats which got vacated on July 5. The decision, highly placed sources in the BJP said, was taken at the crucial core committee meeting of the party called at the residence of CM Yogi Adityanath on Thursday late evening. The meeting was attended by Union minister and UP election in charge of party, Dharmendra Pradhan, co-in charge Anurag Thakur, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation), Sunil Bansal. Sources said that the leaders formally pitched for nominating the MLCs to send out strong political signals ahead of the UP polls due in the next few months. All four seats which got vacated were held by the SP -- Sri Ram Yadav, Lilawati Kushwaha, Ram Vraksh Yadav and Jitendra Yadav. The issue of proposed cabinet expansion also factored in the core committee meeting. But no final decision was taken at the time of filing this report. All eyes will be trained on the BJP which is expected to factor in caste arithmetic while nominating four members to legislative council in the coming days to counter an aggressive opposition in the run up to UP assembly elections due next year.  Since the seats are of nomination category and there is no involvement of the election commission, no time limit has been fixed for completing the process. In fact, one of four seats has been lying vacant since September 2020 when SP MLC Sri Ram Singh Yadav died of Covid. While BJP keeps the names of prospective candidates close to its chest, speculations have been rife about Congress turncoat and former Union minister Jitin Prasada, a Brahmin, being routed to the upper house of UP assembly.  Likewise, the BJP may attempt to keep Nishad party chief Sanjay Nishad in good humor to consolidate its position among the MBC, especially Mallah and its 17 sub-castes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-finalises-names-to-be-nominated-for-parishad/articleshow/86467799.cms||Pankaj Shah

In fact, accumulation of water on roads, overflowing drains, sewage water entering houses has become a common sight almost every time the city experiences rainfall, especially since the floods last year. When TOI recently visited some of the water-logged and inundated areas of Bashrat Nagar in Kalapathar, Kodandaram Nagar, P&T colony and Seesala Basthi in Saroornagar and Yousufguda reverberated with a cry of help. Authorities have turned a blind eye to the encroachments on nalas and the plight of flood-affected residents, many local residents said. “We have no other option but to abandon our houses for at least two or three days every time it rains. Even the encroachments on nalas have increased significantly in the last few years,” said P Gopal, a resident of Kodandaram Nagar. In Bashrat Nagar, where the streets are now filled with slush and overflowing drains, residents were cursing politicians out of helplessness and frustration. “Our children are falling sick due to the stagnant sewage water and garbage that has been accumulating in street corners after the rainwater recedes,” rued Noureen Begum, a resident of Bashrat Nagar. GHMC officials, on the other hand, are gearing up for a fresh round of survey of the storm water drains in the city. The officials said that decision to conduct a fresh survey has been taken to enumerate encroachments which have already been removed, to widen the drains. However, seeking some time to provide the exact number of encroachments removed, GHMC’s deputy city planner K Mallikarjuna Rao said, “The nala widening and restoration works are being taken up in several areas. In some areas, land acquisition is underway by giving compensation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/low-lying-colonies-in-kalapathar-saroornagar-crying-out-for-attention/articleshow/86465685.cms||Moulika.KV

The farmer, police said, was reeling under debt and had a fight with his friend after which he took the extreme step. The double suicide happened in Sanpkheda village, barely 3km from the Shajapur district HQ and 150km west of Bhopal. According to police, Ishwar Singh woke up at 5am and asked his wife Lakshmi if she would take poison with him. When she said yes, Ishwar swallowed a poisonous substance from a packet, left another packet for her on the bed, and walked out of the house to die in the fields. He never made it that far and fell unconscious on the road. Their 16-year-old daughter Khushboo woke up to this horror. Distraught, she took poison, too. Her younger brother was trying to come to grips with the shock, when he saw their mother also trying to kill herself. He snatched the packet from her and threw it away. Khushboo was taken to the same hospital her father had been a little earlier. They were both declared dead on arrival. The village was left shell-shocked. Senior police officers led a team to the village to understand what triggered the double-suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/debt-ridden-farmer-16-yr-old-daughter-die-by-suicide-in-mp/articleshow/86465701.cms||---

City police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said that a special meeting chaired by mayor Premanand Shetty on August 14 had resolved to make the road a one-way. The Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has been developing the road, footpaths and circles to convert the road stretches into one-ways. Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) commissioner Akshy Sridhar has sent a letter requesting the city police to make necessary arrangements for the implementation of one-way traffic. The ACP traffic has submitted a report with suggestions based on the letter from the MCC commissioner. Accordingly, the road stretches are declared one-way and movement of vehicles will not be allowed from the opposite direction, the police commissioner stated. The new traffic arrangement will solve the congestions at major junctions on the stretch, and reduce the number of accidents. The median constructed on the stretches will be removed to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles. The issue of lack of parking space can be solved by allowing parking on one side of the road, after the implementation of one-way traffic. The ACP traffic will make necessary arrangements to erect signboards announcing one-way traffic on the roads, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/clock-tower-stretch-via-hamilton-circle-declared-one-way/articleshow/86463414.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 4 SIMI suspects walk out on bail, ATS to file appeal||BHOPAL: Four alleged SIMI activists -- Siddique, Ismail Mashaalkar, Umer Dandoti and Irfan -- residents of Solapur district in Maharashtra were released from Bhopal Central jail on Thursday after being granted bail by the Supreme Court. Madhya Pradesh ATS has decided to file an appeal against the bail, sources say. The undertrials – who spent nearly eight years in prison -- were released around 9pm after jail authorities completed all the paperwork. Their family members were waiting outside the walls to receive them. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court granted bail to the four alleged SIMI activists on the ground that the district court, which decided their case, had no jurisdiction to extend their judicial custody. They were arrested in December 2013 for harbouring and aiding the fugitives of the Khandwa jailbreak in October that year in which seven alleged SIMI activists had broken out of the prison after knifing two guards. They were charged under UAPA, Arms Act and IPC sections for attempted murder, forgery and criminal conspiracy, and were locked up in Bhopal jail, along with 28 other SIMI suspects. On March 20, 2014, on an application moved on behalf of MP anti-terror squad (ATS), the Bhopal chief judicial magistrate had granted extension of jail remand to Siddique, Ismail, Umer and Irfan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/4-simi-suspects-walk-out-on-bail-ats-to-file-appeal/articleshow/86465719.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Hero stones, sculpture of ‘Rani Mangammal’ found||MADURAI: Two rare hero stones and a sculpture, estimated to be about 300 years old, have been found at Thottapanaickanur near Usilampatti in Madurai district. These were found about 200 to 300 metres apart near a temple known as Malaikoil. Historian T Gandhirajan and his team stumbled upon these structures near a fortification wall in the Thottapanaickanur pass between Usilampatti and Andipatti. They were exploring the routes to Chera Nadu (Chera kingdom) from Tamil Nadu through Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts when they came across the wall, about six feet in thickness extending for a kilometre. This was an important point between the Pandiya and Chera kingdoms. Gandhirajan said the route through this path is said to have been re-laid during the period of Rani Mangammal, who ruled Madurai. The hillock on this route is said to have been inhabited by a tribal population of Moopars, who were dominant in the region 300 years ago. Local people still refer to the road as Rani Mangammal road, he said. The relief sculptures were about three feet tall including the pedestal, and about two feet wide. The first hero stone appeared like a tribal chief, a hunter by profession, as depicted by the bow and arrow in his hand. Sculptures of deer and wild boar on top also strengthen this theory. The female sculpture may be of his wife is seen near the male sculpture. There are ten lines inscribed on it, each comprising three to four words. It may belong to the 17th century AD or early 18th century. Gandhirajan said it is among the first hero stones to be identified in the region of a tribal chief. Moopar community people still worship this statue, he said. ``Adaikalangatha thanappan Magan, Periya Adaikka Moopan Maruvi,’’ reads the inscription on this stone. Gandhirajan said that the second hero stone was carved on three sides. There were sculptures of a king on his horse, his consort or queen standing nearby and flanked by two soldiers on both sides. ``This may be the sculpture of a Nayak king or chieftain,’’ he said. One of the soldiers is seen holding the umbrella above the head of the monarch and the other seen in a stride behind. ``This is an excellent exhibition in a highly classical approach, with intricate detailing,’’ he said. The sculpture of the female found along with these hero stones may be that of Rani Mangammal, (1680 AD to 1704 AD) as she is worshipped as a goddess in this region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hero-stones-sculpture-of-rani-mangammal-found/articleshow/86465722.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Arid village turns into avian haven||DETHLI (BECHARAJI): They say the best gift you can give to the coming generation is water. But credit has to be given to the water-starved residents of a tiny hamlet adjoining the famous Bahucharaji temple in Mehsana. They took this message a step ahead and created a legacy for its generations to behold -- an oasis in their once-barren wasteland.  Dethali, a village with a population of about 1,300, woke up to the stench from rotting garbage emanating from a heavily silted and encroached lake till two decades ago. But soon, life found a way and the villagers created a watering hole not only to fill their own lungs, but to breathe life into its flora and fauna as well. A veritable oasis sprawling across 30 acres brimming with nine crore liters of water that keep surface water intact and replenishes several water bodies around. Bird friendly lake design attracts nearly 150 different avian species that has transformed Dethli into a mini bird sanctuary in its own unique way. In fact, 17 small water bodies around the village, have also been restored. So, what infused life in this austere land. While it was the perseverance of villagers and some natives settled abroad, the rejuvenation was inspired by Jain scholar Muni Jambuvijayji Maharaj, a polyglot, who mastered 18 languages, and a passionate propounder of Jeevdaya or animal welfare. He was a native of the village. Mayur Shah, an Indo-Japan expert with ancestral roots in Dethali said, “This is nothing short of a revolution. The village falls in the path of migratory birds, but not a single one came here as the lake was heavily silted. My father Somchand Shah started the work of desilting the lake and with the help of villagers and forest department, the work was completed within the first decade of the 21st century.” Shah added, “We have developed the natural eco-system for birds to thrive. We also made three islands in the lake for the nesting of birds, creating a natural chabutaro for waterfowls and passerine birds.” The regeneration process started through conservation of biodiversity -- desiltation of the lake, removal of encroachments on and around it and working on building embankments to store water in a modern scientific manner. Wildlife expert Priyvrat Gadhvi, who is helping the village in this project said, “This effort is a great example of community-based environmental action, leading to a win-win scenario for people and the natural world. The restoration the lake has ensured the area becomes a thriving paradise for avian life as well as a biodiversity microcosm.”  Village sarpanch Bhikhabhai Patel adds, “We have 1,000 m lake front which will be nicely developed as a tourist attraction. We will ensure that birds are not disturbed by human activity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drought-hit-village-now-brims-with-water-birds-too/articleshow/86463484.cms||Tushar Prabhune

---||Delhi||Five cutoffs and a special list: Tight race for DU begins on October 1||New Delhi: Delhi University (DU) will declare five cutoff lists and a special list for the upcoming undergraduate admissions, officials said on Thursday. While the first cutoff list will be declared on October 1, the admissions will begin on October 4. The online portal to register for the merit-based undergraduate courses was open between August 2 and August 31. According to senior DU officials, the first list is being declared in October to ensure that students who appeared for their board re-examinations this month can update their marks on the portal. Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of the DU admissions committee, said the complete schedule for the subsequent lists was likely to be announced this week. “As of now, it has been decided there will be five cutoff lists for the merit-based courses and a special list,” he said. While the admissions to the merit-based courses will be based on the cutoff list declared by each college, applicants under the extracurricular activities and sports categories will be taken on the basis of related certificates. DU has announced that students will be permitted to submit certificates from the last four years and the best of three certificates will be considered. This year, the cutoff marks are likely to soar due to the high percentage of marks received by students in their respective board examinations. St Stephen’s College, a religious minority college that conducts its own admissions outside the DU process, has already started interviewing shortlisted candidates. The college announced a cutoff point of 99.5% for economics (H) for commerce and humanities students — an increase both from the 98.75% for humanities students last year and 99.25% for science students.

Addressing the note to the police whom he called “kayda na rakshako” (protectors of law), he starts with a line of poetry: “Manjhi musafir le chalo nij desh bhani (O sailor take me to my own country)”. He goes on to mention “visitor visa” indicating that every human being is a visitor to this world. “Now, I have been feeling for some time that my expiry date has come. I have lived 80 years and do not want to extract 20% more profit from this life,” he stated in the note. He stated in the suicide note that he has been having nutritious food, medicines and walk around 3kms a day, even then, there are many complications that irritate him. “I have been suffering from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), prostate, asthma, blurred vision and a steel plate in my leg following a fracture decades ago which has been irritating me and is very painful,” he stated in the suicide note. Recalling the Bard of Avon’s words, he wrote, “I have played my role on the stage of this world with all my heart and wisdom. But now, the role needs to be ended. It is time to exit the stage of this world. So, more new persons can come to play their role on this stage.” He said that he does not want to become a burden on his family, society and the country. “It would not suit on me that I become a burden,” he stated. Pleading that his family members should not be harassed by intense questioning for his suicide which was his decision only, he wrote, “My suicide can be criticized widely and it can be widely projected in media also but do not harass my family.” Vyas demanded that his body or organs be donated. He asked for his late rites to be completed in an electric crematorium the use of wooden pyre, and specified that no post-death rituals be held. He ended the suicide note with an “alvida” (good bye), beneath which he and his wife signed their names. On the other side of the paper, he added, “More details (about his suicide) are present in a SPIPA blue file which can be got by asking Miss Rajan.” Police sent the suicide note to FSL for further examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/its-time-to-exit-stage-of-this-world/articleshow/86465827.cms||---

Around 20% students of private schools have shifted to government schools this year. Reason: Parents who lost their jobs and business during Covid are unable to continue the academics of their wards in private schools. DEO Bhopal, Nitin Saxena said that this year around 20% students from private schools have taken admission in government schools. “Several students have taken admission in government schools this year. Around 20% of them are from private schools. Government schools have raised their standards in both teaching and infrastructure,” said DEO Saxena. Even in Subhash Excellence School the number of students from private schools have increased. “Excellence school of Bhopal is doing a great job. Even in normal situations the number of students from private schools to take admission in our Excellence School has been high. This year, it is even higher,” added DEO Saxena. Parents who have taken admission in government schools said that they were left with no option after losing their work. “I was a bus driver. I was somehow managing to send my child to a private school. However, the situation has changed now as I am doing some other work which is not enough to keep my child in private schools. I have now sent my child to a government school,” said Raju Malviya. Another parent said that they have shifted from other city for work. “We had a business in Raisen. However, during Covid it has been shut down. We have now shifted to Bhopal to start a new job. However, this has resulted in our struggling financial situation. Due to this reason, I have admitted our students to a government school. And it is a good school to study,” said a parent. Another parent said that they were happy after admitting their children in a government school. “Earlier, we were a little sceptical in admitting our children in government school. However, we are happy after getting them admitted in government school,” said a mother Chanda Ahirwar.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: 4 of 6 cinema halls shut down again as viewers stay away||BHOPAL: Four of the six cinema halls in the city, which had opened about a month ago with the arrival of Akshay Kumar-starrer Bollywood film ‘Bell Bottom’, have closed down again. “Four of six cinema halls — Jyoti, Raj, Rangmahal and Rambha — have closed down. Only Bharat and Sangam cinema halls are open”, said secretary of Bhopal Cine Association Azeez Ahmed. During the period of one month, four new films were screened but failed to bring back people to cinema halls. Besides, no new film released last Friday nor any film is scheduled to release on Friday this week. “All the cinema halls will close down. There are no new films nor there are viewers. Cinema halls will open again when a new film releases,” said president of Bhopal Cine Association, Deepak Simhal. “I closed down my cinema hall. There is no point running it when there are no viewers. There were occasions during the screening of Kangana Ranaut’s ‘Thalaivi’ when there were just two-three people watching “, said Bunny Singh, owner of Rang Mahal Cinema Hall. The cinema halls and multiplexes except for Cinepolis, which operates from DB Mall, had opened a long time after they were given permission by the district administration because there were no new releases and they were apprehensive that people may still avoid coming to cinema halls due to fear of a third wave, a fear that has come true. Three cinema halls had opened after Deewali last year also after the first wave and except for one — Bharat Talkies — the other two had closed down shortly after opening. “In pre-Covid days, we had a collection of Rs 50,000 per show but now it has come down to Rs 10,000 per week. How can we run cinema halls in such a situation?”, said Bunny Singh. When asked why people are not coming to watch films in cinema halls according to him, Singh said “There is fear of Corona and the administration allowing only 50% of the capacity crowd in a show, asking for a vacant seat between two viewers, also makes a psychological impact on people. For at least the next 2-3 years cinema halls will have a bad time”, he said. “It’s not only fear of Corona that is keeping the people away from cinema halls. Corona has also changed the habits of people as well. They have explored new avenues to keep themselves engaged, entertained — OTT being one of them. And, now they are so used to watching films on OTT platforms that they are not going to cinema halls and multiplexes. Economy plays an important role in decision making and they realise that by spending Rs 500 to get a connection of any OTT platform, they can see a lot of films and much more on their mobile rather than spending much more to go and see a film in a cinema hall or a multiplex”, said Brajesh Sharma, a Bollywood fan. Azeez Ahmed, when asked whether people’s fancy to watch a film on silver screen has diminished, said “No. People will come when a good film is screened,” he said, adding, the release of Rohit Shetty’s ‘Suryavanshi’ starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif on October 14 may turn out to be that day. Till then, cinema halls in Bhopal have no choice but to put the shutters down, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/4-of-6-cinema-halls-shut-down-again-as-viewers-stay-away/articleshow/86465849.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Health officials said it is not a cause for alarm, urging better cooperation from the public in following safety measures and vaccination.In Madurai district, 414 cases have been reported so far in September. While the average number of new Covid-19 cases has been marginal in rural areas, there has been an increase in urban areas in the last few days. According to the data accessed by TOI, within Madurai Corporation limits, 92 Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the last five days between September 19 and September 23. This is 75% of 123 cases recorded in the last five days in the district.The data also shows that 55% of the cases reported in the last week are from corporation zone 2, comprising wards 24 to 49. “The cases are mostly scattered. But, whenever there is a case in any area, we collect samples from those living nearby and send for testing. For those who test negative, we are trying to get them all vaccinated. We are also advising all Covid-19 patients to get admitted to a tertiary care centre for proper care to be on the safer side and avoid home isolation for now,” said a senior corporation health official. The official added that five wards in Madurai Corporation have achieved 100% vaccination for Covid-19.Meanwhile, district health officials said that there has been no sudden rise in Covid-19 cases in rural areas and that there are hardly few cases. “We are yet to achieve 100% Covid-19 vaccination in any block yet but have achieved close to 70-80% vaccination in some areas. We are hoping to achieve 100% vaccination as soon as possible with more camps to be organized,” said a district health official.

---||Ahmedabad||Taught Gujarati to many bureaucrats||AHMEDABAD: The news of Gujarati linguist Yogendra Vyas’s suicide sent shockwaves among IAS, IPS, and IRS officer in Gujarat and across the country who had studied under him. It is shocking to know that the person who motivated stressed students chose to leave the world like this, said a former student, putting into words what the others felt. Since the early 1990s, Vyas was associated with the Sardar Patel Institute of Public Administration (SPIPA) after it set up an IAS training centre. He taught Gujarati language and literature to hundreds of Gujarat Public Service Commission and Union Public Service Commission aspirants. He also taught IAS and IPS officers from other states who were appointed in Gujarat to master the language. “Prof Vyas was a very sensitive and loving person. While teaching us, he just didn’t teach language and literature but aimed to motivate us. There were students who were suffering from depression in my batch due to pressure of studies. He motivated them to deal with stress and depression. Today, they have become government officers who can successfully deal with much more pressure than what they faced during their studies. It is shocking to know that the person who motivated these students chose to leave the world like this,” said Rakesh Vyas, additional collector, department of women and child welfare (nutrition), Gandhinagar. He added, “Prof Vyas trained many senior officers from states like UP and Bihar who were appointed to Gujarat and had to learn the local language to ensure better administration. I personally know many officers who know Gujarati now because of Professor Vyas’s training.” The additional collector said that the professor also lent financial help to many UPSC and GPSC aspirants who came from poor families. “His sudden demise has left a vacuum in Gujarati linguistic research,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/taught-gujarati-to-many-bureaucrats/articleshow/86465875.cms||---

Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar too said on Thursday the decision to reopen schools in Mumbai will be taken after Diwali. Pawar said although the final decision will depend on the Covid-19 situation and also on suggestions made by the task force, the state will review the situation till October 2 and thereafter a decision may be taken to reopen colleges, especially for courses where students are aged above 18 and have been fully vaccinated. He said since there is no vaccine available for children as yet, the decision to reopen schools has to be taken with extra caution. “Students who are above 18 will be vaccinated by then and we have started vaccination for teaching and non-teaching staff in a big way. We will take a review of the situation on October 2, and if the situation is favourable, a decision to reopen colleges in a phase-wise manner can be taken,” said Pawar. Currently schools and colleges are shut in most parts of the state, except in rural parts of certain districts which are Covid-free for Class VIII to XII. According to suggestions of the pediatric Covid task force, each district has to set up a monitoring committee which will take a review of the Covid19 cases and take a decision to open up educational institutes.  The expert panel has also suggested that schools should be opened first in areas with a low positivity rate and high vaccination coverage. A list of guidelines to ensure social distancing and masking within the school has been given as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/we-may-decide-on-opening-colleges-after-oct-2-in-mumbai-dy-cm/articleshow/86467886.cms||---

---||Dehradun||5 years after police horse Shaktiman died of injuries, Uttarakhand minister Ganesh Joshi acquitted||DEHRADUN: Five years after Uttarakhand Mounted Police horse Shaktiman died after allegedly being “assaulted” during a protest, the accused, BJP’s cabinet minister Ganesh Joshi and four of his associates, were acquitted by the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) court of Dehradun for “lack of credible evidence” on Thursday. “The primary reason is the carelessness and unscientific method in which testimony was presented. It is not easy to identify individuals in a crowd. CCTV footage, video recordings and still photos have always proven useful in such cases. All culprits and their motives cannot be gleaned from them but witness statements can be verified. The judge has to take a scientific and technical view of the matter,” the order said. “It is clear that the prosecution has not been able to prove the accusation beyond reasonable doubt. Because of that, the court acquits the accused.” On the afternoon of March 14, 2016, BJP members had gheraoed the assembly — Congress was then in power — to stage a protest. They were led by Mussoorie MLA Ganesh Joshi, who allegedly started beating up the 13-year-old mare with a stick, videos and photos of which were widely shared at the time. Shaktiman was badly injured and one of its hindlegs had to be amputated. A day after that, on March 18, Joshi was arrested along with his associates — Pramod Bora, Jogendra Singh Pundir, Abhishek Gond and Rahul — under Section 11 (treating animals cruelly) of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC. His first bail application had been rejected by the CJM court on the grounds that he was a powerful person who could influence the investigation. But in five days, on March 22, he was out after getting bail from the sessions court. While Shaktiman had been given a prosthetic leg, it died a month later on April 20, 2016 after battling infections and other medical complications. Joshi is now minister of soldier welfare, industrial development, MSME, khadi and village industries in the Uttarakhand government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-yrs-after-police-horse-shaktiman-died-of-injuries-ukhand-min-acquitted/articleshow/86461336.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Goa||FC Goa ease past Delhi FC to seal Durand Cup semis spot||Panaji: FC Goa demolished Delhi FC 5-1 to book their place in the semifinals of the Durand Cup at the Kalyani Stadium in Kolkata on Friday. Devendra Murgaokar, Muhammed Nemil and Brandon Fernandes scored one each for Goa in the first half. Nikhil Mali did reduce the margin in the 82nd minute for Delhi but Goa responded quickly with strikes from Leander D’Cunha and Romario Jesuraj. It was the second consecutive game Goa scored five goals and are undefeated in the tournament. Bengaluru FC and Army Green face each other in the fourth quarterfinals on Saturday. Goa will meet the winners of that tie in the semifinals on Wednesday at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan at 6pm. Before the quarterfinals, Juan Ferrando’s side were contemplating whether to pullout of the tournament or to continue as incessant rains had made the ground conditions dangerous for the players. However, the climate was favorable, and Goa took on the pitch with captain Edu Bedia and Alberto Noguera in the midfield. But it was Delhi who started on the front foot after the 2pm kick off and caused all sorts of problems in the opening minutes. Trinidad and Tobago forward Willis Plaza’s shot had to be blocked by Goa custodian Dheeraj Singh, while Anwar Ali’s header hit the side-netting. Goa took some time to regroup but there was no stopping once they got into their rhythm. In what was Goa’s first attack, Nemil found Sanson Pereira on the wings and the left-back cut in and sent the ball over Ali for an unmarked Devendra to head in the opener in the 15th minute. Three minutes later, Goa were celebrating again as Jesuraj’s cross was initially missed by Devendra but found the boots of Nemil for an easy tap in. The quick goals simply dashed Delhi’s hopes. Just before the break they conceded a needles freekick near the corner and had to pay the price. Set piece specialist Brandon stepped up and curled in a right-footer to deceive Lovepreet Singh in the Delhi goal. Goa did not leave their guard down in the second session. Redeem Tlang was unlucky to see his grounder hit the upright while there were many chances created. Delhi substitute Mali finished clinically with eight minutes remaining, but it was not enough. Soon, Goa scored their fourth through Leander’s overhead kick which took an awkward bounce before Lovepreet and found the nets. Saviour Gama then perfectly set up Jesuraj for the fifth in added time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-ease-past-delhi-fc-to-seal-durand-cup-semis-spot/articleshow/86492890.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

According to district administration, the taluka received 128 mm rain in just two hours between 6am and 8am and another 41mm between 10am and noon, altogether adding up to 188 mm rainfall in one day. The incessant downpour left low-lying areas submerged with rain water gushing into houses already ravaged by the earlier episode of flooding due to excessive rainfall 10 days ago. Heavy rain also led to water overflowing from Aji 4 dam near Tarana village of Jodiya taluka and Aji 3 dam near Khajurdi village of Padadhri taluka. With water level in Aji 3 dam brimming in its full capacity of 53 metres, two gates of the dam have been opened. The district administration issued flood warning for villages of Jodiya taluka including Bodka, Jashapar, Jiragadh, Meghpar, Rasnar, Timbdi and villages of Dhrol talukas like Modpar, Dharampur, Sagadiya. Water level in Aji 4 dam too has reached 19.5m, while its total capacity is 20.4m. The district administration has opened three gates of this dam and have kept villages coming under this dam including Balambha, Ranjitpar, Hirpara, Morana, Tarana, Madhapar, Sampar, Jamsar on alert. The Rangmati dam of Changa village in Jamnagar has also reached to its fullest capacity. District collector of Jamnagar, P S Zamsingh said, “There is no report of any damage or injury, there is water logging because of heavy rain in Jodiya. Our team is on the alert and SDRF and NDRF have also been alerted.” Nakhatrana and Rapar talukas of Kutch district also reported heavy rains since Thursday morning. In Rapar, lightning damaged a temple in Bela village and a house in Nilpar village. According to locals, heavy rain has also caused waterlogging on Naliya-Nakhatrana road leading to traffic jam. Anjar Mundra, Bhuj, Gandhidham, Lakhpat and Mandvi talukas of the district also received rain. Traffic was affected between Nakhatrana and Kotda after local river near Kotda breached its banks. Agricultural land submerged in various villages of Nakhatrana and led to heavy damage of pomegranate trees. Many local rivers in Mandvi and Nakhatrana too were overflowing resulting in flooding of roads. Rain drenches Rajkot city too The city sky remained overcast since Thursday morning while it started to rain heavily after 3pm. The evening rain threw normal life out of gear at many places while it also flooded several major roads like Yagnik road and Kalavad road. Because of the heavy rains in Jamnagar, Rajkot district administration has alerted villagers of Padadhri taluka not to venture in the river belt and have also kept rescue teams on alert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/within-10-days-jamnagar-battered-again-by-188mm-rain-in-12-hours/articleshow/86463599.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Hindu, Muslim women donate kidneys to save each other’s husbands||DEHRADUN: For over two years, Vikas Uniyal, 50, had been on haemodialysis after kidney failure. So had Ashraf Ali, 51. Both needed transplants but donor matches had not worked out. Until now, when it turned out Vikas’s wife Sushma was a match for Ashraf, and Ashraf’s wife Sultana for Vikas. After successful transplant surgeries, both are now doing well. Both Vikas and Ashraf had been patients at the Himalayan Hospital in Dehradun. First, their wives got tested to see if they could donate kidneys to their husbands. But neither was a match for her husband. They kept trying their luck with relatives in the hope that something would work out. It takes time to match donors — there are blood tests, crossmatch tests (which check if a recipient’s body is likely to reject the donor organ) and HLA antigen tests (which examines immune system response), among others, before a donor can be finalised. Besides, both families were counting on the kidneys actually recovering. When that seemed unlikely, doctors at the hospital had to work out an alternative plan. Both families, with limited means, were spending about Rs 20,000 a month. “With the transplant, they spent Rs 6 lakh each,” Dr Shahbaz Ahmed, senior nephrologist at the hospital, told TOI. But with the surgery, the recurring costs would go down over time. “Both men’s wives were willing to donate kidneys for their husbands but their blood groups were not matching. It so happened that Vikas Uniyal’s wife Sushma’s blood group matched Ashraf Ali’s, and Ali’s wife Sultana’s blood group matched Uniyal’s,” Ahmed said. “Tests were conducted in which we found the organs could be swapped.” The swap itself was possible because of amendments to the Transplantation of Human Organs Act in 2011, Ahmed added. It allowed people other than blood relatives to donate their organs. Sushma and Sultana readily agreed. “It was a fortunate coincidence,” said Sushma. “My husband had been suffering for two and a half years. We had to get four tests done before the surgeries could be done. But it all worked out.” Sultana, too, was finally relieved: “It cost us a lot, both in terms of money and mental peace. But we could help each other out of this situation. That’s what matters."

It accounts for 2.5 suicides a day or five suicides every two days. Out of total, seven cases specified prolonged illness as the reason to end life, whereas in one case the reason was cited as loneliness. While the statistics for 2020 is not available on National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) yet, in 2019 Ahmedabad had recorded 172 suicides where the cause was cited as prolonged illness. In terms of occupation profile, 4.3% of the suicides were committed by senior citizens. What pushes the elderly to the brink? Dr Nehal Shah, a city-based psychiatrist, said that ending life is the last step in a long process. “It can start with frustration, that snowballs into depression and later despair. When the person loses hope of something good happening to them in the future, the drive diminishes. Thus, it’s very important that there must be a timely intervention by near and dear ones. Positive outlook can also help drive the blues away,” he said. “Our role as a society is to support those who have supported many all their lives.” The experts thus advocate active lifestyle, contact with their family members, pursuing a hobby or activity to keep engaged and light exercises as some of the ways to remain agile mentally and physically. Pravin Valera, coordinator of Gandhinagar police-run Jeevan Aastha helpline (1800 233 3330) termed Covid blues as a major reason for spike in suicide cases. “The pandemic has affected all to some extent. In one of the calls we received, a senior citizen couple living alone had lost hope after the wife had contracted Covid,” he said. “In such cases, illness is not the only reason – we could intervene by ensuring a support system. We also appeal to the society to ensure the safety of the senior citizens around them. What they might need is just assurance that they are not alone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/timely-intervention-can-help-drive-away-blues/articleshow/86465918.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad air like smoking 2 cigarettes a day||HYDERABAD: Metaphorically, every Hyderabadi smoked at least 1.75 cigarettes a day all through the last one year. At least that’s what the latest PM 2.5 levels of the city indicate, if physicists Richard Muller and daughter Elizabeth Muller’s 2015 method of measuring air pollution is considered. Through extensive research, these scientists from Berkeley Earth concluded that a day’s exposure to 22 mg cubic per metre of PM 2.5 — tiny particulate matter created through emissions from industries, burning fuels, fine heavy metals etc — is equivalent to smoking one cigarette. “The high concentration of PM 2.5 is equivalent to even kids smoking two cigarettes and that can cause serious pulmonary complications. Early episodes of asthma, bronchitis and chronic inflammatory lung diseases are among few of those. In the long run, the lung capacity can be reduced, resulting in severe damage,” said Dr Viswesvaran Balasubramanian, senior interventional pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at Yashoda Hospitals, Malakpet. Doctors said that increased exposure to PM 2.5 levels may lead to cardiovascular and respiratory issues as PM 2.5 not only gets into the lungs but also enters the blood streams. “We are observing a rise in interstitial lung diseases among people over the past few years. This usually triggers following excessive exposure to hazardous pollutants. Not just this, people are becoming more and more allergic resulting in further health issue. With the pollution levels rising, the only solution is to be vigilant of symptoms for an early treatment,” said Dr A Raghukanth, senior consultant pulmonologist, Medicover Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-air-like-smoking-2-cigarettes-a-day/articleshow/86465897.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Nagpur||2 found with Para Bombay in Nagpur; only 4 in 1 million have this rarest blood group||NAGPUR: Dr Hedgewar Blood Bank recently detected a father-son duo in the city with Para Bombay blood group, a rarest phenotype generally present in about 0.0004% (about four per million) of the population. The detection was done after the father told medical officer Dr Harsha Soni that his blood group is ‘O’ while his son’s has Bombay blood group. Dr Soni insisted on getting blood test done for the son, which revealed that it was not just Bombay blood group but even a rarer phenotype known as ‘Para Bombay’. Later, the father’s blood was also tested. He too was found to have Para Bombay blood group. Finding people with this blood group in Vidarbha holds significance because now blood banks will have to be more vigilant with people with ‘O’ blood group. “ABO blood group system is commonly known and we know the blood groups such as ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘AB’ and ‘O’. There is a rare blood group known as ‘Bombay blood group’ first discovered in Mumbai in 1952 (then Bombay),” said Dr Soni. According to her, people with ‘A’ blood group have ‘A’ antigen in blood while those with blood group ‘B’ have B antigen. “People with ‘AB’ have both A and B antigens while people with the ‘O’ blood group don’t have any of the antigens. There is a third antigen too called H which is present in some quantity in all blood groups, including ‘O’,” she said. In Bombay blood group, people have H antibodies instead of H antigens. As a result, health complications can arise if the common ‘O’ blood with H antigen is given to people having H antibodies. In the Para Bombay blood group, the blood has H antigen as well as H antibodies. Individuals with this blood group face no complications unless they get blood transfusion. Dr Soni said that a common lab at primary level will detect this blood group as O only. “This increases confusion. We need a specialized mechanism to test and declare the blood group. We also test saliva of the patients,” she said adding that Dr Hedgewar Blood Bank has reconfirmed these two cases of Para Bombay blood group from National Institute of Immunohematology of ICMR. Dr Harish Warbhe, expert in transfusion medicine, said that there are a select number of documented cases of Bombay blood group in Vidarbha. “However, the Para Bombay blood group is very rare and hardly documented,” he said and added that Para Bombay blood group is usually misunderstood as ‘O’ blood group. Even the person in this particular case used to consider himself of ‘O’ blood group and reportedly donated blood three-four times. “Now, we have asked him and his son not to donate blood unless they get a call from the blood bank,” said Dr Soni. “In case any one of them needs blood, we can arrange the same through the nationwide registry of rare blood groups,” she said. Significance Bombay blood group is rare because only one out of 10,000 humans is born with this Para Bombay blood group is type of Bombay blood group which is even rarer A father-son duo with Para Bombay blood group found in Nagpur This means, people with this rarest blood group are there in Vidarbha In case they need blood transfusion, blood of exactly same group is must for them Directory of people with rare blood groups is maintained at national-level||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/father-son-duo-detected-with-rarest-para-bombay-blood-group/articleshow/86465892.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

This will save time and energy of students.” Currently, students enrolled in the university are required to visit either the North or South Campus in order to address issues pertaining to document submission, submission of fees, collection of transcripts and so on. According to senior DU officials, the student facilitation centres are likely to become operational from January next year. “The facilitation centres will be completed by this year-end and will have a built-up area of 120 square metres each. The university is also planning to open college and academic departments on these parcels of land in future,” the officials said. Joshi said, “We are giving students one place in their vicinity where they can visit for all university-related issues. It will be at their doorstep and they do not need to visit the main campuses anymore.” Two more student facilitation centres are likely to be made functional in Karkardooma and Fatehpur Beri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ball-set-rolling-for-university-at-your-door/articleshow/86465946.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Five-point agenda to help double farmers’ income, says Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said here on Thursday that his government is working on a five-point agenda to realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolve to double the farmers’ income. This includes increasing agriculture production, reducing the input cost in agriculture, ensuring remunerative prices of their crops to farmers, compensating their losses and motivating them towards varied farming. He was addressing a function organised at Minto Hall to dedicate to the public 50 "seed villages" in the state under the programmes being organised to mark the 20-years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in power. He further said that providing irrigation facilities is the fundamental necessity to increase the agriculture production and the state government aims to irrigate the entire farming land in the state and it is the reason why irrigation potential in MP has gone up to 42 lakh hectares. It's also necessary that farmers get fertilisers and seeds on time and if the situation arises, they should also be able to get interest-free loans. His government is sensitive towards all this and actively working to do it on the ground. The dream of a strong and prosperous farmer is being turned into reality in MP under the Prime Minister's guidance, he said. The farmers are benefiting from schemes like "PM Samman Nidhi" , " PM Kisan Mandhan", `PM Crop Insurance Scheme and increase in minimum support prices of crops, he added. Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar and state agriculture minister Kamal Patel were also present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/5-point-agenda-to-help-double-farmers-income/articleshow/86465914.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC, AMC want public shaming of river polluters||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday concurred with the suggestion by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for public shaming of polluting industrial units and their owners as one of the measures to curb pollution in the Sabarmati river, as an environmental activist included in the court-appointed Joint Task Force submitted that 120-km stretch of Sabarmati is “dead river”. As the high court has initiated suo motu proceedings for curbing pollution in the river and enhancement of the Sewage Treatment Plant capacity to treat water properly, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati called for suggestions from AMC, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and the task force for quick measures to be initiated to address the issue. One of the suggestions made by AMC was to identify the industrial units illegally discharging trade effluents in sewer, which mix with sewage water and gets treated in STP resultantly damaging the plant. AMC’s counsel Mihir Joshi submitted, “Identity of such polluters should be publicised, so people know about them. Many countries have adopted this practice with great success.” The court agreed with the suggestion and said, “Very true. So that people know who these people are who are creating the problem. We are all part of the city, and there is an awareness that this pollution must be stopped.” The judges further said, “If we are able to hold neck of five industries doing all this, their entire details be published in newspapers with their photographs and history of their families. It is very shameful for them to indulge in this.” While AMC and GPCB tried to blame each other for the lapses in implementation of green norms and monitoring, the court agreed to the proposal that the civic body’s permission granted to the industrial units to discharge trade affluent into sewage after treatment in Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and discharging the water directly into the river after process in the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CEPT) should be immediately cancelled and the practice should be stopped. Meanwhile, a joint task force member, Rohit Prajapati of Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti, presented the preliminary plan on how to go about cleaning the river by stopping the industrial pollution and rejuvenating the river. He told the court that 120-km stretch of Sabarmati is dead river, and in absence of flowing water, what people in the downstream get is only highly contaminated water. The issue of irrigation in three villages 20 km downstream by one Miroli Sahakari Piyat Mandali Ltd was also discussed. The high court was of the opinion to immediately stop drawing of contaminated water from the river for irrigation. The court asserted that nobody should be allowed to continue with his livelihood at the cost of public health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-amc-want-public-shaming-of-river-polluters/articleshow/86465954.cms||---

In the absence of any methodology at the local level, there is confusion among authorities and many age-old trees are felled. On July 6, the state government amended the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, giving ‘heritage’ status to 50-year-old trees, besides requiring that felling of more than 200 trees will need a state-level committee nod. The 1975 Act is applicable in the jurisdiction of municipal corporations and councils. On Thursday, the state environment ministry headed by Aaditya Thackeray notified criteria and methods to determine the age of the heritage trees. According to Method I, the age of the trees can be determined on the basis of written records indicating the year of plantation. If such a record is not available, then the age of the trees can be determined with the help of recorded witness testimony. As per Method II, the age can be determined by multiplying the diameter of the tree by species-specific growth factor. To arrive at the diameter, the tree’s circumference is to be measured in inches using tape at about four-and-a-half feet above the ground. The circumference is to be divided by 3.14 to find the diameter of the tree. Estimate the age of the tree by multiplying the diameter by the growth factor. Method III includes the use of an increment borer instrument. This method being new, it needs to be executed under the expert guidance of local forest officials till the time expertise is developed by local tree authority. Increment borers are used to determine the ages and growth rates of trees and for the evaluation of wood properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-notifies-methods-to-determine-age-of-trees-to-get-heritage-tag/articleshow/86466277.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Jessore-VIP Road patchwork follows airlines’ SOS||KOLKATA: Prodded by SOS calls from airlines that had to reschedule pick-up times for pilots and airline crew over the last two days owing to pothole-ridden roads around the airport, Bidhannagar cops and state public works department undertook an overnight drive to fix some of the damaged stretches with patchworks. Major airlines were deluged with panic calls from flyers caught in traffic snarls caused by the heavily cratered Jessore Road and VIP Road, which made them to take up the issue with the Bidhannagar commissionerate, who in turn informed the gravity of the situation to the state government. “The situation had become pathetic. On Wednesday, there was not much rain. Even then, several flyers reported barely on time after they got struck in traffic snarl on VIP Road or Jessore Road. We had also started picking up our flight captain and crew members at least an hour before schedule to ensure they are not late,” said an airline official in Kolkata. “Following the patchwork, the situation improved slightly on Thursday,” the official added. Between Dum Dum Park and the southern end of Kestopur bridge and from Baguiati to Kaikhali, the top layer of the road had worn out in most areas. The condition of Jessore Road was even worse, with craters of anything between 6ft to 8ft in diameter and some as deep as 1ft-1.5ft cropping up in multiple places like Airport gate 3, the confluence of Belghoria Expressway, BT college crossing and Birati crossing. Since Wednesday night, cops along with PWD officials began placing bricks on the craters to smoothen out the depth and fix others with broken bricks and sand bags to make the roads easier for travel. “We have started patchwork repairs as of now and will repair the roads once the rain eases,” said a PWD official. A senior official of Bidhannagar Commissionerate’s Traffic department added their officers were on the road for almost three days on a stretch as traffic movement along the roads had gone haywire mostly due to the poor condition of the thoroughfares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jessore-vip-rd-patchwork-follows-airlines-sos/articleshow/86465960.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Dehradun||Stalled since 1992, tallest dam on Yamuna in Uttarakhand gets Centre nod||DEHRADUN: The finance committee of the Jal Shakti ministry has given its approval to the tallest dam on the Yamuna — with a proposed height of 204 metres — which will come up in Uttarakhand at a cost of Rs 5,747 crore. The nod to the dam — which was first approved in 1976 and work on which was halted in 1992 due to lack of funds — has reignited a decades-old debate, with environmentalists again red-flagging the project as a “flood risk” to Delhi and “ecological threat to the Himalayas”. The financial approval to the 300 MW Lakhwar Multipurpose Project, which will straddle Dehradun and Tehri districts with its 22 kilometre long reservoir, was given by the ministry on Wednesday. The project is now awaiting final clearance from the Union cabinet. The multipurpose project will provide drinking water and electricity to six states — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi. It will also provide irrigation on 33,780 hectares. For the project, 90% of the cost is to be spent by the Centre while the remaining 10% will be borne by the states. “The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had given its clearance to the project on February 2 this year. We now have permission from the jal shakti ministry, too,” said Uttarakhand power minister Harak Singh Rawat. The project will have a water storage capacity of 78.8 million cubic metres. Nearly 780 hectares of forest land and 105 hectares of private land has been transferred for the project. Over 850 families have already been awarded compensation for their land. Environmentalists, however, have demanded the project be abandoned on the lines of Maheshwar dam in Narmada, Gujarat. They claimed that the dam would obstruct the free flow of Yamuna and prevent groundwater table recharge, leading to water crisis rather than solving it. Himanshu Thakkar, water activist and coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, said there was no “environmental or economical justification” that could be given for revival of the project. “The project did not go through a proper impact assessment, public consultation or appraisal,” he said, adding that it would pose an “environmental hazard” especially at a time when climate change-induced variations in rainfall patterns have increased risk of landslides in the hills. Manoj Misra, a retired Indian Forest Service officer who runs the 'Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan' and had filed a petition in the NGT along with Bhim Singh Rawat against the project in 2015, told TOI the dam posed threat of flooding in Delhi. “Delhi is the first large city that falls on Yamuna’s path as it flows downstream. It will get impacted if anything were to go wrong with the dam. The project has not been properly examined,” Misra said. Rawat, meanwhile, alleged that a public hearing regarding the dam held in 2020 was conducted during the pandemic when not many residents were present. “Instead of making people aware of the implications of the project, it focused on what compensation people would get,” he said. The deputy general manager of Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (UJVN), Rajiv Agarwal, however, told TOI the environmental clearances and other aspects of the project have been thoroughly analysed and public hearings with locals conducted as per procedure. “It is the tallest dam on Yamuna. It was only after an expert assessment that the NGT had given its clearance in February this year,” he said. Project History The Lakhwar-Vyasi Hydroelectricity Project was announced in 1976 and work on it started in 1987 after clearances from the environment ministry. In 1992, the project was halted due to lack of funds. After the formation of Uttarakhand in 2000, the project was divided into the Lakhwar multipurpose project (300MW) and Vyasi hydroelectric project (120MW). The work was handed over to the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) which then transferred it to Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam (UJVN) in 2008 for completion. In 2011, UJVN sought extension of the existing environment clearance for the project from the union ministry.  The clearance was provided in 2015, but a plea was filed against the project in the NGT in 2015. The tribunal on January 10, 2019 directed the Union environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee to examine the project afresh. The committee recommended the project for environmental clearance in its December 2 meeting last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stalled-since-92-tallest-dam-on-yamuna-in-ukhand-gets-centre-nod/articleshow/86461434.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Dehradun||Akhara Parishad sets up 11-member panel to probe its chief's death||Haridwar: The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex body representing the 13 akharas in the country, has set up an 11-member committee to inquire into the death of mahant Narendra Giri. The decision to set up a panel, the office-bearers said, has been taken in view of “a strong feeling in the community of seers that Narendra Giri’s death was a case of murder, not suicide as is the impression being given”. The postmortem report on Wednesday had found that the seer died of “asphyxia due to hanging”. Giri was president of ABAP when he was found hanging at Baghambari Mutt in Prayagraj on September 21. A suicide note purportedly handwritten by the mahant said that he was forced to take his own life as he was being “blackmailed” by his disciple, Anand Giri, and two others over a “morphed photo with a girl”. Giri has been arrested and booked for abetment to suicide. General secretary of ABAP, mahant Hari Giri, said they were satisfied over the UP government's recommendation to the Centre for a CBI probe into the seer's death, but wanted to ensure that “truth in the matter comes out and stringent punishment is awarded to the guilty.” “We have faith in the CBI. But if something adverse happens to a member of the Akhara Parishad, it is our duty to respond to it in a responsible manner. Hence a decision has been taken to appoint an inquiry committee,” he said. TOI had earlier reported that seers in Haridwar have alleged that Giri’s death was the fallout of a “conspiracy” by those who were angry with the mahant over a series of controversial decisions he had made as ABAP chief, including publishing a list of fake babas. Meanwhile, Swami Kailashanand Giri, who holds the highest office of acharya mahamandaleshwar in the Niranjani Akhara — to which Swami Narendra Giri belonged — alleged that “the suicide note circulated in media did not seem to be in Giri’s handwriting”. Hari Giri also added that the authorities need to examine whether the note matched Giri’s handwriting. The ABAP, meanwhile, said that mahant Devendra Shastri of Nirmal Akhara, the vice-president of ABAP, was now the acting president until an election to the post is held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/akhara-parishad-sets-up-11-member-panel-to-probe-its-chiefs-death/articleshow/86461429.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||43 cities in state to join ‘Race to Zero’ to end carbon emissions by 2050||Nagpur: Ahead of global climate meet COP26, Maharashtra has announced that 43 cities of the state will join the United Nations led ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, which aims at committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The announcement was made by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday at India’s Road to COP26 event, part of The Hub Live at Climate Week NYC 2021. Stressing that global investors are seeing Maharashtra as a potential state to invest in, Thackeray said, “While we do that, we need to keep our carbon footprint under control. We cannot keep emitting carbon and adding to the emissions of the world. So we are looking at opportunities where investments continue to come while working closely with the manufacturing companies and the population in terms of climate mitigation and adaptation.” The minister added that Maharashtra will set an example of how subnational governments can act on climate change, despite being a massively industrialised state. Of the 43 cities, five from western Maharashtra — Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kalyan-Dombivali, and Pune — and Nagpur have already joined the campaign earlier this year. “The environment department will undertake a greenhouse gas emission inventory exercise for all the cities and clusters, which account for a floating population of 50 million in the state. Within 12 months of joining, the cities will have to explain what actions will be taken toward achieving both interim and longer-term pledges, and commit to report publicly both progress against interim and long-term targets, as well as the actions being taken, at least annually,” stated a release by the state. The selected cities are already part of the Union government’s AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) scheme. Thackeray highlighted how the state has been taking initiatives to combat climate change, including the EV policy and targeting 25% of energy coming from renewables by 2025. “We are solarising highways, floating solar panels in dams, besides other small contributions towards sustainability. We are hoping protected mangroves will now be our carbon sinks,” he said. Explaining the idea behind these efforts, the minister said that climate change action should start from cities. “This is where maximum emissions come from. Urbanisation must include rainwater harvesting, percolation, better energy systems, storm water drainage etc. We also need to protect urban forests to absorb pollutants at whatever level possible,” added Thackeray. They will also be identifying priority actions over the next decade. Also expressing his views on battling climate crisis, founder of internal organization Global Citizen Michael Sheldrick said, “We know that halting climate change will take immediate action from everyone. That means state and regional governments have a leading role to play in halving global emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. Global Citizen congratulates Maharashtra and the 43 cities that are announcing their participation in the Race to Zero as part of Global Citizen Live.” On Saturday, Global Citizen will present Global Citizen Live, a 24-hour global broadcast and streaming event featuring an extraordinary line up of artists, with performances from all over the world. Thackeray will be participating in a special event to be held at Gateway of India, Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/43-cities-in-state-to-join-race-to-zero-to-end-carbon-emissions-by-2050/articleshow/86465909.cms||Manka Behl
---||Visakhapatnam||Pollution alert: Vizag’s air quality way below WHO’s revised limits||VISAKHAPATNAM: The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently revised the global air quality guidelines after 16 years, the first-ever global update since 2005, slashing the limits on various pollution parameters. As per the new guidelines, Vizag’s annual PM 2.5 average is about 10 times more than the prescribed limits of the WHO. Similarly, the PM 10 annual average is about five times the annual WHO limits. WHO, in its latest guidelines, tightened the air quality norms and fixed the safe annual limit for PM2.5 at 5 micrograms per cubic metre compared to the earlier 10 mcg in 2005. The annual PM10 limit has been slashed to 15 mcg per cubic metre from the earlier 20 mcg. However, India’s existing national ambient air quality standards are far behind the WHO’s guidelines. Visakhapatnam is located within two major hill ranges, Yarada and Adavivaram (Simhachalam). These two hill ranges are said to be causing inversion conditions, particularly during winter, without giving any scope for pollutants to escape from the core area. Moreover, the major habitations and industries co-exist in the bowl area, where the residential colonies sprang up in the vicinity of industrial clusters. Due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, Vizag’s population has increased from 7.5 lakh to over 22 lakh in the last two decades. Similarly, there has been nearly a 20-fold increase in the vehicular population during this period. Apart from industrial pollution and vehicular emissions, municipal solid waste, road dust, and construction activities are also contributing to air pollution in the city. The Central Pollution Control Board has identified Visakhapatnam as one of the non-attainment cities for not meeting the national ambient air quality standards. A total of Rs 73 crore will be released towards pollution control measures to the city. The GVMC is in the process of implementing an action plan. Member, Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Mohammed Sadiq, said that if the Central Pollution Control Board issues any revised norms, it will be discussed in the APPCB and take a decision accordingly. “The Board is working towards reducing pollution levels and improving air quality monitoring mechanism in Vizag city,” said Sadiq. Dr K Satish Reddy, a general physician, said that pollution is affecting humankind in numerous ways. “WHO adjusting the levels of various parameters hints at the significant health risks associated with the pollution. Due to increasing industrialisation and vehicular emissions, the pollution levels are increasing in our cities and subsequently the health complaints” said Dr Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizags-pm-2-5-is-10-times-more-than-whos-new-limits/articleshow/86465965.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

City-based experts said that while there were negligible cases of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in 2020, the comparison should be with 2019. Dr Manish Mehta, secretary of Gujarat Pediatrics Association, said that 2021 has has had the highest incidence of chikungunya in children that he has seen. “Of patients with symptoms such as high-grade fever and vomiting, about 50% are of seasonal flu, 30% of chikungunya, and 20% of dengue,” he said. “Compared to 2019, there has been a fivefold increase in chikungunya patients, and and about a twofold rise in dengue.” Experts say that while children do not often report joint pains as a sign of chikungunya, rashes on the body and vomiting are the symptoms reported. Dr Chetan Trivedi, member of the executive board of Indian Academy of Pediatrics, said that chikungunya and dengue have similar symptoms for the first two days. “When it comes to chikungunya, there’s very high-grade fever that lasts long. In some cases, complications such as encephalitis are also observed. This year, the complications have been higher even in dengue, where patients suddenly deteriorate,” he said. Due to the season, doctors first try to eliminate other ailments. Experts said about 10%-20% of the patients need hospitalization due to complications, a figure higher than in the last couple of years. “Prevention is better than cure and we appeal to parents to be vigilant about mosquitoes,” said Dr Nishchal Bhatt, a city-based pediatrician. “In about 90% of cases, recovery is uneventful. Parents should look for signs such as high-grade fever, rashes, and vomiting to differentiate between flu and vector-borne diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fivefold-increase-in-pediatric-chikungunya-cases-from-2019/articleshow/86466013.cms||Parth Shastri

I’m pretty sure this facility would play a very vital role towards that,” said Jagan. US consul general Reifman said an American corner is a community gathering place that features guest speakers, movie screenings, English language classes, book clubs, education advisory for US universities, and celebrations of American holidays. “We are proud to have Andhra University as our partner in opening this Corner. Alongside Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, this is the third American corner we’ve opened in India. We’re looking forward to putting together programs on everything, from climate change and youth outreach to entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment. With the active engagement of the chief minister it is a testament to the growing relationship between the people and the governments of the United States and Andhra Pradesh,” said Reifman.

In some places, the craters are so large that the road seems to have caved in — it is almost impossible for cars to move on these battered stretches. One such stretch is from tank No. 5 to Baisakhi Island on the First Avenue. Another spot is on the Second Avenue Road where the entire road surface has dented several inches. Motorists, especially bikers, are facing problems to manoeuvre these damaged spots. “The condition of the roads are terrible. Some of the roads have large craters and potholes,” said Sankhadeep Roy Chowdhury, a resident of AE Block.

---||Delhi||Delhi-NCR: Classes home-delivered for tiny tots as pandemic takes the play out of school||NEW DELHI: Activity boxes and digital dashboard for classes, teachers visiting home to teach three or four children and, of course, online lessons — the Covid-19 pandemic has brought a sea change in preschool education. And parents aren’t ungrateful for the experience offered by playschool companies. As Tanveer Singh testified, enrolling his 3-year-old son in one such class has kept him engaged. Said Gurugram resident Singh, whose son is now in nursery in St. Xavier’s School: “Due to the pandemic, my son was confined to the house and he would end up watching cartoons on TV. But I enrolled him in Klay Prep Schools & Day Care online preschool. The physical touch cannot be replicated and it was difficult to make him sit, but at least he could talk with children of his age and have fun showing off toys.” Unlike Singh, Kalpana Bhardwaj, a doctor from Delhi based in Mumbai, opted for Kare@Home offered by the same company. Under this scheme, the teacher visits the student’s home. “My daughter is anxious when strangers are around. When I learnt of Kare@Home, a group of us came together and a teacher came home to take classes with three other children. We rotated the classes in each other’s house. Within a few months I have seen my daughter’s confidence grow,” said Bhardwaj. For many families, classes at home is a welcome intervention. Flinto Learning Solutions, which has FlintoclassTeacher@Home, started with 200 children in Chennai and Hyderabad. After a brief halt due to the resurgence of Covid, Flinto has restarted home classes and registrations have been on a rise. “Half of our revenue comes from the five cities of Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad,” said Arunprasad Durairaj, CEO, Flinto. “Along with numeracy-literacy skills, we also deliver some social experience to the students.” Before the second wave of Covid, Kare@Home had around 450 children enrolled in Delhi-NCR. The classes cost between Rs 10,000 and Rs.12,000 a month, with around two hours of classes a day, depending on the age group. The company resumed home classes from July. Some companies are also delivering activity boxes for pre-school children. These are boxes filled with activities.  The activities teach different concepts and each box has a different theme. The price of the boxes differs across companies and are mostly subscription-based. AK Srikanth, CEO and founder of Klay, explained, “It is a playschool in a box in which activities are derived from the multiple intelligence system invented by Howard Gardner. We also have online resources to help parents use the box to teach their children. Some of these activities can be done alone, some require the presence of parents.” Educationist Venita Kaul, professor emerita, Ambedkar University Delhi, feels depending on the activities, these boxes are better than online lessons. “If there are activities promoting imaginative play, such as building blocks, puzzles, picture books and free play, it helps the children. If they involve parents, they boost bonding. These are good because it is not good to expose younger children to long screen times,” said Kaul. Vibha Kumar, who has been running pre-school Little Creative Mind since 1992, also agreed that online classes were actually burdensome for tots. “The attention span of children is short and the whole effort can get undone. Online education can also become addictive,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/classes-home-delivered-for-tiny-tots-as-pandemic-takes-the-play-out-of-school/articleshow/86466073.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||After TN, Maharashtra weighing NEET exemption: Minister||MUMBAI: Taking a cue from Tamil Nadu, which passed a bill seeking exemption from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions to medical courses, Maharashtra is contemplating it too. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh on Thursday said while the discussion is at a preliminary stage, TN’s decision has prompted the state government to relook at the merits and demerits of a national-level entrance test. The department has already received representations from groups seeking exemption from the national test. A section of students, though, is opposed to the idea. Deshmukh told TOI a large number of aspirants from Maharashtra study in the state board, so the idea is to give priority to the state board. NEET is based on the CBSE curriculum. “A few delegations have already approached us with requests to seek exemption from NEET. The state has created infrastructure for medical education and students from the remotest areas should get access to it. We also need doctors and medical professionals who are willing to work at the grassroots level in these remote regions. If students from these regions get access to medical education, we will have more doctors. Policies should be drawn for the welfare of the general population,” he said. He, though, added the debate has just started. “A state has gone ahead and taken a drastic step. They have sparked off a discussion. We will hear both the sides and evaluate the pros and cons, and will come out with our official stand in due course. Whatever the decision, it will be in the best interest of students,” said Deshmukh. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, though, said a single national exam such as NEET was the best thing. “The state CET was more taxing as students were forced to apply for multiple entrance exams.” Brijesh Sutaria, another parent, said TN should not have changed the admission process after the exams were over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-tn-maharashtra-weighing-neet-exemption-min/articleshow/86467317.cms||Yogita Rao

Under the second scheme, investors would get Rs 7,000 as incentive for two years and Rs 20,000 as bonus each year. As many as 25 people invested Rs 58.51 lakh in the Dharapuram branch and 16 people invested Rs 23.83 lakh in the main office at Vedasandur. However, the firm failed to keep its promises.Based on the complaints of L Ponnammal of Kattupatti and R Vellimalai, 45, of Vedsandur in Dindigul, the economic offences wing (EOW) in Coimbatore registered two cases against Kumar and Karthikeyan in December 2012.

---||Pune||Soon, cameras along Pune-Mumbai expressway to help issue instant challans||PUNE: Around 250 high-end CCTV cameras will be set up along the 94-km stretch of the Pune-Mumbai expressway as a part of a system to instantly issue challans to motorists for various traffic offences, said officials of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation. An intelligent traffic management system is being developed for the expressway, which witnesses frequent accidents and traffic violations, said officials. An MSRDC official said it will be a collaboration with the road transport ministry to sync with the Sarathi portal, which contains the details of all vehicle including the name of the owner and contact number. “This will allow the challan to be immediately sent to the vehicle owner’s mobile number once a camera catches a traffic violation,” said the official. “Motorists will be more careful if challans are issued immediately. The cameras will be of state-of-the-art quality and will be able to record the offence as well as the registration number of the vehicle in all kinds weather, be it rain or fog,” the official said. The total cost of the project has been pegged at Rs 120 crore. “Putting the system in place will take a year’s time and the tenders will be finalised soon. The project was on hold since the past two years, but funds will now be available in phases for the project,” another MSRDC official said. Different RTOs undertook a special drive on the expressway between July 5-10 this year after a fatal accident resulted in the death of three people in the first week of June. During the drive, lane cutting and speeding accounted for the maximum offences. Of a total of 760 e-challans during the week, 533 were for lane cutting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-cameras-along-eway-to-help-issue-instant-challans/articleshow/86466068.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Nagpur||Consumer Act applies to post offices too: Forum||Nagpur: Making it clear that Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is applied to post offices, the Gondia District Consumer Grievance Redressal Commission slapped Rs 3,000 fine on Pune and Gondia postmasters for a month’s delay in delivering the Electronic Money Order (E-MO). The bench comprising president Bhaskar Yogi and member Sarita Raipure directed the postmasters to pay the cost within a month to the complainant, who is a senior citizen. Else Rs 10/day penalty would be levied on them. Out of total cost, Rs 2,000 is to be paid towards the compensation for mental agony and inconvenience and Rs 1,000 as a litigation cost. Complainant Sudhir Rathod had sent Rs 1,000 through electronic money order (E-MO) facility from the Gondia City Post Office to his two sisters in Pune for Raksha Bandhan on August 14 and 18, 2018. However, his sisters – Aruna Yadav and Nisha Chauhan — received the amount after one month and 25 days respectively. Rathod, himself a lawyer, had lodged a complaint with Gondia and Pune post offices as money order was not delivered in the first 15 days. The Pune office replied that the delay was due to slew of reasons, including technical ones like no internet connectivity, and they were not responsible for it. He was also informed that large scale construction works which are underway in Pune also contributed to the delay. After failing to get a satisfactory reply, the 64-year-old filed a complaint with the consumer commission while praying for compensation for mental distress caused to him and sisters due to inordinate delay in delivering the amount. Citing citizens’ charter for the post offices, he contended that E-MO orders can be delivered within 24 hours in the era of internet. Therefore, its delivery after a month should be considered as a deficiency in the service and a fine should be imposed on the post offices under the 1986 Act. Opposing his contentions, the respondents said that their works fall within the jurisdiction of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, and therefore the Consumer Act did not apply to them. Quoting the Indian Post Office Act, they argued that if the E-MO delivery is delayed due to technical reasons, then they were not responsible for it. After hearing both sides, the judges ruled that the Consumer Act is applicable to the post offices and the delay in money order delivery is indeed a deficiency as per its provisions. “The money was transferred for Rakhi, which attaches emotional value, Naturally, the complainant has suffered mental pain and agony. The respondents’ contentions are not sustainable for the reason that delay of a month is unpardonable,” the bench said while partly allowing the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/consumer-act-applies-to-post-offices-too-forum/articleshow/86466116.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

With Trichy international airport being the second leading cargo handler among airports in the state, next only to Chennai and 11th across India, they urged the government to include Trichy as one of the hubs.According to Airport Authority of India (AAI) statistics, despite limited air connectivity in the past three months, Trichy has handled over 1,105 MT of freight whereas Coimbatore and Madurai airports have handled only 169 MT and 7MT respectively. Coimbatore and Madurai were among the 10 export hubs identified that would receive special incentives and focus to boost exports. Trichy is a frontrunner in exporting perishable and non-perishable commodities. “Till Pongal, the scope for textile products export to south-east Asia through Trichy airport will only increase,” K Harimoorthy, consultant, international cargo, said. Consultants said that even exporters from Hosur, Krishnagiri and Salem are utilising Trichy air connectivity with Malaysia and Singapore to export flowers and garments. Export through Trichy airport has constantly surpassed even that of comparatively bigger cities like Amritsar, Lucknow and Guwahati amid the pandemic.With an increase in number of food and value addition MSMEs, there was also an increase in the export of locally prepared snacks to middle east countries. Industrialists said that entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector across delta districts could benefit if there was an export hub established in Trichy. “Food processing industry is booming, the entrepreneurs need guidance to export commodities to address the demand in countries that have Indian diaspora,” N Kanagasabapathy, chairman, Trichy trade centre said. The Kallikudi market equipped with cold storage facility was suggested as an ideal location for the export hub to encourage farmers to increase the export of vegetables to Singapore. “We are preparing a district export promotion plan for Trichy, the government of India will oversee the progress, Cuddalore was the other district to be supervised. Perhaps, because of such a plan in progress, the hub status was not given,” an officials source with the MSME department said. The 10 hubs identified will see investment for a common facility and skill development centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/concern-over-trichy-not-in-export-hub-plan/articleshow/86467325.cms||Deepak Karthik

The couple was arrested on the basis of confessional statement of three shooters and the man who had offered him ‘supari’ (contract) of Rs 2.5 lakh for eliminating the gym trainer, Vikram Singh (28). The victim is recuperating in the ICU of Patna Medical College and Hospital. He had sustained five bullet injuries when the assailants fired at him near Budh Murti under the Kadamkuan police station area here. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said Khushboo had contacted her close friend, Mihir Singh, for hiring the contract killers for the purpose. A sum of Rs 1.85 lakh was paid as advance to the killers. The SSP said the three shooters, Aman Kumar (Samastipur) – Md. Shamshad (Begusarai) and Aryan alias Rohit Singh (Saran) – were arrested from near the Dhanush bridge when they were about to leave for unknown destination. The police later nabbed Mihir on the basis of information elicited from the alleged contract killers. Two country-made pistols, two magazines and eight live cartridges were seized from the arrested shooters. Sharma revealed that the physiotherapist’s wife was unhappy with the gym trainer following difference between the two. She had also threatened Vikram with dire consequences over phone. The SSP said the couple was arrested on charges of conspiring to kill the gym trainer. “The scientific evidence also corroborated the allegations levelled against the couple by the victim,” he asserted. The police had earlier detained the couple for interrogation. They were later released from the police station. According to police, the shooters were living in Patna in rented accommodation and committing crimes. “All the five accused in the case were produced before a court, which remanded them in judicial custody,” a senior police officer said. The CDR of Khushboo’s cellphone suggested that she had conversations with the gym trainer at odd hours. Vikram had accused her of harassing him for long.

Police said that at 4.40pm, they received a call regarding a live electric wire lying on the road. “During probe, it was found that three boys — aged 5-6 years — had sustained injuries and were taken to Max hospital for treatment,” an officer said adding that all were residents of Khanpur. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said a live electric wire of one of the temporary connections fell on the ground causing the casualty. “A case has been registered,” the officer said. According to neighbours, children went out to play and one of them accidentally touched the wire and got electrocuted. “Other children rushed to save him, but they also received electric shocks,” one of the neighbours said. One of the children died in hospital. On September 5, a five-year-old boy died due to electrocution in southwest Delhi’s Moti Bagh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/5-year-old-dies-after-coming-in-contact-with-live-wire/articleshow/86466149.cms||---

She said YSRC activists were injured in attacks by TDP workers. She alleged former ZPTC member Battina Sarada and her family members instigated violence. The minister warned consequences would be severe if the TDP leaders try to harm her party activists. She said the situation would have been different had they misused the police force for political advantage. Sucharitha on Thursday visited the village and enquired about health condition of YSRC activists who were injured in attack by rival party workers. She assured the party workers of all support and asked the villagers to keep ‘evil forces’ at bay. Addressing the media, Sucharitha said trouble broke out only due to the provocation of local TDP leaders led by former ZPTC member. She said not even a single violent incident took place in the village since she became home minister almost two-and-a-half years ago. She said she had been representing the constituency for over a decade and there were no disputes among the locals till Sarada got elected as ZPTC member in 2014 elections. Sucharitha said false cases were booked against many YSRC activists during the TDP regime. Home minister said Sarada’s family has started playing factional politics with locals particularly after losing recent ZPTC elections. “I dare Naidu and his media to show the injured TDP activists if they have guts. They are deliberately spreading false information after attacking the YSRC activists in the village,” alleged Sucharitha. She said Sarada and her husband mobilised more than 100 people at her residence and kept stones stock with an intention to attack the YSRC activists.  Sucharitha said she has been representing the constituency for over a decade and there were no disputes among the locals till Sarada got elected as ZPTC member||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/naidu-distorting-facts-about-clashes-hm/articleshow/86463750.cms||Samdani MN
---||Delhi||Delhi northeast riot case: Top cop forms special cell||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana has formed a special investigation cell (SIC) to carry out a proper scrutiny of cases related to the northeast Delhi riots in 2020. The move came after the courts, on various occasions, have pulled up the cops for shoddy investigation and deficient chargesheets. SIC will consist of four senior officers: special commissioner of police (central zone), joint CP (eastern), deputy CP (Northeast) and additional DCP (Northeast). They will scrutinise the pending investigation in the riot cases and chalk out a time-bound strategy to ensure expeditious probes and effective prosecution. Asthana’s order read: “All the case files of pending investigation cases shall be properly scrutinised and the investigating officers (IOs) shall be guided suitably to complete the investigation in a more effective and time-bound manner by adducing all possible evidence on record.” The top cop also said that in cases where Forensic Science Laboratory reports were awaited, police should follow up personally with the director of FSL to expedite the results. The order added, “The officers shall personally liaise with the special public prosecutors to ensure their presence in court in all matters and also to represent the case of the prosecution on each date effectively.” Asking senior officers to be present in court to effectively communicate the facts of each case, the order also made it incumbent on police teams to ensure that all witnesses and IOs were properly briefed and prepared for the court hearing. Police Headquarters has attached 14 police officers earlier serving in North-East district during the riots to assist in the investigation of the cases. “K G Tyagi, ACP (retd), has been appointed as a consultant to monitor the riot cases. His services must be effectively utilised,” Asthana directed. In September, a city court, while acquitting three people in a riots case, described the cops’ failure to conduct a proper investigation as a “colossal and criminal” waste of taxpayers’ time and money. In August, Delhi Police had also directed its officers to be present at the court hearings after the four courts hearing the cases pulled up the investigating officers for being absent during hearings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/top-cop-forms-spl-cell-for-riot-cases/articleshow/86466151.cms||---

The temple board had met to discuss the allegations against Bhatt along with some other issues during which the decision was taken. Chairman of the trust, Surendra Patel said that Bhatt had written to the temple management and asked to relieve him from the secretary’s post after the complaint was filed against him. And the management accepted his offer and removed him. The decision was also taken to remove him from the trustee’s position if Bhatt gets convicted in the case. Bhatt and city-based chartered accountant Ashok Jain were booked for raping a law student studying in a private university on September 19. The duo has been absconding since then. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh on Thursday transferred investigations of the case to the city crime branch. The girl accused Jain, who runs a CA firm, of molesting after spiking her drink at a guest house. She said that Jain also came to her flat and raped her later. Bhatt has also been accused of raping the girl and threatening her with dire consequences. “We have given police protection to the girl,” said Singh. Jain has written a letter to the state DGP and home minister claiming his innocence. He stated in the letter that he is being framed by the girl’s friend Alpesh Vadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi who is a historysheeter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rape-accused-pavagadh-temple-secretary-removed/articleshow/86462806.cms||---

---||Trichy||RTO directs pvt bus owners to resume services on EB Road||Trichy: The regional transport office (RTO) in Trichy has directed private city bus operators to resume bus services on the East Boulevard (EB) Road near Gandhi market. Private bus owners stopped operating decades ago citing traffic congestion despite having route permits connecting Chathiram bus stand with Thuvakudi via EB Road to operate 33 services on the stretch.Being a crucial link connecting Rockfort hillock and Gandhi market with Chathiram bus stand and several residential localities, EB Road lacks dedicated public transportation. As a result, people reach the parallel West Boulevard Road to board buses as only three TNSTC buses operate 11 services per day. Resumption of bus services on EB Road was one of the poll planks in the assembly election. As the demand was reiterated, Trichy East MLA Inigo Irudayaraj directed the RTO officials to redress the grievance. “We have issued a notice to the private bus owners association to resume the services. Cancelling the permits is a tedious process. We will persuade them to restore public transportation on the EB Road,” a senior official with Trichy East RTO said.Bus operators cited the encroachments and haphazard parking of trucks and other load carriers on EB Road for not operating buses. RTO and TNSTC officials said that the city traffic police has to come forward to regulate the parking on EB Road to boost public transport and help the vicinity to develop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rto-directs-pvt-bus-owners-to-resume-services-on-eb-road/articleshow/86467326.cms||---
---||Varanasi||UP: Irrigation department comes under lens after newly created channel gets lost in floods||VARANASI: After the ambitious project of creating a new channel in river Ganga to divide stream for reducing water pressure on ghats with an investment of Rs 11.95 crore almost lost its existence during flood, the irrigation department and its construction agency UP Project Corporation Limited have come under lens. On detecting large scale irregularities in the project the district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has not only stopped the payment of Rs 4.8 crore but has also asked the UPPCL and its contractor to bring the channel in the shape as mentioned in the project by incorporating suggestions of river engineering experts and local stake holders to initiate corrective measures for avoiding losses faced by the project due to flood. The DM has also recommended a probe into matter to the state government. The project for creating a new channel with eastern bank by sparing a sand island between it and western bank of river Ganga was being questioned by the river scientists like founder and director of Mahamana Malviya Institute of technology for Ganga Management Prof UK Choudhary and Sankat Mochan Foundation’s Prof Vishwambhar Nath Mishra on technical grounds. However, the irrigation department and UPPCL were in hurry to complete the project by June 15. The project was started in March. But the floods in river Ganga caused a serious harm to the project as sand accumulated in its major stretch. In view of the same, the DM sought details of the project when shocking facts surfaced. The DM said, “In view of the measures suggested by technical committee to reduce river velocity on western bank to check erosion taking place under mythological ghats, the irrigation department prepared the proposal to create a 45 metre wide channel in 5.3 km with eastern bank.  Without involving local unit of irrigation department and its Bandhi Prakhand (flood division) the project was assigned to UPPCL’s Ballia unit by ensuring release of funds through departments mechanical division.” These facts were revealed when the DM asked UPPCL to hand over the project to Bandi Prakhand after the agency claimed to have completed the project. “I was informed that no provision of handing over the project to department or division concerned was made in the MoU of this project despite the fact that UPPCL is responsible for execution of projects only.” Recommendation for probe into these issues to fix accountability in the lapses has been made, he said. He said, 5.50 lakh cubic meter of sand taken out during dredging as a part of the project was auctioned and Rs three crore revenue generated was deposited in government exchequer.  Over four lakh cubic meter sand dumped on both banks of channel was also to be auctioned but it was swept in flood waters while major part of the channel was filled with sand and silt, he added. Payment of remaining Rs 4.8 crore of the total sanctioned budget of Rs 11.95 crore has been stopped, he said adding that the UPPCL has been directed to ask the contractor concerned not only to bring the channel in the shape as mentioned in the detailed project report but also to consult river experts and stake holders to incorporate corrective action to avoid further losses. However, executive engineer of irrigation department Pankaj Verma, who is supervising the project, claimed that this is multi-purpose project and its basic objective of reducing the velocity of the river water to avoid pressure on ghats due to which threat of erosion under their steps and historical buildings, has been achieved as the depth on western bank has reduced. As it was a pilot project many things would be learnt from its outcomes and rules for further maintenance of the channel would be formulated. Filling of silt in channel during flood and its dredging would be a continuous process. The river experts like Prof Mishra said, “What happened with channel during flood is not surprising as we were already alarming against the possible threats to the rivers dynamics maintained in Kashi due to flowing in crescent shape. However, no attention was paid towards opinions of experts. Prof Chaudhary has also been cautioning that due to this channel Ganga may leave the ghats in the up stream and problems of sedimentation and pollutants logging can also be increase in the down stream.” Multiple reasons to bring second channel in GangaThe project was started not only to reduce water velocity on the western bank of river Ganga to check further erosion under the mythological ghats but also for other purposes. The project, which become possible following relocation of tortoise sanctuary, ensured 60% river water in old channel on western bank while 40% water in the new channel towards eastern bank with the depth of new channel is 7-8 meters to facilitate the cargo vessels on national waterway-I. It led to creation of a sand island in over 5 km area. The officials expected that this sand island will not only attract picnickers in normal days but also help in hosting mega cultural events like Rann Mahotsava in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/irrigation-dept-comes-under-lens-after-newly-created-channel-gets-lost-in-floods/articleshow/86466888.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Pune||Pune: Bid to extort Rs 1 crore from another realtor, probe on||PUNE: A second case of an attempt to extort Rs1core from another city builder has been registered by the Shivajinagar police against an ‘activist-lawyer’ who is on the run since Monday when the first case was registered against him and his aides. A builder (47) from Kothrud has filed a complaint stating that the ‘activist-lawyer’ and his aides were demanding Rs1 crore since August 2018 for withdrawing civil applications they had filed in Pune and Mumbai courts against his construction projects. The builder claimed to have taken all necessary permissions for his projects. In the first case, a builder from Camp accused three men, the ‘activist-lawyer’ and his two aides, of demanding Rs50 lakh for not initiating an ‘illegal construction’ campaign against his commercial-cum-residential project in Fatima Nagar.  Both the cases, registered with the Shivajinagar police, are being investigated by the Pune city crime branch. According to the crime branch officials, “In the second case, the builder is involved in constructing a residential project at Bopodi. The activist, who forged his ID card to represent as a lawyer, claimed that it was the builder who did not take necessary permissions to construct the building at Bopodi. The activist then submitted a complaint in a Mumbai court in 2016, claiming that construction should be stopped in the larger interest of society. “ “The activist does not have any legal right to submit complaint applications in courts as he is not a lawyer. Police have already verified his documents and it has been revealed that he is not a lawyer,” a senior police officer said. Police have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (whoever fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any fake document), 385 (whoever, in order to the committing of extortion, puts any person in fear, or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bid-to-extort-rs-1-crore-from-another-realtor-probe-on/articleshow/86466199.cms||---

The traffic block continued for several hours as vehicles were stranded in 2-3 feet deep waters across the junction.A number of cars, buses and trucks had to wade through the water for over 30 minutes to cover a distance of just a kilometre. Videos of the traffic jam went viral on social media with people questioning waterlogging even due to normal rain. “Waterlogging is common at Kamrej and even during normal rain, the main road and service roads get blocked. Locals have raised the issue in the past too but there is no solution to it,” said a local shop owner. “I was going to Vadodara by car and got delayed by over 45 minutes due to the jam. There was knee-deep water on the road. It was shocking to see so much water on a national highway,” said Priti Joshi, a lawyer. The issue was discussed during a meeting at the district collectorate on Thursday. Officials of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), road contractors, project director, panchayat and members of Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) have been summoned for a meeting on Friday by the district collector. “It seems there is some issue in stormwater drainage level. A meeting has been called of concerned officers to find an immediate solution to this recurring problem. The waterlogging was caused despite normal rain,” said an official of Surat district collector. From Wednesday midnight to 6 pm on Thursday, Palsana received 126 mm, Surat city 29 mm, Umarpada 78 mm, Mangrol 44 mm, Olpad 23 mm and Kamrej received 50 mm rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/17mm-rain-halts-traffic-for-hours-on-nh-48-near-surat/articleshow/86463784.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy corpn takes up desilting drive||Trichy: Trichy Corporation has initiated a desilting drive across the city to avoid inundation in low-lying and other vulnerable areas, ahead of the onset of the NorthEast monsoon. Around 22 heavy machinery and 800 contractual workers are being employed in the drive to complete dredging and strengthening the drainage canals in all four zones. The engineering department said that drainage channels that collect the surplus rainwater and merge with waterbodies were invaded by weeds. Heavy machinery was used to clear the banks and strengthen the bunds to avoid water seepage to adjacent lands. Seemai karuvelam trees present in the passage of drainage carriers were also cleared. In the K Abishekpauram zone, the drive was completed in Vayalur road and Thennur localities. “More than 20km long drainage channels were cleared in K Abishekapuram zone. We have planned to complete the desilting drive on Friday,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman told TOI. Sanitary officials blamed the residents for the silt accumulation in the stormwater drains. The dumping of solid waste including plastic carry bags were cited as the reason for the rainwater to stagnate in the low-lying areas. Locals suggested the civic body to use detachable RCC slabs to cover the open drains to prevent the waste from clogging the drains. “Corporation must ensure that the silt removed from the open drains was disposed of at the earliest. In certain areas, the silt was left to dry on the road, causing foul odour,” B Ramakrishnan, a resident of Srinivasa Nagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-takes-up-desilting-drive/articleshow/86467332.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Mismanagement of funds a routine affair in zonal offices||Thiruvananthapuram: Unscrupulous practices in fund management like picking random staff to transport money to the bank from offices without any records and non-compliance with financial codes have led to frequent mismanagement of funds in zonal offices. Nemom zonal office which has come under a cloud of suspicion following the missing funds had previously dealt with an instance where one of the staff who received the collection of Rs 53,520 in 2018 failed to report back to office and went incommunicado. When the office staff learnt that the money was never credited in the bank, they raised the issue with the superior officers. The matter was soon settled after the person who was supposed to deposit the money came up with an explanation. The letter drafted by the staff said on his way to the bank, he felt a severe headache and he collapsed at Pappanamcode. The local residents then took him to a private hospital to a certain physician at Balaramapuram upon his instructions. He said in the letter that he fell unconscious in the hospital as his blood pressure soared and later he was sent home. Next day he was not in a position to talk or stand and two days later he would learn that his phone had gone missing and hence he was unable to communicate with the office. However, a day later a local resident from Pappanamcode promptly carried his phone to his residence which enabled him to inform his higher authorities. The money which he took from the office was then returned to the cashier and he prayed that he may be granted leave for the days he was unable to present in the office. The cashier then repeated the same note in another file which was approved by the then charge officer and the matter was settled. Sources said that letting people get away with such practices and not going for deeper probes often led to casual management of funds. Unlike Sreekaryam zonal office, the city corporation is totally in the dark about where the money went. In Sreekaryam it was clear that one staff member frequently took the money from the zonal office to the bank and when irregularity was detected, he was held accountable. In Nemom, it has been reported that operational assistants, clerks or any available person carried the money from the zonal office to the bank and no record was ever left to prove who carried money on a particular day. The audit team which went through the files at Nemom zonal office started off with minor denominations like missing Rs 100, Rs 2,000 before proceeding to bigger ones like Rs 48,000 and Rs 50,000. The counter foil slip register which ought to have reflected these collection records never had slips to show that the money was actually deposited in the bank. Same day verification system which ought to be strictly followed for counterfoil slips and vouchers was never followed which made it easy for interested persons to tweak the system and get away with fund fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/mismanagement-of-funds-a-routine-affair-in-zonal-offices/articleshow/86466171.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: While taps in GHMC flow, Secunderabad residents struggle with erratic supply of water||SECUNDERABAD: In what may come as a surprise to many, residents in Secunderabad Cantonment are buying more mineral water cans than piped water in the black market. Many residents feel that a merger of the cantonment area’s water supply with that of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is the best way to tackle the problem of water shortage in SCB jurisdiction. Erractic water supply, polluted water and unscheduled supply timings are among the key reasons forcing people to procure mineral water cans. However, SCB water wing superintendent Raj Kumar told TOI that 61 per cent areas in the cantonment get water supply every alternate day while the remaining get it once every three days. Residents though claimed the contrary when asked by TOI. “This (claims of alternate day water supply) is totally wrong. Instead of supplying potable water, SCB is supplying polluted water and charging abnormal tariffs,” said Nanda Goud, a resident of Bolarum for over three decades. “In one hour’s supply, there is muddy water for 15 to 20 minutes before we get treated water,” he said. Mohd Haneef, a resident of Bowenpally said, “We never know when we will get supply. Sometimes it is during the day and sometimes it comes late at night. There is no alert from SCB on water supply.” All this while residents in neighbouring Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) areas are getting 20KL of free water. Social worker Satish Gupta’s signature campaign to resolve the water problem which has gathered over 3,000 signatures has yet to have any tangible effect so far. The SCB’s proposal to extend a similar scheme to GHMC’s 20KL free supply still remains on paper. But the SCB too has its own problems. “The resolution has dented the Cantonment Board’s revenues. We have gone from earning Rs1.2 crore a month to just Rs40 lakh. We cannot even bear the maintenance costs and are spending at least Rs 5 lakh a month to attend to leakages and other works,” said water wing’s Raj Kumar. Another official informed that around 50 to 80 complaints of water pollution come in every day. This, even as the SCB’s water wing remains without an online complaint mechanism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/while-taps-in-ghmc-flow-scb-residents-struggle-with-erratic-supply-of-water/articleshow/86466167.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nashik||Nashik: NMC to rework ward demarcation for civic elections||NASHIK: The Nashik civic administration will restart the work of demarcating the wards in a multi-member system following the state cabinet’s decision on Wednesday. Earlier, the state government had decided to implement a single member ward. Earlier, based on the single member system decision of the state, the SEC had ordered the local administration to demarcate the constituencies on primary basis. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) administration had started the work. “We have not received any new orders from the SEC yet. As soon as we get them, we will start the exercise accordingly,” said NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav. Manoj Ghode-Patil, deputy commissioner of NMC, said the work on the draft demarcation for the single-member ward was being carried out considering the SEC guidelines. “The ward system is being planned considering the 2011 Census, the natural barriers like major highways, rivers, nullahs. Arrangement of the wards is carried out so that the people living in an area are considered for a single ward. The ward is also planned considering the maximum and minimum numbers of voters in every ward,” he added. The NMC has 31 wards. Currently, each ward has four prabhag. The voters in the ward have to elect one member for each prabhag. The NMC authorities said they would restart the demarcation exercise if and when the SEC issues an order. “The SEC issues guidelines on the manner in which the blocks have to be decided. Based on the same, the exercise will be carried out,” another officer added. Corporator Sudhakar Badgujar, city unit chief of Shiv Sena, said the situation was in the interest of the voters as they would be electing the best of the candidates. “While single-member ward would ensure direct selection of member, but in case of reservation for women, other members of the political parties in that ward were deprived the chance of getting elected. The multi-member system helps such candidates,” said Badgujar. Members also pointed out that this enables the right type of candidate to get elected other than just muscle power. “The system was decided to ensure the person with better image and nature get elected as the person has to canvass across larger area to get all possible votes from the ward. Given the area, there are limitations on the way and means they can influence the voters. Ultimately, the best wins,” said BJP corporator Varsha Bhalerao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-rework-ward-demarcation-for-civic-elections/articleshow/86461572.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||168 2-BHKs allotted in Rasoolpura||Hyderabad: As part of the Dignity Housing Scheme, Telangana government on Thursday allotted 168 flats to beneficiaries at Katta Maisamma Silver Compound in Rasoolpura in the Secunderabad Cantonment constituency. Under the scheme, GHMC took up construction of 224 housing units at Katta Maisamma Silver Compound at an estimated cost of Rs 17.63 crore. Of total flats, 168 units which were ready to occupy have been allotted. The housing society has been built on a parcel of land measuring 2.15 acres with 224 houses spread across eight blocks (G+3 pattern), with a plinth area of 560 square feet (sft) each . The cost of each dwelling unit worked out to Rs 7.90 lakh apart from Rs 0.75 lakh infrastructure. The inaugural function was attended by several elected representatives, including animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, home minister Mohd Mahmood Ali, labour minister Ch Malla Reddy and Secunderabad Cantonment MLA G Sayanna. Speaking on the occasion, minister Srinivas Yadav reiterated the views of MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao, who recently said the SCB should be merged into GHMC. “It is very important to think how areas such as Malkajgiri, Qutbullapur, Medchal which are in the surrounding areas are developing but not Cantonment. This is happening only because it is under the control of defence,” said Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/168-2-bhks-allotted-in-rasoolpura/articleshow/86466210.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The lockdown had forced him to shut the shop, thus leaving him without earnings for more than a year. Now, not only is Banik’s business limping back to normalcy as the Covid-19 scenario improves but there’s also a lifeline for his 10-year-old daughter suffering from SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). She will get a life-long medicine support, worth around Rs 2 crore a year, free of cost under a “compassionate use programme” by the manufacturers of the drug. Aheli is among six children in eastern India who have been selected for the benefit . SMA is a genetic disorder, a crippling condition, characterised by weakness and wasting of muscles caused by the loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons that control muscle movement. It is not curable but medicines like Spinraza are available for treatment. The humongous cost, however, is a hurdle for parents as the medicine has to be taken life-long. Polly Pal, a Kasba resident, said, “My husband, the only earning member, lost his private firm job in a last year during the lockdown. Even funding our three year-old daughter, Sreetama’s physiotherapy sessions is a struggle.” Aheli and Sreetama are among six children who have already got the first shot of their lifeline at Peerless Hospital in Kolkata. As the disease progresses, taking a few steps has already become a struggle for eight-year-old Aditya Kumar from Bihar’s Darbhanga. Unlike the parents of Aheli and Sreetama, his father has a stable job with a public sector telecom organisation. But Bramhadeo Prasad says his salary would never have allowed him to procure the medicine for his son. Approved by FDA in 2016 Spinraza came to India only in 2019 through the compassionate use programme. In India Cure SMA Foundation is coordinating for this programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/help-for-kids-with-muscular-atrophy/articleshow/86466200.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Trichy||Passengers urge Trichy division to run all trains as demand grows||Trichy: Rail users from Trichy, Thanjavur and Nagapattinam have appealed to the Southern Railway to operate passenger trains in all the sections to cater to their needs. They alleged that when other zones have already resumed regular train operations, officials in the Trichy division are remaining silent despite growing demand. Before Covid struck, Nagapattinam and Nagore had three passenger train services to Trichy, one passenger train to Thanjavur, another one to Bengaluru and an overnight express train to Chennai and Ernakulam each via Erode. Besides, a weekly express between Mumbai and Karaikal, Vasco da Gama express to Velankanni, trains services were also provided for Nagapattinam. However, due to the lockdowns, none of the trains are operational, president of the Nagore-Nagapattinam Rail Users’ Association, S Mohan said. In a memorandum to Nagapattinam MP M Selvaraj and the district collector A Arun Thamburaj, the rail users urged the need to restore all the trains as the situation across the country is returning to normalcy. Another demand put forth by the association was the operation of an express train between Velankanni and Thiruvananthapuram via Trichy, Madurai, Thirunelveli and Nagercoil. Or else, the railways may extend the Trichy- Thiruvananthapuram intercity express upto Velankanni.“As not even a single train service is available connecting Velankanni with the rest of the southern districts, railways should take necessary action to operate a new train to connect the pilgrimage spots like Nagore Dargha, Karaikal Thirunallaru temple and shrine Velankanni,” he added. Rail users also appealed to the authorities to resume all the regular passenger train services along the chord line between Trichy and Chennai, as the patronage for the passenger trains is growing following normalcy has gradually been returning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/passengers-urge-trichy-division-to-run-all-trains-as-demand-grows/articleshow/86467340.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: TDP netas get interim relief from arrest in Tadepalli case||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Thursday directed the police to issue notices under 41A of CrPC to TDP functionaries against whom a case was registered at Tadepalli police station under various sections of IPC and SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act. The case was registered following a complaint from one Tandra Ramu, driver of Pedana MLA Jogi Ramesh, who alleged that TDP functionaries attacked him near the house of former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. The incident triggered a controversy as TDP alleged that Ramesh tried to attack the house of Naidu while the ruling YSRC made a counter allegation stating that TDP leaders attacked them when he went to speak to Naidu. Cops booked cases against the followers of both the parties. While a case under sections of criminal intimidation and violating official orders was booked against Ramesh and other YSRC followers, TDP followers including Vijayawada East MLA Gadde Rammohan Rao, former MLA Bode Prasad, Budda Venkanna, Kommareddy Pattabhiram, Chennupati Gandhi and others were booked under various sections of IPC and also under SC/ST Act. Challenging the FIR, TDP functionaries moved a quash petition before the high court. Arguing on their behalf, advocate Posani Venkateswarlu told the court that the case was registered without verifying the facts. He said the case is politically motivated and inclusion of sections under SC/ST Act was without any basis. While pleading for quashing of the FIR, he sought interim relief from arrest and issuance of notices under 41A of CrPC.  Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy directed the police to continue investigation by issuing 41A of CrPC while also directing them not to make any arrests in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-netas-get-interim-relief-from-arrest-in-tadepalli-case/articleshow/86463805.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Surat||Business-hit textile broker turns opium seller, caught with drug||SURAT: A 43-year-old textile who took to selling drugs was caught by the police on Thursday. Cops also seized 382g opium worth Rs 1.14 lakh from him. Accused Champalal Nakum Parmar, a resident of Godadara Devadh Road, had no business since the start of the global pandemic and was facing severe financial crisis. To tide over his crisis, he started selling opium to earn some quick money, said the police who booked him under various sections of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Sleuths of the Special Operation Group (SOG) arrested Parmar who conducted his illegal trade from his home. He used to purchase the contraband from his contacts in Rajasthan and then sell it in small quantities to regular buyers who he charged Rs 500 per gram. “The accused was a textile broker for the past 10 years and was doing normal business till the start of 2020. He lives with his wife and two children. His business stopped due to Covid and the family started facing financial troubles. He then started selling opium in the last seven months,” said R S Suvera, police inspector, SOG. The accused is native of Rajasthan and had contacts with suppliers of opium there. The accused himself consumed opium before starting its business and hence he had an understanding of the drug. Since opium is sold in small quantities of 5gm to 20gm, sellers usually pack it in tiny pouches made from chopped corners of small plastic pouches. “They first take small zip pouch and cut its corners. The chopped corner is used to keep five gram or more opium. Such a small pouch is used so that there is no loss of the high value drug,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/biz-hit-textile-broker-turns-opium-seller-caught-with-drug/articleshow/86463811.cms||---

The survey has begun in rural areas of Sinnar that have been reporting fresh Covid cases repeatedly to the extent that the number of active cases in the taluka that had gone below 100 have again crossed the 250-mark within a span of four weeks. “We have identified the hotspot villages in the taluka. Most of them are market places and have links with neighbouring Sangamner taluka of Ahmednagar district. The number of covid cases in these villages are too high. Hence, we are focusing on them to cut down the cases,” Mohan Bachchhav, Sinnar taluka health officer, said. The officers pointed out that these villages were termed hotspots because they not only have more than 10 active cases, but are also reporting fresh cases almost every alternate day. The officer said it is not possible to stop people from crossing borders for their needs like agriculture, commerce or even health issues. The officer also pointed out that there would be no roadside health camps, but focus would be on people in villages who have history of travelling — specifically to Ahmednagar district. The rapid antigen tests would be carried out for people who are asymptomatic and the ones who have any kind of symptoms will have to undergo the RT-PCR test. “This will help us find people with underlying conditions and contain the spread of the disease. It will also help us monitor those who may be jumping home isolation norms and send them to institutional quarantine,” Bachchhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/health-dept-begins-survey-in-10-hotspot-villages-in-sinnar/articleshow/86461616.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||MAA poll plot thickens as elders’ bid for unity fails||Hyderabad: The ‘elders’ of the Telugu film industry respectfully referred to as ‘peddalu’ seem to have lost their stature as developments in Tollywood indicated on Thursday. Much as they emphatically said they would see that elections to the Movie Artistes Association (MAA) were held unanimously by bringing about a rapprochement between all warring parties, actor Vishnu went ahead and announced his panel on Thursday. With the involved parties unrelenting, the battle is clearly on in Tollywood for the October 10 elections. Earlier this month, Prakash Raj had announced the 18 names in his panel for various posts and for the executive committee. While Prakash Raj has called his panel ‘Maa Biddalu’, Manchu Vishnu has described it as ‘MAA Kosam Manamandaram’ (All of us for MAA). The present president Naresh, who also has a panel, is yet to formally announce the names. “My wonderful and interesting panel,” is how Vishnu described his team. Raghu Babu, Madala Ravi, Babu Mohan, Prithiviraj Bali Reddy, Siva Balaji, Karate Kalyani and Gautham Raju are in fray for post of office bearers. Former MP and veteran actor Muralimohan, who some years ago also served as president of MAA, had said a couple of months ago that all the elders in the film industry would ensure that there would be no bad blood and they would talk to all artistes to agree for a unanimous election. That clearly has not happened and going by the developments is also unlikely to happen. Actor Naresh quickly released a video after Vishnu announced his panel through twitter. “You have sent me the list of names and asked for my opinion. The panel has fresh names and is positive. There are no controversial figures in the panel. You have given importance to women and also taken into consideration different regions. They are all educated. Expecting that your manifesto will also be as good as your panel. Hearty congratulations in advance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maa-poll-plot-thickens-as-elders-bid-for-unity-fails/articleshow/86466189.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Over 30% teaching vacancy in colleges dents learning||PUNE: Top colleges in the city, which have recorded over 90% cut-off marks in admission to various courses, are struggling as there are not enough permanent teachers to teach students. For many years, the government has barely allowed recruitment of teachers in the aided colleges resulting in huge vacancies. Most departments in colleges are being run with the help of contractual teachers which affects continuity in teaching and research and adds stress on the financial well being of the colleges, principal said. P B Buchade, principal of Abasaheb Garware College, said of the 117 teaching posts, 38 are vacant which comes to 32% of the total strength. “There are many departments where there is only one permanent teacher and the rest of the posts need to be filled up using contractual teachers. If the teachers are regular, then the responsibility and attachment to students are good. But getting teachers on a clock-hour basis is really hard. And even when we get them, he or she will join for a month or two and they leave. We manage with electives, offer them only when expertise is available. But the existing staff is overburdened and research is hampered,” he added. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said while the government wants more colleges to become autonomous, it never keeps its own commitment to keeping 85% of the teaching posts filled at any point. “The clock-hour appointments are also problematic. Such teachers can only take a maximum of nine lectures and they can only work in a single college. If they are paid Rs 500 per lecture, then that comes to Rs 4,500 per week which comes to Rs 18,000 a month. Nobody, with a PhD would want to work for that amount. Secondly, they are available only for lectures. They are not available for interaction or problem solving that regular teachers do in the college,” he added. Savita Datar, principal of SP College, established in 1916, said that out of 135 total teaching posts in her college, 38 posts are vacant. Seema Purohit, principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, said of the 30 sanctioned posts, 17 are vacant in her college. “Of course the quality of teaching gets affected. We feel bad because there are teaching associates who are extremely qualified but still earning low because the government has not started recruitment. We need to look at education and teachers as an investment,” Purohit said. Sharad Kunte, Chairman, Deccan Education Society that runs Fergusson College said it is hard to run the college without permanent teachers.  “Most teachers recruited on a clock hour basis do not take that much interest in teaching and in answer sheet checking . A college as prestigious as ours lacks teachers. Most senior teachers have retired and no recruitment has happened in 10 years. If they had been recruited then, by now they could guide the new teachers," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-30-teaching-vacancy-in-colleges-dents-learning/articleshow/86466196.cms||Ardhra Nair

The state cabinet on Wednesday decided to hold upcoming civic elections in many cities, except Mumbai, in a multi-member ward system. Till now, voters in Kolhapur had to elect one member from every ward. Now as per the state government’s decision, three wards will be clubbed and the voters have to cast votes to elect three candidates from the ward. The election to KMC is due since November last year. The process of ward restructuring and reservations has been completed. Now, the process will have to be done afresh. Mahadevrao Adgule, former mayor of KMC and legal expert, said, “The process of ward restructuring and reservations will have to be carried out afresh. Clubbing three wards needs to be done so that the boundaries of the final ward are clear. Also, the reservation lots have to be drawn again since the restructuring will change the demography of the wards.” Experts like Adgule believe that the latest decision will help the parties and the candidates cannot just rely on their work alone. “Only the candidates with their own clout can win independently. Otherwise, the candidates will have to rely on parties to win,” said Adgule. The KMC officials claimed that they were waiting for the state election commission’s directives to demarcate the wards and hold the elections on the basis of multi-member ward. The KMC has 81 seats at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/multi-member-ward-system-in-kmc-areas/articleshow/86461636.cms||---

The police said Unnikrishnan, 26, of Vattiyoorkavu is the one who sustained serious injuries in the accident and then got beaten up by the other men involved in the accident. The incident reportedly happened on Sunday. A video, apparently shot and released by Unnikrishnan's friends, showed him doing stunts along with another friend in the middle of the road at Nirappukala close to the Neyyar reservoir. In the video, the two young men are seen performing a rolling stoppie. Other vehicles, including a car, can be seen in the background, apparently waiting for the young men to finish their stunts to resume their journey. Unnikrishnan then suddenly took a u-turn and was hit by a Royal Enfield motorcycle ridden by two men. The Royal Enfield rammed into his right shin, causing a fracture. The men on that motorcycle, unaware of this fact, can be seen charging at him and thrashing him for causing the accident. The netizens who saw the video have blamed Unnikrishnan for causing the accident. Neyyar Dam police officials said that despite it being a serious accident, both parties refrained from reporting the matter to the police. Unnikrishnan was part of a five-member group of bikers who visited Neyyar Dam on Sunday. After the video went viral, Unnikrishnan's mother-in-law turned up before the Neyyar Dam police and gave her statement. She said that Unnikrishnan’s parents were not alive. He was still under treatment at a hospital. The police will be soon recording his statement to register a case. The Neyyar Dam police said local residents have been complaining of the rising menace of bike stunt enthusiasts here lately. Often, young bikers from the city reach here on weekends to perform stunts on the roads here that has relatively low vehicular traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bike-stunt-for-social-media-probe-launched/articleshow/86466253.cms||---

Somaiya has now made his tour details public through his official Twitter account. He has written to both district collector Rahul Rekhawar as well as district superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade seeking permission. Rekhawar said he would look into the application and review the situation before permitting Somaiya to tour the district. Rekhawar had last time banned Somaiya from entering Kolhapur district citing security threat and was stopped at Karad. Mushrif has, however, denied all the allegations levelled gainst him by Somaiya. Mushrif’s supporters have once again started mobilizing against Somaiya’s plan. Ramesh More, an activist from Kolhapur city, said if Somaiya created any law and order issue here, activists would then stage demonstrations outside the leader’s house in Mumbai. Murgud town council, under which the sugar factory is located, has passed a resolution to ban Somaiya entering the town. Somaiya is planning to visit the factory from outside. Rajekhan Jamadar, president of the Murgud town council,said, “I had convened an online meeting of all corporators. We passed a resolution to permanently ban Somaiya in the town.

The Std V and VIII scholarship examinations were conducted on August 8 by the Maharashtra State Council of Examination. The students get disbursement through the direct benefit transfer portal. Director of primary education, Dattatreya Jagtap, said, “There are some issues with feeding the data of students which is creating problems in transfer of the scholarship amount. Minor mistakes in name, account details and other information unless updated correctly cannot be processed.” Jagtap said a proposal was sent to the education department to make the allocation.

---||Nagpur||Vax for 12-17 age group likely to start from October 2||NAGPUR: High school-going children (12-17 years age group) are likely to start getting jabbed with the Zydus Cadila vaccine from October 2. Doctors closely associated with the children’s vaccine trials told TOI that the world’s first DNA-based Covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D has already received emergency use authorization (EUO) from regulatory authorities. In October, the company will bring 10 million doses to the market. Doctors not authorized to speak to media officially said October 2 is the tentative date which will be announced by government authorities soon. “We are excited about the trial results. Vaccine for kids is going to be the biggest step towards school reopening, which is necessary now,” said a senior paediatrician closely associated with the ZyCoV-D trials for kids. ZyCoV-D is an indigenously developed DNA-based, needle-free Covid-19 vaccine. According to the department of biotechnology (DBT), this vaccine produces spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response, which plays a vital role in protection from the disease as well as viral clearance. Covaxin’s paediatric trial has also shown very good results and the vaccine is likely to get EUO soon, said doctors who are leading these trials in the city. “Children aged between 12-17 years have shown good antibody levels in the last two-three reviews. In a month’s time, Covaxin will also get the approval from the government,” said a doctor. Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine is more convenient to hasten the pace of vaccination in the country. A trial of mix-and-match of nasal vaccine and injectable Covaxin is also underway in Nagpur. The initial results of nasal vaccine are exciting, said trial coordinators. According to infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, children are less likely to get severe Covid infection. “Children below 10 years of age don’t have enough viral receptors. If those in 12-17 age group get vaccine protection, there is no problem in reopening all schools. Reopening of schools is necessary for the intellectual development of children,” he said. Shinde added, “Children can go to schools. But it is necessary to develop a shield around them by ensuring that their parents and school staff are vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-for-12-17-age-group-likely-to-start-from-oct-2/articleshow/86466237.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The state government has received Rs 25 crore from the Centre. Maharashtra is one of the six states to benefit from this programme. The others are Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Rajasthan Joint secretary of the school education department, Rajendra Pawar, said, “The Union government has paid 60% of its share to implement this project while the remaining 40% will be put up by the state government. Accordingly, the state has received Rs 25.7 crore for 2020-21 financial year.” The state share for the project will be Rs 16.7 crore which will be allocated from the total budget for education set aside in the state budget. According to Pawar, the Stars project will strengthen early childhood education and foundational learning, facilitate school to work transition through vocational education, improve learning assessment mechanisms, and support teacher development. This will help in the economic and social progress of the country, the objectives say. Director of education, Dattatraya Jagtap said, “The focus will be on addressing the learning outcome challenge and help students better prepare for the jobs of the future through a series of reform initiatives.” Education activist, Matin Mujawar said, “These kinds of projects sound extremely futuristic and promising, however there is no guarantee that the project’s aims and objectives reach the beneficiaries. There is no cross monitoring, feedback, audit to see if the objectives were met. It is a lot of money and the government should be accountable for every penny it spends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stars-project-for-schools-with-rs-25cr-who-funding/articleshow/86466231.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The CM emphasised that cows can’t be protected by speeches alone. “Adding devotion in our behaviour towards the cow is the answer. The government is working in three ways for cow protection: Firstly, shelters are being made for abandoned cows where six lakh cows are being protected; secondly, under the Sahbhagita scheme, if anyone adopts a cow from a shelter he will get Rs 900 per month from the government and the third programme is for women and children facing malnutrition,” he said. “The government is doing its work, but people have to come forward as cows can’t be protected with the attitude of using them for milk and then abandoning them on roads,” he added. The chief minister said that so far no religious institute has come forward to adopt cows from shelters. “Religion could be protected when the real values are understood. Only speeches can’t protect cows.

Police cited opinion by Sasoongeberal hospital doctors who said that he sustained ruptured rib bones and lungs and suffered internal bleeding owing to the fall on hard surface. The fire brigade officials had spread a safety net to arrest his fall, but in vain. Inspector Ashwini Satpute of the Bund Garden police told TOI, “We are yet to establish the motive behind the man’s action. We are also seeking a medical opinion to establish if he was suffering from any mental issues.” Kasba Peth fire station officials rushed to the spot carrying safety nets, harnesses, and other life-saving equipment. “As soon as the firemen reached him, he jumped off the hoarding and landed on the ground. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment,” inspector Satpute said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-jumps-off-35ft-high-hoarding-seriously-hurt/articleshow/86466247.cms||---

The high court had earlier reserved orders in the petition filed by N Maruti Mahalakshmi, the second wife of Sri Veera Bhoga Vasanta Venkateswara Swamy, the head of the mutt who died a few months back. Following his death, there has been a dispute among the family members on who will take over the reins of the mutt. While Mahalakshmi has claimed that a will has been executed by her husband in favour of her son to take over the mutt’s affairs after his demise, Veera Bhoga’s elder son from his first wife has also claimed succession of the mutt. Government, in the meanwhile, appointed the assistant commissioner of endowments to take over the management of mutt and later it was announced that the elder son will head the mutt. The HC had earlier set aside the orders of the government as the resolution passed by Dharmika Parishat was not unanimous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pick-mutt-head-within-2-months-parishat-told/articleshow/86463884.cms||Srikanth Aluri

MahaMetro had scheduled girder-launching for the viaduct during the recent Ganeshotsav but had to pause it after Ganesh mandals raised concerns over the viaduct possibly obstructing the passage of Ganapati immersion floats during the immersion procession in the future. Mandal representatives and political parties then urged MahaMetro to not proceed with the work till a solution is found. The issue also came up during Wednesday’s general body meeting of the Pune Municipal Corporation. “We will soon hold a meeting on the issue and explain the plan to leaders from political parties. We have already held meetings with Ganesh mandals,” have also been held with Ganesh mandals,” a MahaMetro official said. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC, said no one was opposing the Metro project. “All we want is to protect the legacy of the immersion procession,” he said. Aba Bagul, leader of Congress in PMC, said MahaMetro must review all options. “MahaMetro must consider modern technology to launch the girder at Lakdi Pul. Increasing the height is another viable option,” Bagul suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/meeting-to-discuss-metro-viaduct-across-lakdi-pul/articleshow/86466290.cms||---

The police identified the suspect as Binu, 51, of Udiyankuoangara. Shinekumar alias Sabu, 43, of Kaivanvila is the complainant in the case. Both the suspect and complainant were friends as well as co-workers who are into the profession of constructing wells. The police said that the incident related to the case happened on Thursday morning near Dhanuvachapuram park. Shinekumar was inside a well that stood on the house premises of one Vijayakumar and engaged in construction activities along with another man, Bhuvanachandran. Binu allegedly took a boulder which is assumed to be weighing over 10 kg and dropped it into the well. Shinekumar, who sustained injuries, was hospitalised. Bhuvanachandran escaped unhurt. Following this incident Binu soon fled from the scene. The police said that Shinekumar and Binu were not on good terms recently. They had a fall out earlier. Shinekumar had recently constructed a well on Binu's house compound and he complained that Binu did not pay him enough. This soon grew into a personal rivalry. The accused was later tracked down and arrested by a team led by Parassala station house officer inspector Sathikumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-held-for-murder-attempt/articleshow/86466294.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune crosses milestone of administering 1 crore vaccine doses||PUNE: The district on Thursday surpassed the milestone of administering one crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines, eight months after the vaccination started. Pune is the second district in the state to achieve the feat. According to CoWIN portal, a total of 1,00,14,107 doses were administered till 7pm on Thursday, covering 69.34 lakh beneficiaries from the eligible adult population with at least one dose and the remaining 30.79 lakh with both the doses. The vaccination drive has recorded over 91 lakh Covishield doses getting administered and around 8 lakh doses of Covaxin. As many as 53,869 doses of Sputnik V were given after it was rolled out in July. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI, “We geared up from the very beginning of the vaccination drive, which yielded this result. All the elements of the health department and the administration have a pivotal role to play in it.  Our next target is to cover the rest of the first dose beneficiaries and speed up the vaccination of those due for the second dose. We are microplanning it and one can expect more mega vaccination drives.” Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Hospital Board of India of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune chapter, told TOI, “This is a great achievement for all of us — the district administration, citizens and all the elements involved in the vaccination process, including the healthcare workers in the government and private hospitals. Now that around 80% of our target population has received at least one dose, we are very near to achieve the herd immunity and hopefully, the pending beneficiaries for the second dose, too, would be immunized at the earliest.” According to Patil, this should be the highest number of shots administered in the history of Pune and a proud moment. The vaccination drive started from January 16 across the district amid hesitancy among the healthcare workers, the first beneficiaries. The frontline workers were given vaccines from February 1, while the senior citizens (60-plus) were offered jabs from March 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-crosses-milestone-of-administering-1cr-vax-doses/articleshow/86466321.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Corneal expert Prasanna Aradhye of Nandadeep Hospital performed the surgery under the guidance of opthalmologist Saurabh Patwardhan. The damage to the cornea is a rare disorder and is usually due to an infection. The girl had developed the infection after an injury. Her vision had become blurred and her left eye was not responding to the normal light. Aradhye, while speaking to TOI, said, “Such surgeries are rare in the small age group patients. Their parents usually ignore it and once they get older, they lose their vision. At that age, restoring the vision becomes difficult.” He said that they managed to get the cornea from Hyderabad. The eye donation is significant in saving vision of patients. Aradhye said that the girl will have normal vision after a one and half years as it develops naturally. He said that the success rate in corneal transplants in smaller age groups can be increased by ensuring better post-operative management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/corneal-transplant-saves-eye-of-toddler-girl/articleshow/86461694.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Road safety council member criticises state||Thiruvananthapuram: National road safety council (NRSC) member Kamal Soi, who is in the city currently, said on Thursday that he does not understand why the state government here is in delaying the implementation of the high security registration plate (HSRP) scheme ignoring orders by the Supreme Court as well as the ministry of road transport and highways issued in 2018. Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, he said that the reluctance of the state to be up to speed with the rest of the country in terms of using the latest technology does not suit the state's image of being one with a high rate of literacy and education. Soi said that there are many benefits for HSRP. It will help to maintain the security of the vehicles and identify the vehicles in case of accidents or damages. The number plates are written in IND with chromium plating, and therefore, it will be easy to track the numbers even during the night. In case the vehicle gets burnt in an accident, or it is abandoned, it is easy to get the details of the owner. The high security registration plate powered number plates have smart features that enable them to retrieve details of vehicles that catch fire during accidents or deliberately put on fire, he said. Soi said that at a time when the rate of heinous crimes are increasing at a fast pace, schemes such as HSRP will enable law enforcers to track down and arrest culprits fast. He said that Kerala is the only state in the country that is yet to implement the scheme fully. While vehicles delivered post 2019 are rolled out with HSRP number plates it is the responsibility of the state government to ensure that older vehicles are upgraded to HSRP. He also lambasted the motor vehicles department of Kerala which still issues paperback registration certificates and driving licenses while the rest of the nation has moved to smart cards.  The national road safety council member also added that he met minister for transport Antony Raju here and personally appealed him to implement the system fast. If the state government still caused a delay in complying with the court order, he would file public interest litigation before the state High Court, Soi, who is also an internationally acclaimed road safety expert, said here during the news conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/road-safety-council-member-criticises-state/articleshow/86466329.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Spice garden top draw of PMC biodiversity park plan||PUNE: The civic body has finalized its plan for the biggest biodiversity park having seven gardens, including one for spices, on Taljai Hill. Vasundhara biodiversity park, spread across 102 acre, will be developed at the cost of Rs120 crore. “This spice garden will have multiple aims. Citizens and youngsters should get educated about spices. Most of them are aware about the finished products, but do not know about the raw form or trees of these spices. This garden will also educate public about the medicinal qualities of these plants,” said Ashok Ghorpade, the head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) garden department. A PMC official said spices were mostly produced in areas with hot and humid weather. Accordingly, artificial conditions would be created at the park by using greenhouse or polyhouse technology. “The civic body will get in touch with states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, besides some northern states, for guidance about plantation. These states already have such gardens,” a senior PMC official said.  According to the PMC’s plan, a stretch of the project will be used for an Oxygen park. The proposal includes small amphitheatres, cultural facilities and a cricket stadium. A ‘Gurukul-style school’, skateboard ramp, rock climbing wall and a bamboo park are also in the plan. The park was proposed and approved by the civic standing committee in 2002. The proposal has been tabled before the standing committee. “The elected members want to know the project details. The civic staff and architects will give a presentations before a call on its approval,” said Hemant Rasane, chairperson of the PMC’s standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/spice-garden-top-draw-of-pmc-biodiversity-park-plan/articleshow/86466339.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Salon told to pay Rs 2 crore for ‘botching’ model’s haircut||NEW DELHI: If it wasn’t for the sum involved, one could perhaps joke that the salon operator was having a bad hair day. But Rs 2 crore is not a trifling sum and that is what the salon has to pay a model as punitive award for a haircut that allegedly wasn’t what she had hoped for. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) awarded this sum to the model on Tuesday for allegedly deficient services at a salon in a five-star hotel in Delhi in April 2018. Justifying the award, NCRDC president RK Agrawal and member S M Kantikar held in their order that “…women are very cautious and careful with their hair. They spend a handsome amount on keeping hair in good condition. They are also emotionally attached with their hair. The complainant was a model for hair products because of her long hair... But due to hair cutting against her instructions, she lost her expected assignments and suffered a huge loss which completely changed her lifestyle and shattered her dream to be a top model.” The model visited the salon on April 12, 2018, a week before she was to appear for an interview. Her regular hairdresser was unavailable that day and some other stylist apparently took over. The order noted, “According to the complainant, she specifically instructed the hairdresser for long flicks/layers covering her face in the front and at the back and four-inch straight hair trim from the bottom. It is alleged in the complaint that the complainant was wearing high-powered spectacles and was requested by the hairdresser to keep her head constantly down.” While the model wanted a “simple haircut”, the hairdresser allegedly took over an hour on the task. Told she was getting a “London” haircut. The complainant was left in “utter shock and surprise”, when the hairdresser allegedly “chopped off her entire hair, leaving only four inches from the top”. The haircare model complained to the salon management and was offered hair extension treatment for the interview or treatment of hair “free of cost.” On May 3, the model returned to the salon, but alleged later that “during treatment, her hair and scalp got completely damaged with excess ammonia and there was a lot of irritation in the scalp”. The NCRDRC order noted that the model “underwent severe mental breakdown and trauma due to negligence in cutting her hair and… finally lost her job”, and directed the hotel to pay her Rs 2 crore within eight weeks of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/salon-told-to-pay-rs-2cr-for-botching-models-haircut/articleshow/86467396.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The flight, which is scheduled thrice a week, has already been cancelled six times this month. The flight service authorities have given "operational reasons" as the cause every time through email and text messages — creating last-moment panic among passengers. Samir Sheth, a frequent flyer to Mumbai, said, "The passengers have to face hardships when there are sudden cancellations. They may have connecting national or international flights from the Mumbai airport. Those flights are usually on time. Therefore, if the passengers don't reach Mumbai on time, then their entire schedule can get disturbed and cause them mental frustration. People have business meetings, medical appointments, and other personal reasons to reach Mumbai. Last moment cancellations spark panic. The 72-seat flight is usually fully booked and should be operated properly." Though the airport authority is ready to welcome the flights, the Kolhapur-Mumbai flight has got cancelled few times due to some operational reasons from the flight service provider. Kamal Kumar Katariya, the Kolhapur airport director AAI, said, "The flight service between Kolhapur-Mumbai was canceled around six times in September due to some operational reasons by the flight service provider. However, I am sure that it will get streamlined from the next week. The flight connects Kolhapur and Mumbai thrice a week — on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays — and gets a good response. Most of the time, the flight is 100% full. The other flights from Kolhapur to Tirupati, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad are also getting very good responses."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-mum-flight-cancellations-ground-passenger-plans/articleshow/86461719.cms||---

The noise level on the final-day day of the 10-day festival in fact was higher than last year's. A team from the environment science department of the Shivaji University, Kolhapur surveyed the noise levels at 22 locations in the city. It found that the noise levels were higher due to the bursting of firecrackers and the use of the high-decibel sound systems by the pandals. Dr Asawari Jadhav, the head of the environment science department, said, "Last year, there were fewer people on the roads due to the stricter Covid restrictions. The use of firecrackers, loudspeakers, vehicle horns etc. had increased this year. Therefore, the overall noise level at most of the places in Kolhapur city was higher." "Our department surveyed the noise level at 22 locations in four zones — silent, residential, commercial and industrial — in the city and found an increase in noise level this year on the immersion day between 6pm to midnight. The noise level on immersion day was also the highest in comparison to the previous nine days of the Ganesh festival this year" added Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ganesha-idol-21-immersion-day-louder-than-in-2019/articleshow/86461747.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune Indian Medical Association wants booster dose for healthcare workers||PUNE: Doctors attached with the Pune branch of the Indian Medical Association have unanimously upheld the need for a booster dose for healthcare workers, making it the first unit of the medical body in India to officially make such a recommendation. Senior paediatrician Dilip Sarda, the chairman of the Pune Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s core committee on Covid vaccination said, “Various studies have proven that vaccine mediated protective antibodies wane considerably after six to eight months. Healthcare workers are the most exposed and high-risk segment. Hence, they should at least get the third booster dose.” IMA Maharashtra branch president Ramkrishna Londhe said, “The state and the national body of IMA has not made recommendation for a booster shot for healthcare workers yet.” In a small study of 40 members carried out recently, the Pune IMA office-bearers found that the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was extremely variable. “All the 40 members were positive for the virus-specific antibodies, but some had less than 50, while the level was as high as 500 in some, indicating the depletion and the need for a booster dose,” Sarda said. A booster shot, though offered in several western nations, remains a hotly debated topic in India. The Centre recently made it clear that it was not a priority, indicating that a decision on the third dose might not be imminent. The IMA, Pune, members expressed readiness to undergo a trial to assess the need for a booster dose among the healthcare workers in India. Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Pune IMA’s hospital wing, said, “When Covid vaccine was rolled out on January 16 in India, healthcare workers were the first to get it. Much of the confidence about the vaccine’s safety and protection-lending capacity is built on the their vaccination data. Hence, if it is about assessing the need for booster dose, healthcare workers attached with IMA Pune branch are ready to participate in studies.” Booster dose might be given to vaccinated people with lower antibody levels against Covid-19, Patil said. “The Union government’s present concern is the vaccination of all eligible population with at least one dose. We are all for it. There are about one lakh healthcare workers in Pune. It means, we need not more one lakh doses to give them a booster shot,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-19-pune-ima-wants-booster-dose-for-healthcare-workers/articleshow/86466353.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The HC had earlier held the officers guilty of non-implementation of its orders in paying compensation to a woman from Nellore district, who had moved a contempt petition against officials for not paying compensation to her in lieu of land taken under land acquisition. As the time period set by the high court had expired, Tallapaka Savitramma moved the contempt petition. After hearing her plea, the HC pronounced Manmohan Singh (then principal secretary of revenue), SS Rawat (principal secretary of finance), MV Seshagiri Babu, Revu Mutyala Raju and KNV Chakradhar, who were collectors of Nellore district, guilty under Contempt of Court Act. While Singh, Rawat and Raju were sentenced to jail term along with fine, Chakrabhar and Babu were only fined. As the court suspended the sentence for four weeks to go for appeal, the officials moved petitions pleading to set aside the single judge order. Special government pleader C Sumon told the HC that its orders have been complied with and compensation has been paid to Savitramma. He said the officials made all efforts to pay the compensation in accordance with the orders of the HC. However, the single judge held the officials guilty for the delay that took place in complying with the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-suspends-jail-sentence-of-ias-officers/articleshow/86463971.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Schools whose affiliation has not been approved transfer their students to other friendly CBSE institutes for a considerable sum of money. This way their students get to appear from CBSE board, albeit from a different school. Since this saves the ‘academic future’ of the student, parents don’t complain and due to financial kickback even the new school takes the risk. The central board frowns upon this practice and has repeatedly warned against such malpractice, but in reality it’s not possible for CBSE to track every single student in all affiliated schools. CBSE last week opened its online portal for submission of List of Candidates (LOC) by schools, in which principals have to mention all details of students registered on their rolls. In official CBSE terminology, it’s called ‘sponsoring students’. As in, the schools sponsor their students for exams conducted by the CBSE. But considering the malpractice indulged in by certain schools, the CBSE this literally harped on the point of sponsoring only genuine students. The board’s circular which are usually the typical black and white drab notes, the CBSE went on to include a coloured blurb in which the warning is mentioned clearly. Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE’s controller of examination, wrote in the circular that “schools should sponsor only their own candidates”. He reminded principals that it was their responsibility to ensure that students are not from any unaffiliated or unauthorized schools, they are attending classes regularly and that they are not registered with any other educational board. The board went on to cite its Affiliations Bye-Laws 2018 and provisions under section 14.2 which mentions that every school has to send a LOC with names of students enrolled in Std IX-XII. Unlike the popular perception, CBSE only deals with Std IX-XII and that’s the reason their schools get affiliation only from Std IX onwards. Schools found indulging in such practices are liable to face disaffiliation. A senior academic, who is currently retired, told TOI that it’s almost impossible for CBSE to prove such cases. “First of all, it’s very difficult for CBSE to find out, unless someone from within the school complains. Secondly, proving it through paperwork is not as easy hence the onus lies on the principal to avoid getting into such legal problems,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-warns-schools-against-illegal-sponsoring-of-students/articleshow/86466402.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Data from the public health department for the September 15-21 week revealed that Akola, Buldhana, Dhule, Hingoli, Nanded, Nandurbar and Yavatmal districts registered below 6,000 tests in these seven days despite being advised to increase testing in the previous week. The other three districts cautioned — Osmanabad, Palghar and Parbhani — showed some improvement. A senior official of the public health department said, “The testing has to improve, and it has been repeatedly conveyed to collectors. These districts are testing very low and some are conducting more Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) than RT-PCR tests. We cannot be complacent.” Test conducted in September 15-21 weekThe overall daily testing in the state dropped to 1.19 lakh in the week ending on September 21 from 2.01 lakh for the week between July 10 and 17. Last week, a total of 1.67 lakh tests were conducted in Maharashtra. A health expert said there had been repeated meetings with the collectors of the cautioned districts on ramping up tests and surveillance, especially contact tracing and testing in hotspot areas. State Covid task force member Shashank Joshi said, “We shall need one more week post-Ganesh festivities to get a clear picture on if there has been a significant drop in active cases. We are still having around 40,000 Covid cases. Considering the high prevalence of monsoon activity and constant movement of people because of festivities, testing in some geographies should be scaled up. We cannot be complacent because it is important for us to isolate the asymptomatic carriers at the earliest.” He said public health measures like following Covid protocols, double-masking and vaccination were the key to contain the spread of coronavirus. “There has not been a major drop in cases of the Delta variant in circulation although there has definitely been a significant thinning of the second wave. But testing remains the key,” Joshi said. He said a significant increase in the positivity rate was not noticed despite the dip in testing. It meant there was a gradual decline of the second wave in most districts, Joshi said. About 17 districts registered less than 100 cases, according to the recent cabinet note prepared by the public health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-7-of-10-dists-cautioned-conduct-below-5000-weekly-tests/articleshow/86466382.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The national bird of Azerbaijan, European Roller is the solitary bird from the roller family that breeds in Europe, Asia and north Africa and winter in the east and south Africa with brief stay in parts of Maharashtra post-the second half of the rainy season as a passage migrant In the few latest sightings, the European Roller was spotted near Majalgaon in Beed district of Marathwada in the vicinity of the Jatwada area, located around 10km from Aurangabad. Honorary wildlife warden and bird expert Kishor Pathak said the European Roller was close to getting the status of “Near Threatened” due to the decline in its population. “The bird dwelled here for a few weeks before embarking upon the journey towards breeding grounds in other parts of the world. The insect population grows during the rainy season in Marathwada and other parts as the bird feeds on it,” he said. The bird exhibits rolling aerial movements of the body during courtship displays or territorial fights. Besides European Roller, the Indian Roller, another bird from the “roller” family, also migrates to Marathwada and other parts of Maharashtra from north of India during the fag-end of the rainy season. The two rollers differ in shades of blue and brown on various body parts. The beak of the European Roller is slightly longer than the Indian Roller. “These birds along with the other feathery bipeds play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance acting as a crucial part of the food chain of the nature,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/european-roller-keeps-date-with-marathwada/articleshow/86461799.cms||Prasad Joshi

The functioning of the college was supposed to begin from the end of this year. NMC’s medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, told TOI that the proposed PG medical college would be established in the next financial year. “We were in the advanced stage of planning when the deadly second wave of the pandemic begand in Nashik in March. We could not proceed with the PG medical project as we got busy dealing with the rising cases in the city,” Nagargoje said. According to him, the NMC is firm on its plans to establish the medical college that would enable the civic body to avail the services of doctors studying in the proposed medical college. The NMC’s proposed PG medical college would be established at its Bytco hospital and would be affiliated to Mumbai-based College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) — an autonomous body. The college would offer 13 different PG courses with an intake capacity of 26. A CPS team would inspect the infrastructure before giving its nod to the project. The civic administration has ruled out the possibility of starting an under-graduate medical college at this juncture as it entails huge cost. “Once we start the PG medical college we will have additional doctors who would treat patients admitted to the various civic-run hospitals. It would be a boon both for the patients and the civic body,” the civic officials. The NMC has been struggling to hire doctors on contract during the two waves of the pandemic, but despite the best efforts the response was lukewarm. There were even cases where few doctors left some time after joining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-delays-nmcs-medical-college-plan/articleshow/86461819.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

According to state government sources, the service was expected to resume in September however, there are no signs of the flights to begin any time soon. With this, seaplane operations have remained suspended for some 221 days since its inception on October 31, last year. The aircraft which operated the sea plane flight along the route has been sent to Maldives for maintenance earlier this year. It is unclear whether the service will resume on its maiden anniversary this year, say sources. “SpiceJet, whose 100% subsidiary - Spice Shuttle, operates the seaplane service is in talks with a manufacturer to buy an aircraft. These processes take time and therefore, we are not sure whether and when the new aircraft will be procured and operationalised for the service,” a source privy to the development. Seaplane flights connecting Ahmedabad and Kevadia were suspended earlier this year just ahead of the second wave of Covid-19 infections. An email query sent to SpiceJet went unanswered. At a time when the resumption existing service is in doldrums, the upcoming water drome project at Shatrunjay Dam near Palitana in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat has also faced a bottleneck. “A land parcel had been identified for the Shatrunjay Dam project right near the dam site. However, the feasibility study which was conducted for setting up the water drome revealed that the site is a little below the ‘High Flood Level’ of the dam,” said Captain Ajay Chauhan, director – Civil Aviation, Government of Gujarat. Due to this, the water drome cannot be built at the site. State authorities have already earmarked another land parcel near the previous site and a feasibility study will soon begin. “We have identified and earmarked another land parcel located some 500m from the previously proposed water drome site for Shatrunjay Dam. A proposal regarding this will soon be sent to the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation. Once approved, a feasibility study will soon be conducted,” Chauhan added. Shatrunjay Dam at Palitana in Bhavnagar district and Dharoi Dam in Mehsana district were two sites identified for the proposed seaplane project.

The unions are saying that these are not new entities but PSUs carved out of existing ordnance factories. The seven new PSUs have been formed by clubbing different factories earlier under the OFB. The statement on the poster has irked the unions, including the RSS affiliated Bharaitya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS). Earlier, the OFB was a government department having 41 factories under it. Both the communist-leaning All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF) and BPMS have written to the secretary, defence production, saying that the poster is misleading and should be withdrawn. They say that even as the poster mentions that seven new companies are being dedicated to the country, “the fact is that the 41 ordnance factories are being splintered into seven non-viable corporations”. The unions have been opposing the move to corporatize the OFB. They have planned to stage a protest on the same day when the function to dedicate the companies to the nation will be held. The new companies will be separately engaged in making armoured vehicles, troop comfort items, weapon systems, optical devices, advance weapons, parachutes, ammunitions and other machinery. The unions have also filed cases against the government’s move to corporatize the OFB and the Essential Defence Services Act (EDSA). The pleas against ESDA have been filed separately by AIDEF and BPMS. The petition filed by BPMS was heard on Wednesday and the next date has been fixed on November 16. EDSA prevents workers in defence establishments like the factories from going on strike. The Indian Ordnance Factory Services association has also filed a petition against the process of section of chairmen and directors for the new PSUs. The petition will be heard next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poster-on-new-psus-misleading-of-unions/articleshow/86466504.cms||Shishir Arya

(RIL) and other city-based firms have manufactured plastic components from Covid-19 PPE waste. The recycling technology involved converting the decontaminated PPE waste (mainly PPE suits) into an easily processable and upcycled agglomerated form (pellets or granules) which were then converted to non-food applications. Initially, the CSIR-NCL team demonstrated the lab-scale manufacture using the existing recycling infrastructure. This was then scaled up to a pilot study of 100 kg in Pune city which was successfully implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncl-pvt-cos-to-recycle-ppe-waste/articleshow/86466506.cms||---

The event organised by Four Fox Productions, an event management company, was themed ‘Ardhanarinateshwar’ based on the composite male-female figure of Shiva together with his consort Parvati. The founders of the company, Mahesh Charwad and Sharvari Gawande, also announced the launch of a hypermarket which will be run entirely by transgender staff in Pimpri Chinchwad. “We want to give transgenders a platform where they can excel like everyone else. The Super Store will have only transgender employees, from the entry level to managerial positions, manufacturing and production to operations,” said Gawande. Khushi Shaikh, a transgender model and social media influencer, who was also the showstopper, said, “Opportunities like these help us realise that we, too, can achieve our dreams and build a career in any field we want.” Another participant said, “We don’t want to be treated differently. We want to study, work hard, hone our skills, build a career. When it comes to employment, it is wrong to be discriminated against, but it happens all the time. What our community needs is employment opportunities so that we can gain financial stability and empower ourselves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transgenders-walk-the-ramp-highlight-need-for-employment-opportunities/articleshow/86466561.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

She suffered serious injuries on her head and was admitted to a hospital. I also suffered injuries in my head,” he said. Police sources said the accused was a jilted lover and had reached the victim’s house to express his feelings. But, the girl refused to talk. This led the youth to lose patience and pick up a fight with her.

The project was announced in the Budget speech and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is expected to lay the foundation stone on October 2. “The estimated cost of the project is Rs 54 crore and the civic body will invite tenders for the same,” an official said. The project had courted controversies since it was proposed. The Central Park Sangharsh Samiti had alleged that the land was acquired for the park and cannot be utilised for any other purpose. Samiti president Yogesh Yadav said, “JDA is adamant in constructing the multi-crore museum project at the Central Park after violating all rules.” Under the Rajasthan State Land Acquisition Act, the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) had acquired 322 bighas in the Rambagh Complex for public utilities in 1973. As per UIT claims, the prime buildings were part of the ‘acquired’ land and JDA took possession of the same after a long legal battle in 2017. “As the land was acquired for the park purpose, the state government is blatantly violating court orders and constructing the project on public land,” Yadav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-starts-demolition-of-laxmi-vilas-hotel/articleshow/86466570.cms||---

The study assumes significance because the testing data formed the base for identifying hotspots, and deciding on lockdowns and relaxations in states, a senior Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist said. “The aim is to get details like district, age, time, comorbidity and impact on disease management,” he said. Senior scientist and coordinator of the online processing system at ICMR Lokesh Sharma told TOI that the data mined would help in handling a pandemic in future. He said the ICMR invited proposals on analysis of Covid-19 testing data with the primary objective of improving public health, ideas of mining and adding values to national Covid-19 test datasets. The study assumes significance because the testing data formed the base for identifying hotspots Currently, the testing data is being fed to the database through a web and an application programming interface and being shared with different states and agencies.. “According to the ICMR research funding rule, the project review committee would review the proposals and then the study will commence. The duration of the study would vary from project to project. The maximum duration for any study will be three years. The testing data would include RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests (RATs).

As per sources at the Pune airport, the number of passengers being deboarded by airline staff are on the rise. “There have been five or six such cases this month,” an airport official said, adding, “All other states have stated that if one is fully vaccinated and 15 days have lapsed since the second dose, the test report is not needed. However, this is not the case with Karnataka and West Bengal.” Kavita Shreejesh, whose friend was deboarded from a Bengaluru-bound flight last week, said, “We later found out that a negative RT-PCR report is mandatory, even when one is fully vaccinated. In his case, he got no information from the airline and he didn’t check as no other state had this requirement. He lost Rs 10,000 due to this.” Flyers flumoxxedK Krishna, another business flyer, said, “I had come to Pune from Bengaluru and had to return the same evening. They didn’t allow me to board. I ended up spending a day at a hotel, paying a huge amount to rebook my ticket and get an RT-PCR test done. What is the use of vaccination?” At the time of this writing, emails sent to the chief secretaries of both states remained unanswered.  “It is difficult to say why the two states are still following the RT-PCR norm. However, states have been given liberty to have their own regulations in place,” state relief and rehabilitation principal secretary Aseem Gupta said.

High Sir,” suddenly echoed in Lucknow University on Thursday, making students turn their heads to find 50 jawans of Assam Rifles entering the campus on bicycles. Cycling all the way from Shillong, the 50 jawans who are part of 3,000-km cycle rally organized by Assam Rifles to celebrate Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav — the government’s initiative to mark 75 years of India’s Independence, reached the campus to motivate students and arouse the feeling of nationalism in them. The jawans started their bicycle rally from Shillong on September 5 last year and have crossed five states while cycling through Siliguri, Kolkata, Ranchi, Prayagraj and reached Lucknow where they were accorded a warm welcome from LU’s UP 63 Battalion, NCC. Students and teachers cycled with them on the campus and bid them goodbye while wishing all the best for their onward journey to the next destination. The jawans will go to Agra, Mathura and will finally end the rally in New Delhi “The rally commemorates 75 years of progressive India and the glorious history of its people, culture, achievements and promotes the Fit India Movement. The jawans visited all places related to the freedom struggle and paid tributes to freedom fighters.

---||Pune||Pune: Urban development department urges to focus on buses to take cars off streets||PUNE: A group of urban policymakers under the banner of think-tanks Parisar and Sustainable Urban Mobility Network (SUM Net) India have urged the state urban development department to focus on increasing reliable bus transportation to get more cars off the streets. The meeting was organised by Parisar and SUM Net to emphasise the need for implementing 50 buses per one lakh of urban population mandated by the Union housing and urban development ministry for all cities in Maharashtra. Campaign coordinator for Parisar, Swati Pathak, added that a report on bus-based urban transportation would be prepared and forwarded to Eknath Shinde, the state urban development minister. A webinar organised to discuss the issue found that while Mumbai and Pune were inching closer to that mark, other cities in Maharashtra, like Nashik and Aurangabad, have inadequate network of buses. The experts also said that the authorities should plan ahead for areas not within the core cities. “Plans are still made for areas within municipal limits. Local area plans must be made for peri-urban areas outside municipality boundaries. The urban development department should ensure that guidelines are issued for planners to incorporate transport in the framework of a development plan,” said housing and planning expert Vidyadhar Phatak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/urban-development-dept-urged-to-focus-on-buses-to-take-cars-off-streets/articleshow/86466597.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Dehradun||SC-appointed panel qizzes Centre, state over road through Corbett-Rajaji corridor||Dehradun: A Central empowered committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court has asked the Centre and the Uttarakhand government to provide details on construction cost as well as forest clearances provided to a motorable road that passes through the buffer zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve as well as the only wildlife corridor it shares with Corbett Tiger Reserve. The committee has asked the Centre and state to respond within 15 days on why the length of the proposed elevated road — meant to provide smooth passage to wildlife — was reduced and its location changed. The 11.5km Laldhang-Chillarkhal road aims to minimise travel time between Garhwal and Kumaon divisions and is therefore being pushed by the state government as “a critical road for the people of the area.” But the stretch where the road is proposed includes a 4.5km-long stretch, which is the only wildlife corridor that connects Rajaji with Corbett. The Supreme Court had intervened in the matter and road construction was put on hold in June 2019. The state government was asked to get clearance from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the wildlife board. The NTCA had approved the road in April with three riders — the state should get forest clearance from the environment ministry, the length of the underpass should be 700m, the height of the underpass should be 8m. The state forest department, however, suggested modifications to the project, including reducing the length of the underpass to 470m and its height to 5m. The department also argued that it did not require forest clearance as per the Forest Conservation Act guidelines since a kuccha road existed prior to 1980 and it was only being turned into a motorable road. The CEC in its meeting on September 16, details of which were released on September 21, has raised several questions over the project. It has asked the Centre to respond in 15 days with an explanation on why the 2014 Dhananjay Mohan Committee’s report which approved a 4.5km-long elevated road was diluted to reduce its length to 400m. It also asked why the elevated road was being called an ‘underpass’. The CEC also noted that NTCA had recommended an elevated road length of 710m while a jointly prepared report of NTCA and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) proposed a 1,410m long elevated road. “The scientist from WII stated that as per guidelines approved by National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), the total length of free passage should be minimum of 30% of the total length of the road which works out to 1,410m. The reasons for NBWL rejecting the recommendation of the joint committee to construct the 1,410m long road may please be given”. The committee also raised questions on why the location of the elevated road was changed. “The elevated road, suggested in the site visit report dated March 30, 2021, is situated between Jaspur and Kotawali whereas the National Board for Wildlife is said to have approved the elevated road between Chamaria bend and Siggadi Soth. The scientific reason which guided the NBWL in changing the location of the elevated road may be indicated,” it said. The CEC also sought the total cost of the road, including the cost of bridges being constructed while asking the environment ministry to furnish exact requirements related to forest land clearance”. The state was also asked to provide all files connected with the matter, at the forest department, PWD and government level to the CEC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-appointed-panel-qizzes-centre-state-over-road-through-corbett-rajaji-corridor/articleshow/86462056.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||Rai urges neighbouring states to do more for clean air||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday appealed to the Centre and Delhi’s neighbouring states to adopt more robust practices to tackle air pollution like it has been done in the capital. Rai said Delhi’s efforts to switch to CNG and cleaner fuels were meaningless unless the neighbouring states did the same. Asking the Centre and state governments to convert public transport and commercial vehicles to CNG, the minister added that all industrial units in the NCR needed to operate on PNG to curb pollution. “More than local pollution, air quality deteriorates in Delhi because of external factors emerging from the surrounding states. For the past one week, we have been monitoring the air quality. On September 18, the PM10 reading was 67 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) and PM2.5 was 27 µg/m3. The next day, it was 85 and 35 µg/m3, respectively,” said Rai. The minister added, “On September 20, PM10 was 78 and PM2.5 31 µg/m3, on September 21, 81 and 31 µg/m3 and on September 22, 64 and 27 µg/m3. When pollution levels were monitored last year through a war room created by Delhi government, the impact of stubble burning was visible.” Stating that the Centre and states needed to work on a war-footing to implement the usage of the bio-decomposer solution being sprayed by Delhi government for free, Rai added that hotspots in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh needed on-ground task forces to tackle localised pollution. He also suggested implementation of electric vehicle and tree transplantation policies to further reduce pollution. “To tackle the pollution in Delhi-NCR during winter, Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav organised a meeting on Thursday, which was attended by the chairman of CAQM MM Kutty and environment ministers and chief secretaries of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. We appealed to the Centre and the states to eradicate the stubble burning practice as soon as possible,” said Rai. Rai further stated that it had come to Delhi government’s knowledge that plans were being made by the neighbouring states to just distribute the bio-decomposer capsules to farmers. “Merely distributing the capsules won’t solve this problem. It wouldn’t have been possible to control pollution had Delhi government not done the task itself. We have delegated the responsibility to the agriculture department to oversee manufacturing and spraying on the farmlands. The cost of spraying is just Rs 1,000 per acre in Delhi and other states can do the same,” Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-urges-neighbouring-states-to-do-more-for-clean-air/articleshow/86467436.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Over a month after dine-in services resumed, rough estimates show that around 4000 restaurants in Pune are working at just 40% of their original strength — from a total of 1.5 lakh staffers in pre-Covid times, only around 60,000 employees are at work, said Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA). “Around 10-15 % of the restaurants are still offering parcel service due to staff shortage. Nearly 60% of the staff has not come back. Restaurants also cannot employ staff at full strength due to the 50% seating cap due to Covid norms,” Ganesh Shetty, PRAHA president, said, adding, “More and more establishments are opting for contactless menus and payment services to limit interactions between serving staff and customers, not only as a measure against Covid but also because such methods help preclude the need for waiters to physically take orders.” Darsshan Ravalh, secretary, United Hospitality Association, told TOI that several restaurants were reporting that employees who had gone back to their hometowns were either refusing to come back or demanding higher salaries. “The shortage is not only hampering customer service, but also forcing some restaurants with multiple outlets to open only some of their branches,” Rawal said, adding, “We request the authorities to extend dine-in till 11pm and give us an instalment option to pay electricity bills.” Ravish Arora, director, Incognito Restaurant, Bar & Cafe on Balewadi High Street, said, “There a shortage of staff available for hire, while existing employees have been unable to return to the city due to fear of the pandemic,” Arora. “This is the situation the world over,” said, Rahul Mhaske, owner of Corn Club. “Having gone without a job for nearly a year due to the restrictions, most of our old staff found other jobs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/severe-manpower-shortage-hobbles-customer-service-at-city-restaurants/articleshow/86466624.cms||Neha Madaan

The state environment and climate change department on Wednesday issued a notification, laying down norms on how to determine the age of a tree. Earlier this month, the state government, under its ‘Rules of Business’, allotted the protection and preservation of trees in urban areas to the department. In case written records of the tree are available, age of the tree may be determined on the basis of available documents indicating year of plantation. If not, its age may be determined on the basis of recorded witness testimony, states the notification. The second method to find age of a tree is by multiplying the diameter of the tree by species-specific growth factor and the third method which involves use of an increment borer instrument is to be executed under expert guidance of local forest officials, states the notification till expertise is developed by the local tree authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-heritage-tree-state-issues-norms-on-how-to-fix-its-age/articleshow/86467493.cms||Clara Lewis

This takes the death toll from electrocution to eight in 48 hours in a belt that has large swathes still under water. A 36-year-old worker, Sona Roy, got electrocuted while he was busy cleaning a waterlogged room of Texmaco railway workshop’s Agarpara division on Thursday. The incident took place around 10.30 am when Roy and six other workers were cleaning out the waterlogged room of the production manager of Texmaco Rail & Engineering Ltd’s Agarpara division. The workers launched an agitation demanding immediate compensation to the victim’s family. In another incident barely 12 hours before the death of Roy, a 65-year-old man died of electrocution as he touched the collapsible gate of his waterlogged house late on Wednesday night. Dipak Chowdhury, a resident of Agarpara’s Tarapukur, went out of his house on Wednesday night. But while he was entering his house and touched the collapsible gate, he soon collapsed on the floor. “We noticed a smoke emanating from the waterlogged meter-room of the Chowdhury’s house,” said Tridib Paul, a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-more-die-n-24-parganas-toll-now-at-8/articleshow/86464242.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Outrage after electrocution of 2 kids, street light inspection starts||Kolkata: Public anger boiled over in Dum Dum’s Bandhabnagar over the civic apathy that led to the loss of two young lives the previous evening. Two Class VI students — Sreya Banik (12) and Anushka Nandy (13) — died of electrocution on Wednesday afternoon when they accidentally touched live wires sticking out of a decorative street light. In Kolkata, an eerily similar incident had occurred five years ago when a 14-year-old student had also died on Ramesh Mitra Road after touching a decorative trident lamp post whose junction box was open as well. The bereaved families in Dum Dum said accidents were waiting to happen with wires jutting out from open junction boxes in a number of municipal street lights in the belt. “Even after this accident, there are several decorative street ligths with open junction boxes in the Motijhil-Bandhabnagar Cololy areas,” alleged a local. Though civic authorities of South Dum Dum Municipality later began inspection of lamp posts and taping up the open junction boxes, locals said it was too little, too late. “The civic staff should have done this before the monsoon. Then our daughter would have been alive,” rued a family member of Anushka. What makes the decorative lights more hazardous is the location of the junction boxes at a height of around 4-4.5 ft. That is around the shoulder level of a medium-built person. Unless secured, any person can accidentally touch them while trying to find support while wading through water. Locals also pointed out that while Bandhabnagar is inundated every year, the waterlogging had been extremely severe this year because the sewage system had collapsed.  South Dum Dum Municipality chief civic administrator Panchu Gopal Roy said an inquiry committee led by civic executive engineer had already been set up to ascertain the cause of the mishap . “An initiative has already been taken to repair all the disputed lamppost or street lights in all the 35 wards on a war footing within a week,” he said. Dum Dum MP Saugata Roy and education minister and Dum Dum MLA Bratya Basu visited the homes of victims and spoke to bereaved family members. But it did not quell the anger. A group of locals launched an agitation before them alleging inaction of the local administration to curb waterlogging and subsequent maintenance of street lights. The MP assured them that the matter would be looked into. “The incident is very unfortunate. We spoke to family members of both the girls. We would provide all kind of assistance to the families and the state government has already sent Rs 2 lakh as compensation for each family,” he said. The Banik family refused to accept the compensation. “I wouldn’t get back my daughter with this money. I don’t want to take it. Despite all appeals, the local administration did not take any action to curb the waterlogging situation. They don’t look after the maintenance of street lights following which my daughter and her friend had to pay with their lives,” Sreya’s bereaved mother said, breaking down with tears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/outrage-after-electrocution-of-2-kids-street-light-inspection-starts/articleshow/86464226.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Pedal Power Project To Start Rolling With 20.5km Leg||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is all set to start work on its ambitious CycleWalk project meant for pedestrians and cyclists. The tender for construction of the 20.5-km first leg of the project between Sangam Vihar and Malviya Nagar Metro Station, named Nilgai Line, has been awarded. Delhi CycleWalk Project was conceptualised as a dedicated corridor for pedestrians and cyclists, which would loop around the city like a ring and connect Metro stations, bus stands, high density residential areas, business, industrial, recreational and educational districts and master plan greens. The plan is to make Delhi a “city of connected forests and lakes”, reduce the use of personal vehicles and allow people to walk and cycle safely to work, study, shop and stay fit. “DDA has planned to develop about 200km of dedicated cycle-walk tracks to provide pollution-free green commuting. It was conceived to take a few million car rides out of the roads and allow people to walk and cycle safely and joyfully,” said an official. The entire route is divided into five phases. Phase-I has an approximate length of 36km and is further divided into three legs. Work is expected to begin soon on Leg A, Nilgai Line, between Sangam Vihar and Malviya Nagar Metro Station. While the 8.5km Leg B, called Peacock Line, connects Malviya Nagar Metro Station with Vasant Kunj, the 7km Leg C, Bulbul Line, would be from Chirag Dilli to Sant Nagar. There would be a separate branch from Chirag Dilli to Asiad Games Village complex. “Apart from cycle and pedestrian tracks, the corridor will boast of features like universal accessibility track, origin destination plazas, intermediate stations, land bridges and other ancillary development work,” said the official. The origin and destination points are proposed to be interlinked with each other by cycling and walking tracks. Both on-grade and elevated tracks shall have greens all along the length to soften the edges, according to DDA. Conceptualised in 2019, the project’s foundation stone was laid by Union home minister Amit Shah on January 6, 2020. “The tender for construction of Phase-I Leg A has been awarded. Tenders for B and C legs will be awarded in due course. The process of approval from various departments, such as Ridge Management Board, forest department, National Wildlife Board and National Monument Authority, and other stakeholders has been initiated and is at different stages. Construction will commence after all approvals are received,” the official said. The corridor would be a safer and greener alternative to mobility, which would reduce the vehicular load in the city, provide last-mile connectivity and connect residential areas with Metro stations and bus stands. It would also allow citizens to save money on the last-mile commute, which is currently the most expensive per km charge of the journey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pedal-power-project-to-start-rolling-with-20-5km-leg/articleshow/86466648.cms||Sidharatha Roy

As per rules, it is mandatory to carry out anti-mosquito measures immediately in areas from where cases surface. TOI spoke to several patients who are recuperating at home. Many of them said that while the health department conducted anti-larvae spray within 24 hours of them testing positive for dengue, LMC has not conducted any fogging. Further, in some cases anti-larvae spray has not been done. Take the example of Dubbaga resident Anuj Mishra, 7, who was taken to Balrampur Hospital with high fever on September 19, a day after he was diagnosed with dengue. Even after four days, neither the health department nor LMC has taken cognizance. “Nobody visited our locality for anti-larvae spray or fogging. Mosquito population is flourishing here and people are living in fear,” said Anuj’s mother Reena. Tahseenganj resident Shivansh Kumar, 15, was diagnosed with dengue on September 11. While anti-larvae spray has been done, they have been waiting for fogging for over 12 days now. “Many people in our locality are experiencing fever, but fogging has not been done at all this year,” said Shivansh’s father Devesh. “When we asked about fogging, the operator who did anti-larvae said it is LMC’s responsibility,” he added. Similarly, another dengue patient, Bhupendra Kumar from Para, said, “Anti-larva sprinkling was done on Thursday, three days after I was diagnosed with the disease. I got a call from LMC about fogging, but no one has come so far.” In charge of vector-borne diseases unit Dr KP Tripathi said, “We sent our team for anti-larvae sprinkling. For fogging, details of areas have been sent to LMC. We will request it to perform fogging at the earliest so that mosquito menace can be curbed.” Municipal health officer Dr SK Rawat said, “The list of dengue patients is given to a zonal officer for fogging. On the same day, it receives a request from the health department. However, if there is any delay in activity anywhere, we will ask the zonal officer to conduct fogging immediately and submit a report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dengue-tightens-grip-lmc-in-slumber/articleshow/86467497.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The state cabinet has given approval for a budgetary allocation of Rs3,800 crore for implementation of the sewerage master plan and as part of it, the STPs would be completed in the next two years. Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao said the government also sanctioned Rs1,200 crore for construction of reservoirs in GHMC peripheral areas. “If the STPs are completed, Hyderabad will be the only city in the country that treats 100 per cent sewerage. This shows the commitment and seriousness of the TRS government to realise the dream of making Hyderabad a truely global city,” KTR said at a press conference here on Thursday. He said the sewage generation in GHMC areas was 1,650 million litres per day (MLD), while treatment capacity was just 772 MLD through 25 STPs. Since there was a gap of sewerage treatment of 878 MLD, which comes mostly from Musi river, the state government had decided to construct more STPs. “After getting reports on sewerage status, a master plan was prepared through consultants. They said the total sewerage for the year is about 1,950 MLD — 1,650 MLD in GHMC and 300 MLD in peripheral areas within Outer Ring Road,” the minister said. He said the works would be taken up on hybrid annuity mode where 60%of the cost would be borne by the agencies and rest 40% will be borne by the state government. The firms will maintain them for 15 years. Meanwhile, municipal administration department has issued a GO sanctioning Rs1,200 crore for providing adequate drinking water supply for urban local bodies and gram panchayats falling within ORR and outside GHMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-spend-rs-3800-cr-on-sewerage-plan-31-stps-to-come-up/articleshow/86466663.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Ahmedabad||‘Recovery’ drama at AMC||Ahmedabad: After the commercial court at Bhadra issued an attachment warrant on the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) default in refunding octroi amount wrongly collected 36 years ago, the lawyers of a company, Govind Gad Steel Pvt Ltd reached AMC headquarters on Thursday morning and demanded to take under attachment the chairs of the mayor and municipal commissioner. While the parties in whose favour the order was issued remained unrelenting for a couple of hours and insisted on taking the chairs with them, senior officials of the civic body gave an undertaking that the amount of over Rs 64 lakh as sought in refund would be paid to the company within 15 days. An AMC official said, “Advocates and the firm’s representative came with court recovery warrant Thursday morning at around 11am to AMC headquarters. They served the warrant to the legal department officials and demanded recovery of Rs 64 lakh. They wanted to seize furniture from headquarter offices including the mayor and commissioner’s offices. The discussions went on for hours.” The official further said that the legal officers tried to convince them to not to seize furniture, but they were adamant on taking furniture if the civic body doesn’t make the payment upfront. He said that after long discussions and negotiation the advocates of the firm came to an agreement. “AMC has agreed to pay their dues within the next 15 days. We will abide by the court order,” said Umang Nayak, deputy chairman, legal committee of AMC. In this case, AMC officials had inspected the premises of the company at Phase IV, GIDC at Vatva in 1995 and found certain goods on which the octroi was not paid. AMC raised a bill of Rs 21.89 lakh, which company proprietor Omprakash Agrawal deposited. After scrutiny, AMC came to a conclusion that the actual claim was Rs 13.14 lakh. However, the remaining Rs 8.75 lakh was not refunded by AMC citing violation of court order by the company. The company approached the city civil court in 1998 and challenged the levy of octroi. Twenty-one years later, the court said that AMC and its octroi department were not entitled to levy and collect any octroi from the company. The court ordered AMC to refund the amount with 9% interest since 1998. As the civic body did not refund the amount, the court issued warrant for recovery of Rs 64 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/recovery-drama-at-amc/articleshow/86466676.cms||---

On Wednesday, the DPEO Mayur Parekh visited the school in Zabu village of Dhanpur taluka on getting several complaints about the teacher Sachinkumar Shah. During Parekh’s visit too, Shah was not present at the school and on taking statements of the other school staff, the allegations of irregular attendance against Shah turned out to be true. It was also found that Shah used to sign in the roster book for the dates he would be absent. During the suspension period, Shah has been asked to not leave Zabu village and will not be allowed to take up any other government or private jobs. The office of DPEO had received initial complaints about Shah in July and the taluka primary education officer was asked to conduct a probe and submit a report. Sources said that many allege that Shah also runs some business during the school’s working hours. They added that he was an active BJP worker due to which he has photographs with recently inducted ministers Kuber Dindor and Nimisha Suthar on his social media profile. The teacher’s wife is an active member of BJP and holds the post of panchayat member too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/teacher-suspended-for-irregular-attendance/articleshow/86462894.cms||---

At a press conference here, Sudhakar said TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy had no right to raise his voice against the PM. He termed Congress as ‘all India commercial party’. “They are accusing us of selling government-owned enterprises. Haven’t they done the same in the past,” he asked. “They must respond to the allegations levelled by former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh against Navjot Singh Sidhu’s links with Pakistan.” Describing communists as ‘commercialists,’ he said: “They support TRS in one election, Congress in another and some other party in another.

---||Ahmedabad||Twist in tail: Lockdown pets abandoned||AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: Last week, Ahmedabad-based Jivdaya Charitable Trust (JCT) was approached to take in their care, an Alsatian puppy found abandoned on the street. The pup was unable to walk and was extremely weak and undernourished. “Presently, it is taking treatment at our shelter and undergoing physiotherapy. Once it is better and healthy, we will begin to find a home for the pup,” said Gira Shah, managing trustee, JCT. Shah herself adopted a Dalmatian pup earlier this year, who had been left at JCT’s Panjrapole centre with a vaginal infection. “There was a lump around her tail and she could not even sit. It took 25 days for her to simply calm down and it had to undergo an extensive treatment before she was healthy. I was so touched with the way she responded to the treatment and became friendly that I adopted her,” Shah added. Buying and adopting pets became a trend post lockdown as people thought pets would keep them company and help beat loneliness. But the warmth towards furry friends was indeed too short-lived. Harish Patil, who owns a pet shop in Vadodara, said that in last few months, he has helped adopt at least seven such pets. “Many people felt lonely during the lockdown last year and decided to buy pets. It was easier initially as they were working from home. But when their offices resumed, they couldn’t manage to look after the pet and handle work,” Patil said. “A pet dog is just like a kid that has to be looked after all day. It’s not easy. So, those who bought the dogs in last one year have started selling them off or giving them away for adoption,” Patil added. In yet another case, PFA (People for Animals) got a rescue call about a Labrador dog with a collar and leash dumped in a ditch. “The dog’s eyes were infected with maggots. There was a chain and a collar which clearly meant it had been abandoned by someone. We got the dog to our shelter in Ahmedabad, treated its infection and kept him in care. He is so playful now and was recently adopted by a loving family,” said Mahendra Shrimali, secretary, PFA. Rescuers say that poor awareness, giving in to trends encouraged people to adopt, even buy dogs from breeders but in most cases, the dogs were often abandoned or given up at shelter homes for further adoption. Jignesh Brahmakshatriya, who runs a pet dogs hostel in the city, had a similar experience a few months ago. “Two citizens came to my hostel and dropped off their two pet dogs saying that they will pick them up after some days. When they didn’t return for many days, I called them. They said that they don’t need the dogs any more as they can’t give enough time,” Brahmakshatriya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/twist-in-tail-lockdown-pets-abandoned/articleshow/86466670.cms||Niyati Parikh

He will also discuss implementation of the gazette notification on jurisdiction of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB). The CM will also meet consumer affairs and commerce minister Piyush Goyal on September 26 apart from attending a meeting convened by the Union ministry of home affairs. KCR, who will be leaving for Delhi on Friday afternoon, has a busy schedule during his three-day tour. In the first week of September, KCR was in Delhi to lay the foundation stone for TRS party office in the national capital and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Shekhawat to represent various issues pertaining to the state. He camped in Delhi for nine days then. Official sources said even after meeting the Jal Shakti minister, the water resources department is going ahead with its preparations to take over all projects and implement the gazette notification from October 14 without resolving the issues raised by Telangana. Both Telangana and AP have been writing letters to the KRMB on the water sharing issue. With Goyal, KCR is expected to raise concerns over Centre’s decision not to procure paddy during the rabi season. Sources said the CM will highligh the impact on Telangana if the Centre does not procure fine rice from it. On September 26, MHA is holding a meeting with chief ministers of Maoist-hit states. In his earlier meeting with Shah, KCR had sought more funds to lay roads in the Maoist-affected areas and bordering districts of Chhattisgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-off-to-delhi-on-2nd-tour-this-month/articleshow/86467315.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||Ajay Gandhi, who revived Hyderabad’s literary scene, no more||HYDERABAD: He was a chartered accountant by profession. But most of Hyderabad knew Ajay Gandhi as the man behind reimagining and reviving the city’s cultural and literary image, which gained tremendous traction nationally and from other parts of the world over the last decade or so. Gandhi breathed his last on Thursday, after battling cancer for last few months. He was 64. The funeral service will be held at Vaikunta Mahaprasthanam, Film Nagar, at 9 am on Friday. Remembered as the man with the most infectious laughter by friends and close associates, Gandhi’s contribution to Hyderabad’s growing identity as a place for intellectual debate and discussion was through two platforms that he, along with a small team of thinking individuals, created and nurtured — the Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF) and Manthan. The latter, over time, has become a one-of-its kind forum for public discourse in the country. “This is a great personal loss not only for me and my family, but also for Hyderabad. I knew him since I was 15 or 16. And apart from being associated professionally, he was there with me from the conceptual stage of building Lamakaan. He almost single-handedly kept Hyderabad’s literary spirit alive,” said Ashar Farhan, founder of Hyderabad’s most popular cultural space. He shared how Gandhi was first diagnosed with cancer about 20-odd years ago, but beat it successfully. “This time too he was recovering well. We didn’t, in the least, imagine this would happen,” Farhan said. Equally at a loss for words was architect Srinivas Murthy, a co-director of the literary festival with Gandhi. “His vision was unmatchable. His ideas were way ahead of his time and made Hyderabad a hub for literary exchanges. I will always remember him from our last photograph we took on the concluding of HLF (the last physical event) — smiling and rearing to go the next year,” Murthy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ajay-gandhi-who-revived-citys-literary-scene-no-more/articleshow/86466690.cms||---

BJP’s announcement to waive off house tax for houses built on 50 yards also turned out to be fake, he alleged. When AAP leader of opposition in the north corporation raised the issue in the corporation’s house, the commissioner informed that the trade and factory license fee are currently being charged at the hiked rate only. “BJP hiked licence fee by 17-25 times last year and is now putting up posters announcing they have reduced them, but they have actually done nothing. BJP put up such posters all over Delhi before Lok Sabha elections too but made people pay the fees after elections,” Bharadwaj said in a press conference. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP MLA was misleading people. “North corporation’s general house and standing committee have already approved withdrawal of hiked charges and property tax waiver, which are now awaiting official notification. Such notifications take a few weeks, and are likely to happen anytime next week,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpns-claim-of-licence-fee-rollback-false-aap/articleshow/86466691.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

These colleges include Goa College of Pharmacy, Goa College of Art, Goa College of Architecture and Goa College of Music. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Thursday held a meeting with Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation officials, director of technical education and director of education and decided to go ahead on planning the necessary infrastructure for the colleges. Speaking to TOI, Sawant said that Goa College of Architecture has been functioning from a rented premises. “We have taken a decision to identify land for a permanent state-of-the-art college campus. We will see if we can get land in Panaji or outside the city,” he said. Sawant said that the government we will create the required infrastructure with a focus on the next 50 years. He also said that Goa College of Pharmacy is located at a congested premises, with its hostel at Altinho. “Before December 19, we will take a decision on constructing a state-of-the-art campus for the pharmacy college,” he said. On the Goa College of Art, Sawant said that there is a need for renovating the structure, and added that the chief architect of PWD and other officials will finalise the plan. “We will give a new look for the college,” he said. Sawant said that a similar state-of-the-art infrastructure will be created for the Goa College of Music. The chief minister said the state government has not taken any decision to appoint a full-time principal or head of institute for these professional colleges. TOI had reported that Goa college of Engineering, Goa College of Architecture, Goa College of Art, Goa Medical College and other major professional colleges in the state do not have a regular principal or head of institution in position, although highly qualified and experienced candidates have been recommended for these positions by the Goa Public Service Commission. In fact, most of these institutions are under the control of the director of technical education and questions are being asked in academic circles as to why the government is delaying in appointing these institutional heads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-colleges-to-get-modern-infra-cm/articleshow/86466737.cms||---

Senior functionaries of TMC, including its parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien and Lok Sabha MP Prasun Banerjee, are already in Goa to assess the political situation before taking the plunge. TMC has already held preliminary talks with several politicians, political aspirants, and political scientists to have a fair evaluation of its prospects. Two days ago, in Kolkata, Mamata said that TMC would contest Goa assembly polls to be held early next year. Sources said Mamata is planning to visit Goa soon. This is not the first time TMC is entering Goa. In 2012, under the leadership of former chief minister Wilfred de Souza, TMC contested 20 assembly seats but could not open the account. The total vote share of TMC in the 2012 assembly election was below 2%. In 2014, Churchill Alemao had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha election on TMC ticket from South Goa. Sources said TMC has approached senior Congress MLA Luizinho Faleiro and urged him to join the party along with his group. Sources said they may offer him a Rajya Sabha seat before he quit Congress and joined TMC. But Faleiro dismissed these speculations and said: “I have not met any TMC leader… I have heard that TMC leaders have come to Goa.” And even as his name was doing the rounds, AICC formed a 13-member election committee for Goa headed by Faleiro. For some days now, Mamata’s political strategist Prashant Kishor’s representatives have been on a meeting spree in Goa—MLAs, former MLAs, social activists and writers—to understand Goa’s political scenario. N Shivdas, a writer and former Congress functionary, claimed that some MLAs, former MLAs, doctors and advocates were in touch with Kishor’s team. Meanwhile, chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said in democracy every party has the right to contest elections in any state and it will not have any impact. “Everyone is coming to Goa as Goa is a well-known state. Let them come… everyone can come. It does not make any difference if they contest elections. We cannot stop any one from contesting,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. “TMC is just like any other political party,” Tanavade added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tmc-tests-goas-2022-poll-scene-as-mamata-sends-her-key-men-to-state/articleshow/86466752.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies hit pay dirt as film crews rush to climb mountains of filth||NEW DELHI: “Kantabai boli Bumbai mein sabse jyada paisa kachre mein hai” (Kantabai said that in Bombay, garbage is the most precious commodity). That was Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s (Ganesh Gaitonde) famous dialogue in popular TV series Sacred Games, which be delivered standing atop a mountain of garbage with Kantabai by his side. This, however, was not Mumbai but that ugly eyesore, Bhalswa landfill, in Delhi, which you encounter on your way to Sonipat and beyond. In another series — Breathe: Into the Shadows — Abhishek Bachchan (Avinash Sabharwal) fights with another character in the middle of tonnes of garbage in the early morning hours. It was Bhalswa again. Some scenes from Leila, which starred Huma Qureshi, were also shot at the same place, claim sources. Landfills are dangerous places. These giant unstable mounds can collapse, swallowing you up. These also send out flares, every now and then, setting off fires. And by their very nature, they are a repository of diseases.  Yet, filmmakers seem to love the apocalyptic landscape, going by the number of requests being received by the civic bodies from film crews. Taking the cue perhaps, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to act pricey and fixed a fee of Rs 2 lakh per day for shooting at the Ghazipur landfill. The north Delhi corporation, which has Bhalswa in its jurisdiction, however, charges Rs 75,000 daily for shooting there. The Delhi government is developing a single-window system under its new film policy to give permissions in a fast and smooth manner to attract national and international producers. The civic agencies have, however, been given the liberty to fix the fee (between Rs 75,000 to Rs two lakh) for their properties, said a senior east corporation official. “While we have fixed a daily rate of Rs 75,000 for shooting at any other place, the amount is more than double in case of landfills. The charges have been kept high to avoid any mishap, meet unnecessary demands and make arrangements before shooting. However, for shooting documentaries on some subjects, we might relax the price,” said the official. Besides this, Rs 25,000 will have to be deposited as security amount and another Rs 10,000 as registration fee to shoot anywhere in east Delhi, added the civic official further. He pointed out that the crew for the movie Pink had filmed some sequences at a dhobi ghat at Trilokpuri while some scenes of Chhapaak were shot in other areas in east Delhi. TOI spoke to producers who said that the shooting of films in the capital is a costly affair. “Around Rs 75,000 to Rs two lakh is to be paid as fees for shooting at one site. It is costlier than many foreign destinations, which discourages small budget producers. We raised the matter during a joint meeting with the south corporation officials. We had shot some scenes of the film Gurgaon at Ghazipur landfill but didn’t pay any charges,” said Jawed Khan, a line producer. East corporation mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal has given anticipatory approval to the film policy. “Under ease-of-doing-business, a single-window policy for online approval of shooting is being developed for all agencies. After the required documents are deposited and the security fee and permission fee paid, online permission will be given for shooting within seven days,” said the mayor. This covers all buildings and open areas, including the protected monuments of ASI, heritage buildings of the east corporation and private properties like farmhouses, malls, hospitals and theatres. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has kept the rate at a uniform Rs 75,000 for all sites besides imposing an administrative charge of Rs 2000 and 18% GST. The south corporation, too, has developed a portal for smooth facilitation of the entire process of granting approval which will be given by the directorate of press and information within three days of the formalities being completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-hit-pay-dirt-as-film-crews-rush-to-climb-mountains-of-filth/articleshow/86464420.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Lucknow||A piece of Lucknow in cricket world’s digital memorabilia fad||Ever thought of owing a moment from the career of your favourite cricketstar? How about being the prized possessor of Yuvaraj Singh’s six sixes in an over… or being the holder of the gala moment when Mahendra Singh Dhoni held the World Cup in his hands? The uncanny thought may sound impossible but cricket Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are the magic wand that can make it happen. An NFT is a new technology that represents unique digital form of real-world objects like art, music, in-game items, moments, audios, videos. Consider this: An artist makes a painting in the real world and uploads its digital version on an NFT platform for sale at a specified price. Any interested person can become a proud owner and put it up for re-sale. Though NFT platforms began sometime in 2014, they took the world with storm during the pandemic lockdowns. As of now, the world of cricket is witnessing a surge on the count with everyone including the ICC is willing to make the most of the gush by issuing tender inviting companies to bid for monetising the rights of ICC’s digital assets recently. Cricket Australia has also expressed interest in exploring this opportunity. Closer home, the BCCI is also studying the space and will get eventually get into it sooner than later. In May 2021, the cricketing community initiated the Cricket Foundation, a Singapore headquartered blockchain based platform and launched cricketcrazy.io which is the world’s first digital collectibles market place exclusively for cricket. The list of co-founders includes cricket lovers from Lucknow as well. “There is definitely a market to be tapped for an exclusive platform for NFTs of cricket, by cricketers and for cricket fans. The bandwagon promises to change the way people see sports. The collectibles culture will follow things like virtual and personalized gaming,” says Abhijit Sarkar, sports enthusiast and promoter who co-founded Cricket Foundation. The NFTs offer a great opportunity to cricketers as well. “Till now, the legacy of cricketers was tangible. But a lot of their heritage exists in digital form too. With the exclusivity of some of this losing to the social media (as in case of one picture or video getting viral), NFTs offer a chance to preserve the uniqueness of it. In addition, it is an asset that can be monetised too,” said Rudra Pratap Singh, former Team India cricketer. Industry analysts believe that Cricket and NFTs can be a five-billion-dollar industry in two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/a-piece-of-lucknow-in-cricket-worlds-digital-memorabilia-fad/articleshow/86467518.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The state government, she said, should look at the project from the point of view of public interest rather through a political prism. “Dravyavati River Front was not only a dream project of our BJP government, but also the hope of lakhs of people of Jaipur for which we took a pledge and at a cost of Rs 1,400 crore, we moved forward towards converting a dirty drain into a beautiful and clean river,” Raje tweeted. She said that as soon as the work on the project was completed, the image of a new, beautiful and clean Jaipur in the form of a 47-km-long river front had taken shape. Raje alleged that due to the insensitivity and negligence of the state government, the Dravyavati river front project has become a victim of mismanagement. “I urge the state government to look at the Dravyavati river front project from the point of view of public interest instead of looking at it through a political prism so that this project can become an example in the country and the world as a tourist destination and add beauty to Jaipur city,” the BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raje-accuses-govt-of-mismanagement-in-dravyavati-project/articleshow/86467526.cms||---

The buses plying to the aforesaid states are currently standing in the Kolhapur depot. Before Covid, 115 buses plied to Karnataka and 35 buses to Panaji in Goa every day. The MSRTC authorities from the Kolhapur depot have written to their counterparts in Karnataka and Goa for resuming the services. A team of MSRTC officials also visited their offices, but they are yet to get a positive response. Rohan Palange, divisional controller of MSRTC, said, “We wrote to them and even visited their offices to resume the bus services. Our request is that if not into Karnataka bus stands, the MSRTC buses should be allowed to use the National Highway section in the Nipani region in Karnataka to reach Gadhinglaj, Ajara, Chandgad that are in Maharashta. Our buses are now taking a longer route, adding one hour, to reach Gadhinglaj from Kolhapur.” The Karnataka state government has made vaccine certificate mandatory for the drivers and conductors along with negative RT-PCR test reports for passengers to enter the state through buses. Even though there is demand for buses, the MSRTC has not been able to resume services due to these rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-waits-to-resume-buses-to-goa-karnataka/articleshow/86462248.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||Choked Bagjola canal: Quick-fix now, revamp work after Puja||Kolkata: The government is likely to take up the revamp work for a choked Bagjola canal only after the Puja, when the monsoon is over. However, as an interim measure, it is lining up sand bags along the canal to make sure that water doesn’t overflow and flood areas in New Town and Salt Lake. A few stretches and housing complexes in New Town were still under water on Thursday, even after 72 hours of the heavy deluge. The overflowing Bagjola canal has been found to be the main cause for the severe waterlogging in the township. The state irrigation department, along with government agencies KMDA, Hidco, NKDA, BMC and PHE and South Dum Dum Municipality are coming up with a long-term plan to revamp Bagjola canal by a thorough desilt and dredging work, increasing the height of the embankment, repairing lock gates, setting up new drainage pumping stations and fencing off the canal side to prevent dumping of waste. But, it will take time to execute the plans and it could be taken up only after the monsoon ends and weather dries up. “A detailed plan is being readied and the work could be taken up after Puja, from November onwards. As of now, immediate preventive measures, including use of sand bags, are being taken up to minimise waterlogging during heavy rain as much as possible,” said a government official. With a forecast of a cyclonic circulation within the next few days and predictions of heavy spells, the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) is taking up immediate short term measures along the canal banks. The authorities are placing sand bags along Bagjola banks to prevent overflowing of canal water. The banks of the periphery canals connecting Bagjola were cleaned up on Thursday to increase the flow of the canal water. Housing complexes in New Town like Sukhobristi, Elita Garden Vista, Balaka Abason, Maple Hiland Woods, Greenfield Ambition have been the most affected during the recent deluge with water flooding the entire compound, parking place and basements. “We are all stuck inside our homes for days. Residents have become apprehensive of water-borne diseases,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, a resident of Elita Garden Vista. At Sukhobristi, the entire complex was still under water, including the electrical meter room. The lifts were also shut. “The complex continues to remain waterlogged as residents are facing tremendous inconveniences,” said Mainak Kanrar of Sukhobristi. “The government needs to come up with a plan to solve this issue. Encroachments along Bagjola is a major cause of concern,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN). The New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity, a residents’ forum, have called for a meeting to be held beside the New Town clock tower on Friday evening to raise and discuss the issue. NKDA has been operating 36 pumps along with four portable pumps across New Town to flush out the storm water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/choked-bagjola-canal-quick-fix-now-revamp-work-after-puja/articleshow/86464479.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||LPG leakage triggers blast, 4 of family injured||Kolkata: A suspected gas leak — resulting in formation of a vapour cloud inside a small room — led to a blast on the ground floor of a five-storey building at Ahiripukur Lane in Beckbagan around 5.45am on Thursday. The explosion injured four of the same family. It is believed the explosion took place when one of the residents put a switch on to charge a cell phone. A vapour cloud explosion occurs when sufficient amount of flammable material mixes with air and is ignited. The victims have been identified as Ananda Das (42), his wife Kiran (36), son Shivam (7) and his niece Bhumi Chowdhury (16) alias Buli. While Buli is stated to be out of danger, the three others have received various degrees of burn injuries. The victims were initially rushed to a private hospital in the Park Circus area before being shifted to SSKM. Ananda is presently employed with the Japanese consulate as a support staffer. A forensic team, the bomb disposal squad and the dog squad were rushed to the blast site on Thursday morning. Police said the gas cylinder and electrical equipment of the house was found intact. No trace of explosives was found from the house. According to police, the impact of the blast was such that at least three walls of the room were ripped apart. Since the building is interconnected and there are multiple rooms next to each other, the blast damaged three adjoining rooms. KMC has been roped to ascertain whether it will be safe for others to continue living as the ground floor has taken the maximum hit,” said an officer. “The explosion was a result of the ignition of a cloud of flammable vapour. In this case, there was an LPG leakage. It could be either due to a mistake in shutting down the gas (and not just the oven) or a damaged gas pipe. The vapour cloud accumulated in the small room of Ananda. The pressure of the cloud was higher than the atmospheric pressure outside,” explained a source from the forensic unit. “Any little spark or ignition is enough for the cloud to burst. The expansion of this vapour happens horizontally. That is exactly what happened in this case. The blast did not affect the ceiling at all but blew away the walls,” he added. “Vapours were formed due to leakage in gas, which exploded as the house occupant plugged the charger of the mobile,” said joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Dulhara Khatun, a local resident, said the sound was enough to make them believe that it was an explosion. “We came out of the room around 6am and found the wall of the ground floor ripped apart. The residents were lying in the bedroom and screaming for help. I rushed back home, unable to bear to see the scene,” said Khatun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lpg-leakage-triggers-blast-4-of-family-injured/articleshow/86464453.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A discussion on recent changes in healthcare during Covid was also organised. Vice-Chancellor, Atal Medical University, Prof AK Singh suggested that a system similar to the Covid command centres which provided information on real time availability of beds in various hospitals can also be developed for emergency services in Lucknow. “Covid taught us to plan. People who raised questions as to why all beds were not converted into ICU should understand that trained staffers were required for each ICU bed,” said VC KGMU Dr Lt Gen Bipin Puri. Prof Soniya Nityanand, director, RMLIMS emphasized that preventive medicine is vital and should be included in the school curriculum so that it can enable children to have general knowledge of medicine that would be good for both studies and health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/toi-honours-doctors-who-led-covid-battle/articleshow/86467524.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Factor in previous maintenance too: Bombay HC on marital row||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court said that while making an application for maintenance in a matrimonial dispute, an order passed in an earlier maintenance application must be disclosed so that the court can factor in the previous amount ordered. The HC set aside a January 1, 2020, sessions court order in a domestic violence case after a husband questioned a magistrate directing him to pay Rs20,000 collective interim maintenance in a domestic violence case to an estranged wife, after the family court had already directed him to pay her Rs7,000 a month in 2019. The HC bench of Justice S K Shinde said the “law is that in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, so that the court would take into consideration the maintenance already awarded in the previous proceeding, and grant an adjustment or set-off of. the said amount” and “whether, while deciding the quantum of maintenance under Section 12 of the DV Act, court shall take into account, maintenance awarded in the previous proceedings instituted between the parties.” “The family court awarded the maintenance of Rs7,000 each, to the respondent and two children on June 19, 2019; whereas, a month after, maintenance of Rs20,000 collectively was awarded to the respondent and two minor children,” said the HC after hearing the husband’s lawyers, Abhijit Sarwate and Ajinkya Udane, and wife’s lawyer, Kamesh Mishra, and prosecutor S S Hulke. The question raised was “whether, while deciding quantum of maintenance under Section 12 of the D V Act, court shall take into account, maintenance awarded in the previous proceedings instituted between the parties.” The HC said its earlier judgment in another case held the field on adjustment of maintenance awarded in previous proceedings against maintenance awarded in subsequent proceedings, adding “however, it seems the judgment in the case was not brought to the notice of the (sessions) court.” The high court directed the magistrate in Pune to modify its order “taking into consideration, the maintenance already awarded by the judge, family court, Pune”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/factor-in-previous-maintenance-too-in-mumbai-hc-on-marital-row/articleshow/86467528.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt names police sub-inspector in each station to check dhirios in Goa||PANAJI: Goa police has appointed a police sub-inspector in each police station in charge of all animal cruelty cases. The move came after an organisation approached the high court of Bombay at Goa alleging that the government is turning a blind eye to bullfights (dhirios). The orders, issued by the district SPs, state that these PSIs must provide all possible assistance to officials of the district society for prevention of cruelty to animals. The PSIs of Porvorim and Margao are nodal officers for each district. South Goa accounts for double the illegal bullfight cases as those registered in North Goa. Director of animal husbandry and veterinary services Dr Agostinho Misquita told the high court that most of these fights take place in the jurisdiction of Colva police station. Colva PI Melson Colaco held a meeting with bull owners within his jurisdiction and attempted to educate them on the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, as well HC directions. “The bull owners were encouraged to desist from indulging in the illegal activity of bullfighting,” Misquita stated in his affidavit. He added that as and when information is received with respect to bullfights, police authorities have taken timely action and have been able to prevent them. Misquita stated that the police have displayed a proactive approach and maintain regular patrolling in areas which witness bullfights. He added that staff and officers of police stations have been made aware of legal provisions and the high court’s judgement. The societies for prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA) in both districts were notified in 2020. The SPCAs and the state animal welfare board, chaired by the chief minister, are dedicated towards promotion of animal welfare and the implementation of high court directions, the HC was told. Provisions of the Act “are being looked into at the highest level of the state machinery,” the government said. People for Animals (PFA), through its president, Norma Alvares, and represented by Anamika Gode, submitted to the high court that state authorities have been lacking in proactively enforcing the ban on bullfights in the state, and added that there has been an unprecedented increase in bull fights since the lockdowns began to be lifted. The petitioner stated that dhirios have become a regular occurrence in some villages in Goa — notably Cansaulim, Colva, Utorda, Benaulim and Varca in South Goa, and Arambol and Mandrem in North Goa — with several such bullfights being held on a weekly basis. “Despite the presence of vast crowds watching these bullfights, the government and police do not appear to be aware of the same. At any rate, there has been little effort to stop them. Hence this contempt petition,” PFA submitted to the high court. PFA attached several news reports, including at least six by TOI between January and August 2021, on bullfights taking place around Goa and bulls dying as a result. The petitioner is seeking monitoring committees for both districts to submit quarterly monitoring reports showing compliance and enforcement of the dhirio ban, and for officers appointed in each district with a phone number reachable on regular and Whatsapp calls to ensure that bullfights are stopped before they happen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-names-psi-in-each-station-to-check-dhirios/articleshow/86466770.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Delhi||Stress on bio-decomposer as a lasting solution to Delhi’s winter of discontent||NEW DELHI: Just before the start of the harvest season which every year leads to deterioration of air quality in the capital and neighbouring areas, the Centre on Thursday reviewed various pollution abatement measures in a meeting with ministers and officials of Delhi-NCR states and sensitised them about the necessity of minimising the stubble burning episodes through multi-pronged strategies. Besides existing approach to handle paddy stubble through in-situ management with intervention of machines and equipment (Happy Seeders and others), the focus was also on extensive use of IARI’s Pusa bio-decomposer with the states – Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - sharing how they already had planned to assist farmers to use it in over 16 lakh acres of paddy-grown areas free of cost. States’ representatives also shared their multi-pronged action plan that includes use of non-basmati paddy straw as fodder and use of stubble as biofuel (biomass pallet) under the NTPC’s existing programme. The biomass pallet will be used in thermal power plants (TPPs) as a substitute to coal. The power plants have been asked to use 5-10% of the feed from the biomass pallet having 50% stubble residue. Chairing the meeting, environment minister Bhupender Yadav said the outcome of the action plan would significantly depend on the “efficacy of the enforcement and implementation” by states. He assured states that all the issues requiring any inter-state and inter-ministerial coordination would be adequately addressed by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas. Besides environment ministers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Haryana chief minister M L Khattar also virtually attended the review meeting. Punjab was represented by senior officials. The progress of the measures, discussed on Thursday, will be reviewed a month later. Meanwhile, a task force has been constituted to work out the ways and means for utilising the non-basmati stubble as fodder in Rajasthan and Gujarat, common manure development facility using rice straw and private participation to encourage in-situ management of stubble through Pusa bio-decomposition. The Pusa bio-decomposer, first used last year in select farms, decomposes stubble within 20-25 days after spraying. It turns it into manure, improving the soil quality. Since other alternatives of in-situ management of paddy straw such use of Happy Seeder continues to be an expensive method for most farmers, the cost-effective bio-decomposer can be a popular alternative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stress-on-bio-decomposer-as-a-lasting-solution-to-delhis-winter-of-discontent/articleshow/86467552.cms||Vishwa Mohan

On Friday, the hospital administration submitted combined salary bills of five months to the directorate, which has in turn sent back queries regarding some bills. They will not be cleared till GMC answers these queries. “No sooner than we received the salary bills on Friday, we intimated the GMC administration about the queries we had about certain bills. Saturday and Sunday were holidays. On Tuesday, we wrote to GMC,” said director of accounts Dilip Humraskar. TOI had reported on its Wednesday edition how the staffers were yet to be paid, forcing some of them to beg from others to meet their daily expenses. GMC’s director of administration, had said that the bills were submitted to the directorate “before Ganesh Chaturthi”. He said GMC expected the staffers to receive their salaries for the festival. Now, even as the two departments engage in ping-pong, the 400-odd staffers remain unpaid, with no clarity on when they will get their hard-earned money. “It depends on them (GMC),” said Humraskar. “As soon as GMC’s response to our queries is received, we will clear the bills. We are also concerned about the salaries of the staff. I’m very particular that salary bills are not kept pending.” Humraskar said it was not possible to clear the other bills (for which queries have not been raised). “When salary bills of hundred or more staff are submitted together, and there are queries about even three to four bills, they cannot be split,” he said. The multi-tasking staff were hired mainly to do Covid duties during the April-May period, when the state was among the worst-hit places in the world, with the positivity rate hitting 50%. Even without their salaries, the workers have continued working in the Covid wards. Most of the staffers hired come from remote parts of the states, and from poor families. They said that they stuck to their jobs hoping that their services would be continued as they work for a government establishment, although their employment is contractual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unpaid-covid-workers-now-accounts-dept-puts-ball-in-gmcs-court/articleshow/86466801.cms||Bindiya Chari

According to police, the girl’s mother has claimed that her daughter was pregnant. She also alleged that her husband often came home in an inebriated condition and even molested their daughter. “A medical examination will be conducted to ascertain if the girl was indeed pregnant,” an official informed TOI on the condition of anonymity. Sources in the city police said that the accused had strangulated the girl following a heated argument late on Wednesday evening. “It was during the course of their quarrel that the accused had killed the girl. The exact reason behind the argument is yet to be determined but it is suspected that the accused had come home with some abortion pills,” said an official, adding that forensic experts will verify the nature of pills.Police said that a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act will be filed once the pregnancy is confirmed in the medical examination. “The family is poor, both parents worked as labourers and lived in a dilapidated home. The accused was addicted to drugs and liquor,” the official added. Police said that the girl’s mother had informed her relatives about the incident. They then alerted the police about the offence. A special team comprising ACP and SHO of the area were sent to investigate the case. Police said that the body was lying motionless in the house and an FSL team was summoned to collect samples. Cops said that a few medicines were also seized during the investigation. “The father had fled after the crime. We are searching for the accused. The plausible motive appears to be due to the girl’s suspected pregnancy,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-kills-teen-daughter-after-verbal-duel/articleshow/86467530.cms||---

The official added that the inmate tried to grab the cutter from the hand of the prison staffer and when the head matron intervened, she received cuts on a hand. Police have registered a case in this regard too. Delhi’s prisons have been witnessing frequent clashes in September. On September 11, two inmates were injured in a clash, and the very next day, one Vikas Chopra attacked another inmate, Vikas Dhull, with a surgical blade. On September 13, a 28-year-old undertrial was attacked. Around two weeks ago, 25 inmates were found injured, but the authorities claimed them to be self-inflected. In August, 29-year-old gangster Ankit Gujjar was allegedly murdered inside Tihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inmate-injured-inside-tihar-6th-case-in-a-month/articleshow/86466780.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi stares at liquor shortage as private vends shut shop||NEW DELHI: A shortage of liquor is being reported across the city, a week before the 260-odd private shops shut down from October 1. People are finding it difficult to buy the brands they could easily get a few months ago. Those engaged in the liquor business believe that the shortage of brands and an overall deficit might grow as the deadline nears for closing private liquor shops. Though the government is trying to ensure no liquor shortage occurs, the transition from the old to the new excise policy is likely to cause a problem. To deal with this issue, the excise department has asked the 600-odd government liquor shops to maintain sufficient stock by anticipating the demand so that a major shortage is avoided. Currently, there are around 850 liquor shops in Delhi and all of them will be closed by November 16. New players who got licences through open bidding under the updated excise policy would start opening liquor stores, which would be far bigger and better than the existing vends, from November 17. Under the new excise policy being implemented by the Aam Aadmi Party government, Delhi has been divided into 32 retail zones for equal distribution of shops. Each zone covering 8-10 wards will have nearly 27 liquor vends. Billed as a reform-oriented policy, it is designed to transform the liquor buying experience of people, besides substantially increasing the excise revenue for the government. Many consumers have already started experiencing the shortage. Their favorite liquor brands are missing from private shops that have started winding up their business. People are often seen returning without liquor from the shops. The stores have also stopped placing orders for fresh stock. Baljeet Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, said, “I used to easily get my favorite brand from a store in the market close to my house, but now it has run out of stock. The store owner has stopped buying liquor so that he can dispose of his existing stock before October 1. I have to either buy a different brand or scout the nearby markets.” An excise official claimed that the situation would improve after the transition period and all steps were being taken to ensure that government stores meet the demand. Naresh Goel, president of Delhi Liquor Traders’ Association, said some private liquor shops that had sold their stock had already shut down. “Liquor demand grows during the festive season. A major shortage of liquor could be witnessed because government stores may not be able to handle the increased demand after private shops, which are better stocked, close down. Even government shops are in the process of winding up operations from November 17. The closure of private shops will lead to an unequal distribution of vends across the city,” added Goel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-stares-at-liquor-shortage-as-private-vends-shut-shop/articleshow/86464504.cms||AlokKNMishra

He was addressing a public meeting in Siddharthnagar district after inaugurating a Kendriya Vidyalaya building. “Main yaha nivedan karne aaya hoon…aap aise hi aashirwaad banake rakhiye…aap sewa karne ka mauka diye hai. (I have come here with a request. You showered blessings on us and believed in us. Please keep reposing faith in us). India will progress only if Uttar Pradesh sees development,” he said. Hailing the double-engine government for unprecedented development of an aspirational district (Siddharthnagar), Pradhan said, “The new school building and the upcoming medical college here has been possible because of a double-engine government. The state’s all-round development has wiped out the BIMARU tag. In every field, UP is setting an example and this because of Yogiji.” Pradhan, who inaugurated a new Kendriya Vidyalaya building and participated in ‘sah-bhoj’ (community feast) with KV students and those of Composite School, Madhubenia, said, “Before Yogi Adityanath assumed power, there were 400 students in this school. Now, it has a strength of 800. This is called governance. Now, UP will outsmart US and Europe in intellectual ability, not just in population.” Attacking previous governments, Pradhan said, “This heroic land, known for imparting knowledge to the world, witnessed anarchical rule before BJP came to power. But the people sought democracy, justice, brotherhood and social sensitivity and made Modiji prime minister, not once but twice. They again gave us an overwhelming majority in UP.” He continued, “This land is the birth of Buddha, who preached the message of peace to the world. From freedom struggle to culture, science to any tradition, UP has set an example.” In times of humanitarian crisis like Covid pandemic, India set an example before the world, Pradhan said. “At a time when economies of developed countries were sinking, India vaccinated over 80 crore people with either one or both doses, out of which about 8 crore doses were administered in UP under Yogi’s leadership.” Referring to India and UP as synonymous, Pradhan said, “Without UP’s support, it was impossible for India to take the lead.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/min-yogi-govt-wiped-out-bimaru-tag-on-up/articleshow/86467534.cms||Isha Jain

The affidavit said, “During the course of hearing on September 20, issue pertaining to NOC advanced to a house in Sector 27-A was raised, wherein the petitioners alleged that the UT administration is giving NOCs share-wise, categorically mentioning the floors as well. The NOC was issued to co-sharers on account of a lien being created on their shares.

The victim, Sunil, in this thirties, received a request from a woman who claimed to be a foreign national on a matrimonial site. The victim started communicating with the woman through email and Whatsapp. Later, the accused woman lured the victim to invest money in a herbal oil company from Mumbai and took Rs 17 lakh from him through online payment. Upon realising the fraud, Sunil approached the police with a complaint.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wet weekend cloud over submerged EM Bypass pockets||KOLKATA: With the regional Met office in Kolkata predicting heavy rain this weekend, those living along a large stretch of EM Bypass are keeping their fingers crossed. Thursday afternoon’s spell of rain made matters worse for residents of Mukudapur, Nayabad, Panchasayar and Madurdaha. Now, any further rain this weekend would spell doom for them. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation sewerage and drainage department officials offered no remedies, except arranging for portable pumps to flush out storm water from low-lying areas. “At present there is no drainage network in these areas. Storm water is yet to recede. Further rain could completely inundated these areas,” said a KMC drainage department official. The KMC is planning to evacuate residents from areas off Bypass and Garden Reach-Metiabruz belt with help of disaster management department. “If need be we will rescue people from low-lying areas and take them to safer places,” said a civic official. Mrinal Dasgupta, a retired government employee, had an appointment at a hospital near Mukundapur on Wednesday. But he had to cancel due to waterlogging. “I have got a fresh appointment on Saturday. But I don’t know what will happen,” Dasgupta said. One of the worst-affected areas is Mukundapur Main Road that leads from Rabindranath Tagore Institute of Cardiac Sciences to Bypass. “Rain on Wednesday afternoon added to our misery. I don’t know when situation will improve,” said Narayana Health regional director (east) R Venkatesh. The situation is a fallout of rampant filling of wetlands in the belt, unplanned development, inadequate focus on infrastructure and slack maintenance. A drainage plan under Phase II of Kolkata Environment and Infrastructure Improvement Project can solve this problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wet-weekend-cloud-over-submerged-emb-pockets/articleshow/86464566.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Nashik||Godavari pollution: NGT tells state to deposit Rs 1 cr interim compensation||Nashik: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) principal bench in Delhi has ordered Maharashtra to deposit Rs1 crore interim compensation with the Nashik district collector, besides directing the chief secretary to “personally look into” the “continuing failure and neglect” by various authorities to address the Godavari river pollution problem at Trimbakeshwar. “The interim compensation may be utilized for restoration of water quality of the river in Trimbakeshwar, district Nashik,” the green tribunal stated in an order on September 16. The bench, headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, made some stringent observations and directed the chief secretary to take remedial action against “erring officers” in the light of binding orders by the Supreme Court as well as the NGT relating to the water pollution issue. It directed the chief secretary to personally remain present for the next video conference hearing on January 10, 2022. “The chief secretary may also ensure that a copy of this order is kept in the ACR (annual confidential record) folders and personal files of the concerned erring officers,” the bench said, adding, “This order is without prejudice to the prosecution of the concerned officers for past and for continuing violation of the statutory provisions and orders of the Supreme Court (SC) and this tribunal and liability under the polluter pays principle.” The question for consideration before the tribunal, in a plea filed in 2019 by Kiran Ramdas Kamble and others, was the action to be taken for failure of the Trimbakeshwar Municipal Council and other state authorities concerned in preventing discharge of municipal waste from two nallahs that merge with the Godavari river, in violation of an SC judgement of 2017 and in spite of four orders by NGT in the last two years and provisions under the municipal solid waste management law. In October 2019, the Nashik district collector and state pollution control board had jointly submitted a report acknowledging several violations in the matter. NGT had then issued directives at regular intervals to address the same. At the last hearing held through video conferencing on September 16, the state cited lack of funds and the pandemic as justification for the inaction, but NGT dismissed these arguments. “The stand of the authorities of Maharashtra is unfortunate. It shows lack of sensitivity to public duties and respect for binding law and orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Tribunal,” the bench remarked. “Continuing violation of law, resulting in denial of the right of the citizens to clean environment and also potential for damage to public health is against the rule of law guaranteed under the Constitution. Inaction of the authorities is like saying ‘we do not respect law, crime is permissible and we are party to it’. Water pollution results in deaths, diseases and preventing it is as important obligation as preventing any other crime, to protect the health of the citizens. Water pollution also results in depriving living creatures of a source of drinking water,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/godavari-pollution-ngt-tells-state-to-deposit-rs-1-cr-interim-compensation/articleshow/86462420.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||NCW asks cops to probe restaurant denying entry to saree-clad woman||New Delhi: The National Commission for Women on Thursday asked the Delhi Police commissioner to probe the incident in which a woman was allegedly denied entry in a city restaurant for wearing a saree, and take necessary action in the matter.While observing that the saree is an intrinsic part of Indian culture and majority of women in the country wear it, the NCW said that denying any woman entry in a restaurant for her attire is a violation of her “right to live with dignity”.The Commission made these assertions in a statement in which it mentioned that it has taken cognizance of the incident and ordered a probe. NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Delhi Police commissioner asking him to look into the matter and take necessary action against the restaurant, if the allegations leveled are found to be true. The NCW has also written to the marketing and PR director of the restaurant to appear before the Commission for a hearing on September 28. In its statement, the NCW stated that the Commission has come across a social media post wherein a restaurant in south Delhi has allegedly denied entry to a woman because she was wearing a saree. “Reportedly, the restaurant’s dress code policy for guests allows only smart casuals and according to the eatery, saree does not fall under smart casuals,” it has said. The Commission has condemned the arbitrary and bizarre behaviour of the staff of the restaurant and its policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ncw-asks-cops-to-probe-restaurant-denying-entry-to-saree-clad-woman/articleshow/86464582.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Jal Jivan Mission: AAP leader levels more allegations||Lucknow: Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh, who had alleged a scam worth Rs 30,000 crore in the ongoing Jal Jivan Mission in UP, on Thursday levelled fresh set of allegations in the implementation of the scheme. Singh claimed that all 21 companies which are working for the mission had “failed” quality standards in a recent review meeting. Singh said that principal secretary (Namami Gange) Anurag Srivastava on August 25 held a meeting of the rural water supply department and Jal Jivan Mission to review various piped water schemes being implemented in phase 1 and 2. In this meeting, it was found that the work of none of the 21 companies was up to the standard. “They are compromising not just on quality but are also behind schedule which will increase the cost of the project,” Singh said. The MP had earlier accused the Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh and other officials of a massive scam in the implementation of the scheme. He claimed that a company which had been blacklisted by other states was given the tender for part of the project and also that rates for various works and items had been escalated. Demanding a CBI enquiry, Singh said that the “blacklisted” company Rashmi Metaliks had claimed that it would sue Singh for Rs 5,000 crore but when the defamation notice was sent by the court, it was for just Rs 10 lakh. “Our charges are being proved correct by those in the system itself. First engineers associated with the mission wrote letters that tenders were given at 30-40% higher rates than approved. These letters also make it clear that their financial powers were increased from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore without following due process,” he said. He added that due to the pressure created by these letters, Mission executive director Akhand Pratap Singh wrote to the Jal Nigam managing director on August 21 to ask for the fresh list of approved rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jal-jivan-mission-aap-leader-levels-more-allegations/articleshow/86467540.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Patrol team of forest dept attacked inside Asola, forest dept suspects bootleggers||New Delhi: A team of forest officials patrolling Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary were attacked by around 25 suspected bootleggers with rods and sticks on Thursday evening. At least four members of the patrol team were injured and one of them, a wildlife guard, sustained serious injuries on the head, officials said. The forest department says the attack is suspected to have been carried out by bootleggers who use the Asola route to smuggle illicit liquor from Haryana to Sangam Vihar in south Delhi. “We have been arresting liquor smugglers over the past two months and this appears to be a pre-planned attack to retaliate against us,” said Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest (south). The team of wildlife guards and range officers were patrolling the sanctuary in a jeep and motorcycles when they were attacked, he added. The attackers were most probably from two places — Sangam Vihar in Delhi and Sarangpur in Haryana, said Anand. “Liquor was being brought from Sarangpur to Sangam Vihar over the past several months. Police were called, but the attackers had fled by then. We will lodge an FIR,” he added.A forest official at the sanctuary claimed that the attack took place around 7pm and while the wildlife guard sustained serious injuries, a driver, deputy range officer and another wildlife guard were also injured. All of them are being treated at Batra Hospital in Tughlaqabad.In August, three men were arrested in three days by forest officials for trying to smuggle illicit liquor through the sanctuary. Forest officials say walls of the sanctuary have been broken down in places by the smugglers to use the forest route to avoid detection on the road while entering Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/patrol-team-of-forest-dept-attacked-inside-asola-forest-dept-suspects-bootleggers/articleshow/86464546.cms||---

The current red-hot rally in the stock market has further fuelled their asset growth. The asset under management of equity mutual funds in the state surged by Rs 7,763.8 crore at Rs 1.24 lakh crore in August as compared to Rs 1.16 lakh crore in July, shows data compiled by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Apart from the increase in net asset value following soaring equity indices, fresh investment into equity-oriented schemes increased the mutual funds’ AUM, said analysts. “Stock prices of several companies, irrespective of the size or sector, reported unprecedented surge, delivering returns that ranged from 2 to 6 times the actual investment within a year. Over a longer period, the returns in some cases were even higher. Some retail as well as HNI investors booked profit into individual stocks and reinvested a part of their gains into equity MFs,” said Jayesh Vithalani, an Ahmedabad-based financial analyst. Analysts also attribute the fresh inflows into new fund offers and diversion of funds from real estate investments and bank deposits to the surge in investments in equity mutual funds. “A couple of new fund offers were launched which attracted a lot of investments from retail as well as HNI investors, contributing to a major inflow in equity mutual funds. Moreover, there is diminishing interest among investors for fixed deposits and bonds due to limited returns. Therefore, people are diverting funds of matured fixed deposits into mutual funds which are promising good returns,” said Mumukshu Desai, director of an Ahmedabad-based financial advisory fund. According to Desai, SIP inflows remained buoyant and touched a level of Rs 10,000 crore pan India. “The trend for SIP investments was bullish in Gujarat too with several new investors opting for SIPs and the rest continuing existing ones,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-equity-mf-assets-swell-to-record-levels/articleshow/86466877.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Jail for 4 NDMC ex-officials: White-collar crime more dangerous, says court||New Delhi: A Delhi court sent four former NDMC officials to jail for three years in a cheating case, saying they were employed for a service which is to be taken much higher than a mere “job” as it encapsulates demand of selfless dedication to public welfare while tendering self for public good.It said their acts were much graver, penetrating deep to shred the credibility of public institutions in the eyes of people for whose benefits these very institutions were constituted. “The conduct of convicts/accused has been contradictory to such public expectations and cannot be justified,” Special Judge Nirja Bhatia said in the order.Subhash Chand Jain, PK Mathur, Yad Ram Shammi and Dinesh Chand Sharma were convicted for conspiring among themselves to defraud NDMC in a matter pertaining to execution and award of electrical work, for which they awarded the work and released payments to the contractor after receiving illegal gratification. They forged documents and showed inflated amounts for prosecution of the conspiracy.“The convicts committed a white collar crime, and such crimes are committed by people generally belonging to ‘upper socio-economic class’,” the court stated.“Thus, equipped with their financial and educational background, it is considered easier by them to manipulate, maneuver and navigate the system in such a manner so as to make it succumb to their own self interests. Such crimes are in fact more dangerous for the reasons that the consequences of white collar crimes are much larger than the ordinary crimes and also that such crimes lower public morale and confidence,” it observed.The court added that the plea that the convicts have only been found guilty with respect to Rs 1,22,913 does not hold much merit as every amount which does not belong genuinely to a public servant and forms part of public money is much valued and cannot be quantified as a small sum.“Being the government servants, convicts/accused persons hold a position of great responsibility and were expected to conduct themselves with a higher level of integrity. More so, they have been occupying higher positions, associated with awe and respect in the public eye, their conduct of such nature is sufficient to dislodge public trust in institutions per se,” it noted.The court said the convict were “weighed over by their greed” and sought to utilise official/contractual capacities and positions to usurp public money for their personal gains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jail-for-4-ndmc-ex-officials-white-collar-crime-more-dangerous-says-court/articleshow/86464622.cms||Usha Das

These AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) cities and urban clusters will strive to prevent climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. These cities include Chandrapur, Malegaon, Mira-Bhayandar, Sangli-Miraj, Akola, Satara, Ambarnath, Nanded, Shirdi, Amravati, Solapur, Thane, Badlapur, Jalgaon, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Panvel, Vasai-Virar City, Kolhapur and Pimpri-Chinchwad, among others. Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kalyan-Dombivali, Pune and Nagpur already joined the campaign earlier this year. The environment department will undertake a greenhouse gas emission inventory exercise for all the cities and clusters, which account for a floating population of 50 million. Within 12 months of joining, the cities will have to explain what actions will be taken toward achieving both interim and long-term pledges, and commit to report publicly both progress as well as actions being taken, at least annually. Thackeray made the announcement at India’s Road to COP26 event, part of The Hub Live at Climate Week NYC 2021, and as part of the Global Citizen Live Campaign. “We cannot keep emitting carbon. We don’t have the luxury of time. Maharashtra will set an example of how subnational governments can act on climate change despite being a massively industrialised state,” said Thackeray.

---||Thane||43 Maharashtra cities to join global ‘Race to Zero’ pollution drive||MUMBAI: Ahead of the climate change conference ‘COP26’ to be held in the UK, 43 Maharashtra cities will join the UN-backed ‘Race to Zero’ global campaign to reduce pollution, announced environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Thursday. These AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) cities and urban clusters will strive to prevent climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. These cities include Chandrapur, Malegaon, Mira-Bhayandar, Sangli-Miraj, Akola, Satara, Ambarnath, Nanded, Shirdi, Amravati, Solapur, Thane, Badlapur, Jalgaon, Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Panvel, Vasai-Virar City, Kolhapur and Pimpri-Chinchwad, among others. Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad, Kalyan-Dombivali, Pune and Nagpur already joined the campaign earlier this year. The environment department will undertake a greenhouse gas emission inventory exercise for all the cities and clusters, which account for a floating population of 50 million. Within 12 months of joining, the cities will have to explain what actions will be taken toward achieving both interim and long-term pledges, and commit to report publicly both progress as well as actions being taken, at least annually. Thackeray made the announcement at India’s Road to COP26 event, part of The Hub Live at Climate Week NYC 2021, and as part of the Global Citizen Live Campaign. “We cannot keep emitting carbon. We don’t have the luxury of time. Maharashtra will set an example of how subnational governments can act on climate change despite being a massively industrialised state,” said Thackeray. Global Citizen’s co-founder & chief policy, impact and government affairs officer Michael Sheldrick said, “We know halting climate change will require immediate action from everyone. That means state and regional governments have a leading role to play in halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/43-maharashtra-cities-to-join-global-race-to-zero-pollution-drive/articleshow/86471778.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

---||Mumbai||Mhada home winners see upswing in family education, pay: Study||MUMBAI: Families that won a low-income housing lottery —in which people got the chance to buy subsidised Mhada homes—saw a significant improvement in their income, education, employment and even civic participation in the years following their win, a study has found. Winning families were 16% more likely than non-winning families to earn over Rs 10,000 a month, 27% more likely to earn over Rs 15,000 and 37% more likely to earn over Rs 20,000, the survey found. Members of these families were also 9.6% more likely to be employed and 16% more likely to have full-time jobs. The effects were stronger in the young adult group: Those who turned 21 or passed college after the win were 32.5% more likely to have jobs. Significantly, children in winning families were 14% more likely to go past Class X, 17.6% more likely to pass Class XII, and 15.9% more likely to enter post-secondary education than non-winning families. These numbers were also higher for those who turned 16 and 21 after the win: The former were 18% more likely to finish Class X and the latter 26% more likely to finish college. These effects are comparable to benefits seen in conditional cash transfer schemes, the study said. “These findings show that housing programs can be really powerful tools to help families exit poverty,” said study author Tanu Kumar, now a post-doctoral fellow at the College of William & Mary in the US. “They are not just short-term solutions but can affect families across multiple generations.” The study, to be published soon, surveyed 834 households that had participated in the lotteries in 2012 and 2014, looking for differences in the trajectories of the 421-odd families who won and the 413 who didn’t win, in the three to five years following the lottery. Both winning and non-winning families were similar in terms of education, income levels and existing housing. A key reason for the benefits seemed to be the ability of winners to rent or sell the new home, rather than relocate to their new homes, the study suggested. (Many housing schemes don’t allow buyers to sell or rent their new homes.) Half the winning families chose to rent out their homes, and rental incomes were usually more than the mortgage payments. Poor families dependent on local networks for livelihood are usually reluctant to relocate, Kumar noted. “Being able to convert housing into cash allows households to benefit from the housing in case that the location isn’t right for them,” she said. Increased income likely allowed households to invest in education, either through spending or simply allowing children to continue or finish school, said Kumar. Winning parents were also much more likely to send their children to private schools, the study found. “There is research on psychology and poverty that shows that decreasing stress about the future and about money allows households to invest more in the future.” Kumar said winning families were also slightly more optimistic about the future and more individualistic in their outlook. Winners were 33% more likely to say they were happy about their financial situation and 8.8% more likely to say that individual effort leads to success. The program seemed to have an effect on winners’ participation and standing in the civic and political sphere, Kumar found in a separate survey. Winners were more likely to be able to name a local official, to approach officials and politicians with demands, and to attend neighbourhood meetings. More study of subsidised home programs is needed, cautioned Kumar, noting there is relatively little data on long-term effects. “There’s a lot we don’t know about them still, particularly how parameters like the size of the subsidy, loan structure and eligibility requirements affect beneficiaries’ experiences.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mhada-home-winners-see-upswing-in-family-edu-pay-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/86468320.cms||Vaishnavi Chandrashekhar
---||Kolkata||Rs 18cr project fails to solve Golf Gardens flooding||Kolkata: Residents of Golf Gardens are facing serious waterlogging issues despite a Rs 18-crore project to augment the drainage infrastructure with installation of larger capacity pipelines and setting up of a pump house to drain out water from localities adjoining Prince Ghulam Mohammad Shah Road and Haripada Dutta Lane. “Last year, all roads were dug up to lay large drainage pipelines. The project promised a better tomorrow. But the reality has been quite the opposite. This year, the area remained waterlogged for 24-36 hours after the rain,” said businessman Saibal Mukherjee, who shifted from Golf Green to Golf Gardens in 2013. Monoranjan Khan, who moved into the area in 1995, said the drainage augmentation project did not solve the problem because no outlet had been created. “Water from RCGC flows into the locality and is pumped into a water body that had gone dry. But that got filled up quickly. If pumps are used now, water flows back from this pond,” he pointed out. The problem, said Sovon Datta, president of Golf Gardens Citizens’ Association, was the choking of the outlet into Garfa canal. “Under the project we had set up a pumping station and laid pipelines. But after the recent inundation we will review the project,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-18cr-project-fails-to-solve-golf-gardens-flooding/articleshow/86464620.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Lucknow||Tiger reserves, parks to reopen on Nov 1||Lucknow: To give a boost to ecotourism in the state, national parks and tiger reserves would be reopened on November 1 this year instead of November 15. Usually, national parks and tiger reserves are closed on June 15 and reopened on November 15. Giving this information to TOI, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) wildlife, PK Sharma said that though the final order in this regard is yet to be issued by the forest department, preparations are on by the UP forest corporation, the nodal agency for ecotourism promotion in the state, to make it a robust season for nature tourism. For the convenience of tourists this year more homestays will be available in Dudhwa and Pilibhit tiger reserves. The homestays are provided by locals who are verified and authorised by the forest corporation and the district administration. The homestays were started in November 2019, but due to the pandemic last year the scheme did not take off well. There are homestays in Dudhwa and Pilibhit tiger reserves, Katarniaghat and Suhelwa wildlife sanctuary. Details of homestays are available on the website of the department. GM, UPFC, Eva Sharma said, “We will add homestays in Amangarh tiger reserve also as hardly any tourist facility is available there currently.” Besides, the existing infrastructure at Pilibhit tiger reserve has been improved recently with the renovation of ‘tharu’ huts. The tourism department and UPFC have launched tour packages for ecotourists from Lucknow to Dudhwa, Lakhimpur Kheri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tiger-reserves-parks-to-reopen-on-nov-1/articleshow/86467559.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Government employees will be terminated if they leak REET question paper||JAIPUR: Rajasthan will witness a massive inter-district movement of students as nearly 16 lakh candidates will travel to appear for the REET (Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teacher) on Sunday. Students have already started traveling towards the centres to avoid rush on exam day. Travelling for students in Rajasthan Roadways buses as well as in private ones has been made free for REET students. Special trains have also been announced for a day to ferry the candidates. At a review meeting on Thursday, the chief minister approved the proposal for termination from service of government employees caught leaking REET question paper and withdrawal of private institutes’ recognitions if their employees facilitate cheating. Gehlot said strict action should be taken against copying gangs. He directed to install CCTV cameras at examination centres and videograph the entire process — from printing the question papers to examination centres and opening them. He said candidates appearing in REET should not carry phones to the examination centres. Gehlot said if the candidates, especially women, who have come to take the examination have problems with lodging and food, then public representatives, social workers and voluntary organizations should come forward to help them. He said the district collectors should talk to voluntary organisations in their districts and prepare them for help. Chief minister directed to set up control rooms in every district so that the candidates, especially women candidates, could inform if they face any problem. Minister of state for education Govind Singh Dotasara said special vigil should be kept on the gangs and coaching centres involved in paper leaks and copying. He said at the time of entering an examination centre, a new mask should be made available. ACS (school education) PK Goyal informed that 3,993 examination centres have been set up in the state. He said 16,22,019 candidates have applied for the exam. Railways has given consent to run11 special trains for the candidates and has been requested for some more special trains. He said that executive magistrates and police units would be stationed at railway stations and important bus stands. Health department meanwhile has issued directions to all chief medical health officers asking them to keep all health institutions open round-the-clock on September 26. Directions have also been issued to ensure that Covid guidelines are followed at the examination centres. Considering the large number of students that will remain on roads for the exam, traders in Jaipur have announced to keep markets closed on September 26. The state government has cancelled university exams from September 25 to 27 and the chief minister has appealed to people to avoid travelling except for urgent purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-employees-will-be-terminated-if-they-leak-reet-question-paper/articleshow/86467556.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid temple run: A prayer in their hearts, but no masks on their faces||NEW DELHI: Despite Delhi Disaster Management Authority prohibiting visitors at places of worship in the city, several temples are open for devotees and are allowing them entry without observing Covid-appropriate norms. The kiosks selling puja items on the temple premises too are fully operational, raising questions about whether steps are being taken to check the spread of coronavirus. Hanuman Mandir in CP and Jhandewalan Devi Mandir in Karol Bagh were being visited by devotees. Though they were fewer in number than usual and volunteers were keeping a watch, people had easy access to the temples, and some of them were allowed into the complex even without masks. Outside, people were lining up at the kiosks buying prasad and other items without caring much for physical distancing.  “People are coming here every day. More people visit the temple on weekends and on special days such as Tuesday,” said a stall owner at Hanuman Mandir. Ravinder Goel, a trustee of the Jhandewalan temple, said that devotees entered the temple during VIP visits. “I don’t know about other places but here we have been enforcing the norms strictly. Given that places of worship have been closed for a long time while markets and malls are now open, it is perhaps time to relax the restrictions for religious places,” he said. People who had visited Kalkaji Mandir recently had a similar experience to share. One devotee who went there recently reported a lengthy queue “Due to the heavy rush at the main mandir premises, it was impossible to maintain any social distancing,” he said. “It was also strange to see all the stalls doing business without restrictions.” While members of the temple management committees argued that it was impossible to restrict the entry of visitors, administrative officials said that it was the responsibility of the temples to not allow devotees into the premises. But temple authorities countered that either the government should engage people to stop the devotees at the entrance or some flexibility should be given to let devotees in, keeping Covid-19 requirements in mind. Ajay Bhardwaj, a member of Shri Kalkaji Mandir Prabandhak Sudhar Committee, claimed they were making every effort to restrict the crowds and comply with Covid norms. They were allowing only members of the committee for puja, he said. “But often devotees come for darshan and won’t leave the place,” he added. “It is impossible for us to stop them from coming.” Suresh Sharma, a priest at CP’s Hanuman Mandir, argued that temple committees had no authority to act against defaulters but claimed that they were taking all care to ensure compliance with the DDMA order. A Delhi government official said they would carry out inspections and take action against violators. “Not allowing the entry of even a single devotee inside the complex is the responsibility of the managing committee just the way hotels and restaurants have to maintain the permitted numbers in their establishments,” he clarified. “We have talked to the Jhandewalan mandir management and they have assured us they aren’t open for visitors,” said Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (Central), adding the committee had opened the temple only for members of the management committee. Sagar said the district authorities recently held a meeting with the management of religious places and instructed them to obey the DDMA order banning gatherings at shrines. “We sensitised them to follow the directives until changes are made,” said Sagar. The Hanuman temple at Connaught Place falls under the jurisdiction of the New Delhi district. “We have taken appropriate action wherever the DDMA order hasn’t been followed and all management committees have been made aware of the order,” said a district official. The Chanakyapuri sub-divisional magistrate had recently ordered the management of Gurdwara Bangla Sahib on Baba Kharak Singh Marg to immediately bar entry to devotees, in keeping with the Covid guidelines in place. The Delhi government has also virtually barred large congregations for festivals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-temple-run-a-prayer-in-their-hearts-but-no-masks-on-their-faces/articleshow/86464632.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Late rain brings Delhi ever closer to 1944 record||NEW DELHI: Parts of the capital received strong showers on Thursday night, which may see Delhi break its all-time record for September rainfall by Friday. The city is expected to see at least a ‘two-week’ delay in the withdrawal of the southwest-monsoon this time around, with Met officials forecasting showers to continue till the first week of October as well. While ‘trace’ rainfall had been recorded at Safdarjung till 8.30pm on Thursday, Met officials said parts of south, central, north and east Delhi received showers after that period, which will bring Delhi closer to 1944’s all-time September record of 417.3mm rainfall during the month. The normal date for withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from Delhi is September 25. The date has been revised recently, with September 21 treated as the normal withdrawal date prior to 2020. RK Jenamani, scientist at IMD, said the monsoon was yet to withdraw from west Rajasthan, with the IMD still waiting for the withdrawal to commence in order to forecast withdrawal from the rest of north India. “Once that commences, we will be able to tell more accurately when other parts of Delhi-NCR also could see monsoon withdrawal. At this rate however, Delhi is not likely to see it for another two weeks, with rain also expected in early October,” he said. The IMD in an alert issued at 8:50 pm on Thursday said light to moderate showers would be occurring at night in most parts of Delhi, forecasting heavy intensity rain at a few places as well. Safdarjung, till 8.30 pm on Thursday had received 408.3mm of rainfall in September, which is less than 10mm short of the all-time record. Forecast for Friday, meanwhile, showed light showers were expected across the capital, with the maximum settling at 33.3 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/late-rain-brings-city-ever-closer-to-1944-record/articleshow/86467578.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Dropped ministers worried about tickets||GANDHINAGAR: While there is considerable jubilation among grassroot workers of the BJP as a large number of first-time MLAs have been made ministers, panic has set in among ministers who have been dropped and their supporters, as speculation is rife that they might not be given party tickets for the 2022 assembly election. An influential minister in the Vijay Rupani government who did not want to be named, said, “The manner in which the high command has dropped all the ministers along with the CM and deputy CM, and an entirely new cabinet has been sworn in, there is a strong possibility that none or very few ministers from the old regime will get tickets for the forthcoming assembly election.” The ex-minister added, “As most of the ministers in the Rupani cabinet were over the age of 60 and some had worked as ministers for over one or two decades, the party is most likely to replicate the same model of dropping all known faces and bring the younger generation forward in the assembly election as well. This strategy will also nullify anti-incumbency.’’ A senior BJP leader privy to the decision making process of dropping all the outgoing ministers said, “The party high command has a clear strategy in mind of giving chance to the younger generation and nurturing a new leadership who can lead the party in the coming decade in Gujarat. The party high command wants vigour in the leadership.” The leader added, “All former ministers who have served three terms or more are not likely to be considered for party tickets in 2022. Depending on what contribution the dropped ministers make towards strengthening the party before the polls, they could be given anew role in the organisation.”  Meanwhile, after major reshuffle in the state cabinet, now there is strong possibility that the BJP will appoint young, performing party workers at key positions in boards, corporations, statutory authorities and other government companies after `Shradha Paksha’ ends. “Party president C R Paatil is working for identifying such leaders and new CM Bhupendra Patel is likely to take a call soon after consulting the party high command,’’ said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dropped-ministers-worried-about-tickets/articleshow/86466921.cms||Kapil Dave

Wong said that trade relations between Singapore and India were very strong and, as per the master plan presented by the government, the environment was conducive for investing in UP. “Investors from Singapore are interested in investing in the Bundelkhand defence corridor, MSME, logistics, integrated township and data centre. Some had also expressed interest in investing in a skill centre in Varanasi. There are two companies from Singapore which are interested in setting up a data centre in Noida. A few others have said that they would like to invest in the agro sector in Kanpur,” the delegation informed the officials. The government has given a proposal for land allocation for these projects. The Singapore delegation said that the availability of manpower, including skilled workers in UP, was a huge attraction for investing in the state. Infrastructural facilities like airports, expressways were also a plus point. Extending an invitation to investors from Singapore, Mahana said that the government would provide them with every possible facility. “The demand and supply chain has been strengthened and large tracts of land has been acquired under a land bank so that it could be made available to investors at the earliest,” he said. Tiwari meanwhile spoke about the infrastructure development in the state because of which, he said, UP had been successful in drawing investors from across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/singapore-firms-find-atmosphere-in-up-conducive-keen-to-invest-in-state-envoy/articleshow/86467574.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There has been apprehension among residents about water contamination after the heavy deluge as many underground reservoirs got submerged with water overflowing from Bagjola canal. “Samples were collected from about 18 reservoirs and high levels of coliform were detected from four reservoirs. There were very high levels of coliform in two reservoirs, one at a housing complex and another at one of the blocks. The reservoirs, including the connecting overhead tanks, have been cleaned with chlorine tablets and refilled with fresh water,” said a PHE official.

The complainant stated that when his son and his wife refused to obey the order of the tribunal, he moved an appeal before the district magistrate, who in 2019 upheld the order of the maintenance tribunal. However, despite the 2019 order, his son and his wife did not change and for the last two months even refused to give him food. He stated in his complaint that in order to survive he used to the neighbours for food. He stated that when he asked Shobha for food, she abused him and Jitendra kicked him and threatened him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-accuses-son-his-wife-of-ill-treatment/articleshow/86466941.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP poll machinery rolls out in Uttar Pradesh, 6 party spearheads dig in heels||LUCKNOW: BJP has set its well-oiled election machinery rolling in Uttar Pradesh with newly appointed election co-incharges readying to camp in their allocated six regions — Paschim, Braj, Awadh, Kashi, Gorakhpur and Kanpur — to ensure mobilisation of grassroots functionaries and boost booth-level electoral campaign in run-up to polls. The strategy was hammered out at its organisational meeting at UP BJP headquarters on Thursday, a day after party’s UP election in charge and Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Lucknow and held a detailed discussion with the state organisational brass and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. While former Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh Sidhu, a Jat, will camp in the politically restive west UP (Paschim) region to consolidate Jat voters in wake of the unrest over three farm laws, Union minister of state and party’s dalit leader from Rajasthan, Arjun Ram Meghwal, will dig in his heels in Braj, which has a substantial dalit population. Likewise, party’s Rajya Sabha MP Saroj Pandey, who hails from Chhattisgarh, will work in the key Kashi region, which houses PM Narendra Modi’s constituency — Varanasi. BJP’s move to deploy Pandey in Kashi is an attempt to consolidate Brahmin voters, who are being aggressively wooed by the Opposition, ostensibly SP and BSP. In Gorakhpur region, BJP will deploy Vivek Thakur, a Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar. The move is interpreted as a ploy to consolidate Bhumihars in east UP with Vivek Thakur hailing from the community. Similarly, Shobha Karandlaje, Lok Sabha MP from Udupi Chikmagalur (Karnataka) will work in Awadh region. Karandlaje, a Vokkaliga by caste, is media-savvy and is known for her core organisational skills. And the crucial Kanpur-Bundelkhand region has been handed over to OBC leader and Union minister of state Annapurna Devi. Union minister and party’s youth face, Anurag Thakur, who has been assigned the task of election management and handling media and IT cells, held a separate meeting with party functionaries on Thursday. Sources privy to the meeting said, Thakur categorically sought propping up Central and state government schemes on social media platforms. The idea, sources said, was to turn government schemes into an adhesive tool to cement voter base, cutting across caste lines. Seeking to harp on popularity of PM in run-up to polls, BJP will organise statewide exhibitions portraying public welfare schemes in the last seven years. The three-day exhibitions will be held from September 25, coinciding with ideologue Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s birth anniversary. . BJP conclaves with docs, lawyers, CAsAfter ‘prabuddha varg sammellans’, BJP will hold conventions for professional groups, including teachers, doctors. lawyers and CAs. This is seen as BJP’s bid to move a step ahead of its opponents, mainly the BSP which had been organising intellectual meets to consolidate Brahmins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-poll-machinery-rolls-out-6-party-spearheads-dig-in-heels/articleshow/86467587.cms||Pankaj Shah

While speaking on the occasion, the Union minister said a shodh peeth(research centre) will be established under the name of Mahant Gambhirnath at DDU Gorakhpur University. “Mahant Digvijaynath always tried to provide equal education rights to women and girls and in 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi incorporated it in the New Education Policy (NEP). The country will get momentum of development if people of all castes and creeds get the same education and the Union and state governments will work continuously with the motto ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’,” said Pradhan. “The entire country is celebrating 75 years of independence and Mahant Digvijaynath played a vital role in the Chauri Chaura incident of freedom struggle,” he said. The minister appreciated the leadership of PM Modi and CM Yogi and said under their guidance, Covid pandemic was managed efficiently and Uttar Pradesh made a record of administering 40 lakh vaccine doses on the occasion of PM Modi’s birthday. “Under Ujjawala scheme, 8 crore women in the country got free LPG connections of which 2.5 crore are in Uttar Pradesh. Soon the LPG will be supplied through the pipeline in Gorakhpur. The government is continuously working for the upliftment of the poor and underprivileged and a fertilizer plant dedicated to the farmers will be inaugurated next month,” he added. While speaking on the occasion, the CM said Mahant Digvijaynath was associated with the freedom struggle as a revolutionary youth and wrote a new history in front of the nation and world with his works and personality. “Positive thinking promotes development and it can’t exist with a negative mindset. When a government of nationalist ideology moves forward with positive thinking, infrastructure development takes place,” he said. “PM Modi launched several public welfare schemes and today, the Ujjawala scheme brought a new revolution in the area of green energy and its benefits have reached the poor and needy without any discrimination,” the CM said. “The fertilizer plant which was closed in 1990 will start operating again from next month under the guidance of PM Modi. Today, everyone can see that PM Modi gave a global platform to the country when 21st June became International Day of Yoga,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mahant-digvijaynath-played-vital-role-in-freedom-struggle-pradhan/articleshow/86466967.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Now, BSP will give 50% poll tickets to youth||Lucknow: The Bahujan Samaj Party seems to be going in for a major transformation before it goes into polls in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. The party has decided that a major chunk of tickets will be given to youths in the assembly elections. A senior BSP leader said, “Till when are youths going to wait for their turn? Senior leaders should give space to youths now.” According to another party insider, BSP chief Mayawati is planning to give 50% tickets to youths this time. Some say it is the party’s strategy shift primarily aimed at stopping Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Ravan’s influence on Dalit youths. However, others say that the 70-year-old BSP chief is growing old and gradually shifting responsibilities to the youths within the party. Though she is holding meetings with BSP leaders and cadres mainly at her residence and restricting her public appearance as of now, BSP’s ‘gen next’ leaders have their job cut out: to strengthen the party base. At work are BSP national coordinator and Mayawati’s nephew 26-year-old Akash Anand and unarguably number two in BSP Satish Chandra Mishra’s lawyer son Kapil. Primarily political greenhorns, both Akash and Kapil are gradually learning the basics. Politically at least three years senior, Akash is touring other states. He was recently in Punjab when BSP struck an alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal for 2022 Punjab assembly elections. Similarly, Kapil, the national media coordinator, has accompanied his father at several prabuddh sammelans. The lawyer with 12 years of experience has also been addressing youths in Lucknow and urging them to be prepared to counter the Opposition’s tirade against BSP either by activities at local level or through social media. A senior BSP leader also said that while Mayawati has decided to promote youths, the party has also decided to test such leaders’ loyalty. Now, ticket-seekers would have to prove their loyalty by telling the party leadership how many villages they have visited, what they did to strengthen the party at booth level and what they did to prove their loyalty towards the party, said an insider. The aim of the exercise is to not only create a battery of new leaders after several from the old guard switched loyalties but also to ensure that new leaders don’t leave the party. Ticket-seekers have been given two months, based on which the BSP chief is likely to announce tickets. Among other strategic changes, the party has begun talking about Hindu gods and goddesses in a bid to win back voters. Mishra, during a prabuddh sammelan, was seen running from one temple to another, a shift that was never visible in the party since its foundation. Mishra had then told TOI that there was no restriction on BSP leaders on offering prayers. However, whether the BSP’s strategy shift will yield results is yet to be seen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-bsp-will-give-50-poll-tickets-to-youth/articleshow/86467593.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Citing heavy rains and warning by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) about more rain, the water resources department had started releasing water from Gangapur dam, which was filled to 100% capacity. The discharge of 1,000 cusec, which started at 8.30 am on Wednesday was increased to 8,129 cusec by evening and then reduced to 500 cusec by Thursday 11 am. This has further helped in reducing the water levels in Ramkund area of Nashik city. A good number of shops and establishments are located in the commercial areas around Ramkund. “When the water level was rising, the shopkeepers were worried about the water entering the shops, but now the water level has gone down fairly,” said Keshav Gatkal, a shopkeeper. Peth and Surgana, the two neighbouring talukas in the hilly areas of Nashik, had received heavy rain till 8.30 am on Thursday while Trimbakeshwar and Igatpuri received about 40 mm of rain. Parts of Nandgaon taluka in the district received heavy rain on Thursday, which led to the overflow of streams, that restricted the movement of the people across it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/lull-in-showers-water-level-in-godavari-starts-receding/articleshow/86462549.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kochi||Kerala Plus One, a tale of disappointments||KOCHI: Though admission to Plus One classes began on Thursday by following Covid protocols, hundreds of students were disappointed as they couldn’t get admission in school and courses of their choice, which was indicated in their applications. Even students who scored A+ in all subjects didn’t get admission as per their designated choice. Moreover, many students are yet to be allotted seats and are anxiously awaiting the second allotment result of Plus One admission, which is likely in October first week. At the same time, students from CBSE and other streams, who wish to pursue higher secondary in state syllabus, too faced this issue despite securing high marks in Class 10. “Top scorers are confused and are complaining to their teachers as they didn’t get admission even in the school they completed SSLC despite getting full A+. There were 147 students who secured full A+ in our school and nearly 90% of them chose the science stream in our HSS as the first option. Less than 40% got their seats in the first allotment.  Science is the most sought-after stream, but this year most students will not get admission in it due to high competition,” said the principal of an aided HSS in Alappuzha. The first allotment results were announced by the general education department on Wednesday. There aren’t enough Plus One seats to accommodate all eligible candidates who completed Class X. Though there are 4,65,219 valid applicants for Plus One, only 2,71,136 merit seats are available. In the first allotment, 2,18,418 seats were allocated to students and only 52,718 seats remain unallocated. There are no seats for nearly 1.95 lakh students and their future is at stake. But, teachers said that the main reason for the ongoing hullabaloo is the liberal marking system followed by the government in SSLC evaluation that led to an unusual increase in the number of top performers. State general secretary Departmental Higher Secondary School Teachers Association (HSSTA) Anil M George said several undeserving students secured full A+ due to liberalized assessment making the competition the toughest ever. “This year 1,21,318 students scored A+ in all subjects while there were only 41,906 students last year. There was a threefold increase in full A+ scorers though the grace marks were not calculated. Thousands of undeserving students were given full A+ and because of that thousands of deserving students are struggling to get admission to their favourite school and streams. The present situation questions the assessment system of SSLC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/plus-one-a-tale-of-disappointments/articleshow/86462535.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

A bench led by Justice S S Shinde told this to additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who sought an online hearing so that solicitor general Tushar Mehta can appear from Delhi. Deshmukh’s advocate objected to ED’s “demeaning tactics” of delaying the hearing. “This petition demonstrates the hapless state of affairs. The tactics are deplorable,’’ he added. The court posted the hearing on September 29. Deshmukh challenged five summons issued by ED, saying they stem from political vendetta. He preferred a virtual hearing due to the pandemic. ED alleged that Deshmukh had received illegal gratification of around Rs 4.7 crore from orchestra bar-owners between December 2020 and February 2021 through dismissed police officer Sachin Waze.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-tells-ed-to-respond-to-petition-of-deshmukh/articleshow/86467610.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Kin sells rape survivor's infant for Rs 90,000||NAGPUR: A 16-year-old rape survivor’s two-month-old daughter was allegedly sold off for Rs90,000 by a relative, on the pretext of giving her in adoption. The baby, sold on Tuesday, was traced by cops from Kotwali police station on Thursday following day-long effort and much drama. The Kotwali police had swung into action after a complaint was filed by the women and child development department on Wednesday evening. The rape survivor’s kin learnt to have signed an ‘adoption’ agreement on a Rs100 stamp paper with the family which paid for the baby. It’s learnt the baby changed several hands through agents, part of a chain of illegal adoption racketeers and human traffickers, before being handed over to the family which made the payment. District child protection officer Mushtak Pathan said adoption without following formalities is illegal. “Any exchange of money for adoption done through irregular mechanism is an offence and labelled as human trafficking in Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said Pathan. He had alerted district child protection unit counsellor Arun Shukla after receiving information about the sale of the baby. “After informing district women and child development officer (Aparna Kolhe), the counsellor was sent to record statement of the rape survivor whose baby was allegedly sold off,” he said. Counsellor Shukla recorded the statement of the rape survivor, who reported that the relative sold off her baby for Rs90,000. The women and child development department has now asked cops to ‘rescue’ the mother-daughter duo and shift them to some government facility. Shukla had rushed to Kotwali police station to lodge a complaint, but red-tapism delayed action on Wednesday. Sources said the baby was handed over to a couple at Chhapru Nagar and cash was handed over to the rape survivor’s kin at Nari in Jaripatka. The minor had been diagnosed six-month pregnant in May, leading to an offence of rape being registered at Kotwali police station against a 16-year-old neighbour. The minor had given birth to a girl at the end of July. The minor rape survivor resides with the relative as she lost her father early and her mother had abandoned her. Sources close to the rape survivor’s family said the minor wanted to retain the baby, but the relative with whom she stays insisted on giving away the baby for adoption. Sources said the rape survivor’s relative had delivered the baby to a woman, whose cellphone was switched off as soon as she realized police were searching for the baby. Family sources said the relative had earlier even tried to get the minor married off in Gujarat, but she was sent back due to her tender age. Senior police inspector Mukund Thakre of Kotwali police station said the relative who sold the baby after executing an agreement on stamp paper is with the police. The process of registering an offence is on. “As the baby has been traced now, the culprits would be booked after legal consultation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rape-survivors-two-month-old-daughter-sold-for-rs90000-by-relative/articleshow/86464768.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kanpur||GRP teams arrest three persons involved in loot in running trains||Done/ALVI Jhansi: A month-long search by several GRP teams led to the arrest of three persons involved in two successive midnight loots in the running trains in Orai and Jhansi stations here on Thursday. One of the accused is still absconding. All the four accused were involved in two robberies--one which took place on the intermittent night of August 23/24 in train no. 09322 (Patna-Indore Express) near Sarsauki station falling under Orai and the other on the successive night in train no. 02533 (Pushpak Express) near Paricha station in Jhansi. In almost a similar modus operandi in both the loots, the burglars had changed the signal light by inserting a coin which made the trains halt. They then got into the general compartment with some local weapons and started snatching ornaments from the passengers and escaped into the dark within minutes. As they did not leave any clues, over a dozen GRP and RPF teams started investigating the matter with constant monitoring through technical surveillance but without getting any clue. Almost after a month, acting on a tip-off, the GRP arrested Badal, Jai Prakash and Azad, all hailing from Chirgaon area of Jhansi district. They were hiding under the passenger shade at Chirgaon railway station. One of their accomplices Bhan Singh is still absconding. Police have recovered two broken ‘mangal sutras’, one ear ring, two motorbikes and Rs 3,720 from the cash from them. SP (GRP) Mohammad Imran said the accused are from a nomadic tribe whose past criminal records are being verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/grp-teams-arrest-three-persons-involved-in-loot-in-running-trains/articleshow/86467008.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor signs ordinance for OBC quota in rural local body polls||MUMBAI: Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari signed the ordinance providing for the OBC quota in rural local body polls on Thursday, a day after the state cabinet sent him a revised version. Koshyari had earlier returned the original ordinance to the state after raising queries, which had raised the hackles of the MVA government. The state is expected to send him another ordinance providing for the OBC quota in urban local bodies later this week. The State Election Commission (SEC) had earlier said that the ordinance on rural polls would have no impact on the bypolls to six zilla parishads and their panchayat samitis which are due on October 5 since the process of filing nominations had ended. “We will take the ordinance to the State Election Commission and ask if the election process for the zilla parishad bypolls can be cancelled and restarted to allow for the quota. If necessary, we will approach the Supreme Court,” said OBC welfare minister Vijay Wadettiwar. “The state will have to go before the SC to make any changes in the bypolls since the case for the OBC quota is before the court,” said a senior SEC official. Sources said that governor Koshyari had sought several clarifications. A senior state official called on him on Tuesday and explained the issues raised before sending the amended ordinance. Sources said that governor Koshyari asked about the lack of empirical data on OBCs, which the SC had asked for. “We explained that it would take time to provide the data and there are many local body polls slated for the next 6-8 months, which would then have to go through without the OBC quota,” said a senior official. He also said they explained how difficult it was to extract OBC data even from the Centre’s Socio-Economic Caste Census. The governor also asked for the SC to be informed about the ordinance before it was promulgated, based on the view of the state’s law and judiciary department. “However, we explained SC is not shown drafts of legislations before they are enacted,” said a senior officer. The state’s ordinance provides for the OBC quota in rural local body polls by amending the state’s gram panchayat law. The quota had been quashed by the SC in March. The ordinance allows for the OBC quota in rural bodies with the rider that once combined with the SC and ST reservations, the combined quota will not cross the 50% limit. Also, the OBC quota will not cross 27% of the seats, in keeping with the existing state legislation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guv-signs-ordinance-for-obc-quota-in-rural-local-body-polls/articleshow/86467641.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Now, when the Plus One admission started in state on Thursday, Nashwa was dejected as she didn’t find a place in the first allotment list in any of the 26 schools she had applied for admission in bio-science stream “I put in my maximum effort for the exam and it paid off as I got A-plus in all subjects. But now, I don’t know what to do as I am not in the list of the 26 schools across the district I had applied,” said Nashwa who was a student of PKMMHSS, Edarikode in Malappuram. Eager to pursue her studies, Nashwa had even started going for private tuition during the past three months for Plus one bio science course. But now, she is concerned that all her efforts would go in vain if she has to settle for other subjects. Nashwa is not alone in facing the predicament of not being able to get the subject or school of their choice despite scoring a full A-plus. Malabar region and particularly Malappuram and Kozhikode are facing acute shortage of Plus One seats with Kerala witnessing a record win in SSLC this year, including tripling of the number of full A-plus candidates. For instance, Malappuram has a total of 77,837 applicants for the 41,470 seats available. In Kozhikode too there is a wide gap between the number of applicants (48,606) and the total seats available (27,927). “As many as 2,070 students in our school passed SSLC and 633 of them scored full A-plus. But, we have only 360 seats for Plus One. Even many of those who scored full A-plus will not be able to get admission as students from across the district have applied for the limited seats,” said Pramod Vazhangara, a teacher at PKMMHSS Edarikode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-seats-for-even-full-a-students-in-malabar/articleshow/86462571.cms||---

The men from the village have been a part of the defence services since pre-Independence period and even today, at least one person from every house, is serving in the army. Some families have their fourth or fifth generations in the army. The village, however, lacks basic facilities for the youth to train for the army recruitment drives. The youth rely on the ex-army men for training and coaching. Dadaji Bhuse, minister for the welfare of the ex-army men, announced that a committee will set up to develop various infrastructure in the village located 17 km from Satara city. “We are going to develop a museum to honour the valour of the youth, who have laid down their lives for the country. We are setting up a panel of locals to suggest the place and model of the museum to be set up. Also, we are planning to set up a training centre where youths can get coached to join the army. A stadium will be developed for the youth to practice exercises to meet physical requirements,” he said. As many as 46 men from the village were sent to fight in the World War I. Since then, the Britishers named the village as Apshinge Military. And long before that, the tradition of valour continues since the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. At present, the village has a memorial with the name of every soldier, who had laid down his life for the country. Also, the memorial has names of the widows of the martyrs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-memory-of-generation-of-soldiers-state-plans-museum-of-valour-in-satara-village/articleshow/86462634.cms||---
---||Bareilly||After 1980s, wild elephants trek on old/ forgotten corridor, wreak havoc in Kheri||Bareilly: A herd of wild elephants wreaked havoc in social forestry’s Maheshpur range in Mohammadi area of Lakhimpur Kheri district, destroying several acres of standing crops and damaging a temple gate. This is the first time since the 1980s that a herd has come to this area, Samir Kumar, divisional forest officer, told TOI. There are more than 15 elephants in the herd, including two calves, he added. The foresters surmise that the same herd but with smaller numbers had tried to cross over from Mailani range of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in July to another forest but returned after failing to find a corridor to move on. The herd moved to Pilibhit, where it apparently united with another herd and returned to Maheshpur range on Wednesday. There was a wildlife corridor in Mohammadi years ago but now, the area is densely populated, old-timers said. The elephants’ return indicates a bid to revive an old wildlife corridor. This spells trouble for farmers in the area as they do not know how to deal with a head of wild elephants. Anil Chauhan, Bagh Mitra master trainer, told TOI, “The last time wild elephants migrated here was in 1988-89. This herd has two young calves and the elephants are quite protective of their calves and may turn aggressive anytime. They target the sugarcane fields at night. They have destroyed the cane fields of several farmers at Mallapur village. We are lighting fires outside the village, using acrid smoke with chillies, crackers and beating drums to keep the herd away. We have been monitoring their movement since they entered Kheri district from Pilibhit.” Farmer Anoop Singh said, “The elephants have trampled and destroyed my paddy field completely, causing a loss of over Rs 1.5 lakh. Am not sure if I will get compensation.” DFO Kumar said, “The sugarcane fields are possibly attracting the elephants here. The elephants have now reached Aonla block of forests and there is no forest area from here. Our ranger along with his team is monitoring the area and trying everything possible with the support of local volunteers and ‘bagh mitras’ to minimize the possibility of man-elephant conflict. Our priority is to push the herd back towards its natural habitat without causing a panic situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-1980s-wild-elephants-trek-on-old/-forgotten-corridor-wreak-havoc-in-kheri/articleshow/86462654.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||I am unfit for Kerala BJP chief’s post: Suresh Gopi||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At a time when rumours about leadership change in the state BJP unit are doing the rounds, Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi on Thursday ruled himself out from the race for the post of the party’s state president. The actor-politician told reporters that the post was fit for seasoned politicians, and not for an actor like him.  “The party should be led by experienced politicians who can read the mind of people keen to enter politics in future. I won’t be taking up the post even if K Surendran or V Muraleedharan ask me to do so,” he said, adding that neither PM Modi nor home minister Amit Shah would ever want to anoint him as the state president of BJP. Speaking about the controversy over the “narcotic jihad” remark by a Catholic bishop, Suresh Gopi said the church leaders in the state will be granted an audience with the representatives of the Union government. “Such discussions were on since 2019. They can meet the Union government representatives and share their grievances,” he said. Suresh Gopi, who had praised CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s stand on the statement made by Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt the other day, said the chief minster’s response to issues such as “love jihad” and “narcotic jihad” on Wednesday, were unwelcome. “The bishop was speaking about a social evil. He did not accuse any particular community,” Suresh Gopi said.  Vijayan had on Wednesday termed the allegations of "love jihad" and "narcotic jihad" in the state as baseless by citing figures. “The terms love and narcotics should not be attributed to any particular religion. The hopes of some forces to spoil unity and peace in the state will remain unfulfilled,” he had told reporters. Meanwhile, speculations about an imminent rejig in the BPJ state unit have been gaining momentum following the recent leadership change BJP effected in the party state unit in West Bengal. Though leaders close to Surendran rubbish the rumours as baseless, a section in the party believes that an overhaul is not unlikely. They point out the party’s abysmal performance in the assembly elections and the controversies that haunt the party and the leadership as the reasons for such a possibility. “We have to understand that BJP has been focussing on West Bengal after the assembly elections. In West Bengal, the party is hopeful to trounce Mamata Banerjee in a few years, but Kerala is not a place, where it can dream of forming a government in near future. But having said that, the decision on how the party units in each state should run and by whom is wholly dependent on the central leadership, especially Narendra Modi. Like in the past, we can’t rule out surprises,” said a senior party leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/i-am-unfit-for-state-bjp-chiefs-post/articleshow/86464961.cms||---

Razzak carrying Rs 1 lakh cash reward was wanted in connection with a racket in which four Chinese nationals were arrested for purchasing pre-activated SIM cards and selling them for trading on dark web, crypto currency deals and hawala transactions. A blue corner notice was also issued for Razzak while ATS had got him declared absconder. Apart from four Chinese nationals, 22 Indians had also been arrested in the case, while Razzak had been absconding ever since the racket was busted in January 2021. IG, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy said, “Abdul Razzak in connivance with arrested Chinese nationals Xu Xunfu, Li Teng Li and the latter’s wife Yun Tai Tian uses to sell pre activated SIM cards to another Chinese, who was working as manager at a hotel in Gurugram.” The accused used to send the details to their counterparts in other parts of the world through WhatsApp and got bank accounts opened in which ‘hawala’ transactions were done later, the IG added. “We are collecting evidence of the activities of Razzak,” said Goswamy. On January 17, UP ATS had arrested 14 Indians from different districts in the state for illegal money transactions worth several lakhs of rupees after opening online accounts in banks using the SIM cards. On January 24, two Chinese nationals Xu Xunfu aka July and Li Teng Li aka Alice were arrested from Gautam Budh Nagar on red corner notice while third Chinese Sun Ji Yeng was also nabbed soon after. In February, UP ATS had arrested one Prasant Potteli from Hyderabad for assisting the three Chinese in procuring pre-activated SIM cards and making fraudulent transactions by using them. In July, BSF had arrested the fourth Chinese Junwei Han in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-nabs-fugitive-carrying-rs-1l-cash-reward-from-thane/articleshow/86467636.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Vizhinjam port project to be delayed||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Adani Group, which is undertaking the Vizhinjam container terminal project, has approached the government seeking extension of time for the completion of the project till 2023. In the discussions held between ports minister Ahammad Devarkovil with Adani Group officials here, the group has informed the minister that the project would be completed by 2023. Later, the minister and the group officials said that the government was committed to complete the project and would be completed by December 2023. The project, for which the previous UDF government had entered into an agreement with the Adani Group in 2015, was to be completed by December 2019. The concessionaire company had raised 16 disputes at different points, and had sought the extension in completion of the project by claiming the benefits of force majeure clause in the agreement. The company had raised multiple reasons like cyclone, floods, strike, Covid-19 etc as the reasons for delay in completion of the project. But these were rejected by the government. The government had entered into an agreement with M/s Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Ltd (AVPPL) for the construction of a deep-water multipurpose seaport at Vizhinjam on August 17, 2015. The scheduled day of completion of the Vizhinjam international multipurpose seaport project as per the agreement was the 1,460th day after signing the agreement, which was on December 3, 2019. However, the project could not be completed on time due to multiple reasons. In the wake of Adani Group and the state government not being able to settle their differences, the matter was referred for arbitration, which is a quasi-judicial process for settling disputes with judicial intervention. The government had appointed former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph as the arbitrator on its behalf. Though the government had requested the company to settle its differences through reconciliation talks before moving for arbitration, the Adani Group had refused to budge. It had also informed the government that if the government fails to appoint an arbitrator on its behalf, the company would approach international centre for alternate dispute resolution (ICADR) and seek appointment for an arbitrator on behalf of the government as well, under ICADR Arbitration Rules, 1996.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vizhinjam-port-project-to-be-delayed/articleshow/86462617.cms||---
---||India||No technical concern in Covishield certificate process, says UK in sign of conciliation||NEW DELHI: Under fire for keeping Covishield-vaccinated travellers from India on a par with the unvaccinated as per the country’s quarantine norms, the UK showed some conciliatory signs on Thursday with the British High Commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeting that neither side raised technical concerns on the certification processes. “Neither side (India and UK) raised technical concerns with each other’s certification process. An important step forward in our joint aim to facilitate travel and fully protect public health of the UK and India,” Eliis said, in what seemed an attempt to assuage outrage over reports that UK had issues with India’s digital vaccine certification. The High Commissioner’s tweet came after “excellent technical discussions” with R S Sharma, chairman of the empowered group for Covid-19 vaccine administration and the head of the CoWIN platform. Sharma tweeted: “Echoing his views, this will be instrumental in resuming socio-economic activities between India and UK.” Sharma, however, told TOI, “We have no information to the effect that the UK has some concerns about the certification process of our vaccination programme. Nothing of the sort has been conveyed to me by the British High Commissioner, the UK government or our ministry of external affairs.” The reports that the UK did not have a problem with the WHO-approved Covishield, but with India’s Covid vaccination certification process, intensified the row over the shot being initially out of the list of approved jabs. The India government said it will initiate reciprocal action and commentators pointed out that the CoWIN process was highly reliable with a digital signature and QR code. It was also pointed out that the UK’s vaccination had faced a security scare over reports that users could “edit” their certificates and that gaps in the application process for EU approval had hit travel to the UK. The health ministry on Thursday called the UK’s new travel policy “discriminatory” as it does not recognise those vaccinated in India even as Covishield is now on the list of approved jabs. Health secertary Rajesh Bhushan said while the two countries are in dialogue and may reach a resolution soon, India reserves the right to reciprocate in similar manner if the UK fails to recognise vaccinated Indians. “We’re clear Covishield is not a problem... We have been having detailed technical discussions regarding certification, with the builders of the CoWIN app and the NHS app, about both apps,” Ellis had said in a statement on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-technical-concern-in-covishield-certificate-process-says-uk-in-sign-of-conciliation/articleshow/86468584.cms||---
---||Nagpur||CBSE puts blockchain tech to use for academic document verification||Nagpur: Blockchain technology, made popular due to the cryptocurrency mania sweeping the world, is now being put to use for academic records verification by CBSE. Board exam marksheets of both Std X and XII will now be stored using blockchain technology with records being maintained by five separate digital registrars in three cities across the country. This project, called CBSE Academic BlockChain Documents (ABCD), has been developed in technical collaboration with Centre of Excellence for Block Chain Technology of National Informatics Centre (NIC) under ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY). Antriksh Johri, CBSE’s director of information and technology, said, “Blockchain technology ensures that academic documents are recorded in a secure and tamper proof manner. These academic documents can be accessed online in a trusted and verifiable manner. It also substantially cuts down the time for verification and results in transparent, tamper proof and paperless usage of certificate.” Blockchain technology records data in a distributed ledger with ownership of all participating stakeholders. The data is recorded in the chain based on the consensus among the stakeholders and simultaneously replicated at all the locations in the distributed network of blockchain nodes. This eliminates the dependency on a third party for verification. Johri said, “Data is linked and stored with cryptographic security so that it is immutable and traceable. The linking of the blocks in the blockchain ensures that they cannot be tampered with and the data is trustable as it can be verified across the participating stakeholders.” Upon issuance of new certificates by CBSE, the digitally signed certificates will be sent to the blockchain-based system creating an additional secure link. This network is established with nodes at Bengaluru, Pune and Jaipur. Presently, the certificate chain is managed by NIC at its data centres. CBSE started working on this project in September last year and was awaiting the 2021 exam results to launch. “As of now, we have put digital marksheets from 2019-21 and will continue to load previous years’ documents as well,” said Johri. The central board’s IT team has had their hands full this calendar year, with the biggest project being to develop a portal for schools to upload Std X and XII marks online as physical exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. Johri said, “Within three days, we were able to develop the software and put it online for schools to use.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbse-puts-blockchain-tech-to-use-for-academic-document-verification/articleshow/86464929.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Guv sent back OBC ordinance due to discrepancies: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Coming to the rescue of Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is under fire from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents for returning the OBC reservation ordinance, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday backed his move clarifying that it had “some discrepancies”. “The governor rightly sent the ordinance, as it would have been stayed by the court due to discrepancies. The file was sent to him without the opinion of the Law and Justice Department. The government then made corrections and resend it to him,” Fadnavis told media after his arrival in city. Resending ordinance is the latest topic of friction between the MVA government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Koshyari. Both constitutional authorities are already at loggerheads over several issues, including appointment of 12 MLCs. Recently, both sparred over Koshyari’s call to the government to convene a special assembly session on women’s’ safety in the backdrop of a series of rape incidents. Thackeray countered him by stating that he should advise Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah to convene a special session of Parliament considering similar crimes in the BJP ruled states and also in Delhi. Speaking on Dombivli gang rape case, the former CM indirectly flayed Thackeray terming his finger pointing towards other states as “insensitive”. “Due to today’s incident, the issue of women’s safety has come to the fore again. Such heart-wrenching incidents of violence where over two dozen perpetrators raped a lonely woman are worrying. It shows, the state’s law and order situation is in a very poor state and the government needs to immediately take strict action to prevent recurrence of such crimes. The authorities should introspect on their failure to prevent repeated crimes against the women.” On various speculations surrounding his meeting with revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat and MPCC chief Nana Patole, the South-west Nagpur MLA clarified that they had come to request him to allow forthcoming Rajya Sabha bypolls unopposed. “I told them that any decision in this regard would be taken by the core committee along with BJP state president. As speculated, no talks were held regarding suspension of 12 BJP MLAs. We will fight both inside and outside the court for revoking their illegal suspension,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/guv-sent-back-obc-ordinance-due-to-discrepancies-fadnavis/articleshow/86464971.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Pune||Monsoon comeback: 2 weather systems to bring more rain to Maharashtra from Sunday||PUNE: More rain is in store for parts of Maharashtra in the next few days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an isolated heavy rain warning courtesy two systems. An upper air cyclonic circulation over South Chhattisgarh and another cyclonic circulation over Telangana and its neighbourhood, and moderately strong westerlies over the Konkan region will bring heavy showers. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune told TOI that the influence of these systems along with an upcoming low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, will cause a quick comeback of the monsoon to Maharashtra, especially in conjunction with moderately strong westerly winds. “From Friday, rainfall activity in the state will reduce. However, from Sunday evening, rain activity will start increasing again for a short period. Monsoon is likely to be vigorous in Maharashtra from September 27 onwards,” Kashyapi said. Another system that would aid the upcoming vigorous stint is an imminent low pressure area. According to IMD, a cyclonic circulation over the Myanmar coast and adjoining Gulf of Martaban is extending up to mid-tropospheric levels. “This system is likely to move north-westwards and emerge in Northeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a low pressure area is likely to form over the same region around September 24 evening. This low pressure is likely to move west-northwestwards towards Odisha coast during the subsequent 48 hours,” he said. This will further help rainfall increase over Maharashtra. An IMD forecast on Thursday stated that heavy rainfall at isolated places was likely over Konkan-Goa and Madhya Maharashtra on September 26. Sunday and Monday could also see thunderstorms and lightning in Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada, among other locations in India. Squally weather with a wind speed of 40-50 kmph to gusts of 60 kmph is also likely over the south-west and west-central Arabian Sea, Gulf of Mannar and Comorin area on Sunday. Fishermen have been advised not to venture out to sea. On September 27 too, heavy rainfall at isolated places have been forecast over all the four regions of Konkan-Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha. Kashyapi said both Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada will see subdued rain till September 25, but it will pick up there after from September 26 evening for a couple of days. Nashik, Pune and Satara are on an alert for thunderstorm with lightning, gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated places in ghats areas for September 26-27. ‘Yellow’ alert for half the districts in Marathwada The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday issued “yellow” alert for half of the districts, incuding Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli and Latur, in the rain-battered Marathwada region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-comeback-2-weather-systems-to-bring-more-rain-to-state-from-sunday/articleshow/86464980.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kochi||CB issues notice to state BJP prez to produce mobile phone||Kozhikode: The Kasaragod district crime branch team probing the Manjeshwaram election bribery case against BJP state president K Surendran has issued a notice asking him to produce his mobile phone, which the police think is crucial evidence in the case. Surendran had reportedly told the police when he appeared before questioning in connection with the case on September 16 that the mobile phone in question was not in his possession. But the crime branch team, with the help of cyber cell, has found that the mobile phone has been in use in recent days following which it has issued a notice to Surendran to produce it. The investigation team has also found that there were contradictions in the statements given by Surendran during his interrogation. They have found that his claim that he had not stayed at the hotel at Thalippadappu, where the nomination withdrawal forms of namesake candidate K Sundara were prepared, was not correct. Meanwhile, police have included six more BJP leaders and activists as accused in the case along which Surendran under 171 B (bribery involving giving a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 E section of IPC. Surendran told media persons on Thursday that police had recorded false statements in connection with the case and asked how his phone has become relevant in the case. Sundara, who filed his nomination as BSP’s candidate, had in his statement told the police that he was given Rs 2.5 lakh and a smartphone by BJP leaders to withdraw his nomination. He had also told the police that local BJP leaders came to his house at Vaninagar, took him to the party office at Jodkkal, where he was threatened to withdraw his nomination in March. He had reiterated before the police that he was promised money and a wine shop if Surendran won the election. He had added that Surendran called him and gave an assurance. Sundara had contested as an independent candidate in 2016 assembly elections and secured 467 votes. Surendran lost the polls by 89 votes. Surendran was questioned on September 16 by the crime branch team probing the case at Kasaragod guest house for 75 minutes. Surendran is learnt to have told the police that the allegations of payment of money to Sundara, the namesake candidate to withdraw his candidature were false and that he didn't know Sundara personally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-issues-notice-to-state-bjp-prez-to-produce-mobile-phone/articleshow/86464994.cms||---

---||Delhi||Missed one heartbeat too many? You must see a doctor||NEW DELHI: Heart palpitations are one of the common health concerns. But, in the majority of cases, we ignore them because they are known to occur when we are stressed or anxious. However, cardiologists say, if the palpitations continue for a longer period and even when a person is not under stress, it may be a sign of some abnormality that needs medical attention. Recently, doctors at Delhi PSRI hospital said they came across a 58-year-old man who had been having heart palpitations for three to four years. “The patient came to the hospital only when he started having breathing difficulty also,” Dr Amitabh Yaduvanshi, head of invasive cardiology and electrophysiology at PSRI hospital, said. Imaging tests showed that instead of the heartbeats arising from the upper right chamber and following a certain trajectory to spread to the heart (as is in a healthy person), in this case, there was additional heartbeats to the extent that every third of his heartbeat was arising from an abnormal site, the Left Ventricular (LV) Summit. It is rare, occurring in about four per cent of the cases of Ventricular Premature Complexes in which extra heartbeats arise from one of the heart’s two lower pumping chambers. “The extra heartbeat was putting pressure on the heart. If the patient had delayed visiting the hospital any further, it may have led to heart failure,” Dr Yaduvanshi said. The doctors conducted a procedure in which radiofrequency energy (similar to microwave heat) is used to destroy a small area of heart tissue that is causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. An advanced electro-anatomical mapping system was used to identify the site of origin of the abnormal beat, Dr Yaduvanshi said. “The palpitations or missed beats are common symptoms, but in some cases, it may be due to abnormalities in the heart. Abnormal heart beating should not be ignored.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/missed-one-heartbeat-too-many-you-must-see-a-doc/articleshow/86467029.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Lucknow||Former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav quotes RBI data to question govt’s claims||LUCKNOW: Armed with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data which reflects that Uttar Pradesh registered one of the lowest per capita income growth during the present BJP regime as compared to the national average and a sharp decline from the Samajwadi Party tenure (2013-17), former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday tore into the ruling BJP for misleading people with claims of providing record employment, growth and development. The SP national president quoted performance of the five poll bound states from statistics released by the RBI which show that the per capita income growth rate of Uttar Pradesh between 2013 and 2017 when Akhilesh Yadav was the CM was five per cent as compared to a national average of 5.5 per cent. However, during the financial years 2018-20 (pre-Covid) it came down to three per cent, which was 1.6 per cent below the national average. As per statistics quoted by the SP chief, the corresponding figures for 2018-2022 forecast a disheartening scenario with per capita growth going down to 1.8 per cent as compared to the national average of 2.7 per cent. “During the BJP regime the per capita income has been reduced to one-third. Manifold rise in prices of essential commodities and reduction in interest rates on deposits have only worsened the situation. Now, the BJP should explain if these were the ‘achche din’ (good days) that the party promised before elections,” Akhilesh said. The SP went on to question claims of the BJP government regarding record employment to youths and the poor. “Either the RBI statistics are computed incorrectly or the state government is lying. Both claims which contradict each other cannot go together,” said a senior SP leader. He said the statistics established beyond doubt that the state was on a ‘real’ growth track during the Akhilesh regime. “The growth was inching close to the national average which proves that the state’s economy was on the right path then,” he said, adding that now after coming to power in the state next year the SP would definitely walk an extra mile to push the growth figures to where they were during Akhilesh’s previous regime and improve it further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-quotes-rbi-data-to-question-govts-claims/articleshow/86467647.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||After 30-year wait, PDA beginsprocess to give land to allottees||ALREADY PUBLISHED Prayagraj: As part of its unique scheme ‘Mission Sangam’ to fulfill the unfulfilled dreams of the people running from pillar to post to get the possession of land allotted to them for more than three decades, the Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) has finally shortlisted 415 people who would be benefited under the initiative. A brainchild of new vice-chairman of PDA, Arvind Chauhan, the process to take the scheme to its logical conclusion has begun at PDA, officials said. Early this month, PDA has come up with this unique scheme, ‘Mission Sangam’, following which the authorities have identified 415 individuals who were allotted land by the PDA but they failed to get the possession for various reasons. These individuals would be given a new piece of land. PDA, in its drive against land mafias in the past over one year, has freed around 600 plots which will come handy when allotting the same to those who have not been given possession of land allotted to them around 30 years back. Now, the list of these individuals has been uploaded on the PDA website, www.pdaprayagraj.in and could be viewed by allottees. “Now that the list of 415 individuals has been uploaded by us, the individuals concerned can either give their consent for getting the land that PDA has to offer or get their money back with interest if they so decide,” said the VDA V-C. The official further informed TOI that for the redressal of the complaint, if any, of the allottees, an ‘integrated command centre’ (ICC) has been set up at the 8th floor of PDA building, Indira Bhawan, in Civil Lines. Moreover, if any individual has any objection to the uploaded list or wants to inform the PDA about at error, the same can be done by sending a mail to PDA at aldda@rediffmail.com The PDA has also made it clear that the fresh piece of land that would be given to the allottees, could be less or more than the land allotted earlier. The allottee has to bear the cost incurred against cancelling the earlier registry of land and getting the new piece of land registered in their name. Adhering to complete transparency, the process of change of plots will be done through lottery on the scheduled date which would be informed through publication in the authority website and newspaper. After the change, the final list will be displayed on the authority website and pasted on the information board for the perusal of the people and the change letter will be sent by registered post, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/after-30-year-wait-pda-beginsprocess-to-give-land-to-allottees/articleshow/86467035.cms||---

The labels on them were intact. They were used on different dates in the last week of August and first week of September. Although we find waste dumped here, medical waste was dumped for the first time. Officials should take action against those behind it.” Waste dumping happens at night as the stretch is poorly lit, said K Chandru, a passerby. “Anti-social elements visit the place to consume liquor. Women avoid the stretch at night due to their presence. Residents dump waste in the drainage passing through the stretch. As waste blocks the drainage, bad smell emanates from it, causing inconvenience to motorists,” he said.An official of the health wing of the corporation said that they are trying to find the hospital from where the waste originated from the batch number on the vials. “Action would be initiated against those responsible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/med-waste-dumped-on-syrian-church-street/articleshow/86467036.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Governors like rogue elephants, alleges Saamna||MUMBAI: Taking a dig at governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna said on Thursday that governors in non-BJP-ruled states were playing the role of rogue elephants under the control of mahouts from New Delhi. The Sena said these “rogue elephants” were “trampling democracy.” “Such elephants trample democracy, federal structures, laws and political culture. But they must remember that the Central government, the Prime Minister, belongs to the entire country, even though the state governments may not be from the same party. Just destabilising those states amounts to creating a rift in national unity. What is happening is Maharashtra is nothing but destabilising the state,” Saamna alleged. Attacking the Centre, Saamna said democracy wouldn’t be sustained by building a new Parliament complex but it would if the Centre paid attention to the cries of state governments. The editorial said governors were “not just white elephants living off the expenses of the state” but “agents of the Centre” and alleged that governors were “given a free hand to destabilise state governments.” The Sena questioned why governors in BJP-ruled states didn’t speak about issues like rising crimes against women and law and order. Without naming anyone, the Sena said that in non-BJP-ruled states, BJP leaders who carry out mudslinging against the state government are rewarded with Z-plus security cover by the Centre. “Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari has expressed his concerns over the safety of women and the law and order scenario here. But why is this concern not expressed by the governors of Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh? Have those governors killed their sensitivity? If they raise concerns, thousands of women across the country will get justice. It is binding on the governor to carry out the duties laid down in the Constitution. But how fair is it that the governor sitting in Raj Bhavan is trying to destabilise the very government that was given the oath of office by him? Because of such activities, the federal structure of the country is collapsing,” Saamna wrote. On Tuesday, a letter war had erupted between CM Uddhav Thackeray and Koshyari over the Sakinaka rape and murder. After the governor wrote to him suggesting a 2-day session of the legislature to discuss atrocities against women, Thackeray listed crimes in BJP-ruled states and urged the governor to write to PM Modi to call for a 4-day session of Parliament to discuss the crimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/governors-like-rogue-elephants-alleges-saamna/articleshow/86467692.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Chennai||Aavin to install cloud-based cooling centres in 17 districts||Chennai: Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation (TCMPF) plans to install cloud-based Bulk Milk Cooling centres (BMC) in 17 districts to improve storage and quality of raw milk before it is sent to dairies for processing. This cloud-based system allows TCMPF to not only monitor milk quality but also quantity, pricing and temperature control. At present, collection centres have weighing machines and analysers, but data from these equipment is manually keyed into the system, giving room for human errors especially given the quantity of milk Aavin handles a day. On average, Aavin procures about 38 lakh litres to 40 lakh litres of milk a day, data showed. With cloud-based BMCs, the whole data entry and monitoring process is automated. All the supplier needs to do is place the can on the weighing machine. The bill is automatically generated and the same is reflected on the digital screen. Similarly, staff deployed at the BMC will take a small sample of raw milk from the can and place it on the analyser stand. The fat percentage, lactometer reading (LR), and Solid Not Fat (SNF) percentage readings are displayed on a separate screen. This would help Aavin ensure that only quality milk reaches dairies. In 2019, the state said 350 BMCs will be installed at Rs 1.75 crore. But the State Policy Development Council (erstwhile planning commission) has sanctioned Rs 63 lakh for 50 BMCs. The council also recommended that TCMPF lease necessary equipment instead of purchasing them. This led to the supplier pulling out of the project citing financial reasons. But the federation clarified with the council that purchasing the eqipment and leasing them would cost about the same. Tenders are likely to be released for this project later this month, said a senior Aavin official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aavin-to-install-cloud-based-cooling-centres-in-17-districts/articleshow/86462887.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||UP to develop Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit in Vindhyas||Lucknow: The images from the epic Hindi novel ‘Chandrakanta Santati’ will be brought to life with the state government developing and promoting the Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit in Vindhya region of UP. ‘Chandrakanta Santati’, written by Babu Devki Nandan Khatri in 1880s, weaves a tale of fantasy, magic and mesmerising ‘aiyaars’, besides the captivating love story of Vijaygarh princess Chandrakanta and Naugarh prince Virendra Singh. Many of its imprints are traced to Chandauli and Sonbhadra districts though a few of them are in shambles and need restoration like the Vijaygarh fort. Being a popular novel, Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit would draw a good number of tourists. “We are getting brochures printed that will tell in detail what all sites the circuit has. There would be other efforts as well that will be taken up to promote and develop the circuit,” said MD, UP Forest Corporation (UPFC), Sanjay Singh. UPFC is the nodal agency for promotion of ecotourism in the state. The Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit has several sites in Chandauli, Sonbhadra and Robertsganj districts which bear a historical connection. To begin with, there are Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls on the Chandraprabha dam on the river with the same name in the state’s oldest wildlife sanctuary, the Chandraprabha wildlife sanctuary which was declared in 1957, in Chandauli. The waterfalls are about 65km from Varanasi and are perennial. The site has quite a few facilities existing for tourists besides a forest rest house. Moving beyond, there is a Chandrakanta van vishram grih (forest rest house) which finds mention in the ‘Chandrakanta Santati’. At one point in history, it was also the resting quarter of ‘Kashi Naresh’. It’s a fort lying in the Naugarh region along the Karmanasa river and about 18kms from Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls. The Aurwatand waterfall on Karmanasa river lying in the dense forest in Chandauli with rock paintings that date back to prehistoric era, about 25km from Rajdari-Devdari waterfalls, is another ecotourism site on the Vindhya circuit. One of the biggest attractions of the circuit, however, would be a 400 feet high Vijaygarh fort built in the fifth century by a Kol King in the Maukalan village of Sonbhadra which, at present, is in a dilapidated state. It has a huge pond on its backside which is a water reservoir. It is situated about 40km from Chandrakanta forest rest house. The Salkhan fossil park in Robertsganj which is about 1,400 million years old and about 25kms from Vijaygarh fort will be no less an attraction for nature enthusiasts. The most developed circuit out of the nine that the government has identified is the Lakhimpur-Pilibhit-Katarniaghat circuit. The other one where the effort to boost ecotourism has already started is the Agra-Etawah circuit. The Chandrakanta ecotourism circuit in the Vindhya region is the third. These circuits have ecotourism going on already but the government’s promotional bids will boost the activity, attract private investment and entrepreneurs and make it a profitable venture for the stakeholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-develop-chandrakanta-ecotourism-circuit-in-vindhyas/articleshow/86467674.cms||Neha Shukla

Nagalakshmi did not like the marriage and always harboured a grudge against her son-in-law. Meanwhile, Nandhini gave birth to Saikrishna, who is now four years old, and Durgesh.”Due to differences of opinion, the officer said, Nandhini had separated from Nithyanandam eight months ago and moved into her mother’s house along with the youngest son, while leaving the elder son with her estranged husband.As her mother was unwell for the past couple of days, the officer said, Nandhini had taken up her mother’s job at the hotel on a temporary basis. “When she returned from work on Tuesday around 9.30pm, Nandhini inquired her mother about her son, as he wasn’t seen around.

Later, he held a high-level meeting to discuss the ongoing railway projects. Gangal told TOI, “The Rishikesh-Karnaprayag broad gauge-single track is the toughest route which is under progress. Work is going on at a brisk pace and we expect the project to be completed by the end of 2024.” He further said, "The 125 km distance from Rishikesh to Karnaprayag has to take the rail track. While 90% of the route is covered in tunnels. This is rare in India. So, the work is difficult." The proposed 125-km stretch will have 12 stations, 35 bridges to be built at an estimated cost of Rs 16,200 crore. Earlier in the day, Gangal along with other senior officials inspected the Motichur rail station. The station had been electrified recently.

The petition, filed by residents of several villages in the Gaula Par area of Haldwani, argues that their fields have repeatedly been damaged by wild elephants and Neelgais which enter the villages in hordes and wreak havoc. The petitioners added that many of them had taken loans on the crops but the damage has put most of them under crushing debts. Speaking to TOI, advocate Anil Anthwal, who appeared for the petitioners said that the locals made several complaints to the local officials as well as the state government but no action was taken. “The villagers asked the authorities to put up fences or at least dig pits so that the animals do not enter their fields but the authorities took no action,” he said. “The inaction on the part of respondent authorities is illegal and improper, therefore, the respondent authorities are liable to be directed to take appropriate action for raising fencing and digging pits so that the wildlife may be prevented from entering in the fields of the villagers and causing damages to the crops of the villagers,” read the petition, a copy of which is available with TOI. Meanwhile, the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma issued notices to the state government and forest department. The court has given the respondents three weeks to respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-in-hc-alleges-farmers-suffering-crop-damage-because-of-animal-attacks-demand-compensation/articleshow/86462897.cms||Prashant Jha

The OGWs are those who usually assist militants or terrorists with logistics. The father and son duo had recently returned from Kashmir, the official added. Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh confirmed the raids and the two suspects were identified as Mohammed Shameem Salmani and his son Parvez Salmani. The operation was conducted after receiving inputs from J&K. They will be handed over to the J&K police, a source in the ATS said. According to the official, Shameem's relative had been running a salon in Srinagar for several years. He was caught by the Army recently with weapons allegedly supplied by Shameem and Parvez. On Thursday, a senior official in the Indian Army said, “On the basis of inputs received from Anantnag regarding the presence of anti-national elements (ANE), a joint operation was launched by military intelligence unit and ATS Bareilly to apprehend two ANEs. During questioning, the accused confessed to having supplied a 7.62 mm auto pistol and six live RDS to a likely OGW on September 17.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/father-son-duo-held-in-joint-raid-in-bijnor/articleshow/86462914.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Nainital's Thandi Sadak struck by landslides again||Nainital: Following heavy rains on Wednesday, Thandi Sadak area in Nainital, a popular spot for locals and tourists, was once again struck by landslides which continued through the night till Thursday. The landslides washed away the temporary retention walls and other arrangements made by the district administration to repair the affected area. The fresh landslides also damaged the girls’ hostel located on the hill with its floors developing cracks. Locals were once again asked to not visit the area as there were still chances of rocks falling from the hills. This comes after geologists warned that the landslide on Thandi Sadak is not a one-off incident but part of a faultline that has been activated in Nainital. “This is what I have been telling the authorities that once a faultline is active, you cannot treat it with makeshift arrangements. We need smart planning and mitigation measures but warnings have not been taken seriously by the administration,” said BS Kotlia, the geologist who was asked by the district administration to suggest ways for treating the landslide at Thandi Sadak. Even then Kotlia had said that temporary arrangements at the affected sites won’t help and a more permanent solution like the ones done at dams is needed to prevent further landslides. The district administration, meanwhile, said it will soon make efforts to clear the stretch and come up with a solution. “Since Thandi Sadak is still an active zone we are not repairing the stretch as yet. However, once the rains stop, we will treat the area. A robust solution will be derived so that a permanent solution is made for the area,” said an official of the district administration. The Thandi Sadak area in Nainital has been affected by landslides since August. The area has been hit by landslides at least four times in the last few weeks. The administration then asked a few geologists to come up with solutions. Earlier, landslides were also witnessed near Governor’s house in the Lake Town, the Nainital Bhowali Road and Haldwani-Nainital Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nainitals-thandi-sadak-struck-by-landslides-again/articleshow/86462879.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Nagpur||After 21 yrs, Morris College T-point to Inst of Sci road becomes reality||Nagpur: Some 21 years after it was planned, the road connecting Morris College T-point Square to Institute of Science in Civil Lines has been developed and opened for traffic. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is planning to allow walking, cycling and fitness activities on this new road in specified timings in morning and evening. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, and RTMNU vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari inaugurated the new road on Wednesday. Tiwari said, “Road will benefit citizens. The road passes below Metro Rail station at Morris College T-point. MahaMetro was to construct road below Metro Rail station. Despite many reminders, MahaMetro has not completed top layer of the road. We have given it ultimatum of Thursday morning.” The road was approved in city’s development plan (DP) implemented in 2000. There was a narrow road connecting Ravindranath Tagore Road (Maharajbagh Square to WCL Rest House Square to Akashwani Square Road), from near the entrance gate of Institute of Science till Morris College T-point. The civic body had proposed to develop the road in 2012. NMC managed to get land from RTMNU, Institute of Science, BSNL, Mure Memorial Hospital, and Veterinary Polyclinic for the project. With a length of 615 meter, the road has been developed with a width of 18 meter at a cost of Rs4.65 crore, including road-divider and footpath. A highlight of the road is that NMC had already planted half grown trees on both sides. With greenery on two sides, the road has a pleasant look. A new bridge has been constructed on a nullah. Also, the civic body has constructed compound wall along some part of the road. NMC officials said traffic on Amravati Road from RTMNU Square to Variety Square to Morris College T-point will reduce due to the new road. Vehicles coming from Amravati Road and heading towards railway station or Loha Pul currently come via Variety square. Now, these vehicles can pass through the new road and vice versa. Also, vehicles going from Civil Lines to railway station to Loha Pul can also use new road, which will ease congestion on three roads in Civil Lines. NMC sources said there is a plan to allow walking, fitness activities and cycling on the new road for a couple of hours every morning and evening, along the lines of Old Airport Road or Walkers Street. “The road is new and in pollution-free environment. Many people are already using the road for walking and fitness activities during the construction of the road. Therefore, traffic will be prohibited for select hours to allow walking, cycling and fitness activities,” sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-21-yrs-morris-college-t-point-to-inst-of-sci-road-becomes-reality/articleshow/86465173.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Drink up fast, your Aavin milk has a short shelf life||CHENNAI: Transportation delays and inadequate cold chains for milk taken from source to processing units have reduced the shelf life and quality of Aavin milk, an audit report of the state’s largest milk production unit showed. The report released last week in coordination with state-owned Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation (TCMPF) collected 10,295 milk samples from cooperative societies in eight districts. The samples were subjected to Methylene Blue Reduction Test — a standard method for bacteriological analysis of milk — to check quality of milk before it is pasteurised. While good quality milk takes five hours or more to get decolourised, milk of fair or poor quality gets decolourised within two hours. Upon testing TN samples, analysts found that at least 51% of milk changed colour within 30 minutes and the rest in an hour or two. The inferior quality was blamed on transportation delays and inadequate milk cooling equipment. As per standard practice, milk collected at village-level cooperative societies is sent to nearby Bulk Milk Coolers (BMCs) for intermediate cooling before it is sent to dairies for processing. Food analysts say milk should reach BMCs in an hour. But in most parts of TN, transportation takes at least three hours. As a result, raw milk is exposed to atmospheric variations triggering bacterial multiplication. This in turn affects milk quality despite pasteurization, where raw milk is exposed to high temperatures to kill pathogens. Pasteurization, analysts say, will be less effective if the bacterial count is above 30,000/ml of milk. “When (such) milk is processed and sold, the shelf life is reduced and it may get spoiled when heated within six to eight hours after sale,” said an Aavin official. TCMPF received 175 BMCs till December 2019 and installed only 53 till June 2020. The remaining could not be installed due to incomplete civil work at sites, it said. There were other problems at the procurement stage too, such as multiple delays owing to cancellation and revision of tenders, Board Level Tender Committee (BLTC) approval, non-finalisation of commercial negotiation and staff shortage. These delays led to the Centre cutting grants under National Programme for Dairy Development. The federation in response attributed the delay to the pandemic. There are up to 400 BMCs in TN so far. When contacted, T Sadagopan of TN Progressive Consumer Centre said Aavin would conduct public awareness camps earlier on milk quality. But, today, such camps are hardly ever organised. “We see the food safety department taking action against roadside shops for providing poor quality food. But why are they hesitant in acting against such brands,” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/drink-up-fast-your-aavin-milk-has-a-short-shelf-life/articleshow/86462946.cms||Ram Sundaram

Though most of the buses are back on roads, many are still parked in open places with weeds growing inside. Public are still scared to travel by bus and they choose private vehicles instead causing severe traffic congestion on roads. “Around 70-75% of private buses are back on roads. But the rest of the buses are yet to be made operational because the vehicles require a huge amount as repairing cost. I had to shell out Rs 1.75 lakh to repair my bus in December last year. It conducted service only for one month and has been in the shed since January. Income from operating bus is negligible and diesel prices are too high. We cannot introduce any schemes since the sector is in a pathetic condition,” said Kerala private bus operators’ federation president of M B Sathyan. While vehicles plying under tours and travels plan to introduce many schemes to bring back customers. “There is an uptick in domestic tourism. But that is not enough to sustain the sector. We plan to introduce many schemes to lure customers and a decision regarding this will be taken at the executive committee meeting in October. We encourage drivers to operate only non-air-conditioned vehicles to prevent Covid infection,” said Travel Operators’ Association president M S Anil Kumar. He also said the association intends to make short videos on Covid protocols and introduce hanging display boards on social distancing and other rules to be followed, in vehicles. KSRTC officials said that after the introduction of bus-on-demand (BOND) service, no new scheme has been introduced to bring more passengers to the buses. “Our current daily income comes to around Rs 7.5-Rs 8 lakh. We used to get around Rs 13 lakh per day in the pre-pandemic period,” says district transport officer Thajudeen Sahib V M. The Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) currently has no plan to introduce any schemes to lure passengers back to the public transport sector. “We took certain decisions like rationalization of bus routes, and have conducted a study regarding allowing buses from Vypeen to the city. A lot of work needs to be done by the authority for the revival of the sector,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/public-transport-sector-yet-to-find-a-path-to-recovery/articleshow/86465159.cms||T C Sreemol

It required 22 votes to pass the no-confidence motion. But only 18 councillors of the opposition LDF turned up to vote. UDF councillors stayed away from voting. LDF moved the no-confidence motion after the Onam kit gift row erupted against Thankappan last month. “The district Congress committee (DCC) managed to settle the displeasure among certain Congress councillors. They were given assurance that Thankappan would be replaced from the chairperson’s post. If the DCC is not ready to do so, the Congress councillors would support us if we move another no-confidence motion against the chairperson after six months,” said a LDF councillor. A UDF councillor said the party could sail through the test thanks to the support of all 25 councillors. He acknowledged that there were complaints that meetings were not held with all UDF councillors over many matters. “The question of replacing Thankappan has not been raised in any circumstances,” he said. However, Thankappan told the media soon after the no-confidence motion failed to pass, that she would act according to the DCC directive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-trust-motion-against-udf-fails/articleshow/86465192.cms||---

While Covid-19 graph has steeply declined, cases of high grade fever, seasonal flu and vector-borne diseases have shot up. Many patients are showing symptoms of dengue and scrub typhus at the same time, doctors from private hospitals said. As per the official data, 48 samples were reported to the health officials in each of the six districts in Nagpur division. But only three including one death in Gondia from the zoonotic disease has been confirmed. The highest were 22 in Nagpur district where 11 suspected scrub typhus cases each in Nagpur city and rural were reported. Of these, only one was found positive through the confirmatory ELISA test. Internal medicine expert Dr Mohan Nerker, who is a director of Seven Star Hospital, said around four patients are admitted with them. “Most of the patients are from rural parts and Madhya Pradesh. Those from MP have high titer ratio. We prefer IgM tests. The MP patients are brought in critical state. Some suffer from both dengue and scrub and even hepatitis A. Dr Harshvardha Bora, critical care expert at Kingsway Hospital, too said patients of the zoonotic disease are more from MP. “Every week some patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ failure are brought here. If diagnosis is missed, they go in to multi-organ failure,” he said.  Dr Shyam Nimgade, assistant director of health services (malaria), agreed that scrub typhus suspected cases could be more but in ELISA confirmatory tests, only 3 were found positive. “We collect samples of symptomatic patients and those testing positive in rapid tests. We don’t add residents of other districts in Nagpur division’s tally. There is no point in adding them here. The reporting is to alert local authorities which is done through GMCH. Nagpur being medical hub for most of the major diseases many patients come here,” he said. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist at Alexis Hospital, said, “Scrub is a seasonal disease striking during July to November each year. This is gross underrepoting. I must have treated around 50 patients of the disease this season. Scrub is mainly rural disease. Symptoms are non specific and patients can die due to lack of diagnosis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/several-cases-of-scrub-typhus-but-official-data-show-only-3-in-division/articleshow/86465239.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Noida||‘Construction sites flout rules, but no action yet’||Noida: A group of residents have flagged several violations of pollution norms at construction sites in the city and written to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), seeking its intervention. The residents alleged they hadn’t received any response from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board despite several tweets on the violations. “Winters are approaching and every year, we deal with toxic air levels. There are hardly 15-20 days of good air. However, there doesn’t seem to be any action on the violations at construction sites. Dust is a huge problem at most of these sites. They are neither covered nor is water sprinkled there,” said Amit Gupta, the complainant and member of the Progressive Community Foundation. Gupta further said that contractors of the Noida Authority had damaged several roads. “They simply dig up the road for repairing pipelines and other maintenance work and leave it in that condition for days. Mechanical sweeping is only done on paper. We hardly get to see these machines,” he added. UPPCB officials in Noida said checks were done every time they received a complaint and violators were fined too for causing air pollution. Sources said UPPCB was short-staffed and had been working at half its capacity for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/construction-sites-flout-rules-but-no-action-yet/articleshow/86467112.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Congress netas meet Devendra Fadnavis to seek ‘unopposed’ RS bypoll||MUMBAI: State revenue minister and senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat and state Congress president Nana Patole on Thursday unexpectedly knocked at the doors of leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis at his official residence to press their proposal for unopposed elections to the Rajya Sabha on October 4. Thorat and Patole urged Fadnavis to withdraw the nomination of BJP candidate Sanjay Upadhyaya so that there would be no contest and Congress nominee Rajani Patil could be elected unopposed. Fadnavis was non-committal, saying the proposal would be placed before the senior leaders as well as the core committee of the BJP. Asked by mediapersons if there was any agreement between MVA and BJP over revoking the suspension of 12 BJP legislators, Fadnavis made it clear that there was no deal. “We never indulge in such tactics. Thorat and Patole met me for unopposed election to the Rajya Sabha, and the matter will be placed before the core committee and a decision will be taken,” Fadnavis said. The RS by-election has been necessitated by the death of Congress leader Rajiv Satav. It was expected that the Congress would nominate Satav’s wife Pragnya, but Congress president Sonia Gandhi nominated former MP Rajani Patil. Along with Pragnya, more than a dozen senior Congress leaders had been vying for the Rajya Sabha seat. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik felt that the BJP would accept the proposal and pave the way for the unanimous election of Rajani Patil to the Rajya Sabha. In the past too, on several occasions, one of the political parties had withdrawn their official nominee to facilitate unopposed election, he said. “Maharashtra has a high tradition in politics, and I am sure BJP will follow it and support the candidature of Rajani Patil,” Malik added. Thorat too was confident that Fadnavis would accept the proposal in the larger interest of democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-netas-meet-fadnavis-to-seek-unopposed-rs-bypoll/articleshow/86467151.cms||---

---||Meerut||Man who shot at constable in Baghpat held after encounter, lawyers cry foul||Meerut: Two weeks after a constable was shot at and left for dead by unidentified men on the outskirts of Baghpat, police have arrested a man after an “encounter” and claimed that he carried out the attack as he wanted to “befriend” the cop’s wife. However, local lawyers were not convinced with the police theory and claimed that the man police had picked up was a tea seller who had no criminal record. Constable Arun Kumar was shot at by unidentified men on September 8 while he was on his way for night duty in 112 emergency service. Police said that the accused, Kiran Pal Singh, has confessed to the crime and also said that he wanted to “befriend” the constable’s wife. He claimed that the constable and his wife were not on good terms. After being shot at, Kumar --who is still in hospital-- had called up Baghpat SP to tell him that he had been shot at by unidentified men. The attack had taken place on the city outskirts and there was no CCTV camera there, due to which police was initially clueless about the criminal and the motive behind the attack. According to SP Baghpat, Neeraj Jadaun, “Ever since the constable was shot at, we had been gathering evidence. We also questioned the constable’s wife and this angle came to light. We had been on the lookout for Kiranpal since then.” “Kiranpal landed into the police net accidentally, when a tip-off that a few criminals were present in a locality led the team cordon off the area. After the encounter, a criminal was shot in the leg. He was later identified as Kiranpal,” the SP said. Police are now trying to track the criminal record of Kiranpal, who is admitted in a hospital due to his bullet injury. Meanwhile, lawyers in Bagpat district court protested outside the SSP office on Thursday demanding immediate release of Kiranpal and action against the policemen who shot at him. According to the complaints of the lawyers, Kiranpal was a tea seller in Baghpat court premises and police were trying to frame him in a fake case. “I don’t think Kiranpal can commit such a crime. He is innocent and is being tortured in police custody,” alleged Somendra Dhaka, a lawyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-who-shot-at-constable-in-baghpat-held-after-encounter-lawyers-cry-foul/articleshow/86462993.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||Schools’ association questions ‘free uniform’ expenditure||Nagpur: A schools’ association has questioned the need for expenditure of over Rs 200 crore for school uniforms by the state government, saying that “most of the schools are closed”. Free books and uniforms are distributed in government-run schools. RTE Foundation, a Nagpur-based association, said the state government needs to come clean on expenditure of such magnitude. Sachin Kalbande, founder-president of the organization, said, “The state government says there 36 lakh beneficiaries and for them an amount of approximately Rs 216 crore has been earmarked. But where is the transparency here? Are we sure that so many students will be attending school this year? In fact there are so many places (urban) where the government itself has banned reopening of schools.” RTE Foundation has collected vast amount of data through the Right To Information (RTI) filings based on which their president Kalbande has started questioning the expenditure patterns of the state government. Earlier, his focus was mostly on RTE reimbursements to private schools as Kalbande tallied expenditure sheets of Central government grants and those of the state to point out certain lapses. Kalbande said, “I have now got access (through RTI) to last 10 years’ balance sheet of the education department and my audit team is scanning every entry. The first thing that really jumped at me was the money being spent on uniforms. It’s a good cause and I hope that the government continues to provide uniforms to all the needy students. But I have my doubts whether every beneficiary is getting it or not.” He said free uniform is given under two categories. “The first is for girls. Every girl child studying in a government school (municipal corporation, zilla parishad etc) will get two sets of uniform free of cost. The second is for boys, but not all of them. Only those falling under certain categories are given the free uniform,” said Kalbande. RTE Foundation is now focussing on how the payments are made and how the accontability protocol works. “As of now, the school management committee gets the money and they ensure that their students are given free uniforms. Approximately Rs 600 per student is the grant, so how is the government ensuring that everyone is getting access to it,” said Kalbande. In the coming few weeks, Kalbande’s team aims to finish scanning all entries in the balance sheet. “Then we will take this thing forward and start asking them questions on an official platform,” said Kalbande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-association-questions-free-uniform-expenditure/articleshow/86465285.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The workers — Raju Sagathiya (35), Shivanand Chauhan (24) and Suraj Sejariram (24) — were working on the fifth floor of the Blossom City building near Ambica Township around 10.30 am on Thursday. The contractor had assigned them the task to demolish the slab of the sixth floor. During the demolition work, the slabs of the sixth as well as fifth floor caved in. Sagathiya and Chauhan died on the spot while Sejariram suffered severe injuries. Police said that the workers were not given any safety equipment nor were they trained to carry out such work. “As of now we have registered a case of accidental death. But if we find evidence an offence might be registered later,” said a police official. The contractor Prashant Pachani is absconding, cops said. The renovation work of the building was going on for a month now, but Chauhan, a native of Bihar, and Sejariram, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, had joined the work on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/two-construction-labourers-die-one-hurt-as-slab-caves-in/articleshow/86463019.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In Tadoba, gypsys of locals get preference over outsiders||Nagpur: In a major move to provide benefits of eco-tourism to local villagers, the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) has decided to keep Gypsys owned by resort owners and outsiders at bay to accommodate local vehicles. Of the total safari vehicles operating in the core area, around 50% are owned by outsiders, government employees and resort owners. Now, locals are being selected by EDCs and gram panchayat in a democratic way and those in need of livelihood are being given a chance. The Local Advisory Committee (LAC), a statutory body taking decisions related to tourism, had in 2019 decided to phase out outside gypsys. The decision was not implemented then due to pressure from Gypsy owners. Now, the management has redistributed safari vehicles owned by local people to the core areas. The move will come into effect from October 1. TATR deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “The decision will benefit at least 55 families living around Kolara, Mohurli, Pangdi, Khutwanda, Zari and Navegaon tourism gates. There are 120 gypsys operating in the core and 150 vehicles enter through 14 buffer gates.” Most of the vehicles in the buffer zone are owned by local people. Of the 120 vehicles operating in the core area, 55 are run by private operators and resort owners from outside. Kale said now first preference will be given to locals. “We have redistributed the quota of gypsys to locals by keeping resort vehicles out of rotation. If resort vehicles want to jump rotation, they will have to pay the locals who are in line. The number of vehicles jumping the rotation will not be limited,” he said. Now, of the 55 Gypsys operating from Mohurli gate, 24 have been allotted to locals. Of these, 12 have been allotted to Mohurli, and four each to Kondegaon, Sitarampeth, and Bhamdeli villages. Similarly, in Kolara, of the 34 vehicles, 15 were run by private people. Now seven Gypsys have been given to Kolara and four each to Bamangaon and Satara villages. From Khutwanda gate, of the seven vehicles, five belonged to private players. In the new arrangement, three vehicles have been allotted to Khutwanda and two to Ghosri villages. From Navegaon gate, of the 10 vehicles, five belonged to private operators. “Now we have allotted three Gypsys to Navegaon and two to relocated Jamni village. The decision commensurates with the NTCA guidelines and would not only benefit local people from ecotourism activities but will also reduce the resource dependency of people on the forest,” said Kale. Sources said that at Mohurli, where there are a lot of stakes involved, outsiders and resort owners are opposing the move. At other gates switching over to locals is going on smoothly. However, Mohurli sarpanch Archana Katkar said, “I welcome the TATR decision but resort owners, who are opposing the move saying they have also become locals over the years, should understand that they are already earning money from resorts. Now they should leave the Gypsy operations to the locals who have protected the forests for long.” Expand ambit of Jan Van Yojana: CM Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday asked the forest department to expand the ambit of Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan Van Yojana in areas where people are constantly facing interface with big carnivores. Currently, the scheme is in operation in 939 villages. “The authorities should also explore whether the change in crop pattern in sensitive areas can help mitigate conflict,” Thackeray said. The CM was addressing a meeting to review the man-animal conflict in the Chandrapur district where 34 people have died in the conflict. He also asked the department to come with comprehensive guidelines on solar fencing to stop crop depredation around TATR. He asked to set up solar bore wells at 218 spots for wildlife. Secondly, tigers that have been frequenting villages should be identified and radio-collared for better monitoring, said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-tadoba-gypsys-of-locals-get-preference-over-outsiders/articleshow/86465340.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Kochi||How a 7-year-old dinosaur fan from Kochi entered record books||KOCHI: The majestic Tyrannosaurus rex (T Rex) and the fictional dinosaur Indominus Rex might be familiar for all. But do you know Rajasaurus (whose fossils were found from India) that sports a peculiar crest on its head, much like a crown of a raja? Well, Rajasaurus is one among the nearly 200 dinosaurs Aadikrishnan V Bharat (Aadi), a 7-year-old boy from Kakkanad, had known about since he was five. The knowledge he has about the dinosaur world has secured for him around six records in two categories each in Kalam’s World Records, India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records. The records are for identifying the maximum number of dinosaurs (132) and their diets in the shortest time (2 minutes & 50 seconds). He also holds the records of identifying the maximum number of dinosaurs (94) in one minute in all the three books. Besides their food habits, he also knows all the characteristics of each dinosaur and from where their fossils were found. “He was always passionate about learning about dinosaurs and he aspires to become a palaeontologist. He started reading about dinosaurs after seeing the films in the Jurassic Park series and later the documentaries in the National Geographic channel. We supported his passion by providing books like “Dinosaur A to Z” and encyclopaedias. After knowing about the existing record in the category we applied for it and he set new records,” said his mother Vijitha Prasad and father Bharat Rajan, both techies. When asked about his most favourite dinosaur, Aadi, without even a second thought, said “Velociraptors”. The reason? “They were the smartest, fastest, most intelligent and agile of all the dinosaurs I know. Moreover, they were carnivorous,” Aadi said. And taking a short breath, the Class II student of Bhavan’s Adarsha Vidyalaya started talking about the dinosaur that is at the bottom of his list: Mamenchisaurus, known for its remarkably-long necks, which made up nearly half the total body length. Aadi has a very “good” reason for it too. “China was the home for Mamenchisaurus and its fossils were found there. Coronavirus came from China and all are struggling because of it. So I don’t like the dino,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-a-seven-year-old-dino-fan-from-city-entered-record-books/articleshow/86465296.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Nagpur||Nagpur University administration revives centenary panel after row||NAGPUR: In a damage control exercise, the Nagpur University (NU) administration on Wednesday revived the 13-member centenary celebration committee set up in March 2020 due to uproar over alleged arbitrary formation of another panel having lesser-known individuals. The committee formed in 2020 had the likes of cricketer Umesh Yadav, senior counsel Sunil Manahor, MLCs Nago Ganar, and NU stalwart Baban Taywade as members. After SR Chaudhari took over as the new vice-chancellor, a 19-member centenary celebration panel was surprisingly formed with statutory members being informed about the development. Only two management council members found their names on the list. Being once in a lifetime event, the centenary celebration is considered the most important event of the university. The NU is completing 100 years on August 4, 2023. Not consulted and with the 13-member panel suggestion made by Vishnu Changde discarded, the elected management council members were upset with the NU brass led by Chaudhari. While they believed the panel should have been approved by the management council, experts said the VC transgressed into the powers of the chancellor in setting up the 19-member panel. The governor, who is chancellor of all public universities, is chairman of senate and by virtue of this is custodian of university. “By this account, it was within the powers of Senate to decide,” they said. By Wednesday evening, the members compelled the VC to include the five elected members though questions of constitution and approval of the committee remained. Earlier in the day, the VC said, “Every activity in this regard (centenary celebration) is being done as per the decisions, provisions and rules.” However, he didn’t clarify the existence of two simultaneous committees for the event. As per members, the 13-member committee, now led by the VC, has been termed as steering committee and the other one as organizing. Interestingly, the steering committee hasn’t met while the organizing committee set up by VC met recently. During the council meeting on Wednesday, the issue was put up as table item much to the surprise of the members. The roles and financial provisions are yet to be defined for the 100th foundation year celebration, they said. Initially, the members were upset over the VC’s move to hand pick candidates for the 19-member panel led by the Pro-VC. The members said since it was the biggest event of the university, the administration needed to follow a democratic process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-admin-revives-centenary-panel-after-row/articleshow/86465323.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Ahmedabad||Customary divorce not acceptable for Leuva Patel community: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has ruled that customary divorce is not acceptable so far as the Leuva Patel community is concerned, because there is no proof that such practice existed before the implementation of the Hindu Marriage Act, and they have to approach a court of law to obtain a divorce. The high court was dealing with an appeal filed by a woman who was seeking a divorce decree on the basis of a customary divorce deed inked in the presence of community leaders, the panch. The woman is from Amreli district, and married a man from her community in Rajkot in 2010. As they had a matrimonial dispute, the separated by signing a divorce deed. When the woman wanted to remarry and settle abroad, for the purpose of issuing the visa, the foreign authority insisted on a divorce decree issued by a competent court in Ahmedabad and sought the decree under the Family Court Act. The family court rejected the suit and said that the parties are from the Leuva Patel community and they failed to prove the practice of customary divorce was prevalent in the community. The woman approached the HC, which also refused to order the issuing of a divorce decree by upholding the couple’s divorce taken by the couple through the customary divorce deed in the presence of community leaders. The HC refused to accept affidavits filed by five witnesses to the divorce as legal evidence. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati said, “In our view, the plaintiff (woman) has miserably failed to prove at the first instance that there was any such custom prevailing in the Leuva Patel community to obtain divorce by execution of a document in presence of the panchas and secondly, whether such alleged customary divorce was continuously and uniformly observed for a long time in the Leuva Patel community and was not opposed to public policy.” The HC observed that for a valid customary divorce, “the custom must be ancient and there must be proof of customary divorce prior to passing of the Act”. Mere executing documents in presence of panchayatdars for divorce does not prove that customary divorce is a practice. Insisting on following the law of the land in such practices, the court cited philosopher Bertrand Russell saying nationalist is the best policy and internationalism is not possible. The courts and statesmen should not recognize or encourage regionalism. But, they have to promote nationalism. Finally, the HC asked the couple to go before a family court and file a divorce suit. If they do so, the family court will have to dispense with the cooling off period, the HC ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/customary-divorce-not-acceptable-for-leuva-patel-community-hc/articleshow/86467130.cms||---

---||Delhi||Plea against police chief appointment a ‘copy-paste’: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday termed as “copy-paste” a petition filed before it, challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner and expressed anguish that the lawyer for the petitioner was unable to explain the claims made in the petition. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said this petition is entirely copied, including full stop and comma, from another plea filed with similar prayers before the Supreme Court. It said that the lawyer, who is the author of the petition that has been copied, is waiting in the queue to argue, in an apparent reference to advocate Prashant Bhushan. The court also took a dim view of the inability of the lawyer for petitioner and lawyer Sadre Alam to explain what “super time scale” means, despite basing his challenge on it as one of the grounds. Apart from the PIL by Alam, the high court is also hearing an intervention application by NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), filed through Bhushan, which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court. “All these things you have copied from the memo of the senior advocate (referring to Bhushan). If you are copying, you do it 5% and write 95% of your own. Here, 97 to 99% is copied even with all the full stops and commas. Don’t do this in the future; we have tolerated it this time,” the bench warned. When Alam’s lawyer started his argument on inter-cadre transfer during the hearing, the chief justice asked him what he meant by “super time scale.” The court repeatedly asked the same question that he could not explain and sought time to check and come back. “We are asking you for the last time; we will dismiss the petition with costs. You have copied from his memo that is the problem. Without understanding, you are reading. Now we want an additional explanation. What is the super time scale,” the bench said. While dictating the order, the bench said, “counsel appearing in... started with an argument on inter cadre transfer. He simply read over paragraphs without explaining anything. When the word ‘super time scale’ was read, we asked a question whether he can explain or not, and the counsel for the petitioner was unable to explain what is the meaning of super time scale in the service jurisprudence.” The counsel sought time and the court listed the matter for further hearing on September 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-against-police-chief-appointment-a-copy-paste-hc/articleshow/86467132.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government had recommended a CBI probe into the mahant’s death on Wednesday night. Late on Thursday evening, the DoPT issued a notification for a CBI probe into the mahant’s death. The team visited the Bagambhari Math in Prayagraj where Giri had allegedly ended his life. The CBI team also met members of the Special Investigating Team (SIT) constituted by the state government to probe the case. The CBI team reached Prayagraj around 1pm and went straight to Police Lines. Senior police officials, including SSP Sarvashresth Tripathi and IG Prayagraj zone KP Singh, and 18-member SIT team also reached the Police Lines. The team also questioned the doctors who conducted the postmortem on Giri’s body. Sources said CBI sleuths recorded statements of mahant Giri’s disciples who broke open the mahant’s room and brought down his body which was hanging from the ceiling. Source added that this CBI team will return to Delhi and another team will be formed to conduct the probe. As per rules, CBI takes over an investigation only after a notification is released and then a preliminary inquiry is done before an FIR is registered in a case. The demand for a CBI probe was raised by opposition parties, including Congress and Shiv Sena. Some seers and Hindu religious leaders had also demanded a CBI probe into the death of Mahant Narendra Giri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mahants-death-cbi-team-reaches-prayagraj-for-probe/articleshow/86467741.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Chennai||Chennai: Youth stabs college girl, 20, to death near Tambaram station||CHENNAI: A 20-year-old student of the Madras Christian College was stabbed to death by a youth as she walked away from him towards the nearby Tambaram railway station around 1.45pm on Thursday. Witnesses said Shwetha and Ramachandran, 25, were arguing on the crowded road to the station opposite the college when he whipped out a knife, held it to his throat and threatened to kill himself. She turned and was walking away when he suddenly stabbed her in the neck and six times in the stomach before shocked passersby could react. As one of Shwetha’s friends cried out, Ramachandran turned the knife on himself, but onlookers prevented him from killing himself and handed him over to police. Police said the two had got together three years ago after twice meeting accidentally on a train to Nagapattinam. They had fallen out a couple of months ago as Ramachandran got angry with Shwetha saying her phone was busy whenever he called. Since the Covid lockdowns, they had been keeping in touch mostly over the phone. Police said the couple had decided to meet on Thursday to sort things out. While Ramachandran was keen on a patch-up, Shwetha preferred to break up with him as she was upset that he was suspicious about her. Shwetha, a resident of Chromepet, was doing her second year diploma in medical laboratory technology (DMLT) course at MCC’s School of Continuing Education. Ramachandran, an engineering graduate and a native of Thirukkuvalai in Nagapattinam district, had been working at a car manufacturing unit in Chengalpattu. He had rented a house at Maraimalai Nagar. According to eyewitnesses at the spot, the two were seen talking and walking near the railway quarters in Tambaram around 1.45pm. That’s when Ramachandran attacked her. Shwetha, who was bleeding profusely was taken to Chromepet government hospital, where she was declared brought dead by the doctors. Ramachandran is undergoing treatment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital. The Selaiyur police have registered a murder case and began further inquiry.

He blew the conch and offered a bell weighing 51 kg in the temple. Hundreds of farmers reached the temple to get a glimpse of Tikait, who maintained that he has support from all walks of life and BJP will lose polls this time. “I am offering this bell to Lord Shiva just to see if this government will hear it. Otherwise, they have not been listening to farmers for 10 months,” said Tikait. Tikait reached Muzaffarnagar on Wednesday. He first paid his tribute to Lord Shiva with family, but didn’t visit his home, not far away from there. “I will not go home until three farming laws are abolished,” he said. When asked about the slogan ‘Har Har Mahadev Allah hu Akbar’ raised by him, he said, “This slogan is mentioned in the Indian Constitution. BJP leaders should abandon their houses built by Muslims. They should also disclose how many Muslims are working for them. Who stitches clothes for them? They must tell us.” Later, he was welcomed by bursting firecrackers in the Muslim-dominated area, Meenakshi chowk. BKU Senior leader Shahid Alam said, “Since farming movement is going on, majority of Muslim farmers have joined the protest against farm laws. The movement is also helping to bridge the gap between Jats and Muslims created after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/saffron-stole-clad-tikait-offers-bell-weighing-51-kg-in-muzaffarnagars-shiva-temple/articleshow/86463086.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Mumbai||After dengue, chikungunya cases also take wing in Maharashtra and Mumbai||MUMBAI: Outpatient departments of hospitals and clinics are witnessing a rise in chikungunya cases alongside dengue for the past one-and-half month. Both these viral diseases are transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito. While official chikungunya figures for the city were not readily available, the state numbers show an increase in several districts. Till mid-September, Maharashtra reported 1,537 confirmed cases of chikungunya, a near 100% increase from 782 cases last year (see box). A majority of the reported cases are from Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur. Data from Metropolis Lab showed an increasing trend of chikungunya in the city over the last three months. In July, 239 out of 790 samples (tested using three methods) were positive. The number rose to 564 out 1,943 samples in August. Till September 19, there were 510 positives out of 1,749 test samples. Testing in Mumbai and Thane districts is not adequate and cases could be underreported, said Dr Mahendra Jagtap, state entomologist. Nearly a dozen private and public hospitals from the city told TOI that they have been treating a steady stream of patients with complaints of fever, rashes, headache and nausea. The most defining symptom of chikungunya is acute pain in the joints that can last up to a year in older people. Dr Behram Pardiwala, head of internal medicine at Wockhardt Hospital, has treated nearly 40 cases in the past six weeks. “The patients come with very high fever and joint pain,” he said. Bombay Hospital physician Dr Gautam Bhansali has six patients admitted for chikungunya. “These patients have high fever along with other aches and pain. A few with falling WBC count need hospitalisation,” he said. Dr Anita Mathew, an infectious diseases specialist at Fortis Hospital, said they have treated 22 chikungunya patients in the past few months. “There is a spike this year compared to the previous two years,” she said. A civic official said there is no alarming rise. “We are taking a lot of steps to curb the spread of dengue and it’s the same vector that causes chikungunya,” said the official. The viral disease, although not life-threatening, can cause debilitating pain, especially in senior citizens, said Dr Hemalata Arora of Nanavati Hospital, where two hospitalisations took place last week alone. One of them was a 68-year-old whose existing arthritis was worsened by the chikungunya infection. The pain can be so excruciating that even a 27-year-old got hospitalised last week, said Dr Paritosh Baghel, internal medicine consultant at SL Raheja Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-dengue-chikungunya-cases-also-take-wing-in-state-and-mumbai-city/articleshow/86467778.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Coimbatore||E-vehicles find more takers in city||Coimbatore: The city has clocked a 205% increase in electric vehicle (e-vehicle) sales in just the first eight months of this year, when the four regional transport offices (RTOs) in the city had together registered 512 such vehicles, against 186 in 12 months in 2020. A regional transport officer said people in general were looking for alternative transportation systems, as they didn’t want to travel in packed public transport during the pandemic. “This, coupled with the increase in fuel prices, has helped the sale of e-vehicle to touch new highs.” Other factors, the officer said, that changed the people’s mindset towards e-vehicles were technological advancement, which has enhanced the average driving range of electric vehicles with a fully charged battery, and availability of recharging points. As per the data available with the transport department, 412 electric two-wheelers were registered with the Coimbatore North, South, West and Central RTOs in the city till August 31 this year, compared to 150 during January-December, 2020. The sale of electric cars has also recorded a growth of 161% during the period. While only 36 electric cars were sold in the city last year, 94 e-cars were sold till August-end this year. V R Sailaja, a resident of Peelamedu, is one among the residents who opted for an electric two-wheeler. “I used to travel to my workplace near Singanallur on a city bus. I stopped bus travel after the outbreak of Covid-19 and my husband started dropping me on his bike. When he decided to buy a two-wheeler for me recently, I went for an e-scooter,” she told TOI. Recalling her visits to the vehicle showrooms in the city to get quotations, Sailaja said plenty of e-scooter options were available now at various price ranges, depending on the average driving range and other facilities. Dealers said the e-vehicles with 250-watt motors and a top speed of 25kmph did not require registration with the transport department. “Driving licence is also not required to drive such vehicles. There is demand for the vehicles in this range and higher range that require registration. Hence, the actual number of e-vehicles sold this year is higher than the figures available with the RTOs,” said a dealer. E-vehicle manufacturers too expressed a similar view. One of them said most of the vehicles sold were unregistered. “The number of unregistered e-vehicles on the road are 10 times higher than the registered ones.” C Sathyachandran, proprietor of Wagon Wheelz, said e-vehicles were preferred by both men and women alike. “Apart from daily office commuters, those involved in extensive travel such as food delivery and marketing people also use e-vehicles, as they find them economical. They carry additional batteries with them. The market is also mature now and offers a range of vehicles.” A manager of another vehicle showroom said there were many charging points in the city, especially at malls. “If more charging points were to come up, sales will shoot up further.” Dealers said they were also getting inquiries about electric three-wheeler vehicles for commercial transportation that had hit the market very recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/e-vehicles-find-more-takers-in-city/articleshow/86467174.cms||V Devanathan

Bhoma locals have been opposing the plant fearing that it may create pollution as bio-medical waste will be treated at the plant. Lobo said that the plant is expected to be inaugurated in the first week of October. “I would bring them to the plant and persuade them by showing them how the plant works,” Lobo told reporters during his visit to the plant on Thursday. When asked about the opposition, Lobo said that the fear is irrational. The ash from plant will go to the Saligao landfill site, he said. The minister said that the state has no facility for a common biomedical waste treatment and the plant will help people by avoiding improper burial, dumping or burning of the waste. Biotic Waste Solutions Pvt Ltd, will operate the plant on BOOT (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) for the next 20 years. The government has made the land available to them. The entire plant has been erected by the company at a cost of Rs 10 crore and it will charge fees for the services provided by them. Lobo also hospital will be charged slightly more. Presently, hospitals pay Rs 7.25 per bed to treat such waste, which will increase to Rs 9 per bed. Goa has a total 6,194 beds, including 2,485 in private hospitals and 3,709 in government hospitals. The state has a total 749 clinics. All the institutions together generate 2,992 kg bio medical waste per day and 10,92,166 kg per annum. The plant has arranged seven vehicles to collect the bio medical waste from the entire state, Greval said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bhoma-waste-plant-safe-lobo/articleshow/86649918.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The green tribunal has now formed a panel to inspect the mill in Muzaffarnagar's Khatauli and submit its report. “We are not satisfied with the stand of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). We do not find any justification why the inspection was conducted when the unit was not functional due to off-season,” an NGT bench said while hearing a petition which alleged that the groundwater of the area around the factory has been polluted. “We direct a joint committee (comprising Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), UPPCB and Muzaffarnagar district magistrate) to carry out an inspection now, when the unit is functional,” the bench ordered. The UPPCB was earlier asked by NGT to submit a fact-finding report on the allegation that untreated effluent was being discharged by the sugar mill, contaminating groundwater. The state agency has given the mill a clean chit after the inspection. According to a resident of Khatauli, Sripal Singh, “Clean water is the basic need of any human habitat, but this mill is too busy making profits. It is not realizing how many lives are at stake in the region. The contaminated groundwater not only threatens lives directly, but also makes vegetation and crops poisonous.” The UPPCB had filed two reports dated July 2 and September 14, 2021. The first report merely said that due to Covid-19 situation, the inspection could not be carried out. The second report said that the inspection was carried out in September when the industry was not operational due to off-season and no contamination was found in the ground water samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/polluting-sugar-mill-given-clean-chit-after-off-season-inspection-ngt-furious/articleshow/86463107.cms||Sandeep Rai

The video shows the body of the seer lying on the floor with a yellow nylon rope tied around his neck. Two mobile phones of the seer could be seen kept on the table along with a letter pad of Baghambari Math, similar to the one used for writing the ‘suicide note’. There are also no noticeable signs of struggle in the room. Police personnel are also heard in the video asking one of his disciples who opened the door. To which a disciple says that first he made two calls to the seer but as he got no reply, he broke open the door to find that he had hanged himself and later brought down his body. The cop further asks as to why he did not inform the police before bringing the mahant's body down? The disciple answers that he thought that seer was alive. One cop also asks who switched on the ceiling fan? The room according to the video is in order, showing no signs of struggle inside. However, sources privy to the SIT probe disclosed that the room where Mahant Narendra Giri was found, happens to be a guest room and would be opened only when Narendra Giri wanted to meet any visitor. The SIT on Thursday also questioned all the disciples in the mutt who were first to reach the spot and broke open the door. Another section of team members also questioned the guards deployed in the security of the mahant who allegedly were not present on the fateful day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-brought-his-body-down-as-we-thought-mahant-was-alive/articleshow/86467757.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

It was stated that since the Chandigarh administration has issued delimitation order merging 13 villages with the municipal corporation, the number of polling stations will increase substantially this time. Their number will further increase due to limiting the number of electors to 1,000 per polling station during Covid. Thus, there are likely to be over 700 polling stations compared with 445 during the last elections, the UT officials submitted. The state election commissioner asked the UT adviser to provide adequate arrangements and police personnel to ensure smooth and transparent elections. He also directed that requisite arrangements / preparation be made timely. The adviser said all logistics, manpower and infrastructure will be provided as per the requirement of the commission. The pandemic scenario was also discussed and he assured that the administration will make adequate provisions to follow the Covid-19 protocol during the elections. The UT administration on December 30 last year had issued a notification of 35 wards in the Chandigarh municipal corporation. With the merger of 13 villages in the MC, the UT had increased nine more wards after delimitation. The administration had issued a draft notification, increasing 26 wards to 35, and sought suggestions and objections from the public. The UT considered around 180 objections. The major changes were made in areas under wards 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 26 and 27. The last delimitation of wards was done in 2006.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/over-700-polling-stations-likely-for-mc-elections/articleshow/86465477.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Police said that all the victims hailed from Rajasthan and were residents of Morbi. Police identified the deceased as Anand Singh Shekhawat (35), Ashok Birda (25), Tarachand Barala (24), Bijendra Singh Shekhawat (26) and Dinesh alias Rajesh Jat (24). They were returning to their homes at Ganeshnagar in Morbi. Anand Singh owned a transport business at Bharatnagar and the four others worked for him. Around 10 pm when their car was passing by Timbdi village, a bike rider ahead of them suddenly changed his lane. Trying to save the bike rider, Anand, who was driving the car at high speed, lost control over the vehicle as it rammed into a truck parked on the side of the highway. Police said that the entire front body of the car was left mangled by the high-impact collision. All the five passengers of the car died on the spot. “Eye-witnesses said that the car suddenly moved towards the side of the road. When we investigated further it was learnt that a biker had suddenly changed his lane and came in front of the car,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/five-killed-as-car-rams-into-truck/articleshow/86463179.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Shortage of key components hits e-vehicle production, supply||Coimbatore: E-vehicle manufacturers said the production was badly affected by the shortage of crucial components like processing chips and batteries, which were imported from abroad. While the demand is on the rise, they are not in a position to cash in on the same because of the short supply of components. Some of the manufacturers said they were now using their own technology to produce components such as batteries. However, they still have to depend on importing chips from abroad. K Barathan, chief executive officer, Ozotec Automobiles Private Limited, said they were expecting a sale of only 15-20 e-scooters in March this year in each of their showrooms. “However, the demand suddenly increased. Now, we can sell about 50 vehicles a month in each showroom. The demand is surpassing our expectation every time.” He said the production was slow at present because of the unavailability of key components in making batteries. “While they are available in countries such as China, there are issues in transporting them because of container scarcity. We are, however, less affected, as we are not completely dependent on import. We have our own patented battery technology.” C Sathyachandran, proprietor of Wagon Wheelz, said they were incurring losses, as the supply of vehicles had fallen short of the demand. “While we can sell 150 e-vehicles a month, we hardly get 20. We had sold 85 e-vehicles last October. While we can easily sell threefold the vehicles this year, the short supply may be a hindrance. We are getting a huge volume of inquiries daily, but we could not convert them into sales because of the short supply. In fact, we cancel orders, as we could not deliver the vehicles as promised." He said while they had placed bulk orders with some of the companies, the latter could not serve them. “They will lose out on more business, if the production is not scaled up immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shortage-of-key-components-hits-e-vehicle-production-supply/articleshow/86467198.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Allahabad high court sets aside seniority list of police inspectors||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has set aside a seniority list issued on November 22, 2019, promoting civil police inspectors to the post of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) in UP police. It directed the state government to prepare fresh joint seniority list of inspectors posted in civil police as well as in armed police (PAC), keeping in view the Rule 7 of UP Government Servants Seniority Rules 1991. It further directed the state authorities to complete the exercise within a month. It, however, asked the state government not to revert the two already promoted inspectors from civil police to the post of DSP till conclusion of the promotion exercise after preparation of the joint seniority list. The two promoted DSPs were made opposite parties in the petition, but they did not appear before the court to put their stand. A bench of Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh passed the order on a writ petition moved by PAC inspector Vijay Singh. The petitioner had pleaded that his two junior inspectors in civil police were also promoted on the post of DSP on the basis of seniority list prepared on November 22, 2019, but he was not considered for the promotion in illegal manner. In course of hearing, the bench found that the petitioner had made representation to the DGP against the seniority list prepared from among only inspectors of civil police against the rule 1991. The DGP constituted a two-member committee which considered the matter and found that the seniority list was prepared on the basis of a Government Order issued on July 24, 2003, but in fact, the said GO did not exist. The committee hence submitted its report that the joint seniority list of inspectors, comprising civil police and PAC, should be prepared, but even then nothing was done. Allowing the petition, the bench said, “Admittedly, the impugned seniority list of November 22, 2019, had not been prepared in accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules 1991, but it had been prepared in accordance with the GO of July 24, 2003. The committee already recommended that the joint seniority list would be prepared in accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules 1991. In view of aforesaid, the impugned seniority list is hereby quashed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-sets-aside-seniority-list-of-police-inspectors/articleshow/86467762.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

Koderma deputy commissioner Aditya Ranjan said: “Most of these students come from humble background and cannot afford the fees of expensive coaching centres. Due to their financial constraints, they are unable to fulfill their dreams of becoming an IAS, IPS, doctor or engineer. Now, the administration will help them achieve their dreams.” “A three-day career counseling camp will be organised here from October 2 where experts from New Delhi, IIM Ahmedabad, senior officials of the district and experts from across the country will participate. They will share ideas with the students and help them choose their career path. A link has been created where students can register their names for the orientation programme. Information through SMS will be sent to students registered with employment exchange,” Ranjan said. In the second phase, Ranjan added that a guidance centre will be set up where a select few teachers will teach students free of cost and prepare them for all kinds of competitive examinations. So far, nine teachers have been shortlisted for the coaching exercise. More will be involved soon, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-school-students-to-get-free-coaching-for-competitive-exams/articleshow/86465299.cms||---

Meral police station officer in-charge Shivlal Kumar Gupta said, “In her complaint, the 17-year-old girl alleged that she was sold for Rs 20,000 by her father to a human trafficker identified as Arjun Lal, a resident of Himmat Nagar under Sultanganj police station in Uttar Pradesh. She was forcibly married to Arjun Lal’s son Raju Jain in a temple and is now pregnant.” After a few days, her 15-year-old sister was also sold to Arjun Lal for Rs 15,000. He had also taken her to UP. On September 20, Arjun Lal returned to Sirho village along with the two girls. Sources said Arjun Lal was bargaining his time for the third 12-year-old sibling. In the meantime, the three sisters managed to flee and reach their aunt’s home in a nearby village. The following day, they approached Meral police station and filed a complaint against their father and the tout. “Based on the complaint, the police have arrested both father and the tout and remanded them in judicial custody after registering a case under sections 341, 323, 366A, 376, 370 and 506 of the IPC and 34 POCSO Act,” said the police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/teenaged-girls-accuse-father-of-selling-them-in-up/articleshow/86465911.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren felicitates six tribal students||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren felicitated the first batch of six tribal students selected for enrolment to five universities in the United Kingdom for their higher studies under the state’s flagship scholarship scheme — Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda overseas scholarship — at a ceremony held at Project Building on Thursday. British deputy high commissioner in Kolkata, Nick Low called the initiative ‘visionary’. Under the programme, the government proposes to sponsor 10 tribal students per year, covering their tuition fees, journey fares and other expenses while they pursue their Masters or higher education in foreign universities. The programme will be run by the department of ST, SC, minority and backward class welfare department. A total of 22 applications were received since the advertisement was floated in March this year and the final selection was done on September 6. The scholarship is planned for 22 courses in 15 universities. Hailing the efforts of the department for making the scheme a reality, Soren said, “I hadn’t thought that we will be able to work out the modalities of the scheme so early since its announcement last year as there were lots of technicalities involved — coordination with different embassies, seeking clearances from various agencies and others. But I am happy that our officials have made it possible.” He said that the idea behind the scheme is to provide students from tribal and marginalised community a chance to pursue studies in best universities across the globe. “Now that this scheme has begun, we will gradually expand it so that more and more students of different communities can take benefit. Initially, we have allocated Rs 10 crore for this scheme, but I have asked the department to ensure that the funds aren’t lapsed and unused amount is added to next year’s budget,” he said, adding that the reason this scheme was inspired by Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda is because he was the first tribal to study in Oxford about 100 years back. “He went on to become a global icon and also played a crucial role in the making of our country’s Constitution. We run the schemes in the name of our icons and legendary figures so that the future generation knows about our great history,” he said, hoping that tribal students who will study in foreign universities will also help in better branding of the state. Tribal affairs minister Champai Soren called it a start of a new chapter in Jharkhand’s history. “It’s a historic moment when the state is able to send its tribal students to study in foreign university on state’s expense. This will mark a new beginning,” he said. In his letter to Soren, British deputy high commissioner in Kolkata, Nick Low said, “...I am truly delighted to convey my heartiest thanks and congratulations to the Government of Jharkhand for launching the Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda Overseas Scholarship Scheme for students belonging to tribal communities to pursue higher education in the United Kingdom.” Praising the scheme, he said, “In the direction of bridging the inequalities of access in higher studies, I sincerely congratulate you for steering this visionary initiative. Your leadership and the efforts of the state government to drive this knowledge partnership between Jharkhand and the United Kingdom deserve the highest praise. The legacy of Jaipal Singh Munda, who started his Oxford BA programme a century ago will, I believe, now be taken forward both through this batch of scholars and subsequent beneficiaries.” An official of the department said that five panel of professors from different universities were set up to scrutinise applications. “In the first phase, we interviewed 13 applicants and nine in the second phase. Of the 22 applications, six are selected now and remaining four will be picked up soon,” he said. Explaining the procedure for application, he said, “An applicant first had to apply in the university and after admission is confirmed, the state government issued scholarship letter which paved way for making of visa and other formalities.” Those selected in the first batch students are Hercules Singh Munda (School of Oriental & African Studies, University of London for MA in linguistics), Akanksha Mary Balmuchu (MSc climate change science and management, Loughborough University), Anjana Pratima Dungdung (University of Warwick, MSc international relations), Dinesh Bhagat (University of Sussex for MSc in climate change, development and policy), Priya Murmu (MA in creative writing and writing industries in Loughborough University), Ajitesh Murmu (MArch-bio-integrated design in University College London —The Barlett School of Architecture). All will leave for higher studies this month end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-felicitates-six-tribal-students/articleshow/86465147.cms||ASRP Mukesh

"What prompted him to take the step is being probed," said Adityapur police station incharge Rajendra Prasad Mahato. In the preliminary investigation, police have learned that the doctor was mentally disturbed since the past few days. "Prima facie it's a suicide bid," OC said. Amit, who works as a junior doctor in the medicine department in MGM hospital, is scheduled to get married in November, this year. Sources at the MGM hospital, have told that the doctor was also working as a consultant at a private nursing home in Jugsalai.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Free Covid vaccination a reason for fuel price hike, says BJP MLA Biranchi Narayan||DALTONGANJ: BJP’s Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan on Thursday claimed that the free vaccination for Covid-19 in the country is to be blamed for the rise in prices of petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders. Replying to a question on uncontrolled price hikes of fuel prices during a media interaction here, Narayan said, “The rise in prices of petrol and LPG cylinders is because of this free vaccination. From where will the Union government bring in money? You ought to have paid for your vaccine. Some inconveniences do come when big things are done.” Meanwhile, Narayan criticised Mandar MLA and ruling Congress’s co-working president Bandhu Tirkey over reports of him allegedly trying to persuade deceased Sahibganj SI Rupa Tirkey’s family to refrain from demanding a CBI probe into her death case. “The CM must ask him to explain his conduct,” he said. An audio clip of Tirkey’s conversation with Rupa’s family in this regard went viral recently. He also demanded the removal of Latehar DC Abu Imran for “crossing his limits”. Two days ago, an audio clip of him went viral where Imran is asking Bandhu why he visited a minority-dominated area. Bandhu was recently in Balumath to meet the family members of seven kids who drowned last week. Narayan also took a dig at the ruling JMM charging it with trying to rob the Muslim vote base out of its ally — Congress. “First, the speaker allotted a namaz room in the assembly. Secondly, the state government has included Urdu as a notified language in the state’s recruitment policy but left our Hindi and other languages for appeasement politics,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/free-vax-a-reason-for-fuel-price-hike-says-bjp-mla/articleshow/86465762.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand health department to draft protocol to keep Covid at bay during festivals||RANCHI: Following directives from the Union government, the state health department is going to draft guidelines that focus on stringent Covid-control measures to prevent a surge in cases during the upcoming festive season. State epidemiologist Dr Praveen Karn on Thursday said, “We are finalising our protocols for the upcoming festive season and they will be in sync with the directions received from Union health ministry. We are going to be extra cautious as the effect of second wave hasn’t ended completely and as a precautionary measure, we will be putting restrictions on gatherings in districts with a positivity rate of 5% or more.” A department official said, “The district administrations will conduct surprise inspections. We will intensify screening as well as testing at all entry and exit points -- be it road, rail or airports -- to test people who are returning home from various parts of country. Random checking and surveillance will continue in selected areas till the end of festive season so that people do not let their guard down. Other focus areas will include ensuring that congregations are banned during Durga Puja. Events and fairs will also be banned.” Asked about any other measures, Dr Karn said: “We will continue to expand our testing net ahead of festivals as that is the only way to track patients with infection. Apart from that, we will follow test, track, treat, vaccinate and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to keep the virus at bay.” In its guidelines, the Centre warned all states of a possible surge in cases if people do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Currently, there are 3.09 lakh active cases across the country and over 30,000 cases are being added on a daily basis. In coming months, various festivals will follow one after another starting with Navratri from October 7 which will culminate on December 31 with New Year’s Eve. The period has been termed as a critical one as there may be tendency to ignore safety norms during the festive season and can result in large gatherings, events, fairs etc. So it is critical to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour as any laxity will lead to serious consequences and will result in a surge of cases,” read the guidelines. The guidelines also mentioned a system issued by the Union health ministry which calls for constant monitoring of the Covid-19 situation and provided with a threshold to enforce restrictions based on weekly positivity rate as well as on occupancy of beds in hospitals by Covid patients. As per the directions, the districts have been asked to put in restrictions in areas which report a positivity of 10% or more in a week as well as 60% bed occupancy -- be it oxygen-supported or in the Intensive Care Unit. The states have been directed to enforce at least a 14-day restriction at any district which crosses the threshold limit during festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-centers-nudge-health-dept-drafting-playbook-to-prevent-covid-19-infection-during-festivals/articleshow/86465941.cms||Gaurav Pandey

While the Railway Board has approved the South Eastern Railways’ proposal to run the Rajdhani through Lohardaga and Tori stations two days a week instead of Muri and Barkakana stations, a formal announcement is yet to be made. Seth met Vaishnav at his office in New Delhi and handed him over a charter of demands. Besides operating the Ranchi Rajdhani through the new railway route, Seth also demanded that the railways must immediately resume the operations of Ranchi – New Jalpaiguri weekly express, Ranchi – Deoghar Intercity Express, Hatia – Patna Pataliputra Express and Hatia – Ranchi – Sanki passenger train. “All these trains had been suspended due to the pandemic,” Seth wrote. Seth also demanded that the ministry must urgently take up the beautification of Pandra railway station in Ranchi district. “Pandra railway station is 5km from Ranchi and is located very close to the new Jharkhand high court, Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha and the Ranchi smart city. It is also very close to many education institutes. Hence, it is necessary to develop and beautify the station. A survey must be undertaken before deciding on it,” Seth said. However, Seth’s charter of demands did not mention anything about rationalizing the fare of railway tickets in express and passenger trains and platform tickets. When contacted, Seth said: “I will be raising this issue with the railway minister soon.” Jharkhand Passenger Association had recently urged Vaishnav to rationalize the ticket fares to provide financial relief to the passengers. At present, festive special trains are charging 1.5 times the normal fare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-mp-seeks-resumption-of-trains-from-city-silent-on-fare-hike/articleshow/86464966.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Admission process under RTE opaque, discriminatory: Survey||Ranchi: A survey carried out by the Association for Parivartan of Nation (APNA), an NGO, has revealed that children from poor families in Ranchi face a lot of impediments while getting admission at entry level classes in local private schools under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. As a result while the students are unable to get admission in private schools, a large number of seats in the latter remain vacant. Section 12 (1) (C) of RTE Act provides that 25% of the seats in private and non-minority schools should be reserved for poor children living in their vicinity. APNA, which conducted survey of 54 families living in slums of Ranchi, claimed that the admission process under RTE is opaque, discriminatory and has other irregularities. It stated, “Around 80% families said that they had to visit the schools two or more times to enquire about outcome of their application. After losing several working days, most of the families found that their applications were rejected.” It added that as per the district superintendent of education, Ranchi, under Right to Information, 89% of the applications were rejected in 2019-20 even as 74% of the seats remained vacant in the schools. Sarvesh Vardhan from Ravidas colony filled up application forms in three schools but was rejected by all of them. Moreover, the parents are not informed about the grounds of rejection and they are also not provided second chance for filling applications, the survey stated. The report states that the very short duration for filling application forms creates undue pressure on parents for getting the certificates and documents as fast as possible. During the interaction parents stated that they also felt discriminated as often they were kept outside the school campus during the admission process. Around 53% per cent of parents said that the school staff was either non-co-operative or rude. The organisation has recommended an increase in income limit for economically weaker section, increasing admission time to three months and appointment of a grievance redressal officer in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/admission-process-under-rte-opaque-discriminatory-survey/articleshow/86465851.cms||Sanjay Sahay

They demonstrated for an hour with Munda’s body, resulting in the movement of vehicles on the highway and also on Gola-Boreyo road coming to a standstill. The BJP workers have demanded that murderers be arrested in 24 hours, the trial of accused persons in fast track court, job to the dependent of deceased, free education for his children and a compensation of Rs 50 lakh. The protesters submitted a memorandum of demands to DSP Silli Christopher Kerketta. They warned that BJP would start an agitation at the district level if their demands were not met. On Wednesday, Munda was having tea, with another BJP leader named Raj Kumar Sahu, at a hotel in Palu village under Ormanjhi police station when an assailant fired at him. Sahu sustained injuries in the firing and is currently admitted to a private hospital. Meanwhile, police have formed a five-member special investigation team, headed by DSP Silli, to investigate the case. Rural SP Naushad Alam said, “Police are carrying out raids at several places to nab the criminals. The assailants would be in the police net soon.” Police are on the lookout for one Manoj Munda in connection with the Munda’s murder as the latter had appeared as a witness against him in a murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-stage-protest-against-murder-of-party-office-bearer/articleshow/86465546.cms||Sanjay Sahay

It is painful for all of us to see that even after 21 years of state formation, Mahto’s dream of taking development to all sections of the society hasn’t been achieved yet. AJSU-P will continue to fight for his dreams and will ensure that Jharkhand becomes one of the best states.” Addressing a gathering after paying floral tributes at the statue of Binod Bihari Mahato on the occasion of the former’s 98th birthday, in Silli, Sudesh said: “Binod Babu had given us a slogan of ‘Lado’ and ‘Padho’ (fight and learn) during Jharkhand’s statehood movement and I think the youth of the state should be reminded of the values connected to those slogans. After two decades, all of us need to introspect on how much have been achieved so that we can realise dreams of Binod Babu’s Jharkhand.” Sudesh also expressed his condolence over the death of Rajkishore Mahto, former MLA and great grandson of Binod Bihari Mahto, and said that party stands by the family and pray for the departed soul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/sudesh-remembers-binod-bihari-mahto-on-his-98th-birthday/articleshow/86465476.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Dhanbad judge intentionally hit by autorickshaw: CBI to Jharkhand HC||RANCHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday informed the Jharkhand high court that deceased Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand was “intentionally” knocked down by the accused autorickshaw driver on July 28 morning, leading to his death. Appearing before a division bench of Chief Justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and Justice Narayan Prasad of the court online, the probe agency’s east zone joint director Sharad Agarwal said CBI has put its officer on round-the-clock duty to uncover the truth behind the judge’s death. While stressing that the death of the judge is not an accident but an intentional one, Agarwal, however, said the theory of a conspiracy behind the death needs to be investigated. After hearing him, the bench observed that the death of a judge is the first of its kind in the country and has shaken the morale of the judiciary. “Time is the essence in this investigation and the more time is spent, the harder it will be to ascertain the truth,” the bench said. Agarwal also informed the court that the autorickshaw driver, Lakhan Sharma, is a habitual offender and had earlier committed mobile thefts. “He has been changing his statements and the CBI is doing everything to reach the depth of the matter,” the officer said. Judge Uttam Anand was on a morning walk near the Randhir Verma Chowk, a posh area in Dhanbad, on July 28 at 5 am, when he was hit by the autorickshaw. The vehicle has a passenger sitting in front along with the driver. The CCTV footage showed a motorcyclist going behind the autorickshaw and noticed the injured judge on the ground but drove away without providing help. Anand lay on the road unattended and was subsequently rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. The police had taken up the investigation with the Dhanbad SSP initially with the DGP assuring the court of a speedy inquiry. However, the government recommended a CBI investigation later. The CBI took up the matter on August 4 and is trying to link the dots together but has not achieved any major breakthrough as yet. The high court has also been monitoring the CBI’s investigation. The agency has submitted sealed reports to the court on the stages of the investigation done so far in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dhanbad-judge-intentionally-hit-by-autorickshaw-cbi-to-hc/articleshow/86465039.cms||---

He was apparently fleeing on a scooty with his accomplice Mohamed Kalamuddin and the mob chased him down and caught hold of him at a toll plaza where they beat up him before snatching the goat. Zakir sustained injuries after falling from the scooter while attempting to flee. He was later handed over to the police, some eye-witnesses said. Kalamuddin, who was driving the two-wheeler, fled the spot. Kandra police station in-charge Rajan Kumar, however, denied Zakir was thrashed by the mob. “He was probably slapped by one or two enraged villagers before the patrolling party reached the spot upon receiving the information. The accused has been taken to MGM hospital,” Kumar said. No FIR was filed till the time of filing this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/man-thrashed-for-stealing-goat/articleshow/86465990.cms||---

In a statement, the consulate said the training was held at a city hotel in collaboration with MSME-Development Institute (MSME-DI) Ranchi and Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC). As many as 35 MSME representatives attended the workshop. “With growing digitalization globally, more and more businesses are gradually shifting to digital platform. There has been a concomitant rise in cybercrimes. Cyber attacks through malware, phishing, ransomware have become commonplace. According to a survey by Kaspersky, about 48% of MSMEs have had data breaches owing to lack of understanding of threats and the importance of cyber security,” the statement read. Arnab Ganguly, a policy analyst at CUTS International, said, “The training focused on basic cyber security threats and what needed to be done to prevent them.” “Many MSME units have shifted to online for business in the post Covid-19 era. Given that MSMEs contribute roughly 30% of India’s GDP, it is imperative to equip them with the knowledge and tools to become resilient to cyber security breaches and grow their businesses sustainably,” Ganguly added. Union MSME director SK Sahoo said, “While the Covid-19 pandemic has created considerable challenges for MSMEs, it has also created an opportunity for the MSMEs to expand their business via online platforms. However, cyber security remains an area of serious concern for the MSMEs due to lack of understanding of cyber security risks, less prioritization for cyber safety, limited capital allocation to cyber security and other things.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/us-consulate-hosts-cyber-security-meet-for-msmes/articleshow/86466232.cms||---

In his complaint Ashwin Brahmbhatt, a resident of New Sama Road, told the police that he decided to build a house on his plot at Sherkhi village near the city earlier this year and accordingly contacted Hitesh Chanpura for the new construction work. Accused Chanpura had already done some renovation work at Brahmbhatt’s house in the city. After initial negotiations, Brahmbhatt and Chanpura signed an agreement regarding the construction in March. On July 21, Brahmbhatt gave an advance Chanpura Rs 5 lakh to start the work. A day later, Chanpura asked for more money and Brahmbhatt transferred him Rs 3.1 lakh more. However, the construction work never started. Angered by the delay, Brahmbhatt asked Chanpura to return the money if he was not interested in doing the work. Accused, however, sought some more time, but for the past few month, Brahmbhatt could not contact him as Chanpura’s cellphone was switched off. Later, complainant even visited the accused’s house in Undera, but there too he was not found. Realizing that he had been cheated, Brahmbhatt approached the Sama police station and based on his complaint, Chanpura was booked for cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/contractor-cheats-retired-banker-of-rs-8l/articleshow/86463632.cms||---

The delegation cited both allegations of irregularies in the conduct of the exam and the ‘coaching class’ culture as reasons for their stand. NSUI’s Maharashtra Pradesh secretary Pratik Kolhe said, “NEET is conducted for admission to medical education courses across the country. However, irregularities are taking place in the examinations which puts a big question mark for students. Also, the course is geared more towards NCERT curriculum, which is slightly different from what is taught in Maharashtra board affiliated institutes.” The union said that students from rural areas cannot afford to come to the city and enrol in expensive coaching classes. “Therefore, the dream of students from ordinary families to become doctors is getting shattered. The Maharashtra government should take a decision like the state of Tamil Nadu, which cancelled NEET,” said Kolhe. The delegation included NSUI members Ashish Mandape, Nikhil Wankhede, Pranay Singh Thakur, Aniruddha Pandey, Shadaf Sofi, Chetan Meshram, Saurabh Kalmegh, Vidyasagar Tripathi, Rajaratan Ramteke, Kunal Chaudhary, Pranay Pandre and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/scrap-neet-demands-congress-students-wing/articleshow/86484130.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Meanwhile, with Kerala consistently reporting more recoveries than new infections, active cases in the country dipped below the 3-lakh mark for the first time in over six months since March 19 this year. At nearly 1.6 lakh, Kerala has more than half of all active cases in the country. India recorded 31,407 fresh cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, as compared with 32,028 on the previous day. India recorded 318 deaths from the virus on Thursday.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad’s particulate matter is seven times WHO-recommended limit||HYDERABAD: Hazardous particulate matter in the air is seven times higher in Hyderabad than the prescribed limit, according to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) revised guidelines. After 16 years, WHO released its guidelines showing how the city’s PM 2.5 and PM 10 (extremely hazardous particulate matters found in smoke and dust) average for 2020, when the city was in a state of lockdown for months was seven times the revised safe limit. Health experts said higher levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 increases the likelihood of several medical conditions, including asthma, preterm birth, low birth weight, depression, schizophrenia, diabetes, stroke and lung cancer. The WHO has updated the annual safe limit for PM 2.5 to 5mg per cubic metre and PM 10 to 15mg per cubic metre. The revised guidelines make it difficult for Hyderabad to meet global standards with its annual PM 2.5 average in 2020 recording 35mg per cubic metre and PM 10 average at 81mg per cubic metre, which was seven times than the WHO safe limits. The PM 2.5, which is the most hazardous of all, continues to be on the higher side,” warned environmentalist Purushottam Reddy. “Cities like Hyderabad, Delhi and Bengaluru have turned into ‘gas chambers’. The country has barely made any effort to even meet the WHO’s 2005 guidelines. If the revised WHO guidelines are not taken seriously now, surviving in Hyderabad too will get difficult in the next few years as there would be large scale health implications.” With the WHO setting a threshold for key pollutants, experts have called for stricter rules to mitigate its health impact. “The WHO’s revised limits have strengthened the argument that even at lower levels, these pollutants pose a risk to human health,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. “Now, there is evidence on how these pollutants have significant health impact. While some blame it on vehicular emission, others attribute it to fossil fuel burning. It’s time the government starts initiating action against major pollutants in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabads-particulate-matter-is-seven-times-who-recommended-limit/articleshow/86468783.cms||Preeti Biswas

Our party has majority and there is no dearth of leaders who can take over as CM, but if you want me to continue the work I do for you 365 days in a year, bless me with one vote, all of you,” Banerjee said at a rally in Puddapukur. While the chief minister was speaking it was still raining, but party officials had made a hangar-like structure with a roof to ensure that the rain couldn’t play spoilsport and fixed the venue at a higher level to prevent waterlogging. “It has been raining for the last four hours. In earlier days, this waterlogging would have taken around a week to recede. But now, in two days most places get dry. Hence, don’t worry about rain and on election day come out to vote. I have announced a holiday for this area, so don’t give any excuses,” she said. Speaking on how BJP and other opposition parties have time and again attacked her, she called herself a “zinda laash (living corpse)”. “I have been attacked so many times, I feel like a ‘zinda laash’. I was attacked in Hazra, Garden Reach, Singur and even during this election I was attacked in Nandigram. But by the blessings of Allah, Guru Govind Singh, Maa Kali, Mahavir Jain and Jagannath, I am still working,” she said to “Didi” chorus from the 400-strong crowd. Praising the cosmopolitan nature of the constituency which has 40% non-Bengali speaking population, Banerjee termed it as mini India and repeated Abhishek Banerjee’s “B for Bengal, B for Bharat” slogan. “I support people from all religions. In the last few days, I have been to a masjid, a gurdwara, a Ganesha puja, a Lakshminarayan temple, a sitala temple and Jain Mandir in this constituency. Wherever I have been I have prayed for you all and not myself,” said Banerjee, who visited the Jain Temple on Heysham Road before coming to the meeting. The CM questioned the justification behind enforcing section 144 in Tripura during the festive season. “How will people celebrate Durga Puja and Diwali if section 144 is being enforced?” Tapping the sentiments of the 5,000-strong Punjabi and Sikh population in the constituency, Banerjee said she supported the protesting farmers’ demand and was in regular touch with representatives leading the protest for eight months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-dont-worry-about-rain-come-out-and-vote/articleshow/86467145.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Business||Income tax portal is in much better shape: Infosys||BENGALRU: After coming under intense scrutiny for technical glitches in the income tax e-filing portal, Infosys has addressed some of the concerns. The company on Thursday said that over 1.5 crore returns have been filed till date. It said over three crore taxpayers have successfully completed various transactions on the portal. It said that in September, more than 15 lakh unique taxpayers on average have logged into the portal daily. But the company acknowledged that some users continue to experience difficulties and said it is working expeditiously, in collaboration with the income-tax department, to address those issues. Over 85% of taxpayers who have filed their returns have also completed their e-verification, largely through Aadhaar OTP authentication. The portal is facilitating over 2.5 lakh returns filing daily and ITR 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are now available for filing, Infosys said. Many of the statutory forms have also been made available online. “Infosys has bounced back compared to where they were. Basic forms of ITR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are fine, but the subsequent forms have to be put to practical use for us to see how they work,” said S Sundar Raman, a chartered accountant (CA) and a member of the finance ministry's 10-member committee mandated to undertake a comprehensive review of the portal and share observations and feedback daily. Sundar Raman said the integration testing hasn’t given the best results for all features and functionalities. The upgraded system has involved major technology transitions in an effort to automate more of the tasks. For ITR utilities, the programming language Java was replaced by JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). “JSON is a lighter version and it increases the speed of processing. The new upgrade was built with a view to automate many tasks. If you pay an insurance premium of more than Rs 2 lakh and if you have a mutual fund of more than Rs 2 lakh, the information gets captured at the source level and shows up automatically when you log in so that you don’t have to key anything manually. If an assessee fails to disclose an interest amount, it triggers a notice. Earlier, Infosys did much of the processing at the central processing centre in Bengaluru, while the software for filing returns was designed by TCS. The effort was to make it one seamless platform. They changed the platform, the compatible files and workflows, and there is insufficient mapping of that,” Sundar Raman said. He said the process where an assessee who makes a foreign payment and who needs a certificate from a CA about TDS eligibility and which then needs to go to the bank, is still not smooth. Other sources also said the integration testing hasn’t given the best results. “The architecture is built on microservices and some of the APIs (application programming interfaces that allow microservices to talk to one another) are not compatible. Some of them should be provided by the income-tax department to work synchronously with the new programme. When APIs are not ready, a developer stub (temporary piece of code) is used till they receive the APIs. But this may not be optimal," one source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/tax-planning/income-tax-portal-is-in-much-better-shape-infosys/articleshow/86468847.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Rejecting her argument that the alleged illegal mining by OMC and its border tussle with Bellari Iron Ore Pvt Ltd (BIOP) were interlinked, Justice Shameem Akther dismissed her petition seeking deferment of trial till the border dispute was resolved and lifted the earlier stay on CBI court proceedings. Reminding her that it is nine years since the case was filed, the judge said, “Due process of law cannot be abused by an accused so as to frustrate the trial procedure on flimsy grounds.” CBI chargesheet claims that Srilakshmi in her previous tenure as secretary of industries and mines in undivided AP connived with OMC promoter and mining baron Gali Janardhan Reddy in granting mining leases in Anantapur. But her counsel K Raghavacharyulu argued that though CBI filed four chargesheets, none referred to the border dispute. “Without addressing that dispute the issue will not attain finality as the charge of cross-border mining can never be determined without determining the borders. It is only when CBI files its final report on border dispute, one can assume that the investigation into the case is complete,” Raghavacharyulu said. “Hence, the trial court cannot proceed without the completion of CBI probe into the issue,” her counsel Raghavacharyulu said. He also said that the CBI had not filed any memo before the trial court to delink the border dispute between AP and Karnataka from the illegal mining case. CBI on its part said that its probe into the OMC illegal mining case was complete and the court was free to start trial. “We will not file any more chargesheets in the trial court on this issue,” CBI counsel K Surender said. Justice Akther, while dismissing Srilakshmi’s plea, said the border dispute had gone up to the Supreme Court which ordered the Surveyor General of India to file a final report. The report filed with SC was accepted by Karnataka, but AP had expressed certain reservations. The SC had left it to the Centre to implement this report and demarcate the border, the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mining-case-telangana-high-court-gives-nod-for-trial-against-y-srilakshmi/articleshow/86468863.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The girl has been admitted at the Kalwa government hospital in Thane district; her condition is stable. Police said of the 26 in their custody, two are minors. The main accused is a 21-yearold named Vijay Fuke, a recovery agent for a private bank. He befriended the girl on a social networking platform. She was raped in January this year and a video made, which was used to blackmail her into having sex with Fuke’s friends. News of the incident drew activists of various parties to Manpada police station. Police said the accused are mostly aged 18 to 20 years; four are between 20 and 25. They are college students, school dropouts or working in low-end jobs. They hail from middle and lower middle-class families. Additional commissioner, Thane police, Dattatrey Karale, said the main accused used the video he shot to coerce her into sexual acts with his “friends on several occasions at different places including Dombivli, Badlapur, Rabale and Murbad area.” The incident came to light after the victim’s aunt found she was continuously getting phone calls on her birthday on Tuesday and looking perturbed. When the aunt probed the matter, she uncovered the sordid sequence of events. The aunt shared the information with the girl’s parents and finally, with the help of an NGO on Wednesday, approached Manpada police who finally booked the accused under sections 376, 376 (N), 376 (3), 376 (D) (A) of IPC and Sections 4,6 and 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Thane police formed a team under assistant commissioner Sonali Dhole to trace the suspects. Dhole said, “Presently 29 accused names have cropped up in victim’s statement.” NCP’s Vidya Chavan blamed the incident partly on unmonitored use of social media by teens. After arrest, 24 of the accused were produced before a Kalyan sessions court which remanded them to police custody till September 29. The two minors were produced before a juvenile court which sent them to the Bhiwandi remand home. Police teams are searching for the remaining culprits. Sources said some of the accused are relatives of local leaders from different parties or party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/15-year-old-girl-gang-raped-for-9-months-in-maharashtra-26-held/articleshow/86468881.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The girl has been admitted at the Kalwa government hospital in Thane district; her condition is reported to be stable. Police said of the 28 in their custody, two are minors. The main accused is a 21-year-old named Vijay Fuke, a recovery agent for a private bank. TimesViewA crime of such gruesome nature must invite the strictest penalty. At a time when sexual offences against minors continue unabated, it is incumbent on Thane police to build a watertight case and ensure the main offenders receive exemplary punishment. The case coming in the wake of the Saki Naka murder focuses attention on the areas where law-enforcers need to increase their efforts.Fuke befriended the girl on a social networking platform. He raped her in January this year and made a video, which was used to blackmail her into having sex with his friends. Police said the accused are mostly aged 18 to 20 years; four are between 20 and 25. They are college students, school dropouts or working low-end jobs. They hail from middle and lower middle-class families. News of the incident soon drew activists of various parties to the Manpada police station in Dombivli (E). Recent cases of violence and crimes against women were highlighted to question the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s performance. Main rape accused used video to blackmail girlAdditional commissioner, Thane police, Dattatrey Karale, said the main accused in the horrific Dombivli gangrape case used the video he shot to coerce the minor into sexual acts with his “friends on several occasions at different places including Dombivli, Badlapur, Rabale and Murbad area”.

The girl has been admitted at government hospital in Kalwa for treatment.” NCP’s Vidya Chavan blamed the incident partly on unmonitored use of social media by teens. “The accused and victim came into contact via social media. My humble request to all parents is to keep a watch on their kids. The wrong usage of mobile phones has increased, and we parents need to keep a watch to avoid such incidents.” After arrest, 24 of the accused were taken to Kalyan sessions court which remanded them in police custody till September 29. The minors were produced before a juvenile court which sent them to the Bhiwandi remand home. Sources said some of the accused are relatives of local leaders from different parties or party workers. After the arrests, parents of some of the accused were waiting outside Manpada police station for updates on the case. The father of one of the accused told TOI, “I don’t think my son can commit such a shameful act, but if he has made a mistake I will ask the police to take strict action against him.” Political activists had gathered in large numbers outside Manpada police station to protest the incident. Maharashtra BJP vice president Chitra Wagh said the ruling MVA government was not serious about the safety of women. “The government is neither implementing the Shakti law, nor filling up the post of the chairperson of the women's commission,” she said. She added that in light of recent cases of violence against women, the demand for a special session called by the governor for the safety of women is justified.

In the stock exchange filing, the bank said pursuant to invocation of pledge of shares, it acquired 50,00,000 equity shares of McLeod Russel, forming 4.7% of paid-up equity share capital of the borrower company, a part of the financially stressed Williamson Magor group. “The equity shares of McLeod Russel India held by lchamati Investments were pledged with the bank for securing the outstanding dues of McLeod Russel India (MRIL), the borrower company,” lnduslnd Bank said, adding it invoked the pledged shares for recovery of its dues from MRIL, one of the world’s largest tea producers. In a major relief to the Khaitans-controlled Williamson Magor group, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) earlier this month has given its approval to withdraw the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against McLeod after its promoters reached a settlement with Techno Electric & Engineering, one of its financial creditors. In June, lnduslnd Bank had acquired 70,67,500 equity shares of McLeod, forming 6.7% of paid-up equity share capital of the borrower company, by invoking pledged shares also for recovery of its dues. Apart from IndusInd Bank, other financial creditors to the company are Indian Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, UCO Bank, Punjab National Bank, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, among others.

Currently, the country has reached the stage of 9% blending. This was disclosed by union minister for petroleum and natural gas and housing and urban development Hardeep Singh Puri. He was in an interactive session with the Young Leaders Forum of ICC here on Wednesday. Puri said that stepping up ethanol blending would be critical for energy security of the country. According to him, India imports almost 85% of liquid hydrocarbons and spends over Rs 12 lakh crore. “We are also importing gas. So our priority is to increase exploration and production (E&P) activities along with ethanol blending,” he added. Puri is also going to Assam to review the new E&P status. Elaborating on ethanol blending, the Union minister pointed out that it had issued a tender for ethanol recently and got a huge response. When asked about whether the ethanol blending might affect food security of the nation, the minister assured that it is looking at alternative materials for procuring bio fuel apart from sugar cane. “We are looking at agricultural waste and even bamboo in the north-east for ethanol. So this should not be a problem,” he added. Commenting on the energy grid, he added that out of targeted 35,000 km of gas pipeline, about 22,000 km has already been completed. “Going for gas and green hydrogen is not only an option, rather there is an imperative,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-eyes-20-ethanol-blending-with-petrol-diesel-by-25/articleshow/86467744.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||FCI’s proposed curbs likely to hit rice mills in Telangana hard||HYDERABAD: The Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) plans to procure only fine rice is set to impact the livelihoods of about 10 lakh people in Telangana in the coming season. Not just this, nearly 1,000 rice mills (handling parboiled rice) are staring at a closure due to the curbs — which are likely to come into effect from the next season —on rice procurement by the FCI. After Telangana came into being, the government had aggressively encouraged paddy cultivation, spawning growth in the number of rice mills across the state. According to rice millers, they will be left with no choice but to shut down their units. “Each rice mill directly employs 200 people. There are about two lakh workers employed across all rice mills in the state. As indirect employment in transport and other linkages in rice production, another eight lakh work in various mills,” said Gampa Nagender, president of the Telangana State Rice Millers Association. Lives of all these people are in jeopardy,” said Gampa Nagender. Stating that the rice mills will continue to operate this season since procurement promise had already been given, Nagender, however, expressed concern over the future of several millers. Currently, the state has over 3,000 rice mills, with approximately 1,000 of them handling only coarse rice. While Telangana cultivates almost 1.6 crore tonnes of paddy in kharif and rabi seasons, 60 per cent of this is parboiled rice (which is partially boiled in the husk). But, the FCI recently said it will purchase only 60 lakh tonnes of fine variety rice, thereby dashing the hopes of mills and workers who deal with parboiled rice. After 2014, paddy cultivation had gone up by 50 per cent in the state and 250 new rice mills had come up. According to industry sources, to set up a rice mill an investment of Rs 15 crore is needed. “With a daily operating cost of Rs 1 lakh, most of which goes towards wages to workers, it’s never easy to run a rice mill,” a mill owner in Miryalaguda said. During a recent review meeting chaired by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, officials said that the future of the rice mills will be in jeopardy if the FCI goes back on rice procurement. The state government pursued the matter with the Union government after the FCI said it will procure only limited quantities of rice. “We are pursuing the matter with the central government. Hopefully, some solution can be found,” Mareddy Srinivas Reddy, chairman of Telangana State Civil Supplies Corporation, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fcis-proposed-curbs-likely-to-hit-rice-mills-in-telangana-hard/articleshow/86468916.cms||Sribaala Vadlapatla
---||Kolkata||Kolkata scientist duo on team that makes insulin ‘fridge-free’||KOLKATA: A team of scientists, including two from the city, have managed to develop a “thermostable” variety of insulin, which eliminates the need to keep it refrigerated. The development is being seen as a breakthrough in scientific circles because, for years now, portability has been the biggest hurdle for insulin-dependent diabetics. The research has been led by two scientists of the Bose Institute and the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB) in the city and two others from the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad. “You will be able to keep it outside the fridge for as long as you want, something that will help diabetics across the world, because carrying insulin along with them was considered very impractical,” said Subhrangsu Chatterjee, a faculty member at Bose Institute. “Though for the moment we are calling it ‘insu-lock’, we are in the process of appealing to the DST (Department of Science and Technology) to name it after Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose,” he added. The research has been lauded by iScience, a science journal of international repute. Chatterjee and Partha Chakrabarti, a faculty member at IICB, along with IICT’s B Jagadeesh and J Reddy, were able to introduce a matrix of four amino acid peptide molecules inside insulin molecules, which prevented solidification of the insulin molecules even when not refrigerated. While insulin has to be now kept at an ideal temperature of 4 °C, this new variety would be able to withstand a temperature of up to 65 °C, the researchers claim. The four-year-long research into the structural design of insu-lock was funded jointly by DST and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). “While the urban rich diabetic patient can still manage to negotiate his life around the fragile nature of insulin, can you imagine the plight of the vast rural and underprivileged population who have no recourse to refrigeration?” Chatterjee said, explaining that degeneration of insulin kept outside refrigeration started six hours later. After 12 hours of staying in normal room temperature, it reaches a stage where it becomes unfit for use. “That is why it is so expensive. We are hopeful that DST and CSIR will now help us go for corporate tie-ups for mass production,” he told TOI.

---||Kolkata||In Jangipur, Abhishek claims Cong-BJP ‘secret alliance’||Jangipur (Murshidabad): Trinamool Congress national general secretary and MP Abhishek Banerjee on Thursday seized the occasion of former Farakka MLA and AICC secretary Mainul Haque’s joining Trinamool at the Jangipur public meeting to rub salt into Congress’ wound. Abhishek pointed to a “secret understanding” between Congress and BJP to buttress his view that only “Didi (Mamata Banerjee)” could remove BJP from power. “Congress claims they too are fighting against BJP. So, what is the difference between TMC and Congress. They have been fighting and losing for the last seven years. TMC has been fighting and winning,” he said. “In 2016, Congress dumped ideology to align with CPM to defeat Mamata Banerjee. And now when Mamata Banerjee’s fight is against BJP, they formed an alliance with a communal outfit to divide votes and help BJP. Can they deny it?” he added. “For last seven years (since 2014), what has Congress done as opposition? What have they done in Parliament? When BJP was passing all anti-people bills, did you see them protest? People know their secret alliance for Lok Sabha polls,” the MP said. Abhishek was focusing on the “Congress-BJP understanding” with an eye on Congress’ Adhir Chowdhury, who was found trailing in four assembly segments with heavy minority community presence of the total seven and got a huge lead from Berhampore in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. BJP wrested the Berhampore assembly seat from Congress this year. Abhishek went the whole hog against Congress in Murshidabad in an attempt to maximize anti-BJP votes. He also sang praises of former President Pranab Mukherjee, once a Jangipur MP, while Mukherjee’s son Abhijeet, who joined Trinamool after assembly polls, sat on the dais. “You voted for the great leader Pranab Mukherjee from Jangipur who later became the President of India. His son Abhijeet Mukherjee also joined our party in June,” the Trinamool leader said. A confident Abhishek said that having defeated BJP in the crucial assembly polls, only “Didi” could unseat the party from power. “All opposition parties have recoiled. Only Trinamool is fighting against BJP,” he said. “What did BJP think? They thought they could scare us with ED and CBI, like they have scared Congress. In the last 15 days, I have received five notices. I have been questioned for nine hours. Even if they call me 500 times, we will not sell our spine. We will, instead, force them (BJP) out of Delhi,” Abhishek said. Many BJP MPs and MLAs were eager to join Trinamool, he added. “But we haven’t thrown open our gates. If we open the gates, BJP in Bengal will be washed out in three months,” he said. Abhishek also promised administrative steps in aid of erosion victims in Samserganj after a section of Dhanghora voters called for a poll boycott.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-jangipur-abhishek-claims-cong-bjp-secret-alliance/articleshow/86467087.cms||Sukumar Mahato
---||Kolkata||NIA charges Chhatradhar, 12 others with ’09 train hijack||Kolkata: The National Investigation Agency on Thursday submitted a charge sheet in the hijacking of the Bhubaneshwar-Rajdhani Express on October 27, 2009 by supporters of a Maoist-linked outfit. The agency had taken up the case on April 1 last year. In the 50-page charge sheet, NIA has given details of the role played by 13 key accused, including Chhatradhar Mahato, his brother Sashadhar Mahato, Maoist leader Kishenji and Vikas. The agency alleged that Chhatradhar was in jail in connection with a different case during the incident and planned the hijacking to ensure his release in exchange. A banned organisation, People’s Committee against Police Atrocities, led by CPI (Maoist), had demanded the release of Chhatradhar and others. Sasadhar was gunned down in an encounter in March 2011, and Kishenji a few months later in a faceoff with CoBRA. Sasadhar had also been a prime suspect in the Jnaneswari Express disaster. Chhatradhar was released from jail by the state government months before the Bengal assembly elections. He was, however, arrested again on March 27 by NIA. There were 30 more people accused in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nia-charges-chhatradhar-12-others-with-09-train-hijack/articleshow/86467031.cms||---

Param Roy Chowdhury, a resident of Charkalgram in Nanoor, was picked up late at night from his home. The smartphone with which he allegedly joined several groups to post inciting comments has been seized and sent for a forensic examination. Police said one Suraj Mondal had lodged a complaint at Kalighat police station on September 13. The Election Commission, too, received specific complaints that police were asked to probe. “In the wake of assembly bypolls, a number of groups were created where the admin (in this case Param) and others started posting communal messages. They also posted obscene materials,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Chowdhury has been booked under the IT Act and various IPC sections. Police didn’t comment on his political affiliations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/birbhum-man-arrested-for-communal-wa-forwards/articleshow/86467187.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolkata||BJP shifts from its core issues, plays victim card||Kolkata: The Bengal BJP kept its core issues like CAA aside and played the victim card citing incidents of post-poll violence and raised civic issues to touch urban minds ahead of the Bhowanipore assembly bypoll. Bengal BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya, while responding to the challenge from Trinamool leaders saying that the party would be washed out if TMC threw open its gates, said: “Ask minister Firhad Hakim to flush out rainwater from the waterlogged stretches first.” He also raised drainage problems in New Town, Agarpara, Dum Dum and adjoining areas and the 12 electrocution incidents in Bengal. Meanwhile, BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal’s chief election agent Sajal Ghosh lodged a complaint with the Election Commission saying she was being prevented from reaching out to voters in Harish Chatterjee Street. The Bengal BJP has decided to hit the streets in north Bengal from Friday over the increasing cases of child deaths. “We will begin an agitation in north Bengal from tomorrow maintaining physical distance,” he added. But the most important aspect of BJP’s narrative was post-poll violence. BJP leaders on Thursday ensured that BJP Magrahat West candidate Dhurjati Saha’s body came to the party headquarters at Muralidhar Sen Lane and projected him as a victim of post-poll violence. Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar claimed he was briefed by a karyakarta and a witness to the case. “He was kicked and punched while Trinamool supporters dragged him down the staircase of the counting centre. He was hit on the head with an iron stick and he collapsed. He had to sacrifice his life simply because he was an opposition candidate,” Majumdar said. Bhattacharya later at a press meet alleged that as many as 52 BJP organizers were killed after the assembly results were declared on May 2. BJP leaders claimed that the names of the accused “Trinamool workers” who attacked Saha were dropped from the FIR lodged at Thakurpukur police station. BJP South 24 Parganas vice-president Sufal Ghantu complained that the names were dropped even after the family named them. “There is no correlation between the complaint lodged by the family and the contents of the FIR,” said BJP leader Debjit Sarkar. Diamond Harbour SP Abhijit Banerjee held that Saha was not hospitalised immediately after he received an injury on May 2. “He was present at the counting centre for two-three hours after the incident. He came to his house and was then sent to the hospital,” he said. The Bengal BJP has called a meeting of the state committee on October 1 to ratify the appointment of Sukanta as the new state president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-shifts-from-its-core-issues-plays-victim-card/articleshow/86467166.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Sept 30 bypoll: EC seeks to file ‘clarification’ affidavit in HC||Kolkata: The Election Commission on Friday sought to file a “short affidavit” in Calcutta High Court clarifying paragraphs 6 and 7 of its September 4 press release announcing the Bhowanipore assembly bypoll on September 30 in which CM Mamata Banerjee is a candidate. The EC’s counsel made the prayer to the division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj following the arguments made by senior lawyer Bikash Bhattacharya challenging the “constitutional crisis and vacuum” plea that Bengal chief secretary H K Dwivedi had purportedly made in his letter to the poll panel. He purportedly referred to Article164(4) of the Constitution that says a minister who is not a member of the state legislature for a period of six consecutive months shall at the expiration of the period cease to be a minister. Petitioner Sayan Banerjee had objected to Dwivedi’s argument, saying a party having 213 MLAs was not in constitutional crisis. He also referred to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the EC press release in which the commission mentioned the “constitutional exigency” and also a “special request” from the state of West Bengal. The division bench will hear the matter again on Friday. Government pleaders felt the adjudication on this matter would in no way affect the conduct of polls because the election process, once started, could not be stopped by any court of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sept-30-bypoll-ec-seeks-to-file-clarification-affidavit-in-hc/articleshow/86467210.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

BJP can’t even imagine who this leader is. MLAs are already joining, and more will come.” Hakim, who was on the campaign trail for CM Mamata Banerjee on Thursday, said Trinamool Congress was not inducing BJP leaders indiscriminately into its fold. Prodded further, he said, "This leader was never with Trinamool." BJP spokesman Samik Bhattacharya said: “TMC should think about ethics and ideology before trying to poach BJP leaders.

Responding to a question about the delay in the approval even as Chinese vaccines have secured the UN agency’s approval, and whether Covaxin can be approved in the upcoming meeting of the WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) scheduled to meet on October 5, Bhushan said: “SAGE is a scientific grouping within WHO. Its meetings are decided by WHO.
