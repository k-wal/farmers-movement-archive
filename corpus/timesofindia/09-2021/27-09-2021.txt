---||Bengaluru||55 years ago, Karnataka’s first sleeper bus hit the roads||BENGALURU: It was 1966 and Bengaluru was agog with news about a brand-new special sleeper bus service introduced from the city to Hubballi. Hundreds had gathered at the bus depot in Shantinagar to catch a glimpse of the exclusive trailer bus fitted with beds, fans, a radio, a record player and even telephones. Dubbed the business class of road travel, it was the first sleeper bus to be introduced in the state. Nikhil Tivari, eight years’ old at that time, accompanied his father to the Mysore State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) bus shed behind the present KSRTC headquarters. “I still remember that day when we walked into that big bus workshop and spotted the light blue and red bodies of two buses linked to each other. The staff then gave us a tour of the inside and there were beds, cushions, lights and a radio,” recalls Tivari, now in his sixties. The Basavanagudi resident was one of the few who got first-hand experience of the state’s celebrated maiden sleeper bus which had everyone talking about.  “It was a sight to see the bus up close and my father captured it all on camera,” adds the nostalgic Bengalurean. According to K Dhanapal, a BMTC driver and historian who is part of the Bengaluru Darshini, a city sightseeing service, the first sleeper bus had its inaugural run in March of 1966 from the then Kalasipalya bus stand. A second sleeper bus was also built, complete with a pair of buses for up and down journeys. A crowd-puller all the way“It was a marvel on the road 55 years ago and everyone on the road would stand awestruck to watch the long bus pass. Many would gather in the evening at the bus stop to see the bus leave to Hubballi and passengers travelling in its eight upper and eight lower berths were viewed with envy,” Dhanapal says. Similar scenes were reported the next morning when the bus from Hubballi reached Bengaluru. History reads that the first sleeper bus was a prestigious project for MSRTC then. In the early 1960s, the state transporter sent a staff named Kannappa to West Germany to study sleeper bus body building. Kannappa returned and built the state’s first sleeper bus for inauguration in 1966 by joining two buses. It had a specially trained driver, two conductors and telephones onboard designed by Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) to communicate between the two coaches on the overnight journey from Bengaluru to Hubballi and back. Despite being a crowd-puller, the service was short-lived as the drivers found maneuvering such a long bus on the road extremely difficult. Within a few years, the buses were taken off service and gradually faded into oblivion. KSRTC’s history book, Sarigeya Suvarna Varshagalu, celebrating 50 years of the utility released in 2011, didn’t even have a reference to the iconic sleeper buses of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/55-years-ago-states-first-sleeper-bus-hit-the-roads/articleshow/86538584.cms||Petlee Peter

According to Sub Inspector of Vajrapukotturu Police Station, Govindarao, "There were six fishermen, all residents of Andhra Pradesh's Srikakulam, on the boat, out of which five fell in the sea due to strong waves". The officer informed that out of these five persons who fell in the sea, three reached ashore safely but, two others died. "One fisherman who was on the boat is still missing," he added. The incident took place around 5.00 pm today when the boat was enroute to Andhra Pradesh from Odisha via sea route. "A team of six fishermen are returning from Odisha on sea route to MN Peta village in Vajrapu kotturu mandal this morning. They reached Gedduru village in Mandasa mandal by evening. At around 5.00 pm, a wave hit the boat and five of them fell into the Bay of Bengal," said Govindarao. Vanka Chiranjeevi, one of the survivors spoke to Andhra Minister Seediri Appala Raju over the phone and requested the Minister to help in search of their missing colleague. The minister Seediri Appalaraju told Chiranjeevi that the state government has informed the matter to navy, and they launched a search operation. A red alert was sounded in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh for a cyclonic warning, and fishermen were alerted to stay away from sea by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cyclone-gulab-2-fishermen-from-andhra-dead-one-missing-after-boat-capsizes-in-bay-of-bengal/articleshow/86538229.cms||---

Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy said the succession is according to the wishes of the deceased seer that his nephew take over the 500-year-old Veerashaiva mutt after him. Thejas, the new seer, is studying in class 8 in a private school in Kamasamudra, Hassan district. “Thejas Devaru will perform his duties as the new seer of the mutt and will also continue his education,” Kuppuru Gadduge Mutt priest BR Girish told TOI. Thejas is the younger child of Mahesh and Kanthamani, who live in the mutt. Mutt officials and family members claimed the boy consented to taking up the responsibility. Yathishwara Shivacharya Swami was admitted to Siddaganga hospital in Tumakuru as he was suffering from Covid-19. He died of a heart attack on Saturday night.  The heads of Kuppuru Gadduge Mutt have been from the same family for the past 500 years. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/boy-13-new-head-of-tkuru-mutt/articleshow/86538698.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Monsoon season extends, so does wait for road repair||BHOPAL: As the rainy season pulls on, giving officials of the agencies responsible for construction and maintenance of roads in the city a handy excuse for not undertaking repairing of roads, residents of the state capital may have to wait for some more time before the pathetic condition of roads improves. In fact, with every spell of rain, the condition of already tattered roads is only getting worse. When it rained on Sunday morning, rainfall lasting half-an-hour was enough to create little pools of water on the pothole-ridden roads- be it Chuna Bhatti, Trilanga, Shapura, Bittan Market and even patches of posh Arera Colony. Condition of service lanes connecting the residential colonies with the main roads is even worse and worsening further as the rains continue to lash the city. "Except for some VVIP areas, roads everywhere else in are in tatters. VIP road, Shahpura, Chuna Bhatti, Hamidia Road, Trilanga, Subhash Nagar- roads are in a bad condition everywhere,” said Vinod Singh, a resident of Chuna Bhatti. He further said that after the CM dissolved CPA- one of the three agencies responsible for maintenance of roads, it appeared that the condition of roads would improve and some patch work had begun also but then, it has been intermittently raining almost daily and the condition of roads has in fact worsened further rather than improving. Vinod is right. Road in Manisha Market was in a bad shape but rains over a period of time have created so many potholes on the road by the side of the sweets shop there that a two-wheeler rider has to craftly dodge those potholes to get into the market from that side. Condition of road connecting Shahpura to Kolar was never good particularly after the BMC carried out laying of pipelines by digging up the road and never fully restored the road but its condition over the past few days has worsened further. Pothoes, craters, broken roads- which turn into smaller and bigger pools of water when it rains- can be seen everywhere on the road towards Kolar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/monsoon-season-extends-so-does-wait-for-road-repair/articleshow/86541305.cms||---
---||World||Merkel’s conservatives & rival SPD neck and neck: Exit polls||BERLIN: Germany’s center-left Social Democrats were locked in a very close race on Sunday with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right CDU/CSU conservative bloc, which is heading toward its worst-ever result in the country’s parliamentary election, projections showed. Top officials from both parties said they hope to lead Germany’s next government and have their candidates succeed Merkel, who has been in power since 2005. Projections for ARD public television, based on exit polls and early counting, put voters’ support at 24.9% for the Social Democrats (SPD) — which is putting forth outgoing Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz for chancellor — and 24.7% for Merkel’s Union bloc under would-be successor state governor Armin Laschet. Separate projections for ZDF public TVput the Social Democrats ahead by 25.6% to 24.4%. Both put the environmentalist Greens in third place with about 15% support. Those results would be the worst for the Union bloc in post-World War II Germany. The electoral system typically produces coalition governments but post-war Germany has never previously seen a winning party take less than the 31% of the vote that the Union won in 1949. That was also the center-right bloc’s worst result until now. Given the exit poll predictions, putting together the next coalition government for Europe’s biggest economy could be a lengthy and complicated process. Merkel will remain as a caretaker leader until a new government is in place. In German elections, the party that finishes first is best-placed, but not guaranteed, to provide the next chancellor. The projections also put support for the business-friendly Free Democrats at about 11% and the Left Party at 5%. The far-right Alternative for Germany — which no other party wants to work with — was seen winning around 11% of the vote. Surrounded by Merkel and his party’s top brass, Laschet said “we can’t be satisfied with the result” predicted by the exit polls. The Union took 32.9% of the vote four years ago. “We will do everything we can to form a government under the Union’s leadership, because Germany now needs a coalition for the future that modernises our country,” he said. Laschet’s likeliest route to power is a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats. The Social Democrats, meanwhile, celebrated a comeback after polling only 20.5% in 2017 and slipping well below that in recent years. Their general secretary, Lars Klingbeil, said “with this, we have the mission to form a coalition”. He wouldn’t say which coalition partners would be approached. Scholz of the Social Democrats could also form a coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats, if the projected results hold up. Scholz said many voters chose his party “because they want a change of goverment and because they want this country’s next chancellor to be Olaf Scholz.” The Greens traditionally lean toward Scholz’s party and the Free Democrats toward Laschet’s. Another possible combination would be a repeat of the outgoing “grand coalition” of Germany’s traditional big parties, the Union and Social Democrats, under whichever of Scholz or Laschet finishes ahead. But neitheris likely to have much appetite for that after forming an often-tense alliance for 12 of Merkel’s 16 years in power. About 60.4 million people in the nation of 83 million were eligible to elect the new Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, which will elect the next head of government. Merkel won’t be an easy leader to follow, for she has won plaudits for steering Germany through several major crises. Her successor will have to oversee the recovery from the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/merkels-conservatives-rival-spd-neck-and-neck-exit-polls/articleshow/86539770.cms||---

---||World||Out-of-control foot soldiers run amok, embarrass Taliban||ISLAMABAD: Despite announcing a general amnesty after taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban foot soldiers have made life hell for the residents of Kabul and other cities with their acts of aggression against their political opponents and officials of the previous US-backed government. Abdul Haq Omari, a correspondent for Afghan Tolo news, has been waiting for his turn to leave the country. Since August 15, he has not spent a night at his home in Kabul. Since taking control of the country, the Taliban have carried out a series of assassinations of political foes. A number of people, including civil and military officials of the past government, were killed and tortured. Their top leadership had immediately announced general amnesty after they entered Kabul. But these incidents of vengeance by the Taliban foot soldiers have become a headache for the group’s top leadership, who have been trying to convince the world that they have changed. Mullah Muhamad Yaqoob, the country’s new defence minister and son of the group’s slain founder Mullah Omar, has been compelled to warn his fighters that their abuses would not be tolerated. In an audio message, the Taliban minister said that some “miscreants and notorious former soldiers” had been allowed to join Taliban units where they had committed a range of sometimes violent abuses. “We direct you keep them out of your ranks, otherwise strict action will be taken against you,” he warned. “Under the general amnesty announced, no mujahid has the right to take revenge on anyone.” According to Afghan journalists, majority of the Taliban fighter have not taken seriously the amnesty issue. “They just know how to fight because this is the only thing they have seen... They are not so organised and disciplined to follow a decree,” Omari, who had lived in the country during the past Taliban regime, told TOI. He said that any statement or order by Mullah Omar, who had ruled the country from Kandahar from 1996 to 2001, was taken in letter and spirit. “No one could dare go against it. The current leadership lacks the command and control over the group that its founder had. This is the reason that Mullah Yaqoob had to release a third audio message for his forces to improve their conduct,” Omari said. Majority of the Taliban fighters stationed in Kabul are from the country’s rural Pashtun speaking areas. Many of them, according to observers, had never seen Kabul and life in other big cities before. Locals said that they act in a weird manner, like driving bumper cars in Kabul’s amusement park. Sporting long beards and wearing turbans, they enjoy taking selfies on swings, slides, merry-go-rounds, etc. In his message, Mullah Yaqoob instructed them to stop taking selfies. “You are damaging our status, which has been created with the blood of our martyrs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/out-of-control-foot-soldiers-run-amok-embarrass-taliban/articleshow/86540896.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said the police and Army's 14 Rashtriya Rifles launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area on Sunday morning, based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists there. He said the holed-up duo opened fire on the approaching team, inviting retaliation in which both were killed. The slain terrorists were identified as Azad Ahmad Shah and LeT district commander Abid Rashid Dar alias Haqani. Some arms and ammunition, including two AK-47 rifles and a pistol, and other incriminating material were found at the encounter site, an official spokesperson said. Dar was a Pakistan-trained terrorist who had crossed over through the Wagah border in April 2018 and returned in 2019, officials said. “Police records show that both the terrorists were involved in planning and executing terror attacks on security establishments and killing civilians. Dar was instrumental in recruiting gullible youth in north Kashmir into LeT," the spokesperson said. Sunday's encounter in Bandipora was the third since July, taking the number of terrorists killed to six. Shah and Dar, along with Pakistani terrorists Usman and Sajad alias Haider, had been involved in the killing of BJP leader Bari, his brother Umar Sultan and his father Bashir Ahmad Sheikh in July last year, Kumar said. Bari, his father and brother were at their shop at Muslimabad in Bandipora district when the terrorists had opened fire upon them, injuring them critically. They were shifted to hospital but succumbed to their injuries soon after. The family had 13 personal security officers (PSOs) but none of them were present at the time of the incident. As the house and shop were in the same place, Bari had allowed the PSOs to sit on the first floor. All13 PSOs have been dismissed from service and arrested as well. Usman and Sajad were killed in an encounter at Kreeri in August last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-district-commander-among-2-terrorists-killed-in-bandipora-encounter/articleshow/86541209.cms||M Saleem Pandit

ADGP (Jammu Zone) Mukesh Singh identified the terrorist as Sheikh Sunain Yousuf — also known as Raja and Sultan — a resident of Gadapora village in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. “During questioning, Yousuf revealed that he was an active terrorist of TRF and had come to Jammu for a ‘specific task’, which had not yet been disclosed to him by his PoK-based handler,” he said. “Yousuf added that his handler — Ahmed Khalid alias Hamza alias Haqparast, an active terrorist/handler of TRF — was also in touch with other terrorist handlers in Kashmir Valley through social networking apps such as Telegram and Signal,” ADGP Singh said. Detailing Sunday’s anti-terror operation, the ADGP said, “Based on intelligence inputs about the movement of a Kashmir-based terrorist to Jammu to carry out a terror attack, Jammu Special Operations Group had set up checkpoints at different locations across the city.” “During checking near Jammu railway station, a scooty driver dropped a pillion rider (Yousuf) around 50-60m away from the checkpoint and speeded away. The latter subsequently rushed towards a nearby bylane with a bag on his back. On noticing the suspicious movement, a police party chased the man and overpowered him at a distance after a hot pursuit,” ADGP Singh said. “A search has been launched to trace two of Yousuf’s accomplices who aided him with reconnaissance support. We believe that links of Jammu-based terrorist handlers and overground workers will also come to the fore,” the ADGP said, adding that a case has been registered and an investigation is in progress. Earlier this year, Jammu Police had foiled a terror plot with the arrest of four terror associates on February 14. A day before that, a joint team of Anantnag and Jammu Police had arrested a TRF terrorist involved in the killing of three BJP workers and a policeman in south Kashmir in 2020. On February 6, a self-styled commander of the proscribed Lashkar-e-Mustafa outfit was captured from Jammu’s Kunjwani area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-police-foil-terror-attack-arrest-trf-terrorist/articleshow/86541347.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Latest surveillance and intelligence reports show the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has constructed new modular container-based accommodations for its soldiers in at least eight more forward locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) opposite eastern Ladakh, say sources. Read AlsoChina obfuscating issues to hinder border talks: Indiandia has accused China of attempting to hinder border negotiations by seeking to confuse the management of the problem on the border with the larger issue of the resolution of the boundary dispute.The newly-constructed troop shelters range from Wahab Zilga near the Karakoram Pass in the north to Piue, Hot Springs, Chang La, Tashigong, Manza and Churup as one goes down south along the LAC. “Each location has 80 to 84 containers arranged in seven clusters,” said a source. These fresh shelters are in addition to the many more such habitats constructed by the PLA since the military stand-off erupted in April-May last year, clearly demonstrating that China has no intent to de-induct troops from the frontlines for the foreseeable future. “We may be feeling the heat of combat deployments at Ladakh, but we have also forced the PLA to go in for prolonged forward deployments and extensive constructions,” said a senior officer. “Apart from costing money, it has affected the morale of the PLA troops. While our troops are used to operating in the harsh mountainous terrain, Chinese soldiers are not,” he added. Both India and China continue to maintain around 50,000 soldiers each, backed by howitzers, tanks and surface-to-air missile systems in the “immediate depth areas” along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. Amidst the uneasy calm, both armies have been regularly rotating their troops due to the harsh terrain and oxygen deprivation in the high-altitude area, while deploying aircraft and drones to keep tabs on each other. China has also developed several new airstrips and helipads all along the 3,488-km LAC, stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, apart from upgrading its major air bases like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa (Ngari Gunsa), Lhasa-Gonggar and Shigatse to base additional fighters and bombers, as was reported by TOI earlier. The PLA has also deployed two Russian-origin S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries, apart from several other anti-aircraft systems, to tackle any air strikes by India. “It is also currently testing a `Big Bird’ phased array target acquisition radar associated with the S-400 systems at Gargunsa,” said another source. India, incidentally, is also slated to begin getting deliveries of five S-400 squadrons by this year-end, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in October 2018.

The PLA has also deployed two Russian-origin S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries, apart from several other anti-aircraft systems, to tackle any air strikes by India. “It is also currently testing a `Big Bird’ phased array target acquisition radar associated with the S-400 systems at Gargunsa,” said another source. India, incidentally, is also slated to begin getting deliveries of five S-400 squadrons by this year-end, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in October 2018.

Prasada was also inducted as cabinet minister on Sunday evening. BJP had recently announced an alliance with NISHAD party in the presence of UP poll in charge Dharmendra Pradhan. Since then, speculations were rife that Sanjay Nishad would be nominated as member of legislative council. The nomination of Gurjar and Bhurji is being seen as BJP’s bid to woo caste votes. Chaudhary Virendra Singh Gurjar, who hails from Kairana in Shamli, is a strong Gurjar leader from west UP region. Chaudhary Virendra had switched loyalty from Samajwadi Party to BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and diligently campaigned for the BJP. His contribution in the Lok Sabha elections was acknowledged by several BJP leaders as it paved the way for the win of party candidate Sanjeev Balyan from Muzaffarnagar. Chaudhary Virendra was an MLC from Samajwadi Party when he had switched loyalty. The fourth BJP nominee, Gopal Anjaan Bhurji, hails from Moradabad. Bhurji community has presence in west UP and some parts of east UP. BJP think tank believes his nomination would help in wooing voters of Bhurji community. The tenures of three nominated members of the legislative council or Vidhan Parishad ended on July 5. All three — Leelawati Kushwaha, Ram Vraksha Yadav, Jitendra Yadav — were nominated by the Akhilesh Yadav government. Besides them, SP’s SRS Yadavdied, which led to four vacancies out of 10 nominated seats in the UP upper House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eye-on-up-polls-yogi-castes-the-net-wide-with-up-mlc-picks/articleshow/86541893.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||India||Ahead of polls, Yogi revamps team to give it caste balance||LUCKNOW: BJP consolidated its ‘sawarn’ (upper caste), non-Yadav-OBC and non-Jatav-SC rainbow social coalition in UP, ahead of the 2022 UP polls, by inducting seven new ministers in an expansion of the Yogi Adityanath ministry on Sunday. They include one Brahmin, while three are from Other Backward Castes (OBCs), two from the Scheduled Castes (both Khatiks) and one from the Scheduled Tribes. The political conglomerate of the above castes gave BJP more than 40% votes and three-fourth majority in the last three elections — 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly polls in UP. The social profile of the new ministers is the same as the seven inducted in the Modi ministry from the state two months ago — signalling the intent to consolidate communities other than Muslims, Yadavs and Jatavs who are either hostile to the party or have staunchly aligned with its rivals. Read AlsoEye on UP polls, Yogi castes the net wide with UP MLC picksThe Yogi Adityanath government in UP on Sunday nominated four names for Vidhan Parishad — Jitin Prasada, NISHAD party chief Sanjay Nishad, Chaudhary Virendra Singh Gurjar and Gopal Anjaan Bhurji. Prasada was also inducted as cabinet minister on Sunday evening.The induction follows BJP’s move to strengthen ties with the Kurmi-aligned Apna Dal, and Nishad Party which represent a group of riverine communities, and giving Union HRD minister Dharmendra Pradhan, an OBC, the charge of UP elections. The appointment of Jitin Prasada, a member of Rahul Gandhi’s team before he crossed over from Congress, reflects the intent to assuage the concerns of Brahmins who are being wooed by BSP and SP. Prasada is the only one of the seven who has been appointed a cabinet minister. The others are ministers of state. Both the representatives of Dalits are Khatiks or Sonkars: Paltu Ram from Balram Pur and Dinesh Khatik from Hastinapur in Western UP, a region which has a good presence of his community. Khatiks have traditonally been well-disposed towards BJP. Sanjay Gond represents STs. The OBC nominees include Dharmveer Prajapati (Kumhar or potter), Chhatrapal Gangawar (Kurmi) and Sangeeta Balwant Bind. Binds are part of the larger Nishad category. BJP had on Friday announced its tie-up with Nishad Party whose leader, Sanjay Nishad, was nominated to the Legislative Council on Sunday evening. The additions in Lucknow on Sunday mirror the inclusions in the Union council of ministers from the state earlier this year. The exercise saw PM Modi bringing in one Brahmin Ajay Mishra, three OBCs including Anupriya Patel, Pankaj Choudhary (both Kurmis), BL Verma (Lodh) and three SCs including Bhanu Pratap Singh (Kori), SP Baghel (Baghel) and Kaushal Kishor (Pasi).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ahead-of-polls-yogi-revamps-team-to-give-it-caste-balance/articleshow/86541782.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||World||US marines reluctantly let a Sikh officer wear a turban. He says it’s not enough||Almost every morning for five years, 1st Lt. Sukhbir Toor has pulled on the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps. On Thursday, he also got to put on the turban of a faithful Sikh. It was a first for the Marine Corps, which almost never allows deviations from its hallowed image, and it was a long-awaited chance for the officer to combine two of the things he holds most dear. “I finally don’t have to pick which life I want to commit to, my faith or my country,” Toor, 26, said in an interview. “I can be who I am and honor both sides.” His case is the latest in a long-running conflict between two fundamental values in the U.S. military: the tradition of discipline and uniformity, and the constitutional liberties the armed forces were created to defend. While Sikh troops in Britain, Australia and Canada have long worn turbans in uniform, and scores of Sikhs do so now in other branches of the military, Toor’s turban is the first in the 246-year history of the Marine Corps. For generations, the Marine Corps has fought any change to its strict appearance standards, saying that uniformity was as essential to a fighting force as well-oiled rifles. The Marine Corps has made the allowance only to a point. Toor can wear a turban in daily dress at normal duty stations, but he cannot do so while deployed to a conflict zone, or when in dress uniform in a ceremonial unit, where the public could see it. Toor has appealed the restrictive decision to the Marine Corps commandant, and he says that if he does not get a full accommodation, he will sue the Marines. “We’ve come a long way, but there is still more to go,” he said. “The Marine Corps needs to show it really means what it has been saying about strength in diversity — that it doesn’t matter what you look like, it just matters that you can do your job.” For the Marine Corps leadership, an exception as small as one man’s turban was seen as so potentially dangerous that Toor’s request went all the way to top Marine Corps authorities. Their initial reaction in June was largely a denial. In a stern response, one Marine Corps general warned that individual expression of that kind could fray the fabric of discipline and commitment that binds the Marines. It could erode the nation’s trust in the Marines. It could undermine combat effectiveness. It could cost lives. “The Corps cannot experiment with the components of mission accomplishment,” Lt. Gen. Michael Rocco, deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, said in the response. “Failure on the battlefield is not an acceptable risk.” Toor appealed to the commandant of the Marine Corps, which retreated a bit in August, allowing him to wear a beard and turban in limited circumstances. The Marine Corps’ argument, time after time, has been that change could hobble its ability to fight. “In order to build squads that will move forward in a combat environment where people are dying, a strong team bond is required,” Col. Kelly Frushour, a spokesperson for Marine Headquarters, said in written responses to questions from The New York Times about Toor’s case. “Uniformity is one of the tools the Corps uses to forge that bond. What the Corps is protecting is its ability to win on the battlefield, so that the Constitution can remain the law of the land.” Toor grew up in Washington, D.C., and Ohio, the son of Indian immigrants. His father wore a beard, a turban and other symbols of Sikh religious devotion, including a simple steel bracelet and small blade that are meant to remind faithful Sikhs that they are expected to act as virtuous — and, if necessary, armed — defenders of the innocent and oppressed. Growing up in the wake of 9/11, Toor knew that many Americans wrongly associated Sikhs with dangerous religious fanatics. He hoped his military service would help change that. He joined the Marines after college in 2017, knowing he would at least initially have to forgo the physical symbols of his faith, but he was willing to make the sacrifice. “I felt there was a debt to be paid,” he said about his choice. “My family came to this country seeking the American dream, and we got it.” Believing it was wrong to ask for anything before he had given of himself, he shaved daily and wore a Marine Corps utility cap for years without complaint. When he was selected this spring for promotion to captain, he decided it was time. He wrote his formal request for a religious accommodation in April. Two months later, he got a decision from the head of manpower and reserve affairs. After lecturing him on the dangers of his request, the decision letter granted the accommodation — but with so many caveats that it amounted to a denial. Toor would be allowed wear a beard and turban whenever he wanted, as long as it was not while he was deployed, serving in a combat unit that might deploy or performing ceremonial duties in dress uniform. How often might those circumstances occur? “Like, every day,” Toor said with a laugh in a telephone interview over the summer from Darwin, Australia, where he was training with American and Australian forces. “That is just what I do. I’m a combat arms officer.” Toor said the Marine Corps' limits meant that “I would have to either sacrifice my career or my ability to practice my religion.” After he appealed the decision, the Marine Corps retreated somewhat on ordinary duty but refused to budge on wearing a turban during ceremonial duties. The rationale was that the Marine Corps must sometimes limit individual religious rights to avoid appearing partial to any particular faith. “Marines represent the entirety of the Marine Corps,” said Frushour, the Marine Corps headquarters spokesperson. “Therefore, we strive to present a neutral image to the public. The Marine Corps wants all with the propensity and ability to serve to see a place for themselves within our ranks.” Toor worries that the opposite is true — that the hard stance on beards and turbans will make Muslims, Sikhs and others less likely to serve and deny them equal opportunity. “Sikh kids growing up might not be able to see themselves in uniform,” he said. “Even if they want to serve, they might not think their country wants then.” Toor said he hoped the Marine Corps would see the advantages of allowing more freedom of religious practice without a court battle. “It doesn’t matter what size, shape, color, gender you come in,” he said. “If you meet the standard, you meet the standard, and that makes you a Marine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-marines-reluctantly-let-a-sikh-officer-wear-a-turban-he-says-its-not-enough/articleshow/86541918.cms||---
---||World||Swiss vote yes to same-sex unions||GENEVA: Nearly two-thirds of Swiss voters backed the government's plan to introduce same-sex marriage in a referendum held Sunday, with campaigners calling it a historic day for gay rights in Switzerland. With results in from 20 of the wealthy Alpine nation's 23 cantons, 64 percent of voters backed the move, on a 52 percent turnout. Switzerland was one of the last countries in western Europe where same-sex marriage remained illegal. The government's "marriage for all" proposals were challenged by opponents, who successfully triggered a referendum. "The Swiss have dropped a massive 'yes' into the ballot box," Olga Baranova, a spokeswoman for the "yes" committee, told AFP. She was at a restaurant in the Swiss capital Bern hosting the "yes" campaign's celebrations -- decked out in balloons in the rainbow colours -- where drag artist Mona Gamie sang Edith Piaf's "Hymn to Love" to rapturous applause. "Today does not change my country," Baranova said. "Today reflects the change of mentality over the last 20 years. It is really the reflection of a very broad and very important acceptance of LGBT people in society." Switzerland decriminalised homosexuality in 1942, but numerous local and regional police forces continued to keep "gay registers", some into the early 1990s. Same-sex couples can already register a civil partnership, with around 700 established each year. However, this status does not provide the same rights as marriage, including for obtaining citizenship and the joint adoption of children. After years of debate and discussion, the Swiss parliament approved a bill last December allowing same-sex couples to marry in the country of 8.6 million people. But it was challenged under Switzerland's direct democracy system, with opponents gathering the 50,000 signatures needed to put the issue to a referendum. Deborah Heanni, a member of the Libero collective which campaigned for "yes", told AFP: "After eight years of campaigning, we are happy finally to be able to celebrate this victory." Jan Muller of the "yes" committee said: "It is a historic day for Switzerland, a historic day when it comes to equality for same-sex couples, and it is also an important day for the whole LGBT community." The law change will allow same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies and provide them with the same rights as those enjoyed by other married couples. Foreign spouses will become eligible to apply for citizenship through a simplified procedure, and same-sex couples will be permitted to jointly adopt. And, in what proved the most controversial aspect of the referendum campaign, lesbian couples will have access to sperm donations. The right-wing populist Swiss People's Party (SVP) -- Switzerland's largest political party -- called for a "no" vote. Opponents plastered Swiss cities with stark posters decrying the commodification of children and warning the law will "kill the father". One poster showed a crying baby with its ear tagged like cattle, and the question: "Babies on demand?" Another featured a huge zombie-like head meant to represent a dead father. "Everyone will be disappointed," Yohan Ziehli, vice president of the SVP in the French-speaking Vaud canton in western Switzerland. "Parliament made the tactical choice to link two subjects that should not have been, namely the question of parentage which has been hidden behind the shield of marriage for all in order to guarantee its success," he told broadcaster RTS. A second vote was held alongside the referendum, on an initiative brought forward by the youth wing of the Socialist Party, titled "Reduce taxes on wages, tax capital equitably". Proponents of the so-called "99 percent" initiative wanted greater taxation on high levels of capital income, with the revenues generated used to reduce income taxes for the less well off. Results so far showed that 65 percent voted against the measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/swiss-vote-yes-to-same-sex-unions/articleshow/86542097.cms||---

Just as the ceremony was to begin, the Congress leadership decided to induct four-time Amloh MLA Randeep Singh Nabha in place of PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s loyalist Kuljit Singh Nagra, who had been part of the original shortlist. While that came as a surprise, the party chose to ignore mounting opposition from a group of MLAs from the Doaba region to the inclusion of Rana Gurjit Singh. Besides Nabha and Rana Gurjit, the new faces in the Cabinet are Raj Kumar Verka, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Pargat Singh, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Gurkirat Singh Kotli. At 43, Warring is the youngest of the ministers. Among the seven, only Rana Gurjit has been a minister before. Sources said Rahul Gandhi’s intervention on Saturday night led to Nagra making way for Nabha. Since Nagra is believed to be close to the leadership, he was a picture of compliance. “I have decided not to be part of the Cabinet, as I had earlier submitted my resignation on the farmers’ issue. I stand with the farmers’ agitation,” Nagra, who is one of the four PCC working presidents, tweeted. After the swearing-in, he said, “It was my personal decision to resign (from the assembly) for the sake of the farmers, and then I could not have become a minister.” Congress decided to reinduct two loyalists of former CM Amarinder Singh into the new ministry — Brahm Mohindra and Vijay Inder Singla. The other former ministers who retained their Cabinet berths include Manpreet Singh Badal, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Aruna Chaudhary, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Razia Sultana and Bharat Bhushan Ashu. Among the former ministers who didn’t make the cut, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Gurpreet Singh Kangar made their displeasure known by questioning the rationale behind their omission from the list. Congress’s Punjab minder Harish Rawat said young blood had been inducted while maintaining social and regional balance. On the outburst by two former ministers, he said, “We have decided that those who could not find a place in the cabinet will be given other responsibilities in the party and government. No one has been dropped, and the idea was to include seven new people in the cabinet. They (those who didn’t retain their berths) will be serving in other capacities.” In the morning, MLAs Navtej Cheema and Khaira had met Navjot Sidhu at the latter’s Patiala residence to oppose Rana Gurjit’s selection. Apprehensive of such reactions from within the party, the Congress leadership had decided not to release an official list ahead of the swearing-in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/last-minute-drama-over-shortlist-as-15-punjab-ministers-take-oath/articleshow/86542102.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||India||Singhu swells for today’s Bharat bandh||NEW DELHI: Mobilisation of farmers opposed to the new farm laws is in full swing for the Bharat bandh on Monday. Their presence at the Singhu protest site along the Delhi-Haryana border has considerably swelled. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has called the nationwide strike and appealed to all organisations of workers, traders, transporters, businessmen, students, youth and women to voluntarily participate in it from 6am to 4pm. Considering support of political parties including Congress and trade unions, the bandh is expected to be wider than the previous one, as the farm groups appear to be more organised in states beyond Punjab, Haryana, western UP and parts of Rajasthan. Geared up for the bandh, the farmers on Saturday said they were determined not to leave the protest site till the government accepts their demand and repeal the three central farm laws. “We’ll not leave the place. No matter if we have to be here for another year,” said Sukhdev Singh, elderly farmer from Ludhiana. He has been at the Singhu border protest site for the past 10 months. Every farmer TOI spoke to at the protest site shows similar determination while flagging how their number has consistently been increasing and the road stretch they covered on highways has been getting longer. On whether participating in the protests would affect their farming operations, young farmer Rajdeep Singh of Amritsar said, “We have been joining the protest in rotation. I am here while my father and other family members are there in the village to look after farming operations”. Though their number may slightly decrease during peak harvest season from October end to mid-November, they will be back after sowing Rabi crops, and be there at protest sites in bigger numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/singhu-swells-for-todays-bharat-bandh/articleshow/86542153.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||India||China obfuscating issues to hinder border talks: India||NEW DELHI: India has accused China of attempting to hinder border negotiations by seeking to confuse the management of the problem on the border with the larger issue of the resolution of the boundary dispute. In a sharp response to China’s allegation that India has complicated the settlement of the border conflict with the larger boundary dispute, Indian ambassador in China Vikram Misri said that it is Bejing that has been seeking to shift goalposts. Addressing an India-China event last week, Misri delineated obstacles in the resolution of the boundary dispute. “The first is to avoid shifting goalposts. For long, the Indian and Chinese sides have adhered to a well-understood distinction between resolving the boundary question and managing border affairs,” he said. “The 1988 understanding between our leaders was precisely for keeping the resolution of the boundary question on a track separate yet parallel to the bilateral relationship, with the maintenance of peace and tranquillity as the prerequisite,” he said. Significantly, the two sides may be holding the next round of border talks in the coming days. The border negotiations currently on are about Chinese actions of 2020, which resulted in the stand-off and violent incidents in Galwan valley. It has taken several rounds of discussions as well as high-level intervention at the foreign ministers’ level for some disengagement in Galwan, north and south banks of Pangong Tso and Gogra. But other areas remain unresolved. Stressing that India’s position on boundary negotiations had not changed, Misri said, “This is the root cause of the tense situation along the borders. We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations.” The Chinese side, instead, has been engaged in diplomatic gaslighting, accusing India of linking the boundary question. “A serious violation of peace and tranquillity in the border areas naturally requires us to apply our minds on the basis of established agreements, protocols and mechanisms to resolve it. As we do so, any attempt to confuse border affairs with the Boundary Question is a disservice to the work of those involved in finding solutions,” he said. The second obstacle, he said, was “to take a one-sided view of concerns and sensitivities, where one’s own preoccupations trump any of those flagged by the other side,” he said. India-China relations, he quoted Jaishankar, was based on three “mutuals”: “Mutual respect, mutual sensitivities, mutual interests.” “In an international community where we interact as equals, and as important major neighbours of each other, it cannot be that only one side’s concerns are of relevance while the other side’s case goes unheard," he said. “And to press one's own concerns and disregard the other side’s concerns and sensitivities without any explanation or recourse goes beyond disrespect. It actually creates even more obstacles to finding solutions,” he added. “The third obstacle is viewing bilateral relations through the prism of relations with other countries. We are two ancient civilisations and two modern Asian nations who have evolved their own independent foreign policies and cherish their own strategic autonomy,” he said. “India-China relations, therefore, must be judged and managed on their own merits. They are substantial enough and sufficiently complex that they require their own approach and appropriate handling, without imaginary third factors complicating them further and distracting us from working on our priorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-obfuscating-issues-to-hinder-border-talks-india/articleshow/86542270.cms||---

You are entitled to it,” he said. Acknowledging that the representation of women in judiciary, especially in the constitutional courts, remain dismal, he added, “It’s high time we have 50% representation of women in the judiciary. I will be very happy the day this goal is achieved." Justice B V Nagarathna, who would be the first woman CJI in 2027, said, “Appointment of three women judges (recently in SC) will inspire women in other branches of governance to break the glass ceiling”. At a time when the Union government is still at the proposal stage for reserving 50% panchayat membership for women, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Sunday strongly batted for 50% quota for women in all spheres of activity, urging them to “shout and demand” for this right. The CJI said women must unite to seek their legitimate rights as they have nothing to lose but their chains. “You have to shout and demand that we need 50% reservation. It is not a small issue. It is an issue emerging from thousands of years of suppression. It is high time we had 50% representation of women in the judiciary. You are entitled to it. It is a matter of right. Nobody is doing any charity (by giving 50% reservation to women),” he said. The CJI’s strong backing for women’s right to 50% reservation came during a function organised by the Supreme Court Women Advocates Association to felicitate nine new SC judges, including three women — Justices Hima Kohli, B V Nagarathna and Bela M Trivedi. In its 71 year-long existence the SC had only 11 women judges, including the three new judges. It got its first woman judge in M Fathima Beevi in 1989. At present it has four women judges among a working strength of 33 judges. The CJI said the representation of women in judiciary, especially in the constitutional courts, have been dismal. He said one of the main deterrent for women to enter the legal profession is the lack of women-friendly infrastructure. A thin gathering of women advocates cheered on as the CJI spoke. Justice Nagarathna, who would go on to become the first woman CJI in 2027 albeit for little over a month, said, “Appointment of three women judges will inspire women in other branches of governance to break the glass ceiling. Higher numbers and greater visibility of women Judges can increase willingness of women to seek justice and enforce their rights through courts. This is a monumental achievement of the SC.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shout-demand-50-quota-in-all-spheres-cji-urges-women/articleshow/86542318.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Cases in Kerala saw a weekly fall of 8.7% while Maharashtra logged a decrease of 6.8%. At the same time, cases rose by 8% in Mizoram and 3% in Tamil Nadu as compared with the previous week. Himachal Pradesh logged a rise of 15.9% and J&K 2.9%, while fresh infections in Bengal stayed at the same level as last week. India logged nearly 2,00,500 new cases during the week (September 20-26), as compared with 2,14,221 last week. This was the fourth consecutive week of declining cases in the country, after infections rose for a week following a massive spike in Kerala. This week's count was also the lowest since 1.55 lakh cases were recorded in March 29-April 4, when the second wave was building up in the country. At 2,001, India also recorded the fewest deaths from the virus in six months since March 22-28, when the weekly toll was 1,875. The fall in Covid numbers was mainly on account of cases in Kerala dropping for the three week in succession as the post-Onam wave in the state continued to wane. However, in absolute terms, the numbers from Kerala remained high. The state recorded more than 1.21 lakh fresh cases, at a daily average of 17,346, accounting 60.6% of all new cases in the country during the week. The slow rise of Covid infections continued in Tamil Nadu for the third week running. The state logged 11,886 fresh cases, up marginally from 11,541 last week. In each of the previous two weeks, Tamil Nadu saw cases increase by 3.4% and 3%, respectively. The Covid situation in Mizoram continued to be grim. This was the fifth straight week of rising cases in the state, although the rate of increase slowed to 8% from 18% last week. Mizoram recorded 8,995 fresh cases in the week, the fourth highest count in the country after Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. While Maharashtra continued to record a fall in infections, the pace of decline remained slow. As opposed to this week's count of 22,410 cases, the state had reported 24,038 in the previous week. Meanwhile, India recorded just over 27,000 new cases on Sunday, with Kerala reporting 15,951. The day saw 276 deaths from the virus. Kerala again recorded the highest number of fatalities at 165, followed by Maharashtra (36), Tamil Nadu (14), Karnataka and Bengal (nine each).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-2-lakh-india-logs-lowest-weekly-cases-in-6-months/articleshow/86542354.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||World||Thousands of Afghans flee to Iran as uncertainty grows under Taliban regime||KABUL: Since the Taliban took over power in Afghanistan, thousands of Afghani people have fled to its neighbouring country, Iran, as uncertainty grows in the troubled country, according to media reports. A former Afghan policeman who says he is out of work under the new Taliban government is one of the thousands of Afghans who has fled over the border to Iran in recent weeks, Voice of America (VOA) reported. Abdul Ahad, a 22-year-old former officer, told VOA that he is leaving the country because he "has no hope for a future" in Afghanistan. "I lost my job, and I am forced to leave (Afghanistan) searching for a job so I can feed my family," said Ahad, who worked for four years as a policeman in western Farah province. He said, "I do not know what I will be doing in Iran, but at least I will be able to find a job there, earn some money and send it back to my family." Multiple sources and eyewitnesses in the border city of Zaranj, the capital of southwestern Nimruz province, have confirmed to VOA that after the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, thousands of Afghans, fearing economic hardships and political persecution under the Taliban, are fleeing over the border to Iran. Ahad added that many of his former colleagues in the Afghan security forces had already left for Iran. "Some left because of economic problems, but others fled fearing the Taliban's reprisal," he said. It is been over a month when the Taliban captured Kabul after an aggressive and rapid advance against Afghanistan government forces amid the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country. The country plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed. Earlier, the Taliban announced a "general amnesty" for all Afghan government officials and urged them to return to work, including women corresponding with Sharia law. But, the older generations remember the ultraconservative Islamic regime that saw regular stoning, amputations and public executions during Taliban rule before the US-led invasion that followed the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. The Taliban have ruled in accordance with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law and though the outfit has sought to project greater moderation in recent years, many Afghans remain sceptical. Also, appointing hardliners in its new government who oversaw the 20-year fight against the US-led military coalition, with no women included shows what lies in store for the Afghan women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/thousands-of-afghans-flee-to-iran-as-uncertainty-grows-under-taliban-regime/articleshow/86542330.cms||---
---||India||Pay anomaly: Why Colonels earn more than Lt Generals||CHANDIGARH: Anomalies in salary and pension of lower ranks of defence services are often highlighted, but the issue of a glaring anomaly related to salary mismatch among the senior ranks of the military, major general and above, has been pending for years now. The central government has failed to address the anomaly whereby senior rank officers are getting paid lower salary and pension than their juniors. In certain cases, even colonels are drawing more than lieutenant-generals. The crux of the anomaly is the addition of the military service pay (MSP) component, amounting to Rs 15,500, to the salaries of officers till the rank of brigadier. After the rank of brigadier, while the component is subsumed and added on promotion for ranks above major general, the same is not added as a separate element, as a result of which officers of lower ranks get paid more than those of the higher ranks.  While a lieutenant-colonel, colonel and brigadier can get paid up to Rs 2,26,200, Rs 2,29,500 and Rs 2,33,100 per month, respectively, after adding the MSP component, the Vice-Chief of the Army Staff cannot get paid more than Rs 2,25,000. With the addition of the special component, the salary scales of senior officers from lieutenant-colonel to brigadier surpass those of major-general to lieutenant-general. Sources in the ministry of defence (MoD) say that then defence minister Arun Jaitley had addressed the anomaly but the file was reportedly closed by officers of the finance ministry without referring it back to him. Later, the case was again initiated but was bogged down by multiple queries by the finance ministry, which the sources termed ‘exhausting and out-of-context’. Another related issue is that of pensions wherein despite the existence of a protection clause, many generals are being paid lower pensions than their juniors. Explaining the issue, an officer of the MoD said that while the clause protects pensions of major-generals vis-à-vis brigadiers to an extent, it does not protect higher ranks and even the existing protection has become redundant for retirees after 2016 with hundreds of retired generals receiving lower pensions than admissible, adding that the ministry is trying its best to sort the issue out, with the situation being anomalous on the face of it. The sources point out that while it is accepted that there is an urgent need to implement the directions of the high court that were passed almost two years ago, nobody was taking responsibility or showing the way on how or who would do it, while the affected officers suffer a loss every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pay-anomaly-why-colonels-earn-more-than-lt-generals/articleshow/86542376.cms||Ajay Sura

The purpose behind the aerial spectacle, as Group Captain and flypast director Kamran Nazeer put it, was to make a connect with the Valley’s youths and inspire them to consider and aspire for a career in the IAF, whether as a pilot, engineer or a member or the Orchestra. The idea to organise an airshow in Srinagar, which could not be held for over a decade due to security concerns, came from the IAF and was was immediately endorsed by LG Manoj Sinha. On Sunday, Sinha flagged off the event attended by over 600-700 youths, mostly school and college students. Elaborate arrangements were made to keep the event in the skies secure and smooth. A visual delight awaited the young members of the audience as Sukhoi and MiG jets displayed ‘aerobatic’ feats; Chinook choppers flew sideways and came low enough to cause the Dal surface water to literally rise and fly. Suryakiran jets made formations that included a heart in the sky. Organised as part of the 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations, the airshow’s dominant theme was “Give Wings to Your Dream”. Group Captain Nazeer elaborated: “The main aim of the exercise was to motivate the youths of the valley to join IAF, by showcasing the possibilities that await them if they do so. They can fly jets or be musicians. Besides we too are inspired by their enthusiasm as they they have turned up in huge numbers on a Sunday morning to watch us”. College student Rather told TOI that he aspired to be in the forces and had even appeared for NDA exam. He said he was now even more keen to be a part of IAF. His female co-pupil Hafsa too was excited about women being allowed to take the NDA exam and said she was already part of NCC and would be glad to join the forces. The youths who were invited to the airshow were versed with recruitment process of the IAF at kiosks set up at the venue. Traffic restrictions were put on the Boulevard Road as a security measure, though it did get some locals to complain that they were denied an opportunity to witness the aerial display from close quarters. The restrictions were lifted post the airshow. The major attractions of the Sunday’s airshow included paramotor, powered hang-glider, and Akash Ganga Sky diving team. Besides, the symphony orchestra of the IAF played popular songs including from films shot in Kashmir, like Roja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-airshow-in-srinagar-after-13-years/articleshow/86542423.cms||Bharti Jain

The deputy minister said that representatives of a number of countries have visited Afghanistan and they (the Taliban) have also sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General for recognition, The Khaama Press reported. Mujahid said that this is their right to be recognised and added that the leaders of the Taliban are busy talking with the UN. Respecting human and women's rights, forging an inclusive government, and not allowing Afghanistan to be safe haven for terrorism and extremism are the conditions put by the international community for recognising the Taliban. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has promised to be implementing all these, but none of them seems to be implemented yet, The Khaama Press further reported. Meanwhile, Russia, United States, Japan, Canada, France, UK have expressed that the countries are not planning to recognise the government formed by the Taliban. It is been over a month when the Taliban captured Kabul after an aggressive and rapid advance against Afghanistan government forces amid the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country.

Foreign travellers will soon be able to arrive directly in Srinagar,” civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said at a joint press conference with J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha. The media interaction followed a detailed review of all aviation matters related to the J&K, by Sinha and Scindia. Sources said Sharjah was chosen as the first destination in view of the heavy volume of business between traders from J&K, particularly those dealing in horticulture produce, and retail outlets in Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The immigration infrastructure is already in place in J&K, said an officer. “More than 77 stores in Sharjah — mostly owned by Lulu hypermarket chain — source their supplies of dry fruits etc largely from J&K. Similarly, over 60 such stores in Abu Dhabi get supplies from J&K. So there is a high demand of business-rela-ted travel between Srinagar and Sharjah, which is also a convenient transit point to reach Dubai and Abu Dhabi,” a source told TOI. Earlier too, Srinagar handled international flights but they were only for Hajj pilgrims. Meanwhile, among the other outcomes of Saturday’s review meeting by Sinha and Scindia was the former’s assurance to hand over 122 acre land in Jammu by October 10, 2022, for the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to start work on a new 25,000 sq metre terminal at a cost of Rs 600 crore. Srinagar airport too is being expanded from 22,000 sq metre to 63,000 sq metre with an investment of Rs 1500 crore, said Scindia. The cargo terminal at Srinagar airport will open for business by October 1, he added. A paid premium lounge has also been approved for Srinagar airport and the bidding process may begin by September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-places-srinagar-on-international-aviation-map/articleshow/86542520.cms||Bharti Jain

This was announced by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma during a meeting with several leading organizations of the Tai-Ahom community here on Sunday. Even as the prime demand of the Tai-Ahoms and five other communities of Assam for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status remained unresolved, the CM urged Tai Ahom organisations and Tribal Sangha members to sit for a discussion to sort out issues for moving forward. But the CM said the state government has already agreed in-principle to send recommendation to accord ST status to the Matak community to the Union government. The All Assam Tribal Sangha, the apex body of the tribal organizations of the state, have been critical about enlisting six more communities in the ST category which it feels will severely hamper the political interests of the existing tribal communities. The Centre introduced the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in the Rajya Sabha on January 9 the same year with the aim of granting ST status to six communities in Assam, which are currently enjoying OBC status. The names of six communities — Koch Rajbongshi, Tai Ahom, Chutia, Matak, Moran and Tea Tribes — featured in the Bill for granting ST status. But these communities have not yet got the status as it has to be ascertained by the state government before the Bill can be passed in Parliament. A state cabinet committee headed by the then cabinet minister Sarma was given the responsibility to decide on the quantum of reservation for the six communities which remains pending. Nevertheless, the CM assured a slew of other plans for the politically influential community, saying a Tai Language Teaching Centre would be set up by the state government to sustain and popularise the language. He added that Sukapha Samannway Kshetra at Jorhat would be turned into a top tourist attraction and all works would be completed within two years. A Tai museum at Joysagar and Joymoti Museum on Rang Ghar premises in Sivasagar, the seat of Ahom glory that was their erstwhile capital region, would be built, he informed. He also said all places of worship of Ahoms will be preserved and developed under Asom Darshan scheme of the state government and a statue of Sukapha, the founder of Ahom dynasty, will be built at the state secretariat Janata Bhawan in Guwahati. Sarma said all indigenous communities of Assam must remain united so that Sukapha’s Assam can be protected from infiltrators. The CM said Rs 125 crore committed to Tai Ahom Development Council would be released by November 30. He also assured that the proposal of setting up Swargadeo Sukapha University would be considered. In another meeting with the Matak community organizations, the CM said Sodou Asom Matak Sanmilan will be made the sole body for granting OBC certificates to the members of the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-to-give-protected-class-tag-to-ahoms-in-tribal-blocks-belts/articleshow/86539844.cms||---

While those aged above 65, those with co-morbidities, children and pregnant women have been advised to “stay at home” during the upcoming festival. The government has also urged the central puja committee to “cause widespread awareness on restricting inter-locality movement” during the celebrations. “However, those who are fully vaccinated may attend the puja celebrations,” the order added. “All puja activities should conclude by 10pm, subject to relaxation of curfew timings,” the order said.

Even the most-affected districts declined to 25 in July 2021 from 35 prior to April 2018. A few new areas, however, have been identified as potential locations for emergence of Naxalism. To impede the expansion plans of CPI (Maoist) and also to restrict them to bounce back in the areas recently taken away from LWE influence, eight districts have been categorised as ‘districts of concern’. The revised categorisation is a more realistic representation of the current LWE scenario, the home ministry said in a release on a meeting chaired by Amit Shah on Sunday with the CMs of 10 states or their nominees. Addressing the CMs, Shah said there has been a lot of success due to the joint efforts of the Centre and states in cracking down on Left-wing extremism. He said that while the LWE incidents were down by 23%, the number of deaths had reduced by 21%. Shah said after decades of fighting Maoists, a point has been reached where the annual death toll is less than 200 for the first time. The fatalities declined by 82% from all-time high of 1,005 in 2010 to 183 in 2020. The area under Maoists’ influence too shrunk from 96 districts in 2010 to 53 in 2020. These miscreants have been pushed to a few pockets with only 25 districts accounting for 85% of the LWE violence in the country. The fight against the LWE menace is now in crucial stage and the government is optimistic of reducing the menace to an “insignificant level” at the earliest, said Shah. He added that the fight had reached its end and it needs to be accelerated and made decisive. Shah said to completely get rid of the LWE problem, the full development of the country and the states affected by it needs to be ensured. The Naxal review meeting on Sunday was attended by the CMs of Bihar, Odisha, Maharashtra, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand and the home minister of Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deaths-in-naxal-attacks-down-by-21-shah-at-cms-meeting/articleshow/86543018.cms||---

The voter’s name is Prashant Kishor. According to local sources, Kishor’s Kolkata address is 121 Kalighat Street, not very far from chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s 30B Harish Chatterjee Street home and Abhishek Banerjee’s home on Harish Mukherjee Road.

This is besides the euphoria on social media that made ‘FRSH’ the top trending stock in terms of buys and search volumes last week, beating the likes of Tesla and Microsoft. A large number of first-time investors from India — mainly techies and those part of the startup community — also created new accounts to invest in Freshworks, it is learnt. Vested Finance co-founder and CEO Viram Shah said that in the run-up to the listing, investment inquiries soared and over Rs 2 crore has been invested in the Freshworks stock till date, and it has been the number one stock on the platform in the first three days of listing. There was also a 50% hike in new accounts opened by users, primarily to invest in Freshworks. “We saw similar interest when companies like Coinbase and Airbnb recently listed on the Vested platform. FRSH is 2x more popular than Robinhood three days after listing,” Shah said. Calls across support platforms enquiring about investing in Freshworks were up 30-40% on the day the company listed, Stockal co-founder & CEO Sitashwa Srivastava said. Over $300,000 has been invested in the Freshworks stock and almost 70% of investors are those belonging to the tech sector — a large majority from the southern region of Bengaluru, Chennai and other cities, he added. “At least 2% of Stockal’s total user base could be invested in Freshworks currently,” he said. Scripbox chief business officer Prateek Mehta said the search volume for Freshworks has seen a huge surge, and given it’s only been three days, he expects more people will discover it soon and it eventually will perform better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/freshworks-ipo-gets-more-indians-to-enter-us-markets/articleshow/86538295.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The victim was identified as Chandra Bhushan Prasad (45) who owned a general store at Bakhri. Locals gathered in large numbers at Musarigharari chowk and blocked the national highway-28 for more than three hours to protest the trader’s murder. A former mukhiya, Shashinath Jha (58), was also shot dead at Bakhri on August 6. Police sources said criminal Rajesh Pal, who had opened fire on Jha, had demanded extortion from Prasad through an instant messaging app to evade surveillance. Police said Pal had also demanded extortion from two more traders in the last two months for which separate FIRs were lodged against him at Tajpur and Musarigharari police stations. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said Prasad had lodged an FIR against unknown persons with Musarigharari police station on September 3 after being asked to pay Rs 5 lakh extortion. “Prasad had received bullet injuries in his face and chest. He was rushed to sadar hospital where he died during treatment. We have begun an investigation into the incident,” the SP said, adding raids were on to arrest the killers who had reached the spot on a bike and fled immediately after committing the crime.

The Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEIP), Andhra University organised a webinar on ‘Informal sector in India during Covid-19 times: Issues and perspectives’. Prof Krishna Mohan inaugurated the event. Speaking on this occasion, the registrar said; “Even in the normal times, the informal workers do not receive proper wages and work in poor conditions without any rights, insurance, or pension. The informal sector and those engaged and dependent on this sector is the worst hit during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. About 80 per cent of the workforce employed in the informal sector have found it difficult to make both ends meet. The voluntary organisations came to the rescue of the people in the informal sector, that includes the workers and petty traders, by supplying food items during this critical period,” added Prof Mohan. Principal, college of arts and commerce, Andhra University, Prof P Rajendra Karmarkar, said workers in the informal sector have several problems such as social security and low and irregular wages. Referring to the Economic Survey’s estimates (2018-19), director of CSSEIP, Dr P Subba Rao said around 93 per cent of the workforce (42 crore people) are in the informal sector, and are still exploited by their employers. He referred to the reports of some agencies such as the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), and stated that overall, 121.5 million jobs were lost in India in recent times, of which 91.2 million were informal jobs such as small traders, hawkers, daily wage labourers, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/webinar-on-woes-of-informal-workers/articleshow/86537701.cms||---

The suspect met the woman on a matrimonial website and promised to marry her. He took Rs50,000 cash and gold ornaments, collectively worth Rs1.7 lakh. An officer from the Chikhali police said the woman had created her profile on a matrimonial website. “In July this year, the suspect, who claimed to be a businessman from Solapur, contacted her. He then came to meet her in August to discuss marriage. The man took the woman’s gold chain, ring and Rs 50,000 cash and promised to return them immediately and left,” the officer said. The woman waited for him for almost a month but the man stopped responding, the officer said.

The deceased were identified as Nandupalli Raju (20), Koda Simhachalam (31) and Nandupalli Ramana (30), all residents of Vambe Colony in Vijayawada. According to Nunna inspector J R K Haneesh Babu, the trio was heading to Pathapatnam from Kandrika. Speeding and negligent driving are suspected to be the cause of the accident he said. The inspector said there was a caution board and a speed breaker at the spot of accident. The rider of the bike might have lost control if he was speeding and rammed into the jockey. As the bike was already overloaded and none of the three persons was wearing a helmet, they suffered severe injuries from the impact of the collision. While two of them died on the spot, the third died while being shifted to the hospital, said Haneesh Babu. Police also suspect that drunk driving might have contributed to the accident as the three were returning from a wine shop. Haneesh Babu said they are yet to ascertain whether the deceased were under the influence of alcohol and are waiting for the postmortem report. A case has been registered and investigation is underway, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/3-die-after-speeding-bike-crashes-into-scaffolding/articleshow/86537707.cms||---

Women’s police station SHO Kishore Shahchari said the woman is six months’ pregnant and had gone out of her residence for a stroll after dinner. “The three gagged her mouth so that she couldn’t scream. They forcibly took her to a nearby secluded place where the trio raped her. The incident took place almost at midnight,” she said. The SHO said the victim belongs to a middle class family and her husband works in a private firm. “It’s her husband’s private house in Beur. He and other family members were at home. They had started searching for her after she didn’t return home from the stroll,” Shahchari said. She said the woman had repeatedly requested the accused to set her free. “After the incident, she urged them to make her board a train to Lakhisarai and the two of them took her to the railway station.

Temple officials, who have made online reservation mandatory for darshan during the festive period, now propose asking devotees for their vaccination certificate when they come for darshan. In 2019, close to 15 lakh devotees took darshan during Dasara. But with the Covid-19 pandemic still raging, temple officials are permitting only 10,000 devotees each day for darshan. Keeping in mind warnings about a possible third wave of Covid-19, temple authorities are requesting devotees to produce the certificate of Covid-19 vaccination to get access for darshan. Devotees who are yet to receive the vaccine will have to submit a negative RT-PCR test report. Endowments department officials said the guidelines are to meant to restrict crowds and prevent the spread of the virus. The decision has been welcomed by devotees. “One should be very responsible and take care of themselves and others during the pandemic. Negligence of one single person can cause huge damage. Vaccination is being widely carried out across the state and it is very easy to get a vaccine shot. As a responsible citizen, I support the initiative and have booked a slot for darshan, following guidelines. I will produce a vaccination certificate at the time of darshan,” said K Narayanamma, a devotee from Bhavanipuram. Meanwhile, the online sale of darshan tickets is receiving a poor response from devotees. Temple officials plan to take up elaborate campaigns requesting devotees to book slots online rather than increasing the rush at ticket counters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/durga-temple-mulls-making-vax-certificate-or-ve-test-report-a-must/articleshow/86537802.cms||---
---||Patna||IOCL launches smart LPG cylinders in Patna||PATNA: The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) on Sunday launched ‘Indane composite cylinders’ of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which will allow customers to plan their next refill easily. The fibre cylinders will have a transparent component for consumers to verify the quantity of LPG supplied, said Vibhash Kumar, executive director and state head of IOCL (Bihar). While launching the composite gas cylinder for domestic use in Patna, Kumar described this as a big achievement for the country. “Customers can also check and see their gas levels. As its outer layer is of high-density polyethylene, the composite cylinder won’t rust like the conventional steel ones. The price of gas will remain the same, but the additional difference of cylinder can be obtained by depositing the fees. Indane has 50 lakh customers in Bihar,” he said. He said the Indane’s composite gas cylinder is the biggest gift to the people in this rapidly changing technological era. “Lifting a steel cylinder for women was a difficult task, but this 5 and 10kg cylinder made of fiberglass is safe and the most convenient in weight. The weight of a composite cylinder is half of that of steel,” he said. “LPG has great importance in Bihar as there is a huge consumption of commercial cylinders. In the technical field, the IOCL is also providing convenience to its customers by making many important changes,” he added. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) director Dr PK Singh, Patna University vice-chancellor G K Choudhary, Dr Sanjeev Kumar from AIIMS-P, IOCL Bihar-Jharkhand chief manager (planning and coordination) Veena Kumari and divisional LPG sales head Rahul Dixit among other officials were present during the launch ceremony. The composite cylinders were handed over to a few consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iocl-launches-smart-lpg-cylinders-in-patna/articleshow/86536272.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||SC/ST body to hold convention in Dec, expand its base in state||PATNA: The All-India Confederation of SC/ST Organisations (AICSSO) has decided to hold its state-level convention here in December in a bid to expand the base of its unit in the state, AICCSO’s Bihar working president Shashi Kant Prasad said on Sunday. Prasad said this on the sidelines of the high-level meeting of the delegates held at the auditorium of Jagjivan Ram Parliamentary Studies and Political Research Institute. The delegates were invited from various districts. Prasad said the state’s AICSSO unit is being strengthened in the backdrop of a new national situation as the “Centre has refused to hold caste census in spite of general demand and started privatising public sector units (PSUs) to private companies amid the raging unemployment problem”. “That apart, there has been a move to end the quota system. It will automatically block job avenues for the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), weaker sections and all other sections,” Prasad said. Among those who addressed the Sunday’s meeting of the AICSSO included its national general secretary Om Sudha and state-level functionaries. Sudha said most adversely affected by the wrong policies of the Centre were the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward caste groups. “The claim of the Centre that it has been promoting and protecting their interests is a sham,” he said. The AICSSO’s meeting was held in the backdrop of a peculiar situation with regard to Dalit and Adivasi politics prevailing in the state after the death of former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan last year. The party established by Paswan, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), is in disarray. The Dalit politics is also weakened by the existence of the caste-based parties like the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi whose mainstay is the Musahar caste people to which he belongs. Bihar has 22 Dalit caste groups accounting for 16% of the state’s population, while the population of the ST groups is 1%. Traditionally, the LJP had the core base among the people of Paswan caste spread across the state, while the HAM(S) among the Musahars who are most concentrated in the Magadh division districts and also in the Purnia division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sc/st-body-to-hold-convention-in-dec-expand-its-base-in-state/articleshow/86537543.cms||Abhay Singh

The previous record was held by another officer, Lt Col Bharat Pannu, who had peddled from Leh to Manali in 35 hours and 32 minutes.  After reaching Manali, Lt Col Sriram acknowledged that he was motivated by Lt Col Pannu to take up the expedition. Lt Col Sriram had left Leh on Saturday morning at 4 am, and was given a grand welcomed by Manali SDM and DSP at Beas bridge after he reached the town on Sunday. “The total distance that he covered is 472km with a total elevation gain of approximately 8,00 metres. This event was part of Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations, and also marks the occasion of 195th Gunners’ Day,” Defence PRO Lt Col Devender Anand said. Speaking to the media after the feat, Lt Col Sripada said riding at high mountain passes in night was very challenging, as the temperature was too low. He also added that some stretches of the road, which are not blacktopped, consumed too much time. The daunting Manali-Leh highway has been attracting adventure enthusiasts for its windy roads, high mountain passes and challenging conditions.

---||Ahmedabad||Lion fief a royal 50% more than assumed, says study||AHMEDABAD: As urban jungles sprawl inexorably, it is reasonable to assume that Asiatic lions’ territory is shrinking, but a study of individual big cats shows that royal pug marks are stamping their claim across a growing realm. For the first time, a group of leading big cat experts and Gujarat forest department officials radio collared 22 lions and observed them for 365 days. The experts found that a typical Asiatic lion’s territory now averages 266 sq km. Previously, it was thought that a lion ruled over 180 sq km. The study’s figure reflects a 47% increase in the home range. A lioness, on the other hand, has an average range of 114 sq km; earlier, it was believed that she was the monarch of terrain ranging from 75 sq km to 80 sq km. The study is called ‘Home Ranges of Asiatic Lions in the Asiatic Lion Landscape, Gujarat, India.’ It has been published in the Spring 2021 edition of CatNews, a newsletter of the Cat Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The study says that a typical male lion can have a territorial range up to 2.3 times of a lioness’ domain. Another interesting insight is that the home range of an Asiatic lion in Saurashtra may go up to 415 sq km. “Our research was quite extensive as it covered not just the protected area but even the Greater Gir area which extends up to Bhavnagar,” said Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests and a co-author of the study. The study has been jointly written by senior officials of the Gujarat forest department. They are Shyamal Tikadar, the principal chief conservator of forests; Vasavada; and Mohan Ram, the deputy conservator of forests. Dhawal Mehta, Yashpal Zala, Lahar Jhala, and Darshit Mesariya were the other researchers associated with the study. This group of scholars had in an earlier research paper posited that the Asiatic lions of Gujarat may no longer be counted as vastly different from their counterparts in central and west Africa. Senior Gujarat forest department officials said that lions have learnt to stay in proximity to humans and have also strayed into coastal areas. “The recent sightings of lions in Rampara in Surendranagar, Rajkot city, near Junagadh city, and inside some villages reveal that the lions are moving out in search of new territories,” a senior Gujarat forest department official said. Researchers in the past have hypothesized that the lions avoid built-up human settlements, agricultural tracts, sandy areas, saltpans, mangroves, and large water bodies. However, the 2020 wildlife census indicated the presence of lions in built-up human settlements too. H S Singh, a lion expert and a member of the National Board for Wildlife, said: “Based on past research, the forest department estimated a male lion’s range to be 175-200 sq km, and a lioness’ territory to be 70-80 sq km.” Singh went on to say: “The increase in the range indicates that the population is on the rise and lions are in close proximity to humans.” As for the study published in CatNews, it says that the population and distribution of lions have “shown a steady increase due to the government’s commitment and public support.” The study adds: “This growth necessitates conservation action to ensure the long-term survival of lions in the landscape.” A senior Gujarat forest department official said that lions’ movement out of the protected Gir sanctuary has much to do with the proximity that the animals share with the human population. Lions roam to find adequate prey bases such as domestic cattle, nilgai, and other ungulates. “The forest department is now targeting new areas to be developed as lion habitats,” the official said. “The aim is to build the necessary prey base under the Rs 1,300 crore Project Lion announced by the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lion-fief-a-royal-50-more-than-assumed-says-study/articleshow/86538221.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

At present, anyone has free access up to the courtroom,” council chairman Ramakant Sharma said at press conference in the backdrop of the shootout inside the Rohini courtroom at Delhi. Sharma, who was accompanied by bar council vice-chairman Dharmnath Prasad Yadav, members Yogesh Chandra Verma, Prem Jha, Rajeev Kumar Dwivedi and Arun Kumar Pandey, said, “We are celebrating 75 years of independence but unfortunately legal fraternity and courts are the most neglected one yet. There is total security lapse in the state courts. Like many other states, a law should be framed to protect the advocates in Bihar.” The chairman also recalled the bombing and suicide attack at Ara civil court on two different occasions and another bombing at Chhapra court, killing of a gangster inside the Sitamarhi civil court, firing on the Patna civil court premises to raise concern over the security issue. He said hardly any infrastructure has been developed for lawyers and judicial officers in most of the subordinate courts in the districts in the last several few decades. He said though the Patna civil court building is old, lawyers have no proper sitting place. Sharma pointed out that the number of women advocates has increased over the years, but several courts in the state has no separate washroom for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bar-council-urges-cm-cj-to-enhance-court-security-infra/articleshow/86537350.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Vijayawada||AP: YSRC sticks to social justice in allotting mandal, ZP posts||AMARAVATI: Sticking to chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s promise of empowering the weaker sections, YSRC handed over nearly 67 per cent of coveted posts in zilla parishads and mandals to SC, ST, BC and minorities. The party also allotted nearly 64 per cent of the posts to women. This is considered to be highest ever political appointments given to women and weaker sections in the state. The BC communities are particularly elated as the seats reserved to OCs too have been spared to the lesser known communities from the BCs. The State Election Commission (SEC) conducted polls to about 634 mandal parishads of the total 660 in the state. The ruling YSRC won 620 of the 634 mandals leaving only 14 to others. Interestingly, the YSRC leadership set aside the claims of the upper-caste communities to head the mandal parishads and went ahead anointing leaders from the weaker sections. Despite some discontent among the dominant communities in villages, the party legislators were asked to convince them about the chief minister’s commitment in granting majority of the top posts to the backward classes, SC, ST and minorities. Specific instructions were issued to the legislators to ensure minimum 50 per cent of the total posts in their respective constituencies were given to women. The party directed the legislators to accommodate new communities from the backward classes sections in order to expand the party’s vote bank. When the ZPTC post was set aside for one particular community, the mandal parishad president post was given to another community, irrespective of the seat that was allotted for the OC quota. “Political parties have long been making hollow promises on empowering backward classes. A new history has been scripted under Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s leadership as we have spared more than the prescribed seats to the BCs,” said government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. MLC Dokka Manikyavaraprasad said that it was a herculean task to ensure reservations, particularly to the BC communities in villages, as local dominant groups would not compromise on the issue of sharing power. Jagan’s firm decision has made the legislators to follow the principle in toto. Interestingly, nine ZP chief posts of the total 13 have gone into the SC, ST BC quota. This is 69 per cent of the available posts while OCs have got 31 per cent. The party has further expanded the base of the BCs when it comes to ZP vice-chairperson posts. “Nineteen of the total 26 vice-chairperson posts were given to SC, ST, BC and minority communities. This is 73 per cent of the total available posts.

As many as 28.3 lakh houses will be constructed in two phases in 17,005 layouts spread across the state. The state government spent Rs 23,535 crore alone to acquire 68,678 acres for these colonies. According to the state energy department officials, the layouts with less than 550 plots are considered for overhead electrification and layouts with more than 550 plots will get an underground electricity network. During a review meeting conducted by the housing department with the energy department, special chief secretary for housing, Ajay Jain, said Andhra Pradesh will set an example to the entire country by creating all social infrastructure in YSR Jagananna Colonies. “The infrastructure will also include secretariats, health centres, veterinary hospitals, schools, colleges, libraries, shopping complexes, parks, community halls, banks, stadiums, religious buildings, dumping yards, burial grounds, etc,” said Ajay Jain. Ajay Jain said several government departments, including the energy department, have prepared detailed project reports. “The state government has set a deadline to complete the works by December 31, 2022. The government so far sanctioned more than 15.6 lakh houses of which 10.31 lakh houses were already grounded. The government has laid more focus on completion of houses within stipulated time without giving any additional burden to the beneficiary. Beneficiaries are given a choice to select any material to be supplied by the government,” said Ajay Jain. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said AP power utilities have geared up to provide high quality power infrastructure to YSR Jagananna Colonies. “It is estimated that the electrification works will cost around Rs 7,080 crore. The government wants to provide access to modern energy services to 28.30 lakh beneficiaries that could improve living conditions and expand economic opportunities,” said Srikant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/power-utilities-to-spend-over-rs-7k-cr-for-electrification-in-jagananna-colonies/articleshow/86537667.cms||---

Addressing a high-level meeting convened by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to review the LWE scenario in the country, Nitish drew the attention of the Centre towards the policy of charging all the expenses from states on account of deployment of central armed police forces for anti-Maoist operations. “The fight against Maoists to maintain internal security is the joint responsibility of the state and the Centre. But all the expenses are borne by the state governments. This expenditure should jointly be shared by both governments,” Nitish said at the meeting presided over by Union home minister Amit Shah. The chief ministers of other LWE-affected states also addressed the meeting held at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan. In his address, Nitish also said the Bihar government had always been prompt in making payments on time to the MHA on this account, and “at present, no payment is due against Bihar.” Nitish further demanded an increase in the Centre’s funding ratio under the Modernization of State Police Forces (MPF) Scheme. “The Centre has been assisting the states through the MPF Scheme. In consonance with time, it is being realized that the structuring and scope of this scheme needs to be expanded. On the contrary, the Centre has reduced funding under the plan component of the MPF scheme. The ratio of Centre and state share in the scheme has been kept at 60:40. From FY 2000-2001 to 2014-2015, the Centre provided average funding under the MPF to the tune of Rs 40 crore only. But subsequently it has been reduced to Rs 27 crore per annum. This amount is highly insufficient and should be enhanced manifold. For a state like Bihar which has limited resources, the ratio should be 90: 10,” Nitish said. Nitish requested the MHA to reconsider Bihar’s proposal to deploy one helicopter permanently in the state. The MHA has suggested that Bihar should use the helicopter deployed in Jharkhand as and when the need arises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aid-states-in-fight-against-reds-cm-to-centre/articleshow/86536074.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Prior permission must to hold fairs during Puja: Patna DM||PATNA: The Patna district administration on Sunday issued a fresh set of guidelines for the Durga Puja celebrations to prevent spread of Covid. “Fairs, cultural events, Ravan Vadh and processions will not be organised without prior permission from the district administration,” says a part of the guidelines issued by the district administration. The district administration has directed the officials concerned to ensure effective control of processions during the festival. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said Puja committees would have to take permission from the sub-divisional offices and those involved in organising the pandals, fairs and processions will have to take at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine before seeking permission to organise the events. “The site to be approved for holding fairs or setting up pandals should be cordoned off and arrangements be made to check the vaccination certificate of the visitors at the entry point. It should be ensured that gathering of people does not exceed the capacity of the religious places, pandals or fair venues. Hand sanitisers should be made available at all the entry points,” Singh said. He said DJs would not be allowed in the pandals and during the processions. “Minimum number of people should be involved in idol immersion. At the time of idol immersion, there should not be more than the prescribed limit of people specified in the licence. In case of violation of the guidelines, penal action will be taken under the provisions of Sections 51-60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the DM said. Singh added, “Special arrangements will be made near pandals and fair venues for Covid-19 test and vaccination. An instruction in this regard has been issued to the civil surgeon-cum-chief medical officer.” People entering Bihar from states where there are too many Covid-19 cases will have to undergo rapid antigen test at the borders, railway stations, bus depots and airports. Those carrying negative RT-PCR test report, not older than 72 hours, will be exempted from rapid antigen tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prior-permission-must-to-hold-fairs-during-puja-dm/articleshow/86536180.cms||Faryal Rumi

The victim was identified as Anmol Bharti (15). One of the three teenagers, who are accused of stabbing Ajay, was arrested by police late on Saturday night. SHO of Riga police station Sanjay Kumar said the coaching institute is located near Riga main market. “Anmol was taken to a secluded place behind Riga sugar mill by three of the students of the coaching centre, who stabbed him multiple times. He was rushed to sadar hospital by one of his cousins, but died during treatment,” the SHO added. He added Anmol’s father, Ajay Bharti, has lodged an FIR against three teenagers. “A police team will visit the institute on Monday and record the statement of teachers and students,” Kumar said. “One of the accused was arrested after continuous raids. The rest two are evading arrest. Efforts are on to nab them. Ajay has mentioned in the FIR that the killing was fallout of a dispute between Anmol and three other students over sitting in the front row at the coaching centre where they studied,” the SHO added. Meanwhile, Sitamarhi SP Har Kishore Rai said police have also come to know that Anmol had stabbed one of the accused a month back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/class-x-pupil-stabbed-to-death-over-petty-dispute-in-sitamarhi/articleshow/86537435.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Amaravati||AP: Ministers defend govt portal for movie ticket sale, slam Pawan Kalyan||AMARAVATI: Taking strong objection to Tollywood hero and Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan’s charges against the state government, I&PR and cinematography minister Perni Nani cautioned the actor against spreading false propaganda against the chief minister. He advised Pawan to be aware of what is happening in the industry before making false charges against the government. Speaking to reporters here on Sunday, the minister said the government decided to launch the online portal for the sale of film tickets on request from industry stakeholders. He said they issued a GO regulating the movie tickets after eight years with an increase of 40 per cent over the prices fixed in 2013. “Surprisingly, there was no regulation on the tickets during the TDP regime, which is close to Pawan,” said Nani. He wondered why Pawan has to worry if black marketeering of tickets is regulated. He said the chief minister had only accepted a request made by the industry representatives. “Pawan made highly objectionable comments against the state government and chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. We will not take such statements lightly,” warned Nani. He appealed to producers, distributors and exhibitors to speak out and tell the facts to the public. “Exhibitors should say whether this government has ever harassed them. More theatres are operating in AP than in Telangana. While 800 of the 1,100 theatres are open in AP, just 419 theatres are running in Telangana,” said Nani. Meanwhile, in Nellore, irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav said the government would treat the films of both Pawan and Sompoornesh Babu equally. He wanted to know why the industry should be targeted for the sake of a leader who lost both the seats he contested. He said the government would increase the ticket fares if at all they wanted to make more revenue. The minister asked Pawan to explain why he wanted to sell the tickets of his movies at a higher price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ministers-defend-govt-portal-for-movie-ticket-sale-slam-pawan/articleshow/86537851.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Transport, bank and trade unions back today’s strike||PATNA: The state transport associations, bank and trade unions and several political outfits have decided to support the nationwide strike called by the farmers on Monday to press for withdrawal of three farm laws and fixing the minimum support price for farm produce. Raj Kumar Jha, general secretary of All India Road Transport Workers’ Federation-Bihar, Chandan Singh, secretary of State Motors’ Federation, Jitendra Kumar of Bihar Autochalak Sangh and Deenanath of e-rickshaw Chalak Sangh have jointly decided to keep the vehicles off the road throughout the day. “No auto, e-rickshaw, bus or any public transport will ply across the state,” Jha said. He told this newspaper that they are supporting the farmers’ demand as well as other related issues faced by common people, like rising prices of fuel and other commodities and unemployment. Bhanu Shekhar Prasad Singh, president of Bihar Truck Owners’ Association, said around 5 lakh trucks and lorries would remain off the road. “We will not let any vehicle move on the road, except ambulances and other essential service vehicles,” he said. Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), which took out a ‘torchlight procession’ from Patna GPO roundabout to Buddha Smriti Park, urged people to join the protest. INTUC state president Chandra Prakash Singh said the labour class would raise their voice against the Centre’s anti-worker policies and unilateral labour reforms. Ashok Prasad Singh, state general secretary of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said all the three farm laws are only for the benefit of domestic and foreign corporate houses. “These laws are actually to snatch away both land and produce of the farmers. Companies, hoarders and blackmarketers will have complete control over agriculture, which will badly affect the farming sector,” he said. The Maharashtra State Bank Employees Federation and All India Bank Employees Association would ensure that their branches remain closed on Monday. The employees would raise their own demands, like recruitment of part-time sub-staff, adequate recruitment of clerks, withdraw admin transfer policy and security arrangements at all the branches and ATMs. B Prasad, president of the Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI)-Bihar, said the bank employees and senior officials would protest in support of farmers and some of the banks will also remain shut. However, the association has not announced any closure of banks during the Monday strike. State spokesperson of AAP, Bablu Prakash, said his party workers will hit the streets of Patna in support of the bandh. “We have appealed to the people for maximum participation in support of the movement,” he said. It is the second bandh call given by farmers against the implementation of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transport-bank-and-trade-unions-back-todays-strike/articleshow/86537229.cms||Faryal Rumi

A first-of-its-kind hi-tech control centre, aimed at minimizing losses caused due to chemical and petroleum leakages occurring after road accidents, has been set up in the state. The centre will become functional at Ankleshwar in Bharuch from October 1. “It is the first such control and command centre in the country, set up especially for chemical leakages and accidents on the roads. It will cover the roads in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and NCR in the first phase,” said Shanker K, CEO of Nicer Globe that has set up the control room. “The centralized control room will have seven people with chemical engineering backgrounds. They will have detailed information about each and every chemical and how to tackle the situation in case it leaks on the roads. Each of these control room representatives knows multiple languages including Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam so that they can communicate smoothly with the truck drivers,” Shanker told TOI. Nicer Globe is an Indian Chemical Council (ICC) initiative for making the chemical industry and transport safer in the country apart from emergency response. “We will provide a toll-free number that will be pasted on the tankers carrying hazardous chemicals. In case of any accident, the driver or any commuter can call on the number and talk to our representative,” Shanker added. Nicer Globe has appointed a team including a cop and a fireman at every 200 km in different states. In case of emergency, the control room will first ask the driver to take some safety measures. Next, the control room will call the nearest team and direct it to the spot along with an ambulance. And the company that owns the chemical stock as well as the tanker owner will also be informed. “We are in the process of training the tanker drivers as well as the emergency team about the chemicals and safety protocols to be followed. The idea is to ensure minimum damage to people as well as the environment in case of chemical leakage on the road. We chose Gujarat to set up this control room as it is a chemical industry hub,” Shanker added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/control-room-for-chemical-mishaps-on-roads/articleshow/86537369.cms||Tushar Tere

While the proposed deal allows Zee MD Punit Goenka to be in charge of the merged business, the US-based fund, which holds 18% in Zee, had sought a rejig of the company’s board including his ouster. Invesco said, “A newly constituted board supported with the strength of independence will be best suited to evaluate and oversee the potential for strategic transactions, like the one announced (with Sony), as well as to make determinations on the future leadership of the company.” “We note that the disclosure of September 22 (the merger announcement) refers to the future board composition of the company at a time when the current composition of the board is subject to a shareholder vote on the back of our EGM requisition.” Invesco had asked Zee to call an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) of shareholders seeking removal of the company’s three non-independent directors and induction of six new independent directors on its board. Two of the non-independent directors subsequently resigned, while Goenka continued. “We trust that the current board will adhere to its fiduciary duties and not violate its statutory obligations to convene the EGM as requisitioned by Invesco,” said the fund. After Invesco wrote seeking an EGM, the company signed a non-binding deal with Sony, which allows Goenka to be the MD of the merged entity and his family to hold up to 20% in it. “We continue to believe that the business (Zee) is valuable, whether on its own or in strategic alignment with partners such as Sony. However, decisions of material strategic import must follow and not precede actions towards establishment of a proper and independent governance structure as determined by the company’s shareholders,” read the Invesco letter signed by VP Aroon Balani. “In this context and against the backdrop of our EGM requisition, your disclosure of September 22 is symptomatic of the erratic manner in which important and serious decisions have been handled at the company.” When asked about Invesco’s reaction, a Zee spokesperson said, “The board is seized of the matter. The company will take necessary action as per applicable law.” Explaining the reason for the EGM requisition, Invesco said, “Precisely to protect shareholder value and in exercise of our statutory rights as an ordinary shareholder, we have called upon the company to hold an EGM, and it is your duty under company law to now do so. At this EGM, shareholders will decide the composition of the company’s board in a free and democratic manner.”According to rules, the board will have to call for an EGM within 21 days of receiving such a request and the meeting will have to be held within 45 days from the date of receipt of such a requisition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zees-18-owner-wants-new-board-to-review-sony-merger/articleshow/86539401.cms||---
---||Business||Recurring card pays to be hit from next month||MUMBAI: Some cardholders might see standing instructions for payment on their credit card fail from next month. These could be for subscriptions with online content platforms, edtech companies or standing instructions for online advertisement payments. Some of these merchants are yet to comply with RBI’s new requirement of additional factor authentication (OTP) for recurring payments through cards though the deadline is less than a week away. According to sources, around 75% of the banks have put in place the technology to meet RBI’s directive. However, there are some banks and merchants who are still in wait-and-watch mode. Banks are writing to customers, warning that some transactions may fail: “Effective October 1, 2021, the bank will not approve any standing instruction (e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions) given at merchant website/app on HDFC Bank credit/debit card, unless it is as per RBI-compliant process.” The bank has recommended that customers use its bill-pay option for utilities or pay on the biller’s website using OTP. According to Razorpay, which processes close to a third of all recurring payment transactions, a dozen banks have already put in place the new setup where even for repeat payments the bank will alert the customer a day in advance and also provide them with a link to discontinue the mandate. “In the short term, there may be some disruption but, in the long term, this move by the RBI can take growth in recurring payment mandates off the charts,” said Razorpay chief technology officer and co-founder Shashank Kumar. Kumar says the RBI directive addresses two key issues. Earlier, discontinuing a standing instruction to a merchant could be extremely cumbersome with some asking for a letter to be sent by post asking to discontinue the subscription. Second, debit cards were a grey area and recurring payments were done largely in credit cards. Incidentally, even after October 1, international mandates will continue as neither banks nor the RBI has jurisdiction over international billers. “There are 900 million debit cards in India and their inclusion could increase the market multifold,” said Kumar. According to Kumar, by empowering customers to stop the payments at any time, the RBI has increased the confidence level. This could also make online education or entertainment more affordable as the availability of this facility will encourage providers to have a monthly debit model rather than recover annual fees. Besides requiring banks to alert customers, the RBI has capped automatic debits at Rs 5,000 per month. This would mean that billers, like insurance companies, with large instalments, would need to increase the frequency to enable auto-debit. In the case of utilities, many online payers use their bank’s bill payment platform for standing instructions and will have no impact.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/recurring-card-pays-to-be-hit-from-next-month/articleshow/86539337.cms||---

The farmers of Vadakkanad in Wayanad, along with officials of MSSRF’s community agro biodiversity centre (MSSRF CABC), are now pinning their hopes on the age-old contraption by deploying them with LED lights and bioacoustic devices to ward off crop-raiding wild animals. Under the pilot project being implemented at Vadakkanad in Noolpuzha panchayat with the help of Nabard, 28 LED lights were installed on 8ft high GI pipes, at a distance of 40ft apart, along forest fringes in the first phase of the project one month ago. Now, 56 humanoid scarecrows are being installed between these LED lights. “The flickering LED lights would be turned on at nightfall and with the light falling on the scarecrows it would create an illusion to the jumbos and other wildlife that people are standing guard and this would desist from entering the fields,” said Vadakkanad Neerthada Vikasana Samiti president KT Kuriakose. MSSRF CABC is the implementation agency for the project which is funded by Nabard. The pilot project is modelled on an initiative successfully implemented in Odisha one month ago. Kuriakose said that the scarecrows were made using hay, dried bamboo leaves and cloth. Also, fluorescent markings are made on the scarecrows to give a glowing effect during night. “In the third phase, we will also install devices which will emit sounds of predatory animals like tigers. The use of contraptions like LED lights, scarecrows and predator sound playback are expected to be successful in keeping the crop raiding animals away,” he said. The wards of Vadakkanad, Karipoor and Valluvadi are surrounded by forests under Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) on all sides and the farmers have to put up with crop-raiding wildlife all through the year. According to farmers, after the lights were installed a month ago, small herbivores like deer and wild boars have not come to their fields. But, there was one instance of elephant straying but the farmers hope that with the deployment of scarecrows and the acoustic devices later, they would help keep the jumbos at bay to a great extent. “We don’t think that the project would provide 100% protection as wild animals adapt to various forms of deterrent devices. But, we are hopeful that the method, which uses three types of deterrents, would offer us some relief. It has the advantage of being cost-effective as we have set up them at an expense of Rs 1.17 lakh per km as opposed to Rs 1.5 crore for rail fence and Rs 49 lakh for crash guard rope fencing,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/glowing-scarecrows-to-scare-off-wild-elephants/articleshow/86538507.cms||---

These credits are tradable certificates, which enables DMRC to sell credits earned from its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reducing projects to other organisations, who need to compensate for their GHG emissions. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that Delhi Metro became the first Metro or railway project in the world to be registered by the United Nations under the clean development mechanism (CDM) in 2007, which enabled DMRC to claim carbon credits for its regenerative braking project. “CDM is a project-based GHG offset mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allowing the public and private sector in high-income nations the opportunity to purchase carbon credits from GHG emissions-reducing projects in low or middle-income nations as part of their efforts to meet international emissions targets under the protocol,” Dayal said. The 3.5 million carbon credits were collected over a period of six years from 2012 to 2018. “DMRC has been a pioneer in India in quantifying climate change benefits from its operations. It has a number of dedicated projects to its credit oriented towards energy efficiency,” he said. Dayal said that CDM projects generate emissions credits called certified emission reductions, which are then bought and traded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-rides-help-metro-earn-rs-19-5-crore-through-carbon-credits-in-6-yrs/articleshow/86538510.cms||---

A total of 1,037 CAM patients are currently undergoing treatment across the state. Some of the districts — Wardha, Jalna, Dhule, Bhandara, Washim, and Parbhani — have only a sporadic number of patients on treatment. Pune has the highest active caseload (283), followed by Mumbai (208) and Thane (93). Treating doctors and health officials have underlined that most of these active patients are those who have encountered a recurrence days or months after recovery. “The recurrence is a rule rather than an exception in mucormycosis,” ENT surgeon Samir Joshi, head of department and professor at state-run Sassoon General Hospital, said. Clearing the entire fungus in one go (surgery) is nearly impossible because the fungus in the broader zone between the dead area (damaged sinus tissues) and living area (healthy tissues) is not seen. “That is why post-operative cleaning, care and injection amphotericin at least for two weeks are vital to avoid recurrence,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-recurrence-of-mucor-keeps-no-of-active-patients-up/articleshow/86542096.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Ahmedabad||Prince’s writ over 1,111 sq km: Gujarat foresters||AHMEDABAD: In a unique study, Gujarat foresters followed 22 radio-collared lions for a year and their patience was rewarded with a stunning insight: a young sub-adult lion could go on a royal saunter across 1,111 sq km.  The foresters also found that the home range of a young lion pride, consisting of two members, had the massive spread of 3,785 sq km.  These jaw-dropping findings have appeared in the Spring 2021 edition of CatNews, a newsletter of the Cat Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The study is titled ‘Home Ranges of Asiatic Lions in the Asiatic Lion Landscape, Gujarat, India.’ The study was carried out in association with the Gujarat forest department. A senior forest department official said that a 2019 study by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had reported that the home range of a nomadic male was 832 sq km.  Three young non-nomadic adult males were observed in the latest study. The first had a range of 194 sq km; the second, 932 sq km; and the third, 528 sq km. In 2019, a WII study projected the home range of lions in the Gir protected area to be 91 sq km and of lionesses to be 27 sq km. This study showed that the lion domains were larger than previously noted. A senior forest department officer said that WII had found that one nomadic lion had a range of 832 sq km in the Greater Gir area.  A WII researcher who has studied the CatNews paper said that the numbers indicate population saturation in the Gir Sanctuary which is making lions venture out. “In our study, we had found that the area covered by a lion on average was about 2,000 sq km,” the WII researcher said. “Now the new paper has shown a pride of two animals moving across 3,785 sq km.” Officials in the forest department said that home ranges are dependent on prey abundance, prey dispersion, pride size, and water availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/princes-writ-over-1111-sq-km/articleshow/86538477.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The call was made via a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) application and featured the trader’s cousin’s display photo (DP). The “cousin” claimed he needed money to pay for medical treatment in the US. The trader transferred Rs4 lakh to the account the caller gave him and was in for a rude shock when he called his cousin to confirm — the US resident was completely unaware. The trader was one of several people in the city cheated of their hard-earned money using this ploy. “We have received two similar complaint applications,” cyber police inspector Meenal Patil said. “These complaints only show that users of app-based messaging and calls are monitored by crooks, who then use the information, download photographs of family or friends, and pose as them to cheat the users,” she added. This is becoming a popular tactic employed by crooks she said. A prima facie study of bank account and allied details shows that the suspects are based in India. “They keep tabs on the social media profiles of their targets. They look for their target’s childhood or college friends or relatives, preferably based in distant cities or other countries,” Patil said. “After zeroing-in on a friend or relative, the fraudsters download his or her photograph and somehow obtain the phone number of their target. Then, they use the photograph as their DP and make a call. In most cases, the victims don’t suspect a thing,” she said. “The crooks seek money citing an emergency and the victims transfer the amount,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/increasing-phone-calls-using-relatives-or-friends-display-pics-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/86538491.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Tigress found dead near NH 730 in Kheri, 6th death in UP this yr||Bareilly: The carcass of a sub-adult tigress was found near Katna river bridge, a few metres from National Highway 730, in Gola area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday morning. The area comes within the buffer zone of Dudhwa tiger reserve (DTR). Going by its injuries, forest department officials suspect it was hit by a speeding vehicle. This is the sixth tiger to die in Uttar Pradesh since January this year. Anil Patel, deputy director, DTR (buffer) told TOI, “The tigress was nearly two years old. Its back legs had visible injuries and it possibly died of internal bleeding. It appeared to be hit by a speeding vehicle. All its organs were intact and no poaching activity is suspected.” The carcass has been sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly for an autopsy. An FIR has been registered against an unidentified vehicle driver and efforts are on to identify him, said Patel. The carcass was found just 100 metres from a forest outpost near Chedipur village. Vehicles pass by at high speed through the road in the reserve forest area which has a high density of wild animals like tiger, deer and crocodiles. Despite the fact that seven crocodiles have been crushed to death by speeding vehicles in the past two years, no efforts have been made to regulate traffic on this stretch of road either by the forest department or police, wildlife activists said. The foresters said sign boards on speed limits have been put up at various points on the road but are unable to enforce it.

The cops have deployed extra personnel and intensified patrolling near the borders. The bandh has been called from 6am to 4pm during which all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions are to remain closed throughout the country, the farmer unions have claimed. However, all emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies, will be exempted. Extra police personnel have been deployed at the pickets, especially around the border areas and vehicles entering the capital are being thoroughly checked, cops said. No protestor will be allowed to enter Delhi from the three protest sites at the city's borders, they added. DCP (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said: “In view of the Bharat Bandh, adequate security arrangements have been made as a precautionary measure. Pickets at the border areas have been strengthened and all vital installations, including India Gate and Vijay Chowk, will have the required deployment.” There aren’t any specific inputs about any protest being organised in the city yet, but all precautionary measures are being taken, the cops said on Sunday. “The security will be preventive and we are fully alert. There is no call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ in Delhi, but we are watching the developments and adequate number of personnel will be on ground,” another officer said. A police officer from the outer district said that no protestor would be allowed and extra forces had been already deployed in the district ever since farmers went on a sit-in at Tikri border.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-on-alert-patrolling-upped-for-bharat-bandh/articleshow/86538548.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||India’s largest saline agricultural land in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Two crucial studies on the increasing soil salinity in Gujarat have raised concerns. Of the 6.73 million hectares of land affected by salinity in India, Gujarat constitutes 2.23 million hectares, followed by UP 1.37 million hectares, while Maharashtra has 0.61 million hectares affected by soil salinity. In fact Gujarat, UP, Maharashtra, W Bengal and Rajasthan constitute 75% of saline soils of the country. This has been claimed by the department of botany of Banaras Hindu University in September this year. Soil salinity also leads to large agricultural production loses. Another study by department of soil science of Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar (CSK), Himachal Pradesh, Krishi Vishvavidyalaya (HPKV), Palampur, India and Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Jammu has claimed that Gujarat state suffers 4.83 million tonnes of production loss because of soil salinity. “In terms of monetary loss, Gujarat tops the list with Rs 100.63 billion, followed by Uttar Pradesh with Rs 81.29 billion.” The study further adds, “Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have the largest salt-affected area – which is more than 50% of cultivated area — in the country.” The two states alone share around 79% monetary losses in the country. “All these states deserve policy attention for management of salt-affected areas to reduce the crop production and monetary loss,” the study states. One of the major reasons for rising soil salinity is the use of brackish groundwater irrigation waters that is causing secondary salinization in about 17% of irrigated lands in the country. “Good quality irrigation water is scarce in the country. Increasing pressure of producing more food per unit available arable land forces for extensive use of brackish groundwater for irrigation” claims the study. Ground water surveys indicate that poor quality waters being utilized in different states are 32–84% of the total groundwater development. The average rate of increased salinized areas in India is around 10% annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-has-countrys-highest-area-of-land-affected-by-salinity/articleshow/86538525.cms||---
---||Jaipur||On World Tourism Day, CM Ashok Gehlot to announce financial package||JAIPUR: On World Tourism Day on Monday, chief minister Ashok Gehlot will unveil a slew of schemes including a financial assistance package for tourism units, which have been severely hit the Covid pandemic. The chief minister will also unveil guidelines for schemes like home stay, experiential and river cruise tourism, and will launch a mobile application developed by of the department of tourism. Under Mukhyamantri Tourism Udhyog Protsahan Yojana, hotels and restaurants and other tourism units will be offered loans up to Rs 25 lakh with interest subsidy of 9%. The scheme will be part of an already existing Mukhyamantri Laghu Udhyog Protsahan Yojana under which entreprises get loans through banks with interest subsidy of up to 8%. But in case of the new Mukhyamantri Tourism Udhyog Protsahan Yojana, the subsidy could go up to 9%. The tourism units can get loans from nationalised commercial banks, private sector scheduled commercial banks, scheduled small finance bank, regional rural bank, Rajasthan Financial Corporation and SIDBI. But it is not clear as to whether the loans will be availed for working capital needs or for expansion, diversification, and modernization projects. “We need working capital to restart the operations. In the last one and half years, the tourism units have struggled to generate income due the pandemic. That’s why the loans should not be only for expansion or diversification,” said an entrepreneur. A source in the tourism department said that the interest subsidy scheme could be for a limited period, maybe for six months. In case of the home stay policy, there is likely to be some relaxation. As per the existing scheme which was introduced in 2012, home owners are required to offer 2-5 rooms. But the new guidelines will allow 1-5 rooms. Even if a person has two-room set accommodation facility and if he or she is willing to offer the second room to a tourist, they can do so as per the new guidelines.The chief minister is like to announce the guidelines and the new financial assistance package at a hybrid event where he will be joined by senior government officials at the chief minister’s residence and others logging in from other locations of the state capital and districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/on-world-tourism-day-gehlot-to-announce-financial-package/articleshow/86540650.cms||---

The Gujarat ATS has recently seized around 30kg of heroin and arrested seven persons from Iran sent by three drug lords, including two from Iran and one from Pakistan.In the mid-sea operation on September 18, ATS officers had found the criminals using Thuraya and Satellite phones to communicate mid-sea. “Apart from that, they were supposed to use virtual numbers after landing either in Maharashtra or Gujarat. The drug mafia wanted to send the heroin to Punjab. After landing in India, their entire communication was supposed to take place using virtual numbers and the dark web,” said an ATS officer. In the first week of September, the NCB had caught a drug peddler from Zambia with 2kg of cocaine from the city airport, and later a drug peddler from Nigeria was also held. These people were using virtual numbers so that they could not be traced, and their location remained inaccessible, said an officer of the agency.

A police unit at every 5km was deployed on Sikar Road to ensure seamless movement of vehicles. As soon as the exams concluded at 5pm, students began pouring on main roads looking for their rides back home. Some travelled by their personnel cars while others used buses and shared cabs. Cars and buses queued up on Road No. 14 on Sikar Road. Traffic on Sikar Road moved at a snail’s pace for a about two hours after the exam got over. However, seamless vehicular movement resumed by the night. Near Transport Nagar, several buses and cars packed with students began moving through crowded lanes. In the morning, students entered the city in droves before the exam due to which jams were reported on the 200-ft Bypass Road. Except for snacks and automobile shacks, other shops remained shut including some shopping complexes on Sunday due to which the traffic on other roads was minimal. Additional commissioner of police Rahul Prakash said REET concluded in the city without any reports of chaos or panic. “Majority of the students had arrived at their designated examination centres well before time. Except for a few places, there was no incident of traffic coming to a halt at any place,” he said. In the evening, students and parents were seen walking towards five temporary bus stands. Long queues of students were reported at the temporary bus stand at Vidhyadhar Nagar.

---||Delhi||Six-month extension likely for DMRC MD Mangu Singh||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has recommended to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs that Mangu Singh (66) — whose tenure as managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation comes to an end this month — be given an extension till March 2022. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI that the Aam Aadmi Party government has approved the extension of Singh’s tenure by six months. Delhi government and the Centre have equal stake in the DMRC and its managing director is always designated by the state government, with concurrence of the Centre. Once the Centre gives its concurrence to Delhi government’s proposal, this will be the fourth extension for Singh, who has been a part of DMRC since the very beginning. Singh is DMRC’s second managing director and took over from E Sreedharan on December 31, 2011. Singh got his first extension in December 2016 and the second one for three-and-a-half months on December 15, 2020, which came to an end on March 31, 2021. Gahlot had earlier extended the tenure of Singh by six months in March this year. According to sources, the process of selecting Singh’s successor had begun after his third extension, but the government has been unable to find a suitable candidate to fill Singh’s boots. Sources said that the position of DMRC’s managing director requires major experience of railways and there are not enough candidates with the required experience or expertise. Also, Singh’s fourth extension will come at a time when DMRC is going through a major financial crisis caused by the pandemic. Singh oversaw Delhi Metro’s Phase III expansion, when the network length doubled compared with the combined network built during Phase I and Phase II projects.  Work on the Phase IV project started in 2019-end and received a jolt due to the Covid-19 outbreak and even before work could regain pace, the second wave majorly affected construction work in mid-2021. Singh cleared the Indian Railways Services of Engineers examination in 1981 and has been with the Indian Railways in various capacities.  He joined DMRC in 1997 as chief project manager and moved upwards to executive director and then director (works).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-month-extension-likely-for-dmrc-md/articleshow/86538607.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The Thane Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) on Friday heard their application seeking a claim of Rs 50 lakh for their son's death on June 30, 2018. Their son died in the Bhandup area of the Eastern Express Highway in neighbouring Mumbai, when the car in which he was travelling hit a road-divider and jumped on to the other lane where it collided head-on with a container truck coming from the opposite direction. Following the intervention of a MACT member and the District Judge R N Rokade, the man's parents, both retired from their jobs, settled for an amount of Rs 27.30 lakh with the car's insurer towards compensation. Advocate Pradeep Tillu, who represented the couple before the MACT, said they have created a trust in the memory of their son and have decided to help the poor. The couple said, “No doubt, we are sad that we lost our son, but at the same time we want to give back to the society and have set up a trust to help the poor and needy children.” The couple had earlier donated their son's eyes on the day of his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-parents-use-compensation-for-sons-death-to-educate-poor/articleshow/86542410.cms||---

---||Mumbai||2nd wave claimed 89,000 lives in Maharashtra, Pune worst affected||MUMBAI: The second wave of Covid-19, believed to be retreating now, has left over 89,000 people dead in Maharashtra, officially. More than one in five deaths have been reported from the Pune circle that has emerged as the worst affected. The densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which was hit hard at the start of the pandemic and early second wave, has seen fewer casualties lately. Maharashtra has registered nearly 1.4 lakh Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic in 2020, of which almost 64% fatalities have been recorded in the second wave, starting February this year. Deaths peaked in May and June—26,531and 26,601, respectively. Casualties dropped to nearly 11,000 in July, 4,522 in August and to a little over 1,500 till September 25. Around 49,521 Covid-related deaths were recorded in the first wave. Pune circle, that includes Pune district, Pimpri Chinchwad, Solapur and Satara, accounted for the highest (22%) Covid-19 fatalities in the second wave, followed by Mumbai circle (17.8%), which includes MMR. A close third is Nashik circle with 17% deaths. Ahmednagar district that falls within this circle continues to see very high transmission and nearly 700 cases daily, more than Mumbai’s daily average. Experts say the actual count of deaths in the peak months would be higher as many couldn’t get a confirmed Covid diagnosis, find a hospital bed, or may have died at home. A senior state official told TOI that the augmentation of Covid health facilities in Mumbai helped limit the deaths in the peripheral corporations as well as in the second wave. “Early part of the first wave was dominated by Mumbai and MMR, which were contributing to 50%-60% of cases and deaths. But as the infection travelled, interior areas with limited health infrastr-ucture got affected,” the official said. The second wave started with the Vidarbha region and quickly spread to Nashik, Kolhapur and Akola. Data for August and September show that MMR’s contribution to the state’s Covid fatalities has dropped to less than 15%. Pune, Nashik and Kolhapur circles are now accounting for 41%, 20% and 19% deaths, respectively. “Pune is witnessing a declining trend, although its numbers are higher than the rest,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission. “The region sees a lot of migration and inter-mingling, which could be driving the numbers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2nd-wave-claimed-89k-lives-in-state-pune-worst-affected/articleshow/86542100.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Chandigarh||Tainted MLAs in cabinet because mafia rules: AAP||Chandigarh: Condemning the inclusion of tainted MLAs in the Congress cabinet headed by new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) termed it an insult to democracy. Senior leader of the AAP and leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema said the involvement of tainted ministers made it clear that Channi was also part of the same gang and by only changing the face of the chief minister, Congress was trying to once again rob the people of their votes. He said the Gandhi family wanted to further plunder the natural resources of Punjab by including the mafia rulers in the cabinet of Punjab. Cheema said before this, Captain Amarinder Singh and his cronies had looted Punjab in four-and-a-half years and now to avoid public opposition in the run-up to the elections, the Congress changed them. He said the people of Punjab had high expectations from Channi. He said CM Channi and Congress state president Navjot Singh Sidhu should clarify their views on Rana Gurjeet. On the letter written by the Congress MLAs to the Gandhi family for non-inclusion of Gurjeet in the cabinet, Cheema said it proves the allegation of the AAP that Gurjeet is the kingpin of the sand mafia in Punjab. Expressing strong objection to the inclusion of former CM Beant Singh’s grandson Gurkirat Singh Kotli, who had faced trial in abduction and molestation of a French tourist, Cheema said it was unfortunate to include Kotli on the occasion of International Daughter’s Day. He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi should make their stand clear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tainted-mlas-in-cabinet-because-mafia-rules-aap/articleshow/86540735.cms||---

Rijiju said this while inaugurating the School of Law, Forensic Justice and Policy Studies at Gujarat Forensic Sciences University (GFSU). “The judiciary, executive and legislature are different organs but all are working for the country. People outside feel there is a turf war. There is nothing like that. We all are working for the interest of the nation,” said the Union minister, adding, “I have told the chief justice, when I became new law minister, Whenever you phone me. As the law minister of this country, I am always ready in the service of judges and judiciary. We will have to function in this manner.” Expressing contentment at the presence of many judges at the function, the minister quipped, “Today, so many judges are present here. I am really happy. At times when we face difficulties and cannot get things done politically, we place judges at the forefront. When judges are at the forefront, things get done fast. So many judges being present here is a good sign.” Commenting on the role of the government, the minister said, “In the Supreme Court, high courts and even in the lower judiciary, there are judgements or we get to listen to commentaries of judges during (court) hearings, and even anguish and satisfaction aired by them. It is our duty to implement whatever judges say,” the minister said. “There is a need for a lively relation between organs of government. In a democracy, it is very important for us to have a lively relation between us (the judiciary, executive and legislature)...It is vital for us to have a lively relationship,” the minister said. Rijiju further said the “impression” that laws are not being implemented for a long time has been removed to a great extent under the Narendra Modi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-turf-war-between-three-pillars-of-democracy-rijiju/articleshow/86538636.cms||---

The roadways had also deployed 3,500 buses for the purpose. Bus operators association president Anil Jain said, “We had decided to deploy around 25,000 buses. In Jaipur, the situation was such that we had a number of vehicles which we did not get REET candidates. In reality, too many buses were requisitioned.” Also like elections, petrol coupons were provided to bus operators, which might be adjusted at the time of final payment. According to the sub-section of Section 67 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, buses can be paid at rates prescribed. The detention charges will be paid by the education department. Ahead of REET, the state government had invoked Rajasthan Essential Services Maintenance Act (RESMA) on organisations providing transport services. Even the roadways officials claimed that they got no complaint regarding travel arrangements. “While the total number of candidates who availed free travel will be calculated after 10 days, we got around a lakh passengers apart from the usual flow in Jaipur. However, this could also be due to the fact that a lot of candidates travelled with their families or relatives for the exam,” said an official .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-buses-deployed-than-needed-say-officials/articleshow/86540715.cms||---

When the doctor noted his daily routine, it was found that he hardly moved out of a room. Right from classes to meals, everything was done in less than 30 square feet area. Dr Hiral Naik, a city-based pediatrician and secretary of Adolescent Health Academy Ahmedabad (AHAA), said that digital addiction is finding younger prey in the pandemic period. “Earlier, we used to get such cases among the teens. But now kids, who were earlier told to avoid excessive screen exposure, are given all the gadgets for studies,” she said. “The habits are directly related to mood swings and issues such as adolescent obesity.” Dr Naik was speaking at Charting Pediatrics, a one-day conference organized by AHAA along with Academy of Pediatrics (AoP), Ahmedabad, and Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) in the city. Dr Nishchal Bhatt, chairperson of AHAA, said that the session themes included newborn screening, age of viability, impact of pandemic including mental health issues and digital addiction, dengue in the pediatric population, and pediatric immunization. Speakers also elaborated on mental health issues associated with the post-pandemic world where the lack of physical activity and stimuli has resulted in a range of disorders. “In the session related to dengue in the pediatric population, we elaborated that this year the number of cases have increased at least two-fold and the severity has also increased,” said Dr Abhay Shah, who was moderator for the panel on dengue. “The Covid-19 impact on pediatric population is less studied, and we are yet to understand immunity response after infection.” Dr Shah added: “Inflammation of liver and patients with prolonged high-grade fever are higher this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/digital-addiction-spurring-adolescent-obesity/articleshow/86538658.cms||Parth Shastri

For development works, it had to borrow money whose limit is increasing every passing year. According to a communication by the finance department to the Sixth State Finance Commission, the total expenditure of the state increased from Rs 1.16 lakh crore in 2014-15 to Rs 2.13 lakh crore in 2019-20. On the other hand, revenue receipts of the state increased from Rs 91,326 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1.40 lakh crore in 2019-20. This reveals that the growth in total expenditure is 83% whereas growth in revenue receipts lagged at 53%. Revenue expenditure, which is committed in nature and cannot be differed because they constitute salaries, pension, etc, increased from Rs 94,591 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 1.76 lakh crore in 2019-20, registering an increase of Rs 87%, far overshooting the revenue receipts. In the absence of new investments, and improved economic activity, growth f revenue receipts has been decreasing, which fell from Rs 16.77% in the year 2017-18 to 1.63% in 2019-20. The extra burden has also come from increased fund allocation to centrally sponsored schemes. Earlier, the Centre used to fund 100% or in the ratio of 75:25 in the schemes. Now, the Centre has reduced its contribution, forcing the state to put in 50% or 40% of funds into the schemes. Similarly, the Centre has also restructured schemes like Pradhanmatri Awas Yojna where states are required to share additional financial burden. Doubling of annual expenditure on social security pension in 2019-20 compared to 2015-16 and interest burden of Rs 5,000 crore annually to service, the debt of the discoms are other heads that have increased the indebtedness of the state. Before the pandemic hit the country in March 2020, the fiscal situation was already in dire straits and now it has worsened. Additionally, investments and economic activities which increases tax revenues of the government have remained stagnant due to almost no new meaningful investments in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-spent-full-revenue-receipts-on-salary-and-pensions-in-fy20/articleshow/86540818.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Ashwani Sharma, state BJP president, on Sunday regretted that such an incident took place where an Amartdhari Sikh student was asked to remove his “kara”. Rakesh Kumar Chaturvadi, the head examiner, had ordered that Sikh students remove their symbols of religion before entering the examination centre. Recently a student from Alwar was forced to remove his “kara” in Jaipur by the examiner. It has also been noticed that Sikh students were called two hours before the examination in the garb of security check.  “This is pure persecution,” Ashwani Sharma said, adding, “We demand that no Sikh student be harassed or humiliated at any examination centre. When the Supreme court and Parliament allow the Sikhs to wear a “kara” then why are young students being humiliated?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/religious-sentiments-should-not-be-hurt/articleshow/86540782.cms||---

A team of counsellors reached the spot in Narol and talked to the two girls. “The girls initially just insisted that they didn’t want to go back home. But upon further prodding, they said that their mother was in a relationship with their uncle, younger brother of their father. The relationship was not new, but it got intensified during the pandemic period when their father was away,” said a counsellor. The girls tried to dissuade the duo from the relationship – as the girls claimed that the mother and uncle also developed physical relationship sometimes even when they were home – but they were threatened of dire consequences if they approached anybody on the issue. “We approached the household and confronted the girls’ mother. She accepted the relationship and said that she wanted to be with her brother-in-law. Her husband was shocked and severed ties, while assuring that he would go back to their native place in Uttar Pradesh with the girls,” said the counsellor, adding that he did not want to press any charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/help-my-mother-is-in-relationship-with-my-uncle/articleshow/86538759.cms||---

As part of the protest, people, who were drawn from all walks of life and were of all age groups — from 5-year-olds to teenagers, adults and senior citizens — embraced trees and also tied sacred threads (mouli) around tree trunks. Many came holding placards or had put up banners with messages like ‘What will you show to the tourists - landslides?’, ‘Cut the greed, not green’ and ‘No greenery, no votes.’ “Chamoli’s Chipko movement started on the same date in the 70s. We hope the administration sees it as a sign and gets into action to save the environment from further damage,” said Jagdamba Prasad Maithani, chairperson of Aagaas, one of the 20 non-profit organisations who participated in the protest.  Several youngsters who were present in the protest said that they will continue the fight to protect the trees. “We don’t want even a single tree to be cut here. We will continue our protest if our demand goes unheard,” said Nitin Maletha, president of the state committee of the Students’ Federation of India. There were people from outside the state as well who had come to lend their support to the cause. “Trees give oxygen to all. We owe them a lot, which is why I am here,” said Neeta Paghi from Palghar district in Maharashtra. This was the second such protest in a year by Dehradun residents against tree felling. Last year, on October 15, several residents had taken part in a similar protest against the state government's decision to fell around 9,000 trees in the Shivalik Elephant Reserve for the expansion of Jolly Grant Airport. The matter eventually landed in the high court, which stayed the de-notification of the reserve.

But these political parties left no stone unturned to ruin Punjab. For the last three decades, the power of Punjab has been occupied by Congress and the Badals. Being the political son of a five-time chief minister, will Sukhbir Singh Badal reveal who is really responsible for the crisis of farmers and farming and what steps did he take during his rule?” “Sukhbir was demanding compensation of Rs 1 lakh per acre today but he show the documentary records to tell how many farmers were compensated by his government in 2015? What was the punishment given to the culprits of the whitefly scam,” he asked. Sandhwan said, on the one hand, Sukhbir Singh Badal was shedding crocodile tears in front of cotton farmers, but on the other side, he was rewarding Tota Singh and his son Barjinder Singh Makhan Brar, the masterminds whitefly pesticide scam with election tickets. Sandhwan demanded 100% compensation from chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi for the loss of the cotton crop as a new crop cannot be sown now. “Today, Channi himself saw the damage due to pink bollworm infestation. Therefore, he ensure 100% compensation money is transferred in the bank account of each affected farmer,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/badals-cong-equally-responsible-for-destroying-youth-agri-aap/articleshow/86540817.cms||---

Zoo officials said the animal exchange is being carried out for breeding purposes, with only a young female lion and an old male lion left at the zoo at the moment. The exchange sees one male and two female lions arrive at the zoo, with more animal exchanges planned in the coming weeks, including a chausingha and a red-eared slider turtle. “The animal exchange has been done as the male lion is quite old and could die soon. The young female needed a companion and so a male and two more females have been brought, in the hope that there are cubs soon. While the lions have will arrive on Monday, we will also receive a chausingha, a red-eared turtle and a lady amherst’s pheasant as part of this animal exchange from Junagadh zoo in Gujarat,” an official said. Delhi zoo will meanwhile be sending two hippos – one male and one female – while it also has an excess of deer species, which can be used for other animal exchanges, as well as in this exchange. Earlier this month, a male ostrich arrived at Delhi zoo from Chhatbir zoo near Chandigarh. “As winter approaches, animal exchanges become difficult and so this is the ideal time to transport animals. Upon landing, the animals will be inspected and quarantined before they are eventually let into their enclosures. Even after all the tests are done, the animal will be allowed to be on its own first before being released in the enclosure with the other lions or ostriches,” a zoo official explained. Delhi zoo had last month also launched its CCTV central control room, which will allow the 465 HD cameras at the premises to be monitored. The zoo has over 90 different animal species at the moment, and officials claim the aim is to take the figure to 100 different species by the end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-zoo-to-welcome-three-gujarat-lions-via-exchange-programme/articleshow/86540892.cms||---

But the literally back-breaking work ensures that they don’t last for years – claimed a doctoral study. The thesis by Rutvik Purani claimed that out of 457 participants who were construction workers, 44% reported joint pain, respiratory and neurological issues. About 38% had multiple joint pain. Dr Nehal Shah, principal of SBB College of Physiotherapy and research guide to Purani, said that the study was undertaken to understand the extent of physiological and other health issues faced by the workers in largely unorganized sector. “The study covered four areas of Gujarat and covered a large spectrum of workers ranging from brick and stone masons to plumbers, plasterers, roofers, drillers, etc. About 28% were from Gujarat, whereas all others were from other states,” she said. The alarming fact that emerged from the study is age profile where majority of the workers were below 40 years of age. Vipul Pandya, general secretary of Bandhkam Majoor Sagathan, said that the findings are very close to the ground scenario. “Frequent illnesses reduce the work life of the construction worker as he later diverts into other vocations or works as contractor. Unfortunately, the construction site accidents are seldom reported, and extent of injury are also not known. But the high percentage of joint pain is surely a matter of concern,” he said. Dr Shah said that the study is a way forward for the agencies working in the field to take necessary steps to ensure safety. “Better ergonomics, use of safety equipment, etc. could be employed to reduce chances of frequent injuries. Safety norms should also be adhered to,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/construction-workers-suffer-from-joint-pains-study/articleshow/86538771.cms||Parth Shastri

The outfit, which is part of Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance, is led by MLC Sadabhau Khot. The MLC has taken a jibe at his friend-turned-foe Raju Shetti, who has announced to steer agitations against the central government for the proposed payment to the farmers in three instalments. Shetti has started a missed call campaign to garner the support of the farmers and has started a social media drive . Khot said, “Shetti is misleading the farmers. The state government has made a recommendation to the Centre to allow mills to pay the sugar cane price to the farmers in three instalments. I am confident that the central government will never accept the recommendation. Therefore, I ask him (Shetti) to protest against the state government, which I am sure he will not. Therefore, to make farmers aware of the reality and to protest against the state government’s recommendation, we are going to hold a protest on October 5 from Solapur.” Shetti earlier had slammed both state and the centre governments for proposing to pay the price in three instalments. The mills have to pay price within 15 days after the sugar cane is cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-outfit-to-hold-protest-on-october-5/articleshow/86534737.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Add mucormycosis, dengue to police health scheme: Maharashtra DGP||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra director general of police Sanjay Pandey has proposed to the home department to include emerging diseases such as mucormycosis and dengue in the Maharashtra Police Family Health Scheme as their treatment can be prolonged and expensive.  Pandey last month sent a proposal to the home chief secretary to increase the scope of various diseases and their treatment in the implementation of the health scheme for those covered under the term ‘Family’ in Rule 2 (3) of 1961. So far, inpatient treatment for 39 diseases is permissible at 171 empanelled hospitals.  According to senior officers with the Maharashtra Police, the decision has been taken in light of the rise in occurrence of these diseases over the last few years. Also, the treatment for these diseases, particularly mucormycosis, can be expensive and long. The proposal also seeks to include hysterectomy, high grade fever (dengue, leptospirosis, chikungunya, malaria), cellulitis, migraine, swine flu, knee bone diseases and stomach diseases. The letter states that policemen working in the state are constantly deployed at different places for various security arrangements. Their eating schedules are irregular due to the erratic hours of duty. Being away from family, they also don’t always have access to nutritious food, the DGP stated in the proposal letter. They often eat junk food, compromising their health. The letter also suggested further additions to the scheme, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), varicose veins and slipped disc, among others.  Pandey said the state policemen should get facilities available to military and paramilitary personnel, adding that the inclusion of more diseases under the health scheme will improve morale and help them perform their duties better. A proposal was first sent in 2016 by the then DGP Praveen Dixit, to bring dengue, malaria and swine flu under the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/add-mucormycosis-dengue-to-police-health-scheme-in-mumbai-dgp/articleshow/86542474.cms||Ahmed Ali

Former sarpanch of Benaulim Royla Fernandes objected to the way the minutes of the meeting were being read out. She said that it was an incomplete document as the minutes of the last meeting weren’t at all recorded in the document and it wasn’t signed by the panchayat secretary. “When we questioned, the panchayat secretary (temporarily deputed for the gram sabha) said that he was merely reading out whatever was contained in the papers, and that the minutes were not signed by the then panchayat secretary. It was then that I realised that there was something amiss. The gram sabha was being conducted unlawfully,” Fernandes said. Following her objections, it was decided that the gram sabha will now be held on October 10. “We are having this gram sabha after nearly two years. It appears that over the last two years, the panchayat didn’t submit the minutes of the last meeting to the Block Development Officer (BDO) as is the procedure. Had we gone ahead with the meeting without objecting to the manner in which the minutes of the last meeting were being read out, a bad precedent would have been set of passing the minutes without containing the signature of the panchayat secretary,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/benaulim-gram-sabha-adjourned/articleshow/86542190.cms||---

As Gulab uprooted huge trees and electricity poles, the twin states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana geared up to face the brunt of the cyclone. Trains were cancelled and fishermen evacuated as heavy rains with strong gales hit several areas in north coastal Andhra. The fisherman who died was identified as Bunga Mohan Rao. He was in a group of six when their boat capsized in the Bay of Bengal near Akkupalle in Srikakulam district. The others swam to safety. The storm is likely to move west-north-westwards and weaken into a deep depression on Monday morning. Under its impact, heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Telangana, Odisha and AP. Several districts of Telangana began receiving heavy rains by Sunday evening, and dark clouds hovered over Hyderabad. With the meteorological experts giving a forecast of heavy to very heavy rains in most parts of Telangana for the next three-days, chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a teleconference with the district collectors and put all the districts’ administration on high alert. Officials from the Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) said they are tracking the cyclone. Somesh Kumar who was in Delhi for attending the conference of the chief ministers convened by Union home minister Amit Shah, conducted a teleconference with the collectors following the alert issued by the India Meteorological Department. “Hyderabad may witness heavy rain on September 27-28 after the cyclone moves towards south Chhattisgarh and it's neighbouring areas. After it crosses, parts of Telangana will receive heavy rains for one or two days,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad. After IMD Hyderabad said heavy rains may lead to flash floods in parts of city, the GHMC’s disaster management troops were kept on standby and all leaves cancelled. District collectors were directed set up control rooms in the respective collectorates as IMD issued red alert to the north Telangana districts and yellow alert to southern parts of the State. “The police department must coordinate with other departments to ensure that relief measures were taken up on a war foot wherever needed. Special focus should be on low-lying areas and the tanks which were likely to suffer breaches because of heavy inflow of rain water into it,” Kumar said. The services of the NDRF teams should be utilised wherever necessary and that respective district administration should maintain a high vigil to ensure that people did not cross rivulets and canals that were expected to overflow because of heavy inflows, he said. The district collectors were told to nominate special officers to all the mandals to ensure that there was no loss of life or property. Also, the officials should take the help of citizens in conducting relief works. All the necessary precautionary measures should be taken and constant monitoring of water levels in various tanks and reservoirs should be done, the chief secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-ap-on-red-alert-as-cyclone-gulab-makes-landfall/articleshow/86542171.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Delhi||One-third of those appearing for tests on automated driving tracks in Delhi flunked this year||NEW DELHI: Nearly one-third of applicants appearing for tests on automated driving test tracks in Delhi failed this year and it was the highest among five states where such tests for driving licences is being implemented.  The four other states which have implemented the same system are Karnataka, Punjab, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The percentage of failure is the least at barely 1% in Punjab and 3% in Rajasthan. According to the government data till September 21, a total of 9,509 applicants out of 28,647 who took the test on an automated testing track in Delhi could not pass the test. In the case of Gujarat, which was among the first few states to introduce such tracks in the country, the failure percentage was nearly 16%. While experts said there is a huge scope for improvement so far as the automated driving test track system is concerned, at least now the process has begun. “Earlier, people used to get the licence without even undertaking any test. Now that’s slowly becoming a thing of the past. Now the focus should be on specifying a standard when we are going for such tracks across the country and are also encouraging private players to invest in such facilities,” said an official. A senior government official said the tests in automated driving test tracks are primarily linked to the “kerb hits”, which means the number of such hits decides the pass or failure of an applicant on such tracks.  These are recorded either in the CCTV footage or sensors are used to record them. But there are certain cases where “time cycle” to complete a formation is taken as the parameter, which is not an ideal norm. Most of the automated driving test tracks have eight formations and every driver has to complete each of them. Officials from state transport departments admitted that there is a need to bring uniformity in the design and methodology for evaluating the test results across the country in this field. “We tried to develop automated driving test tracks on the lines of the ones in Singapore and Hong Kong. But it did not go ahead. Now that the government has focussed on automated tests without any human intervention, it’s high time we have national standard for this entire ecosystem,” said Pradeep Agrawal, former director (infra) at National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRiP), a government funded project under the heavy industries ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-third-of-those-appearing-for-tests-on-automated-driving-tracks-in-delhi-flunked-this-year/articleshow/86540941.cms||Dipak K Dash

The association has the affiliation of government schools in Pune and Pune rural areas and the members of the association collectively decided to conduct the exam based on the previous online sessions and also the offline classes from October 4. A tentative date of October 21 has been set for city areas where schools will be reopened offline for Std VIII to XII while in rural areas the offline school will be conducted from Std V onwards. The association said the decision to reopen schools was necessary and students would not suffer any more because of the many disadvantages of online education. President of the Pune District School Principals’ Association, Harishchandra Gaikwad, said they have been stressing on offline teaching for a very long time. “We have informed all our affiliated schools to conduct the mid-term exam offline and start preparing for it from now. As per the government notification regarding the annual academic calendar, the exam will be held around October 21.” The schools will have to prepare a question paper for every subject of all classes from Std V to XII in order to be ready for the exam from October third week. The principals’ association had conducted several meetings with the state government with a proposal to restart schools in the state and had also contemplated offline exams in batches for secondary school students as the decision on reopening schools was being delayed. “Now that the government has already announced the reopening, we shall go ahead with our plan for offline exams as it is a must especially for higher school students,” Deepak Raisoni, member of the association and management committee member of the Shikshan Sevak Mandal, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/principals-guild-gets-ready-for-offline-mid-term-exams/articleshow/86538816.cms||---

Vadnere, while speaking during a webinar organised by the ‘Centre for Climate Change and Sustainable Studies’ of the Shivaji University Kolhapur, said the year-long management of floods is necessary to ensure that the cities, towns and villages do not get flooded in case of normal rains. “We need to bring systemic changes to the administrative setup and one of the change should be setting up a separate department for flood management. The dedicated staff and engineers will help in proper coordination with other departments and monitor floods anywhere in the state. The department can also workout rehabilitation models in case extremely heavy rains lead to evacuation,” he said. “While extremely heavy rains is the major reason for floods, encroachments in the flood zones too need to blamed. The construction regulations needs to be followed strictly in flood zones areas. Ideally, the flood plains should be kept free of encroachments. However, if that is not possible, then there is a need of a law banning construction activities along the river banks,” he added. Vadnere also said there is no need to worry about accumulation of silt in dams. “Currently, the dams have silt not more than 10%, but in the long run, silt may become a cause of worry. Hence, All activities that cause silt accumulation in the dams should be banned by the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/state-must-set-up-separate-dept-for-flood-management-vadnere/articleshow/86534808.cms||---

Commissioner of police Deepak Pandey will hold a meeting with the petrol pump dealers to get acquainted with their concerns related to security , f any. From August 15, the city police started the rule of ‘no helmet no petrol’ at petrol pumps across the city to popularise the use of helmets among two-wheeler riders. If a biker does not wear a helmet while going to a petrol pump, he or she will not get the fuel. As this could lead to arguments between the customers and the petrol pump staffers, police personnel were deployed at the petrol pumps in two shifts. Pandey said over the past one-and-a-half months, a large number of bikers have got into the practice of using helmets. The police have also issued notices to the petrol pump owners to ensure the CCTV cameras on their premises are working so that in case there is a violation of the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule, it can be checked. Senior police officials said over 90% of bikers have started using helmets in the city. Those coming to petrol pumps are wearing helmets while the traffic police have also launched a helmet checking drive on the streets, under which two-wheeler riders without a helmet are asked to leave their vehicles and attend a counselling session at the Children’s Traffic Education Park. Only after attending the session, they can get their vehicle back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-bandobast-at-nashik-petrol-pumps-likely-to-be-removed-from-september-30/articleshow/86534826.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Kochiites have been reclaiming their lives slowly ever since the city began unlocking in phases. Night stalls and roadside eateries have been getting busier by the day and with restaurants joining in, the city is gradually returning to normalcy. However, it was a slow start for the watering holes. Restaurant owners in the city said they were buoyed by the sight of family crowds stepping out into the streets. “It was a great response today. We were doing brisk business during the lunch hours. Since MG Road is a business hub, naturally people who come for shopping, dine-in here. Earlier, since lockdowns were imposed on Sundays, families were unable to shop for weddings or for other purposes. Also, there were people who used to avoid bringing families for shopping in the city considering the difficulty to have lunch. Today, most people had stepped out of their homes had come for shopping and as well as for dine-in,” said Nishan Nizar of Ceylon Hotel, Ernakulam. Even as the restaurants are starting to see diners, bars had a slow start on Sunday. Jose Pradeep, a state executive committee member of Federation of Kerala Hotel Association said that the footfalls at bars were quite low. “Many could have gotten used drinking at home. They have realized that it helps them save money too. They could be hesitating to restart the habit of visiting bars for a drink,” said Pradeep, adding that it is a positive sign that sales are picking up and hopefully things will be back to normal soon. A manager with a star hotel in the city said that out of the four pubs within the hotel only two were opened on Sunday. “Two of our outlets had to stay closed due to the unavailability of staff on such a short notice. Customers had turned up but there was no heavy footfall as compared to the time before Covid. Hopefully, people will become more confident and things will change in the coming days,” he said. Meanwhile, restaurant owners said that the government should be taking steps as well to ensure that only those who have fully vaccinated certificates are dining at hotels. “Other than taking their word, it is not practical for hoteliers to ask everyone for a certificate before dining. Authorities should conduct random checks,” said a restaurateur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/as-city-unlocks-restaurants-bars-resume-dine-in-services/articleshow/86536808.cms||---

---||Dehradun||No Lokayukta yet; state put on notice||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday issued notices to the state government and secretary, department of good governance and eradication of corruption, after a public interest litigation (PIL) argued that even eight years after the introduction of the Lokayukta Act in the state; and three years after the Supreme Court order, a Lokayukta was yet to be appointed. The petition, filed by a Haldwani resident, Ravi Shankar Joshi, stated that the Act was introduced in Uttarakhand in 2013. However, the very next year, it was replaced with a ‘milder’ and ‘toothless’ legislation. It goes on to say that a petition had been pending in the Supreme Court on the issue but in January 2018, the apex court was informed by the state government that a new legislation titled Uttarakhand Lokayukta Bill-2017 had been drafted and would soon be passed by the legislature. The SC then directed the state government to appoint a Lokayukta within three months of the enactment of the Bill. But there has been no development on the issue since. A bare comparison of the 2013 Act and the new Lokayukta Act, the petition said, revealed that the state government had diluted the old legislation. “There has been an effort to make it ineffective in as much as the commencement of the Act has been made indefinite. It is stated that the old Act was to be made operational within 180 days of its securing assent from the Governor. However, in the new Act, an amendment has been made that the Act shall come into force on the date of appointment of the Lokayukta,” read the petition, adding that since no Lokayukta had been appointed in the state, the Act was yet to be implemented. Joshi goes on to say the 2013 legislation included the CM in its definition of ‘public servant’ but the newer one gave a special regard to the latter. “The old Act also had several provisions to maintain impartiality of the Lokayukta. It said the person appointed at the post would have a cooling period of at least two years and not be able to join any other government posting after demitting office. It had also given him ample powers to deal with the allegations of corruption. But all these provisions have been removed,” Joshi said. The HC, meanwhile, has given the respondents four weeks to file their counter-affidavits and listed the case for further hearing after that. box What the petitioner says The petition, filed by a Haldwani resident, Ravi Shankar Joshi, states that the Act was introduced in Uttarakhand in 2013.

Cial and Muziris Heritage Project Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding the same on Sunday. Cial, known for its initiatives to promote green energy, owns a 24-seater air-conditioned solar boat which is intended for trial operation in the West Coast Canal, which is being renovated by its subsidiary Kerala Waterways & Infrastructures Ltd. Earlier in February, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the first phase of the canal renovation project by taking a short cruise on the solar boat at the Veli-Kadinamkulam stretch of the canal in Thiruvananthapuram. The plan is to make use of the boat to generate additional revenue till its full-fledged operation for the canal system begins. “As the tourism sector in the state has started witnessing a surge, Cial decided to try out a new revenue stream by deploying its solar boat for the cruise activity until the canal project is completed. As per the MoU signed by Cial managing director S Suhas and Muziris Heritage Project managing director P M Nowshad, the boat will be used for the circuit tours conducted by Muziris Heritage Project, on a revenue-sharing basis,” said Cial in a statement. The boat has 15 solar panels mounted on its roof and the generated power is stored in the battery. The system can also draw power from conventional sources. The boat can be operated for straight five hours on a single charging. It can cruise through a waterbody having a minimum depth of 45cm. The circuit tours are one of the main attractions of the Muziris tourism project and the hop-on hop-off boat service that traverses the hotspots in the erstwhile Muziris region, the hub of Kerala’s ancient spice trade, was the first of its kind in the country. The solar boat is expected to be part of the hop-on hop-off service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cials-solar-boats-to-be-roped-in-for-heritage-tour/articleshow/86536844.cms||---

According to an online ticket booking website, Munawar Faruqui is scheduled to do three shows - Dongri to Nowhere - in Gujarat next month. The first is scheduled at Sanjeev Kumar Auditorium in Surat on October 1, the second at HK College Auditorium at Ahmedabad and the third at Pandit Dindayal Upadhyay Nagargruh in Vadodara. “Munawar Faruqui has been habitually ridiculing Hindu gods and goddesses. He has been hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus with his comedy. The Hindu society has been tolerant, but the Bajrang Dal is not. Bajrang Dal knows how to give tit for tat,” said Jvalit Mehta, north Gujarat convener of Bajrang Dal. He added that the Bajrang Dal will now allow any show of Faruqui to be held in Gujarat. “I am saying this to the organisers. Cancel all his shows. If you do not, be ready to face the consequences – financial, physical and mental. No matter what, Bajrang Dal will now allow these shows to be held in Gujarat,” said Mehta in a recorded video message. Jvalit Mehta said that his organisation is still attempting to identify the show organizer. “Bajrang Dal activists will be present at all three locations in the three cities to ensure the shows are not held,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bajrang-dal-warns-it-will-disrupt-comedians-shows/articleshow/86538850.cms||---

You skid, fall and often break your backs on these roads, forget break-neck speeds. One need not go far.  In Nava Vadaj alone, which witnessed one of the highest number of road stretches resurfaced during 2020-21 budget in western Ahmedabad, 23 stretches in total, many have already started to crack. TOI sampled three stretches in Nava Vadaj area and found that their defect liability period has been marked between November and December 2023. TimesViewThe high court has ruled six times since 2010 on potholes and road works, reprimanding the AMC for poor infrastructure. Safe, motorable and reliable roads for commuting are the right of every citizen. Ahmedabad roads are still plagued by caveins, potholes, and pits which pose a serious danger especially during the monsoon. It is time the AMC commits to building high quality, long-lasting public roads.“We are yet to check whether the roads constructed witnessed some digging for civic utilities. The contractor too has to be asked,” claimed a senior AMC zonal official. Amts depot to Bharat mata udyanIt’s worth mentioning that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) spends an average 11.75% of its annual budget expenditure for road, street maintenance and footpath and sweeping of roads. With expansion of city, the expenditure has also increased from Rs 618 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 962.59 crore in 2020-21 Surprisingly the expenditure for resurfacing the roads has also increased every year, the expenditure for resurfacing road was Rs 159.92 crore in 2015-16, but the expenditure for resurfacing jumped to Rs 241.91 crore in 2020-21, claims the Patheya budget centre report for 2020-21. Airport“AMC should reduce the expenditure on resurfacing roads by improving the quality and durability of initial build so that the roads last longer. The percentage expenditure on resurfacing roads is around 25% of the total money spent on road construction and maintenance, including footpaths,” claims Mahender Jethmalani of Patheya budget centre. He adds, “A large portion of roads in city get washed away in the heavy monsoon rainfall and road quality gets deteriorated, causing the need to resurface.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drizzle-shows-road-outrage/articleshow/86538868.cms||---

The APMC market supplies vegetables and other agriculture produce to the local vendors who then make them available to the citizens at local markets. Hundreds of tonne of vegetables and fruits are brought to the APMC by the farmers on a daily basis and Monday mostly witnesses lot of rush. On Sunday the APMC committee members unanimously decided to support the call for bandh. Meanwhile, Congress party has also extended its support to Bharat Bandh and party’s district president Satej Patil has asked the party workers and supporters to participate the bandh by holding protests. “The bandh call has been given to support the farmers who are protesting in Delhi for last several months against the three farm laws. We too oppose the farm laws passed by the Parliament as these laws are against the welfare of the farmers. I appeal to the party workers and supporters to protest peacefully.” The organisations have also appealed to the traders to participate in the bandh. However, no decision was taken by the traders’ body.

Both citizens and corporators, however, have accused the BMC-appointed clean-up marshals of harassing people with fines.  BMC data reveals that over the past three days, the number of people penalised consistently hovered around 10,000 every day, with over Rs 18 lakh being collected in penalties daily. Corporators across civic wards, though, are of the opinion that the aggressive levy of fines amounts to harassment, rather than actual motivation for people to put on their masks. Corporators said the marshals have been haranguing citizens at traffic signals and at various sea fronts, even if a person is found to be pulling their mask down for a few seconds, leading to constant arguments breaking out. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said that the BMC ought to instead try innovative ways of appealing to Mumbaikars to put on their masks. “While we all want rules to be implemented, it should not be at the cost of citizens being troubled. They [marshals] almost bully anyone who does not have their mask on,” said Patel. Binit Tanna, a Versova resident, said that marshals at Juhu have been penalising people even for smoking in their own cars, which is not their job. “In some cases, people are also being penalised exorbitantly. I recently saw a marshal demand Rs 2,000 from a person who wasn’t wearing a mask. This is no way to get citizens to follow the rule,” said Tanna. Bandra corporator Swapna Mhatre said that the marshals have fixed spots in the city where they station themselves and collect fines. “People at times put on their masks when they see the marshal come close and later pull it down again. We must finally realise that masks are needed for one’s own safety against coronavirus,” she said. Last month, the daily count of people being penalised had dropped to below 5,000. However, prior to Ganpati festivities in the city, and considering the threat of the third wave of coronavirus, BMC and Mumbai Police once again started fining over 10,000 Mumbaikars daily. The city hit its peak on September 6, when close to 14,000 people were fined. So far, the total number of people fined by the authorities since the beginning of the pandemic adds up to 34.4 lakh, while the total fine collected since then is Rs 60.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citizens-irked-as-10k-hit-with-no-mask-fine-daily/articleshow/86542187.cms||---

The bulk of deaths in the district was reported from rural areas. The data released by the civil hospital shows the drop in Covid-related deaths. The number has dropped significantly in Nashik city, even as the number in rural areas has not been as encouraging. The number of deaths reported between August 25 and September 25 was 59, much lower than 67 deaths reported between July 25 and August 25, data shared by the civil hospital showed. The deaths in Nashik rural areas dropped from to 42 from 44 during the same period, while Nashik city registered from 23 to 17. “The number of active Covid-19 cases has had a significant drop in urban areas as against rural areas,” Dr Anant Pawar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the civil hospital, said. Besides, the direct relation between deaths and the rise in the numbers of cases, the officer also pointed out that the lack of health awareness among people in rural areas was a big reason for the death toll still being higher. “One thing to be noted is that most number of Covid-deaths are of those suffering from comorbidity, who are being presented late to the medical system. Most of them are unaware of their comorbidity until they were admitted to the hospital for Covid treatment in serious conditions,” the officer added. The health department has, therefore, appealed to people to ensure that they seek medical help as soon as they fall ill and show symptoms of the infection. “Medical intervention at the right time helps in treating the patients,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fewer-covid-deaths-in-nashik-district-in-sept/articleshow/86534891.cms||Abhilash Botekar

HDFC was the latest to announce sub-7% rates for home loans, valid for all new applications for disbursement till October-end, irrespective of the loan amount or the category of employment of the applicant. It follows (SBI), Kotak Mahindra, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, and other state-owned, privately-run, and a handful of large cooperative banks, who have taken advantage of ample liquidity in the market, buoyed by RBI maintaining low interest rates. Also working to the advantage of consumers is the active policy of banks shifting their focus to retail lending, after a spate of risky corporate lending, observers added. However, the linking of individual credit scores to the special festive rate by some banks and NBFCs, including HDFC, has some real estate players voicing discontent, especially with the pandemic hitting repayment schedules of many. “The reduction of home loans to rates such as 6.6% or 6.7% is definitely a big plus point for the market in the coming months. However, there are practical roadblocks to availing those rates, especially with some wanting a credit score of 800 or more from the customers because there were many defaulters due to the pandemic,” said Darshan Chawla, president of the Professional Realtors of Pune. “The recent report by Credai found housing sales in Pune showed good progress this year. We have had 3,000 walk-ins over the past few weeks, and 10-12% of those leads have converted to sales,” said Vineet Goyal, managing director of the Kohinoor Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-home-loan-rates-dip-real-estate-players-see-promise/articleshow/86538920.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Kochi||IT sector in Kochi may opt for hybrid work mode||KOCHI: The IT industry in Kochi, which had survived the Covid-19 pandemic with minor bruises in terms of staff cut, is slowly coming back to normalcy in terms of work pattern, with the probability of a hybrid work model of work-from-home (WFH) and work-from-office (WFO) evolving. And for the IT crowd, a lot of hiring is going on now, with multiple job offers and high salary levels in the Kochi market. “After the first wave, up to 2,000 people were coming to work, who belonged to the firms which had been managing critical operations for their clients. Currently, the figure has increased to 4,000 to 5,000 professionals,” said Infopark manager (marketing) Arun Rajeevan. According to Rajeevan, much of the workforce of Infopark have taken the second vaccine dose. With the precautionary step of vaccinations, the companies might revert to WFO or hybrid working model. “The companies might ask their employees to return to office by January, that too in a phased manner,” Rajeevan said. “The smaller IT companies are waiting for the industry leaders to take a step in returning to WFO mode. They are looking at what Infosys or TCS is going to do now,” he added. “During the initial stage of the pandemic, there was a line of thought that WFH is going to continue permanently, but now, I think that is not the case. WFH will continue, but mainly as a backup or contingency measure,” Rajeevan said. Meanwhile, in the recent past, the IT industry in Kochi is witnessing a lot of hiring. “TCS has been hiring in increased numbers – during the last two or three months itself they could have hired 700-800 people in Kochi. Mitsogo is another firm that had hired during the pandemic period with around 100 hirings done on their Infopark campus,” Rajeevan said. “TCS’s plan to invest Rs 690 crore in setting up an innovation park and related development will create 10,000 jobs in Kochi in the coming years,” he added. Jyothis Joseph, founder and CEO of ellow.io, an online tech-talent marketplace, reveals the reason for the swift hiring happening now. “After the first six months of the pandemic, companies had started hiring in September-October, 2020 and when it restarted suddenly, there was a huge demand for talent in the market with the candidates getting two or three offers simultaneously. And the candidates started bargaining with the companies resulting in increased salary levels. So, right now, the market is in the hands of the candidates. Both big and small companies are finding it difficult to hire professionals in Kochi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/it-sector-may-opt-for-hybrid-work-mode/articleshow/86536883.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Nashik||Nashik: Restaurant business gets buzzing again as patrons step out||NASHIK: Business at restaurants, which are operating at 50% capacity, has been picking up even as specialist restaurants are missing skilled staff, as some of them are yet to return due to the threat of the pandemic’s third wave. “Since restaurants were allowed to function till 10 pm, business has picked up with a larger number of people now opting to dine out. The business is gaining momentum with 60% turnover as compared to that of pre-Covid times,” said Sanjay Chavhan, president of Association of Bar Hotels and Restaurants, Nashik unit. The wait time at some dining halls and restaurants has also increased lately. People are willing to dine out and enjoy time with family members but, due to restrictions, many have to cancel their plans, especially on weekends. “We had to wait for more than one hour for the meals that would take up another hour. So, we changed our decision to take the parcel home,” said Aniket Sathe, a local resident. At the same time, specialist restaurants are still missing their skilled staff even as big hotels and restaurants, which are organised, have managed to get their staff into the kitchens. “The bigger restaurants have got their staff back, but the standalone restaurants are still waiting for their staff as the pace of business is restricted,” Shailesh Kute, director of a private hotel, said. The reason is that the staff working in the Chinese food segment comes from Nepal, those at most tandoor-centric restaurants come from Odisha and West Bengal, while the non-vegetarian specialists come from Lucknow. “All the staff rushed to Maharashtra after the end of the first wave. But they had to go back again due to increasing cases in the second wave. Now, they are discouraged with the news about the ‘third wave’ and they are taking their time,” Chavan added. The organisation has, therefore, appealed to the state government to remove the cap on 50% capacity and limited business hours. “Travellers will need restaurants, hence the government should consider the appeal,” said Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/restaurant-biz-gets-buzzing-again-as-patrons-step-out/articleshow/86534865.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kochi||Cochin airport uses gamification to engage passengers||KOCHI: Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial), in association with School of Management Studies (SMS), Cusat, launched a passenger engagement programme at the airport with the help of the new age technology of gamification. Named Hrudayapoorvam Cial, it revolves around World Heart Day (September 29) celebrations and a slew of programmes like interactive video game that teaches its viewers basic first-aid principles for heart disease, 30-second plank challenge, basic life support drill, etc. are planned. “Airports are no longer considered simple infrastructure providers but are now a sophisticated and competitive business. Customer experience is fast becoming one of the most important tools to differentiate them from their competitors. This is where the relevance of gamification, which is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts, comes in,” said Manu Melwin Joy, assistant professor of SMS and a gamification expert. The overall theme of Hrudayapurvam Cial, organized by SMS as part of its CSR activities, is based on three aspects: Equity — use your heart to connect to other heart; prevention — use your heart to connect to your heart; and community — use heart to connect to people with heart diseases. Based on these, four initiatives are being organized at Cial. Joy said that the first one is Life Saver Interactive Video Game, an interactive game based on community aspect that teaches its viewers basic first-aid principles. Passengers who are interested can play the game in their mobile phone for five minutes, going through the experience of saving a person suffering from heart attack. If the passenger succeeds in completing the game, Rs 100 will be donated in their name to the heart surgery of a child who needs financial assistance at Aster Medcity, who is the sponsor of the programme. “The final one will be held on the day of World Heart Day. It is an exclusive basic life support (BLS) drill carried out by a dedicated team of health professionals for the public to educate them about life-saving skills. Training will be given to Cial staff too,” said Joy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-airport-uses-gamification-to-engage-passengers/articleshow/86536896.cms||---

The Karnataka government is planning to increase the height of the dam to 524m from current 519m. The Karnataka government claims it has got the approval from the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal to increase the height of the dam. Shetti on Saturday met Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai in Belagavi and discussed the issue with him. “I met him along with farmers from border areas of both Maharashtra and Karnataka. The increase in height will cause frequent flooding in Shirol tehsil. The slope of Krishna river flattens beyond Narsinhawadi and if more water is stored in Almatti dam it will cause inundation of villages along the river down. After hearing us, Bommai said he has asked his officials to study the effect of increasing the height of the dam and assured he will invite us to discuss the issue before taking the final decision,” said Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-meets-ktaka-cm-to-discuss-almatti-dam/articleshow/86534909.cms||---
---||Pune||Uncertainty about school transport places operators on shaky ground||Pune: School bus transporters whose buses and vans were impounded by banks and financial institutions over the last year-and-half when they could not pay the instalments after schools shut and their source of income dried up don’t know how to resume their services now that the government has allowed the reopening of schools from October 4 . Many operators said they did not get any communication from schools to resume services. Getting the buses back on the roads, students to use the buses and their staff back is a challenge, they said. Raju Latamble, who owns a big fleet of school buses in Pune, told TOI that no school or parents had contacted him. “I own 250 school buses, but 11 of them were impounded by the bank since I could not pay their instalments. It is a big challenge for us to get the buses back on the roads. They require maintenance. It will cost me around Rs 1.50 lakh for each of my buses to become operational again. The state government has also said that the schools will close again if Covid cases increase,” he added. The state government has said that classes from Stds VIII to XII will reopen in the urban areas while those from Std V to XII will function in the rural areas. Another transporter said getting the staff on board was a challenge as all of them had left for other jobs. “If I bring them back, they will ask for an advance and I will have to ensure that their salaries are paid. The staff include the drivers, conductors and mainly the female bus attendant who takes care of the children. If the school closes again, they will hold me responsible as they will be taking a risk of leaving their current jobs and joining me. Moreover, I will need buses to have a certain number of students so that some profit can be earned. It is a long time before the challenges for us are over,” he said. Parents were in two minds. “The school is yet to contact us and the PMC will come up with its own regulations. The vaccine meant for children has not arrived and I am unsure whether I will send both my children to the school for now,” a Kondhwa based mother of two said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/uncertainty-about-school-transport-places-operators-on-shaky-ground/articleshow/86538917.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Engr among 3 held for thrashing 2 shepherds||Kota: An assistant engineer (AEN) of Chhabra Super Critical Thermal Power Plant (CSCTPP) in Baran and two private agency guards were arrested on Saturday night for brutally thrashing two shepherds. The shepherds had lodged a case of beating and torturing them in naked condition within the plant. However, CSCTPP management alleged that the two were caught red-handed while stealing items from the plant. The management said that the arrest of the engineer was ‘illegal’ as he was not involved in the matter. They said the fight took place between the security agency and the villagers and the thieves in the area get political patronage. The victims, identified as Jainarayan Lodha and Giriraj Lodha lodged a case against assistant engineer Kallaram Meena and 4-5 other persons. They stated in the report that around eight days back the accused took them forcibly to the plant and thrashed them. The video of the act went viral on social media on Saturday morning following which the two victims reached the police station to lodge a report. Police lodged a case under Sections 342, 232, 379, 384 and 327 of IPC against the engineer and five others on Saturday evening, seized the vehicle used in the crime and sent the two victims for medical examination. Later at night on Saturday, the police arrested AEN Kallaram Meena, his driver Golu Kevat and private security guard Vikram Sharma, the rest will be caught soon, said a police official.The incidents of burglary are rampant despite 14-kilometre long boundary wall around the plant and round-the-clock security, said CP Himanshu, chief engineer of the plant. He said that the AEN holds only administrative responsibility of the private security agency and had nothing to do with the issue, nor was he seen in the video. Local BJP MLA Pratap Singh Singhavi condemned the incident and demanded strict action against the accused. He said that instead of confessing their mistake, the thermal management has lodged a false report of burglary against the villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/engr-among-3-held-for-thrashing-2-shepherds/articleshow/86541065.cms||---
---||Kolkata||A day after accident, cops posted near potholes on EM Bypass||Kolkata: Cops took the initiative to get some of the potholes on EM Bypass filled up with broken bricks and deployed constables at these spots to prevent any further accident. The move came a day after a 58-year-old man, riding a scooter, landed in one of the deep potholes near VIP Bazaar on EM Bypass and sustained severe injuries. Cops said they had to take the drastic measure after repeated complaints submitted to KMDA, the custodian of the road, fell on the officials’ deaf ears. They have been citing waterlogging at a hot-mix plant in Baruipur as the reason behind the delay in carrying out a repair work of the stretch. “We have received multiple complaints from the cops and following daily inspections we are also aware of the extremely poor condition of the road surface on some parts of EM Bypass. The stretch, where the accident happened, is in a very bad shape. However, it is because of the waterlogging at our hot mix plant in Baruipur that we are unable to generate enough asphalt required to carry out a patchwork. Till Sunday morning, our entire plant was under knee deep water. However, we have used additional pumps to drain out the water on Sunday and will conduct a patchwork on EM Bypass late on Sunday,” said a KMDA official. TOI spoke to a close relative of the man and learn that the 58-year-old had fractured his left leg, collar bone as well as ribs and is slated to undergo a major surgery. The woman, however, said she was unwilling to comment on how the accident happened as they are yet to see if the man had at all hit a pothole or was hit by a vehicle from behind. The elderly man is admitted at a hospital on EM Bypass. “The man has been riding two wheelers since his teenage. He had met with an accident way back in 1988 when he was hit by a bus and had fractured his left leg. This time he has fractured the same leg again for no fault on his part,” said the relative. A senior officer of Kolkata traffic police said that large parts of the Bypass, especially the stretch between Ambedkar Bridge and Hiland Park, is dotted with large potholes and craters, some of which are more than ankle deep and four to six feet in diameter. “The roads need immediate repairs, otherwise more accidents will happen. The craters are so deep that the vehicles with small wheels like scooters are extremely susceptible to accidents,” said a traffic sergeant on duty at EM Bypass on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-accident-cops-posted-near-potholes-on-em-bypass/articleshow/86538930.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Additional commissioner of police, Ajay Pal Lamba, said that the police arrested Anand Shandaliya (50), for helping Bishnoi in making extortion calls to a city-based building. Bishnoi was brought to Jaipur on a production warrant from Tihar Jail, New Delhi, along with his man Friday Sampat Nehra. “Shandaliya knew the builder and passed on his information to Bishnoi’s gang. We had been on surveillance after the builder filed an FIR,” Lamba said, adding that the accused earlier worked with slain gangster Anandpal Singh. Police said that Shandaliya was earlier arrested by the Special Operations Group (SOG) as one of the ring leaders of a blackmailing racket. “He was sent to Ajmer jail where he struck a rapport with Bishnoi,” Lamba said, adding that police have unravelled the Bishnoi’s main network in the city. The builder had filed a complaint at Jawahar Nagar police station on September 7, alleging that he had received WhatsApp calls from unknown numbers. The caller introduced himself as Bishnoi and demanded extortion of Rs 1 crore. A special police team was constituted and found that call was made from Mandoli jail by Sampat Nehra. Both Nehra and his boss Bishnoi were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gangster-lawrence-bishnois-city-aide-held/articleshow/86541093.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Leaders of so-called secular parties consider Muslims as mere vote bank: Owaisi||With pics Done/ALVI Faiz.Siddiqui@timesgroup.com Kanpur: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) national president Asaduddin Owaisi targeted all political parties for using Muslims as a vote bank and said the condition of Muslims has become like a ‘band baja party’ in a marriage procession where they (Muslims) are first asked to play music, but are made to stand outside on reaching the wedding venue. Addressing a public meeting in Jajmau’s Tel Mill Compound area on Sunday, Owaisi said, “Now Muslims will not play the instrument of secularism. The truth of the politics of the country is that those who have power — the MLAs, the MPs — are listened to.” Those killed in the CAA and NRC protests are martyrs and this general meeting today is dedicated to those martyrs, he added. “May all those who killed those people perish,” said Owaisi further. Appealing to the people, he said only the candidate of the Majlis should win in the assembly elections. Accusing all the governments of discrimination, “In the eyes of all other political parties, Muslims are merely a vote bank. These parties have not done justice to Muslims. Only those who have power are heard,” he said while accusing the Central and state governments of discrimination. Owaisi also attacked SP president Akhilesh Yadav, BSP supremo Mayawati and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and said they refrain from speaking on the issues of Muslims. “While opposing the CAA, we tore the copy of the black law in the House. Rahul, Maya, and Akhilesh did not speak on the arrest of Maulana Kaleem because they are afraid that they will not get the vote of one section,” he said and added, “When the verdict came in the Babri criminal case, we alone spoke in the House.” He said Atiq Ahmed and Mukhtar Ansari were put in jail by the BJP-led state government. “It’s not only them, but 27% of Muslims are in jails,” he said. Owaisi also alleged that there is a conspiracy of closing the tanneries in Kanpur due to which Dalits and Muslims became jobless. “All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is with every poor and weak of the country,” he added. Countering attacks of rivals, Owaisi said, “BJP government was not formed anywhere when AIMIM contested elections. We fought elections in Bengal, Maharashtra and Jharkhand but BJP government was not formed there. If BJP wins, then how can we be responsible for it.” Further taking the names of castes and leaders, Owaisi said, “Even every caste has a leader, but Muslims have no leader. There is 19% Muslim population in UP but there is not a single leader. The constitution gives us the right to become a leader.” Describing himself as the leader of Muslims, he said, “Not just one, but 100 Owaisis are needed in the state. And this will not be done by merely raising sentimental slogans but by being Mutahid (coming together).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/leaders-of-so-called-secular-parties-consider-muslims-as-mere-vote-bank-owaisi/articleshow/86540008.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Police are on the lookout for the associates of the two fraudsters who were arrested and sent to jail for posting the fake advertisements on Facebook. Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust’s chief executive officer Sunil Verma was informed about the fake advertisements following which he lodged an FIR. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh said, “Our team arrested the accused Shashikant Chaurasia and his accomplice Ratna Shekhar alias Ashu, who also posed as a BJP office-bearer, on Sunday. Both have been sent to jail while a manhunt has been launched for their accomplices, including one who furnished a fake certificate of the DM.” According to officials, construction of shops is proposed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream project Kashi Vishwanath Dham area but no allotment has been started yet since the project is still not complete and the November 15 deadline for its completion is still over a month away. Chaurasia had posted fake advertisements on his Facebook page. Temple Trust CEO Verma said, “Some officials saw Chaurasia’s advertisement which mentioned that shops are available in limited numbers and price of each shop was Rs 70 lakh. Those interested in the shops were asked to contact at the earliest.” Verma lodged a complaint following which the Dashashwamedh police started investigation. Assistant police commissioner, Dashashwamedh, Awadhesh Kumar Pandey said, “The fraudsters had also finalised the deal of some shops. Investigations are on to find out whether any transaction of money was done in these deals.” Police are probing whether the accused had taken Rs 35 lakh as the advertisement mentioned that buyers had to pay 50% of the cost in advance. One more accomplice of Chaurasia and Ashu is on the radar of police for furnishing a fake certificate in the name of the DM regarding allotment of shops, said police officials. “Ratna Shekhar used to negotiate for the shops while posing as the vice president of BJP’s Kashi region unit. In his facebook profile, Chaurasia posed as a real estate trader owning a firm Lion Group,” added officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/two-fraudsters-arrested-forselling-shops-in-kv-dham/articleshow/86539977.cms||---

The study, published in Indian Journal of Tuberculosis, says that 16% of the 485 TB patients suffer from depression and its prevalence is high among those in the age group of 18-40 years. The study was conducted by the department of community medicine and public health of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. Fifty-four per cent of the patients, who were found suffering from depression, are unmarried and 19% are from urban area. Depression is seen significantly higher among the previously treated patients. The study also found that 40% of the 485 TB patients have comorbidities with diabetes constituting the major comorbidity followed by hypertension. It has been noted that depression is significantly high among multi-drug resistant TB patients. Those who conducted the study says that stigma related to TB is the major reason for depression among the patients. “Many believe that only those living in slums contract TB. Such anxiety is high among young unmarried patients. They find it difficult to get matrimonial alliance forcing them to hide the disease,” says Dr Charutha Retnakumar, who was part of the team which conducted the study. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-16-of-tb-patients-suffer-from-depression/articleshow/86536936.cms||---

The 100-metre long wall painting along the Kashmere Gate ISBT ramp depicts a young girl reading a book and how her education ensures the transition from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge. A three-line poem by Yogesh Saini next to the painting reads, “She brings light to darkness; she is the source of life; she is a daughter!” The mural also depicts a veritable library of classic books by Indian and western writers, including Gitanjali by Tagore, Godaan by Munshi Premchand, Great Expectations by Dickens, with an underlying message that a girl's future is full of possibilities to learn endlessly.  Deputy commissioner of City-Sadar Paharganj zone, north corporation, Shashanka Ala said, “We asked Delhi Street Art to restore the four-year-old murals in the area and focus on sending a clear message about educating the girl child.” Yogesh Saini, the founder of Delhi Street Art, said that the team was thrilled when presented with an opportunity to design and create an iconic mural with a meaningful underlying message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/queen-size-message/articleshow/86541058.cms||Anindya Chattopadhyay
---||Pune||Rental agreements on Rs 20 stamp paper cause revenue loss to Pune Municipal Corporation||PUNE: Flawed rental agreements pertaining to 138 municipal properties, leased out several years ago on Rs20 stamp paper, pose problems for the civic body. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials claimed that details pertaining to the contract status of these properties and their termination dates are not known, leading to legal complications. The rent charged is also based on old rates, leading to loss of revenue to the civic body. Civic officials stated that the contracts rented for less than 99 years were being scrutinised. “We have started the process of sending notices to the occupants of civic properties. These people have equal responsibility to renew their contracts but have not done so. The reasons will be checked, and action initiated accordingly,” Rajendra Muthe, head of the PMC’s estate management department, told TOI. Muthe said that the contracts will be renewed as per the prevailing ready reckoner rates. It will help increase the income of the civic body. The PMC hopes to generate around Rs50 crore after scrutiny and renewal of contracts. Another PMC official said that if any of the tenant is not willing to continue with the contract, the civic body will take the property in its possession. Fresh tenders for renting out these properties will be issued. The new rent policy came into effect in 2010. So, all the contracts before it will be scrutinised, an official said. The civic body has 6,000 properties, including vacant land plots and constructed properties. The PMC data show that 4,200 flats are with the civic body of which 1,200 are occupied . The constructed properties include cultural centres, halls and small buildings. These have been given to various social organisation, sports clubs or cultural groups for maintenance and management. They are expected to hold social, cultural activities for the public. Some educational institutions have also been established on civic properties. Renting out of these properties generated controversies in the past as many political leaders tried to grab the properties through their socio-political organisations. Some of the tenants have stayed on civic properties without paying rents to the municipal corporation for years together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rental-agreements-on-rs-20-stamp-paper-cause-revenue-loss-to-pmc/articleshow/86538942.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Mumbai||Can fix home damaged by BMC wall crash: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: In a relief for a Khar senior citizen whose house was damaged after a BMC compound wall collapsed on it in July last year amid the Covid-induced lockdown, the Bombay high court has allowed her to repair and reconstruct the structure. The interim order by Justice Gautam Patel on September 13, was passed in a pending suit by Bridget Pereira (69) who lives on the premises where BMC’s new H-West ward office has been constructed in 2nd Hasnabad Lane. Pereira’s father, Dr Francis Noronha, was allowed by the erstwhile Bandra Municipality to occupy a temporary shed of 674 sq ft in September 1949. He retired from BMC’s services in May 1974. In view of previous commitments made by the Bandra Municipality, the then BMC commissioner, in May 1974, allowed Dr Noronha to continue occupying it post-retirement subject to paying reasonable ground rent and treating it as vacant land tenancy. After her marriage in 1974, Pereira continued staying with her father who passed away in February 1981. In July 2015, the BMC assistant engineer sent notices, asking for documents pertaining to occupation of the structure. The next month, the HC directed that Pereira would not be dispossessed without following due process of law. Ultimately on June 7, 2016, the assistant engineer issued her a notice to vacate and accept alternative accommodation under the project-affected persons (PAP) policy. In August 2016, HC directed a status quo. In July 2020, the BMC’s compound wall collapsed on her house substantially damaging it and making it unsafe for habitation. “There are photographs showing the collapse of the wall and resultant waterlogging,” Justice Patel noted in his order. He also noted that the BMC wants the land for its ward office and Pereira to shift to alternative premises at Malad. Pereira’s advocate Bhavesh Parmar said she is not a PAP and cannot be swept away under this policy. Justice Patel said Pereira’s interim prayers—to direct the BMC to grant permission for repairs and reconstruction and to be reimbursed by the civic body in due course—are not only eminently reasonable but also consonant with the status quo order. “All that is required is a restoration of the premises to its previous condition before the wall collapsed,” he added. Justice Patel refused BMC advocate Rajesh Patil’s request to stay the order saying it is without basis. “The BMC can have no legal right to say that a structure damaged by a collapse of a wall that it had constructed should forever remain damaged and in ruins,” the HC added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/can-fix-home-damaged-by-bmc-wall-crash-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/86542195.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Crucially,, he added that his organisation is seeking financial assistance for every staged production. The performance spaces, closed since March 2020, were allowed to open in February this year, but a new closure was ordered in April as the number of active Covid-19 cases rose sharply during the second wave. “The artists and production houses have been badly hit by Covid and it will take at least three years before they come back to normal. We will have to begin from scratch,” Kadam said. He pointed out that plays will be performed before audiences at 50% capacity and the audience will also be cautious about returning to theatres. In such cases, the artists will hardly get returns for their performance because the production houses will not be able to bear the costs. “We have, therefore, written to the state government to provide some assistance to production houses that launch the plays on stage,” Kadam said. Besides, to boost the artists’ confidence, the parishad has also decided to start competitions at the earliest so that the artists are drawn back to theatre. Theatre operators have also sought that government and local self-governing bodies contribute towards the development by initiating 50% discount in fees for the staged programmes, said Jaiprakash Jategaonkar, a theatre contractor. Regardless, the managers and employees of cinema halls are upbeat about the government decision. The manager of a cinema hall said that several staff members were laid off during the period because of mounting losses. “We started this exercise of calling the staff back about a week ago. The foremost criterion is complete vaccination. We will also be monitoring the health of our staff,” the manager added. The manager said that all protective measures, thermal scanning, proof of vaccination certificate for those above 18 years and such other steps, would be undertaken when operations begin, besides carrying out sanitization of the hall after every show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/natya-parishad-to-seek-financial-assistance-for-artists/articleshow/86534910.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Despite a 24-hour rescue effort, authorities failed to locate the person, who is now feared dead. The person is suspected to be a 42-year-old techie who had stepped out of his home for a smoke. The shocking incident was accidentally captured by a person making a video of the rain and the flooded Puppalaguda-Neknampur stretch. Around 9pm on Saturday, the man, who had pulled his pants up, was seen walking on the edge of the road, wading through ankle-deep water, as seen in the video. After walking for a few yards, unaware there was a trench, he fell into the gushing water, which swept him away. The whole incident was captured on a phone camera by a person, who was making a video. Cyberabad police suspect the missing person could be a software engineer, who stayed in the neighbourhood. Though officials claim the area was barricaded, there were no visible signs of any barricades in the video and the man could easily access the area, leading to his fatal fall. Meanwhile, a married woman came on to the road in search of her husband, who went out for a smoke. On seeing a large number of people gathered at the open drain, she came to know that a man got washed away in the drain. After seeing the video and based on the shirt colour, she strongly suspected the victim was her husband, a software engineer who works in a company at Shadnagar. Disaster Response Force (DRF) of GHMC and other agencies, including police, immediately launched a search operation in Punjanbagh and Ibrahim Cheruvu and other catchment areas. A missing case was registered by local police. Manikonda municipal commissioner S Jayanth said they were still searching for the person. Speaking to TOI, he said that they had barricaded the drain work in the locality and added that the work got delayed due to Ganesh festival. “The work started about two months ago. It has been delayed by two weeks because of the Ganesh festival. We have barricaded the area. Chances are that after falling in the drain, he might have got swept away towards Ibrahim Cheruvu and Musi,” Jayanth said, adding that work will be completed in the next 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trench-dug-on-city-road-swallows-man/articleshow/86542196.cms||---
---||India||Chances of Covid-19 spread in schools low: WHO chief scientist||TAMIL NADU: Tamil Nadu should consider reopening schools for all classes, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan has said, citing sero-survey results and huge learning loss over past 18 months. Addressing an event here on Sunday, Soumya said one of the main findings of ICMR’s fourth sero prevalence study conducted in June and July was that nearly the same percentage of children as adults had antibodies against Covid-19 despite schools remaining closed. School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, who inaugurated “Every child a scientist” programme at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, said CM MK Stalin would take a final call on reopening classes. ICMR’s survey found that sero-prevalence in the country was 67.6%, while it was 57.2% in 6-9 age group and 61.6% in the 10-17 age group. At the function, Soumya said antibody prevalence among kids was because of the community exposure as kids go shopping, playing and mingling with others. “The chances for Covid infection spreading in schools are low and if we follow protocol like improving ventilation, social distancing, sanitation, it should be possible to open schools.” There is no scientific basis to claims that the next Covid wave will affect children, she said. “Children are not vaccinated. So, it’s possible that the proportion of infection will change, but severity of disease is very minimal among children when compared to adults. Among the younger age group, less than 1% of children are getting admitted to the hospitals.” Clinical trials are being conducted for two vaccines for children in the country by Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila companies. Earlier, the WHO chief scientist said that the children had been away from school for the last 18 months and there has been a huge loss of learning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chances-of-covid-19-spread-in-schools-low-who-chief-scientist/articleshow/86543370.cms||---

Police suspect that the two — Bhavesh Shah (45) and 24-year-old Alpesh Padhiyar — may have died due to gas leakage. When the incident happened around 14 workers were present in the factory, a police official said. Apart from the two victims no one else suffered any medical complications due the suspected gas leakage, he added. Police said that Shah and Padhiyar were found unconscious around 3.18 am in the plant located at GIDC estate in Nandesari. The two workers were taken to a private hospital in Chhani, but the doctors declared them dead before admission. “We are waiting for the postmortem report to know the exact cause of death. But it is suspected that they may have inhaled some poisonous gas that leaked accidentally,” said a police official. Later, during the day, scientific experts too visited the plant and carried out inspection to zero in on the cause of deaths. A case of accidental death has been registered at the Nandesari police station. “We are investigating it as accidental deaths. Around a dozen other workers were also working in the plant during the same time. We will also question them as apart from the two deceased no one else had complained of health problems,” a police official said. Initial probe revealed that Shah, a resident of Nandesari, was working at the company as a plant operator for the last three years. Padhiyar, who lives at Anklav in neighbouring Anand district, had joined the company around a fortnight ago as a contractual worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/2-found-dead-in-chemical-unit-gas-leak-suspected/articleshow/86537685.cms||---

During the same period, as much as 15.74 TMC water flowed through the Nandur Madhmeshwar pick-up weir in Niphad taluka before entering the Jayakwadi catchment area. Heavy rainfall in the western region of the Nashik district contributed to the increased water storage in Godavari valley, while similar showers in Surgana and adjoining areas contributed to storage in dams located in Girna Valley. Water storage in the Gangapur dam complex with Gangapur and two other dams rose from 8.45 TMC (83%) to 9.3 TMC (99.5%) during the period. “The heavy rain in the month of September ensured the dams are brimming with water to the extent that the Water Resources Department had to discharge water at the rate of 8,000 cusec to ensure there was room for the water coming from upstream,” said resident deputy collector Bhagwat Doifode. Water in dams across Godavari valley stands at 35.55 TMC (86% of 41.11 TMC) while water in dams across Girna valley stands at 19.52 TMC (79% of 24.7 TMC). The overall storage across seven major and 17 medium projects is 55 TMC (84% of 65.8 TMC).

Data of Delhi Police accessed by TOI showed 392 programmes — 51 dharnas, 339 demonstrations and two rallies — which included farmers’ agitation and students protests, took place till September 24. During the same period in 2020, 249 programmes were held in the heart of the city, which included 37 dharnas, 210 demonstrations and two rallies. Asked about the increase in numbers, a senior police officer said the programmes increased following Covid-19 norms being eased this year. While permission was given for some programmes by police, the rest were illegal. According to standing orders, not more than 1,000 people are permitted at Jantar Mantar. “Last year, there was a complete lockdown. After the restrictions were lifted, people started reaching Jantar Mantar for demonstrations and dharnas. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had prohibited all public gatherings in the capital in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Action was taken against many people for violating the guidelines,” the officer said. The data showed that this year 56 cases were registered, 118 people were arrested and 837 detained for violating the DDMA guidelines. A senior officer said, “If we see the data of 2019, there were 797 programmes, including 687 demonstrations, 87 dharnas and 24 rallies. There was a drastic reduction in the number of programmes due to Covid-19.” DCP (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said they had taken proper precautions for the safety of police personnel as well as protesters and ensured that DDMA guidelines were followed. In July, farmers demanding scrapping of the agri laws during the monsoon session of Parliament were permitted to stage demonstrations at Jantar Mantar. “Before permitting any protest, we gather intelligence inputs after receiving the request from the organisers. We also meet the organisers and if we find everything fine, then permission is granted. If we find something suspicious, then permission is denied,” said the officer. If the protesters go ahead with the programme even after being denied permission, then arrangements are made by police to stop them from reaching Jantar Mantar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dharnas-at-jantar-mantar-up-this-year-most-without-nod/articleshow/86541152.cms||Abhay Singh

Though the yearly difference in number of births of boys and girls had decreased continuously from 2011-12 to 2019-20, it increased slightly in 2020-21, which is a cause for concern.

But, only in 2021-22, it increased slightly from 36,268 in 2019-20 to 36,888 in 2021-22, which is a concern. “There is a need for continuous efforts for effective implementation of pre-conception pre-natal diagnostic technique Act to bring down the difference between births of baby boys and girls,” said Rajan Chaudhary, an activist, who helped the health department in conducting several decoy operations in the state to nab those involved in sex determination and female foeticide. The difference between the number of birth of boys and girls has been reducing sharply. “In 2020-21, at an average of 101 less girl children were taking birth daily,which was 100 in 2019-20,” said Rajan Chaudhary, an activist, who helped thehealth department in conducting several decoy operations in the state for nabbing the accused involved in sex determination and female feticide.

---||Kolkata||Two weekends to go, Sunday shoppers flood malls & mkts across city despite rain||Kolkata: Despite sporadic showers, a large number of people crowded the markets and malls across the city on Sunday. Some of the shoppers braved the waterlogged stretches of various roads in the city, saying that they had little time to shop before Durga Puja, with two more weekends being left. New Market, Gariahat, Hatibagan markets and some malls saw people coming in early to avoid rush but shopping continued till late in the evening. There was a lull for a couple of hours when it rained post noon but shoppers were soon back to the markets. Shopping started late owing to several factors, of which the apprehension of a third wave was the topmost. Most of the shoppers said that they have been vaccinated with both the doses and the inoculation of the employees at shops helped them muster the courage to venture out for shopping. The crowds brought smiles on the faces of the traders at New Market. They were happy to see that shoppers streamed into the market, despite waterlogging inside. Most of the footfalls converted to sales and the earlier tendency for window shopping has reduced since the pandemic set in, according to some traders. “Shopping this weekend, despite the rain, has been so good that we have been able to reach 70% of our 2019 sales and we hope the sales will increase further it over the next two weekends,” said Vinay Mangalani, the owner of Bombay Silk Stores. Right from saris to linen, furnishings, jewellery and cosmetics, shop owners were happy with the crowds. “We feared that the rain might play a spoilsport,” said Naresh Gurbani, the owner of Cott Counter, a children’s wear shop. The shops and hawkers at Gariahat saw enthusiastic shoppers who started crowding, despite the overcast sky since noon. “There was a small gap of an hour between 12:30pm and 1:30pm when it poured. But the moment the sky cleared up, people were back. We had very good sales in ethnic menswear,” said Achintya Sinha of New Choice Punjabi at Gariahat. Shop owners said that this time they stocked up for the new puja collections late because of the pandemic and then the incessant rain. “But we are happy with what we saw this weekend, though there were intermittent heavy rain. Shopping can once more be compared to the 2019 figures. Shopping started late also because many people have lost their jobs and many have had salary reductions, but somehow this weekend the shopping pulse raced at all retail markets,” said Sushil Poddar, president of the Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Associations. Dipanwita Saha, a business woman, crossed a few waterlogged stretches from her residence at Urbana to reach Gariahat with her mother to buy saris and children’s wear. “It has been raining so heavily and erratically this year but we don’t have any more time because gifts also need to be sent out. So, my mother and I went out for shopping on Sunday,” Saha said. Some malls in the city have been doing even better and some said that they have crossed the 2019 figures by 10%. “Despite the rains, the footfall has been around 68,000 this weekend. The rain could not stop the shoppers from coming to our malls,” said a spokesperson of Ambuja Neotia that owns two City Centre malls. This was echoed by K Vijayan, CEO of Acropolis, who said, “The crowd has come in with the ebb and flow of rains and we pray that the rain does not spoil this huge enthusiasm that is back among shoppers. We are running schemes to woo the shoppers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-weekends-to-go-sunday-shoppers-flood-malls-mkts-across-city-despite-rain/articleshow/86539006.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

According to the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS) and manual entry, DK’s attendance has gone up from 60% on day one to 80%. The DK schools, from grade VI to X opened this Monday for in-person classes. Government schools from grade VIII to X commenced last Friday. N Shobha, subject inspector and coordinator for school attendance in DK, giving out the details, said that on the first two days, when schools reopened, campuses had reported about 60% of overall attendance in the district. However, as on September 24, the attendance has improved to 80%, especially in government schools. Few unaided and private schools have continued online classes for some grades, owing to staff shortage. The schools which had terminated their teaching faculty due to the financial crisis are yet to recruit manpower, she said. The 20% of students who are not attending classes are mostly from North Karnataka and other districts. “They are yet to return to the district. Since there is no compulsory attendance, their arrival to campus is likely to be delayed for a month. It also depends on the Covid situation in the district. Some students have remained at home to attend online classes for genuine reasons,” Shobha told TOI. Malleswamy, DDPI, DK said parents are now requesting the department to consider opening lower primary schools. “The decision to open schools for grades I to V is with the government,” he said. Shambhu Shankar, coordinator, Block Resource Centre, Belthangady taluk said, the government and aided schools have 83.5% and 84.7% attendance. The unaided schools have 79.9% attendance, as on Friday. “Overall in Belthangady BEO limit, attendance was about 80.8% as on Friday,” he said. The response from students is also positive. A DPI official said that students will take time to get back on track academically. “What we have observed is that the zeal for learning is not lost, despite schools being closed for a long time. Teachers are ensuring that students maintain social distance. Classes with a large number of students, which were once managed by a single teacher, are now divided into two or three classes, so the teachers have to take additional classes,” the official said. Some students in rural areas are facing transport issues, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/attendance-in-dk-schools-crosses-80/articleshow/86536981.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Kolkata||Students graduate without campus visit since March ’20||Kolkata: The special dress and shoes Vedika Lahoti had bought to wear to her college farewell party lie neatly in her cupboard. The day she had been looking forward to during her college life never ever came, robbing her of the chance to bid her friends, teachers and campus a heartfelt goodbye. Mohar Bhattacharjee had just started getting into her own after getting into college and was forging new bonds with friends when in the third semester a small notice by the college authorities abruptly ended a special time in her life. Atreyee Chakraborty is a biochemistry graduate but she could not do a basic experiment like DNA Isolation and some others because they classes had shifted online after the pandemic and campuses had shut down. In the eighteen months since the outbreak of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, vaccination has picked up and restrictions eased but there is no word on reopening of schools and colleges. For thousands of students in Kolkata colleges, who have graduated this year, saying a heartfelt goodbye to their friends and teachers and creating memories to cherish for the entire lifetime has remained a distant dream. “I don’t know how to explain the heartbreak I experience when I think I will never be able to step inside the campus as a student, walk the corridors I loved so much, never be able to truly thank my teachers and not say the last goodbye to my friends. College life is something I was looking forward to, but the pandemic robbed it away from me. It was not supposed to end like this,” said Mohar Bhattacharjee, who has graduated in English honours from Asutosh College this year. She took admission in mid-2018 and was between third and fourth semester when the campuses shut down in March 2020 and studies shifted online. Graduation marks an important landmark in the lives of students, who are finally eager to carve a place in the world and the farewell is an important milestone in this journey. “When I parted from my friends in March 2020 it was a mess. We were panicked and never said proper goodbye. I thought we will be back within a few weeks. But now I realise we will never ever get back those moments. I had bought a dress with shoes to go with it hoping against hope for a farewell, but both are neatly lying in my cupboard,” said Vedika Lahoti, a graduate from Lady Brabourne College. “Campus is just not about knowledge from books but also about learning life skills. Young adults form a support system in terms of friends and learn how to deal with various difficult situations in life without help of the family,” said Madhulika Bose, a sociologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-graduate-without-campus-visit-since-march-20/articleshow/86539031.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The number of persons who received the first dose has touched 3.99 crore, while those who received both the doses have crossed 1.49 crore. The eligible population that needs to be vaccinated in the state stands at 5.14 crore. On Sunday, only 3,381 doses were administered till 8pm. A senior health department official said, “Since the nurses remained busy in REET examination centres to ensure Covid protocol, vaccination sites remained affected. Also, due to Internet services remaining suspended, doses were not updated on Cowin portal.” In the portal, 27 districts were showing zero doses administered. The number of doses administered in the age group of 18 to 44 years has increased to 2.9 crore, while the above 60 years population has received 1.12 crore doses.

---||Kolkata||UGC must-see list sans Victoria Memorial irks historians||KOLKATA: Victoria Memorial Hall does not feature on the list of the 100 “must-visit” tourist destinations in India, drawn up by the University Grants Commission for the universities. The list was sent to universities on September 22, asking them to encourage students to visit these places as part of the Ek Bharat Sreshtha Bharat scheme that is being promoted by the Centre. This has especially peeved historians in the city because VMH is celebrating its centenary this year. Historians felt that the reason behind the exclusion could be that VMH has always been considered by a section of academics to be a feting of the Raj. However, they criticized this approach and said Victoria Memorial is much more than a piece of Raj-era relic and with the passage of time, has turned into an icon that comes to one’s mind the moment one talks about Kolkata. “This especially upsets me because it has come from the UGC and its opinion is taken seriously by the academic world. I still remember that 50 years ago, undergraduate study of history would start with a visit to VMH, because its annals house relics that give one the right perspective to start out as a scholar. There’s much more to VMH than just its façade, which too is incredibly beautiful,” said historian Ramkrishna Chatterjee, who is also the publications secretary of Asiatic Society. Universities said that they have received the list from UGC that said since the pandemic was on, varsities can start by virtually introducing students to the 100 places on the list and visits can be organized after the pandemic is over. “We are not taking this seriously. Can you imagine that the list does not include Qutab Minar! In fact, a large part of Mughal Delhi is absent from the list. There is a greater emphasis on ancient sites that are neither Muslim nor British. Such polarisation of education is not for greater good,” said a VC, not wishing to be named. Historian Arun Bandyopadhyay, former Nurul Hasan Chair professor of Calcutta University, called this a “historical mistake”. VMH is “an important repository of social and cultural changes in modern India. On the one hand, the Centre is celebrating its centenary(it is under the ministry of culture) while on the other, it is being ignored by another branch of the Centre!” he said. VMH has been branded as one of the most-visited sites on travel literature promoted by the likes of Lonely Planet, Trip Advisor and Fodor’s, pointed out VMH curator and secretary, Jayanta Sengupta. “We are celebrating the century of VMH with much fervour. I don’t wish to comment on the exclusion. I can just say that in the last pre-pandemic year, we were visited by 40 lakh,” he said. VMH was built between 1906 and 1921. Lord Curzon decided to build a fitting memorial to Queen Victoria after she died in 1901 and the Raj thought it proper to follow through, especially because at that time, Calcutta was the capital of the Empire. It’s another matter that by the time the memorial was thrown open to the people, the capital had shifted to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ugc-must-see-list-sans-victoria-irks-historians/articleshow/86539058.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Jaipur||‘Bluetooth also needs to be jammed if govt wants to stop cheating’||Jaipur: Suspension of Internet alone cannot prevent cheating during REET or any other exam, say experts, who called the decision to suspend Internet an error of judgement by the state. Until broadband connections are active in buildings near examination centres and jammers are not in place, chances of cheating cannot be ruled out. “During investigation of cases related to cheating, I found that organised cheating gangs have connived with exam centres allowing candidates to use their internet for cheating. If exam centres don’t connive with these gangs, they install broadband connections at a house/building near the exam centres and connect them with devices inside the exam hall,” said Mukesh Choudhary, cyber-crime expert assisting Jaipur police. Talking about the use of bluetooth devices, he said any organised cheating gang would ask candidates to carry micro earpods connected with mobile phones, which are kept in a range of 10-40 metres. “Bluetooth devices, which are fixed inside one’s ear, pocket, shirt button, scalp etc and connected with a mobile phone kept 10-40 metres away can eaily act as a sender and responder gadget,” said Choudhary. Notably, no provision of jamming bluetooth devices has been imposed by the government meaning that authorities can’t see the most popular medium as a potential for cheating in REET exam. The invigilators can easily scan active bluetooth devices operating within a radius of 10-40 metres from their phones to get a hint of active devices. “It is a universal practice followed in the west,” said Choudhary. Notably, none of the seven divisional commissioners had made the provision of scanning bluetooth devices, which is the most common practice of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bluetooth-also-needs-to-be-jammed-if-govt-wants-to-stop-cheating/articleshow/86541230.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The opposition and allied political parties had recently mounted pressure on the government for the pathetic condition of the arterial road. “We have issued stern warnings to ensure work is up to the mark and also ordered an audit of previously executed works,” he said. Motorists complained of several stretches, including those on xKasheli and Kalwa bridges, have major damage, causing vehicles to crawl to avoid mishaps. Bhiwandi resident Puneet Khimasiya who travels to Ghatkopar regularly says it is an arduous commute. He said that a roughly 10km distance on the arterial highway which initially took barely 20 minutes to cross now takes at least 2.5 hours to cross due to potholes. The Majiwada-Wadape stretch of the highway, also a part of the xMumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, is maintained by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) while the part beyond is under National Highway Authority of India, said officials. G Sharma, who claimed to be a regular commuter, tweeted how he walked down to Kharegaon in 3.5 hours and still reached faster than his stranded cab. Joint MD at the MSRDC, Anil Gaikwad, said, “We have identified the problem points and are coordinating with the traffic department to take repair blocks on the route and temporarily fix potholes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/will-fix-mumbai-nashik-hway-in-15-days-min/articleshow/86542590.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Kolkata||Jab worry over outstation students in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A free vaccination drive will start in higher education institutions of Kolkata very soon but several of their authorities are not sure whether all their outstation students will be able to take the shot on campus. Since hostels are shut and travelling still remains restricted, many will not be able to turn up, they feared. Even though there is a provision in government notice for students from districts who may take the shot at some specified local centres, nothing has been mentioned about students from other states. The state has set a deadline of October 8 to complete the vaccination drive among students of college and universities across Bengal, before Puja vacation starts. The higher education department has asked all colleges and universities to submit a list of willing students who need the first or the second dose. Jadavpur University has generated a new Google form for students where they have been asked to inform if they wish to take the vaccine on campus or not. Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association (JUTA) general secretary Partha Pratim Roy said, “Many students are from different districts who may not be able to come to Kolkata to take the jab on campus. We want to list out the exact data of students who will take the first and second doses on campus. Students have to reply by Monday night.” Engineering student and member of FETSU Aritra Majumdar said, “We have organized a unified movement and hope it works”. Calcutta University has listed 1,600 PG students who need the first dose and 2,800 who need the second. According to the Presidency University’s student’s body, 44% of the total strength wishes to take jabs on campus. Adrija Karak, a member of Presidency Student’s Union, said, “We are concerned about students from districts and other states.” Scottish Church College principal Madhumanjari Mandal said, “All the hostels are closed now and outstation students may not be able to come for free jabs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-worry-over-outstation-students/articleshow/86539101.cms||---
---||Jaipur||REET exam: How 12-hour internet ban crippled life across Rajasthan, e-business suffers||JAIPUR: Daily life and e-business took a hit in all parts of the state barring Jaipur city due to the 12-hour internet shutdown from 6am to 6pm on Sunday due to Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teacher (REET). The blanket ban virtually snapped the only mode of communication for various people. While some were unable to attend online classes, sessions and medical consultations, others had to face huge financial losses as e-businesses were affected. Sunita Singhal, 65, a resident of Panchwati in Vaishali Nagar had enrolled for an online diabetes reversal programme with a healthcare company based in Bengaluru. The six-week programme comprises compulsory two-hour sessions every Sunday. "Today, I missed my fourth session due to the internet ban. Though I can retrieve the recorded video, I have missed the live question and answer session," said Singhal. Similarly, a family in Udaipur missed a condolence meeting of their close relative that was being live-streamed from Chennai. "It’s a big loss for us and most of the family members based in Rajasthan have not been able to attend the condolence meet. Some were able to get through due to broadband connections, but most of us failed," said Nakul Goyal, a businessman based in Udaipur. The ones, who had enrolled for special online academic or corporate classes, had to struggle to find broadband connections at hotels and restaurants or had to visit their relatives and neighbours for their Wi-Fi connections. Ankit Saxena, an IT engineer, had enrolled for a high-end corporate course from an agency based in the United States. He had a harrowing time finding a decent net connection. "I chose the day and time much in advance to ensure that I am fully prepared to attend it and make the most of it. I had heard about the internet ban a week ago. I did try to confirm it with the local administration, which laughed it off by calling it a rumour," said Saxena. "It was only last evening I realised that the internet was being banned leaving me jittery. I wish they could have announced it in advance," he said. ‘Bluetooth also needs to be jammed if govt wants to stop cheating’Suspension of Internet alone cannot prevent cheating during REET or any other exam, say experts, who called the decision to suspend Internet an error of judgement by the state. Until broadband connections are active in buildings near examination centres and jammers are not in place, chances of cheating cannot be ruled out. “During investigation of cases related to cheating, I found that organised cheating gangs have connived with exam centres allowing candidates to use their internet for cheating.

Cops app rendered useless after Net banSeveral students could not find their examination centres after mobile Internet services were suspended in the city on Sunday. Several students who had downloaded the traffic police’s app ‘My Examination Centre’ could not use it due to the clampdown on mobile Internet. Student Anirudh Prajapat, who had come to a centre on Sikar Road, had difficulty in locating his centre even though he had downloaded the app. “Mobile internet was not working and therefore it had no use left,” he said. The app was designed to help students find their centres, but suspension of internet services left many in the lurch. “We did not know there will be a ban on mobile internet in the city. But this app will be used for other exams too,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/12-hour-internet-ban-cripples-life-across-cities-e-biz-suffers/articleshow/86541256.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Back to school, but classes under tree||Kolkata: On Sunday, a group of children with their mothers sat under a banyan tree in Konrapara — a tribal hamlet in Birbhum’s Nagari village — as they paid tribute to Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar on his 201st birth anniversary. It was not just about that, though. On the birth anniversary of the legendary educationist and social reformer, children of the village got a taste of primary education as well. Vidyasagar had spent his last few years in a tribal hamlet that’s now located in Jharkhand. Education has been one of the spheres Covid hit hard. Even as students in the cities and who can afford have access to online classes, the have-nots, especially children in rural India, have been left in the lurch. Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB) and Pratham Education Foundation have been working to fill up this gap that could go a long way in preventing school drop-outs and revival of primary education. Through its collaborative project titled ‘Pora Lekha’, community learning centres run by women self help groups (SHGs) are being initiated with the aim of providing community supplementary classes for children between 5 and 10 years of age. The members of SHGs are trained on using teaching and learning material shared by Pratham. The initiative is expected to create an informal space for learning while playing supplement to schools. Most members of these SHGs are young mothers who have children in that age group. “Covid forced schools to shut its doors, causing an invisible loss to students. Kids, especially the marginalised and poor, have been devoid of schoolthat resulted in loss of primary education. ‘Pora Lekha’ is an initiative to help recover what they have lost,” said Hepatologist Abhijit Chowdhury, LFWB mentor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/back-to-school-but-classes-under-tree/articleshow/86539117.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

IPA’s - or Provedoria as it is better known - decades-old existing home for the aged along the Ribandar-Chimbel road has been abandoned due to its dilapidated condition. The government had earlier mooted the new project closer to a heritage site. But after protests by heritage lovers and villagers, the department agreed to shift it to another location within the historic complex. It is here that the second indigenous religious order of Goan priests (after Oratorians at Old Goa) was set up. At one stage it also housed Goa’s first psychiatric care institution, sources said. Now, only the ruins of a façade of a 17th century church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel — a remarkable piece of architecture – stand at the spot, which the government had recently notified as a heritage site. The row arose after IPA issued a tender, to be opened on Monday, for cutting and disposal of 31 trees. Some villagers voiced their disappointment over the plan to destroy the thick vegetation that provides a quiet ambience to the place. “We are not opposed to the project, but the existing unsafe old age home can be demolished for it,” Tukaram Kunkolkar, a local activist who wrote to the department, said. Heritage activists and others agree with him. “When there’s a building of no historical value just lying waste, why should 32 beautiful old trees be sacrificed mindlessly,” Goa Heritage Action Group chairperson Heta Pandit said. Pandit said local groups have worked hard in getting the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church ruins declared as a protected monument. “It is a crime to destroy our heritage, history and nature,” she said. All efforts to contact Provedoria officials for details about the project proved futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/axing-of-32-trees-at-chimbel-historic-site-sparks-row/articleshow/86542221.cms||Paul Fernandes

She was found a few kilometres away from the spot where she had gone missing. Medical tests were conducted and she was found unharmed. The child lives with her parents in the Laljipada area of Kandivli. She went missing around 11 am on September 24. After hours of fruitless search, her parents and relatives approached Kandivli Police around 4 pm and lodged a case of kidnapping, suspecting that the child had been abducted. Cops swung into action. All nine police stations under Zone 11 of Mumbai Police were alerted . Special teams from local detection staff, Nirbhaya Squad, Protection Squad and other officers were roped in. Police teams checked marketplaces, lanes, rickshaw stands and other crowded places. They eventually found CCTV footage which showed the girl wandering off on her own.

Necessary repair will be carried out soon by seeking funds from the World Bank in order to ensure water released from the dam reaches the tail-end with minimum transition loss,” he said. Patil, who held a review meeting of his department here in presence of different public representatives, asked the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) to expedite necessary formalities for tabling the proposal for repair of Jayakwadi canal system. The ToI in the past had highlighted the issue of “busy” canals of Jayakwadi dam that have been allegedly infested with unwanted vegetations leading to leakages and causing transmission losses in the range of 25 to 40% while flowing towards far end of the command areas from Parbhani and other parts. The left bank canal system of Jayakwadi dam has an irrigable command area of around 1,41,640 hectare spread over Aurangabad , Jalna and Parbhani districts, whereas the right bank canal system has 41,682 hectare of irrigable area spread over Aurangabad and Beed districts in Marathwada besides Ahmednagar district. In another major announcement, Patil during a review meeting at Parbhani on Saturday, said the state government would go-ahead with construction of five barrages in the downstream areas of Purna dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/repair-of-jayakwadi-canal-systems-soon-jayant-patil/articleshow/86535159.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sandhya Sharma of Shastri Nagar said their family members were down with viral infections and they had no option but to order food online. But since there was no Internet, they were forced to cook, she said. Online trade of several other items were also hit. Even ATM at many places was out of order and people face problems.

---||Mumbai||Civic poll tie-up OK if respect is part of it: Sanjay Raut||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said his party should be prepared to contest civic polls, due early next year in around 10 cities, on its own and it was in favour of an alliance if it materialises with respect. He said there will be no compromise on the party’s saffron flag. Addressing party workers at Bhosari in Pimpri-Chinchwad in neighbouring Pune district, Raut said there is resentment among the cadre of the Shiv Sena in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad that the NCP, which is strong in the two cities, is “neglecting” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party despite being its alliance partner in the state government. Referring to chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray’s current visit to New Delhi, Raut in a lighter vein said he was there to take stock of the “Delhi way of functioning”. Noting that Shiv Sena workers in Pune and Pimpri-Chichwad felt the NCP was not treating their party properly ahead of the civic polls due next year, the Rajya Sabha member said: “Don't upset us, otherwise there will be a problem. (NCP leader) Ajit Pawar, who is Pune’s gaurdian minister, also listens to the chief minister. So, local NCP leaders should also accommodate the Shiv Sena.” He said it was upsetting that the Shiv Sena had not been able to unfurl its saffron flag at the civic bodies of the two cities. “We are used to fighting alone. Why wait for an alliance? Let us plan to contest all seats. If an alliance materialises with respect and dignity, its okay. There will be no compromise over our saffron flag,” the Shiv Sena leader said. Raut further added that come what may, “we have to have our own mayor in Pimpri-Chinchwad”. “If we can get the chief minister’s post with 56 MLAs, we can get the mayor’s post with 40 to 50 corporators,” the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said. After the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls, the Shiv Sena parted ways with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post and forged an alliance with the NCP and Congress to form government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/civic-poll-tie-up-ok-if-respect-is-part-of-it-in-mumbai-raut/articleshow/86542639.cms||---

Several students who had downloaded the traffic police’s app ‘My Examination Centre’ could not use it due to the clampdown on mobile Internet. Student Anirudh Prajapat, who had come to a centre on Sikar Road, had difficulty in locating his centre even though he had downloaded the app. “Mobile internet was not working and therefore it had no use left,” he said. The app was designed to help students find their centres, but suspension of internet services left many in the lurch. “We did not know there will be a ban on mobile internet in the city. But this app will be used for other exams too,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-app-rendered-useless-after-net-ban/articleshow/86541294.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The SAP, which remained stagnant for three years, would be raised from Rs 315 to Rs 340/quintal for normal cane variety from the October crushing season, a move that is being seen as a step towards keeping farmers happy, especially in the restive western UP. UP CM Yogi Adityanath made the SAP hike announcement at a kisan sammelan organised here by BJP, a day ahead of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers’ organisations under the aegis of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha on Monday. Yogi also announced that his government was planning to provide a waiver to farmers erring on payment of electricity dues. This comes close on the heels of the state government’s decision to withdraw stubble-burning cases against farmers. SAP has been raised for all sugarcane varieties with high-yielding ones fetching Rs 350 per quintal and low-yield varieties pegged at Rs 330 per quintal. Soon after assuming power in 2017, BJP raised the SAP by Rs 10 to Rs 315 and kept it unchanged, while focusing on timely payment of cane arrears to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-govt-raises-sugarcane-sap-a-day-ahead-of-farmers-bandh/articleshow/86543250.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Jaipur||REET: 90% of registered aspirants appear for test||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers (REET) was conducted on Sunday with around 90% of the registered candidates appearing for the test. There were complaints of late distribution of question papers, some candidates not being allowed to enter examination centers after the permitted time, distributing question papers from opened envelopes and not being given enough time to answer the question paper. Around 16,51,812 lakh students had registered at 4,019 exam centres for the test. It was conducted in two sessions – 10am to 12.30 pm and 2.30pm to 5pm – across the state. Many incidents of cheating and paper leaks were reported from across Rajasthan. In total, 40 were arrested and over two dozen people detained. Two candidates were arrested in Kishangarh, Ajmer, and Neema Ka Thana of Sikar for cheating in the exam through bluetooth devices hidden in slippers. A 'couple' was also caught by the special flying squad of RBSE in Purani Mandi centre, Ajmer. Though tey appeared as husband and wife, their father’s name was the same and had filed different applications. Both were handed to Kotwali police. In Mandana centre, Alwar, candidates protested alleging paper leak and police had to use lathi charge. After protest, a report has been sought from the district examination steering committee by RBSE chairman Dharampal Jaroli. Another exam will be conducted for candidates here. In Tilak PG College, Bassi, protests erupted over an alleged paper leak and police had to again resort to lathi charge to keep things under control. Candidates alleged that they received papers at 10.30am without OMR sheet. However, SDM Shiv Charan Sharma refuted the claims. “Some parents standing outside the exam centre received information that the seal of the question paper was broken. We immediately reached the spot, checked the CCTV footage and thoroughly investigated the matter. No such claim was found to be true and things were resolved,” said the SDM. The REET exam is conducted for recruiting third level (grade 3) government teachers. The exam is conducted at two levels – level 1 for recruiting teachers for classes 1 to 5 and level 2 for teachers from classes 6 to 8. In the morning session, level 2 teachers' exam was held from 10am to 12.30pm and 12,67,539 candidates appeared for it. In the afternoon session, 12,67,983 candidates took the test. Most candidates appeared for both the levels and, hence, a total of 25,35,542 candidates had registered for both levels. For security at exam centres, around 30,000 CCTV cameras were installed and 100 government employees assigned to check them. According to the board, 9 districts were identified as sensitive such as Sawai Madhopur, Karoli, Dausa, Badmer, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Bharatpur, Sikar ad Jalore where CCTV cameras were installed in all centres. In Jaipur, students were frisked properly. In most places, female candidates were asked to remove bangles and hairbands. There are around 31,000 vacancies for government teachers this year. The REET score is valid for three years. So, based on the score, candidates are eligible for the job for next two years depending on the cut-off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-90-of-registered-aspirants-appear-for-test/articleshow/86541346.cms||---

He had recently participated in the Matrix Fight Night 6, and last week, continued his unbeaten run by defeating his Iranian opponent Mohd Mahmoudiyan in Dubai. The fighter had already won all four of his bouts in the competition and on Friday, he made it 5-0 in the professional MMA circuit.

With my unbeatable record, I am confident that I will do well in the UFC, too,” said the 26-year-old. On the current scope of MMA in the country, Jubli said, “The sport is gaining ground. In a few years, it will become even bigger. People are now investing in the sport and India has a decent talent pool.” Jubli added, “In fact, MMA is perfectly suited for Uttarakhand.

I met urban development minister Eknath Shinde and have requested him for the funds to reconstruct the same,” Kande said. The taluka again received very heavy rain on the evening of September 1 with 82 mm of rain in about four hours. During both the heavy spells of rain, there were also three bridges in the town that needs to be repaired as the approach road was washed away or the grills of the bridges were damaged due to the huge flow of water during the floods. “I met Shinde as the town functions under his ministry and hence sought his attention towards Nandgaon municipal council not having funds to carry out the repairs. They should carry out the work at the earliest for the safety of the citizens,” he said. The taluka also has been at the receiving end of the rain in which the roads and farms have been damaged. “I have placed the demand with the district collector as well as the state government. I hope it is achieved sooner,” Kande added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mla-kande-demands-funds-for-reconstruction-of-bridge-in-nandgaon/articleshow/86535231.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mangaluru||This village in Karnataka says no to non-veg food at mehndi functions||UDUPI: Mehndi functions, as part of the pre-wedding ceremony, is often nothing less than a festival. In coastal towns in recent years, they have turned out to be lavish ceremonies, where people gather in large numbers and dance to popular songs, and non-vegetarian food and liquor are served. However, about 27 years ago, the elders of Kodi Bengre village, about 18 km from Udupi, felt that this trend could have a bad impact on children, as they were being introduced to drinking at family functions, which could mislead the youth, and hence decided not to serve non-vegetarian food and liquor at mehndi functions. The population of this village is around 1,600. Nagaraj B Kunder, a resident of the Kodi Bengre, told TOI, “Initially, when a decision was taken to not serve liquor and non-vegetarian food at mehndi ceremonies, there was some resistance from certain quarters, but gradually people agreed. It is an unwritten rule of the village, and the elders have adhered to it for the benefit of the people. In addition, beedi or cigarettes are not sold in this village,” he said. Most of the people who live in this village are fishermen from various communities, like Konkani Kharvi, Mogaveera, Billavas and Muslms. Also, since puja and homa are held as part of the wedding function, which is generally the day after the mehndi ceremony, the villagers felt it would be ideal to stick to a vegetarian menu, Kunder added. The village is under the Kodi gram panchayat, that has about 1,327 houses, of which nearly 300 houses are in Kodi Bengre. The entire panchayat is free of tobacco, and Kodi Bengre follows several unwritten rules, said panchayat development officer Benni Quardros. Last year, the locals had complained that a person was trying to sell liquor illegally, which was addressed and resolved. A district government official said that there are about 14 shops in the village, and none of them sell tobacco, but consumption of betel leaf and nut is permitted. The restriction on consuming tobacco is on women as well, and none of them roll beedis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/this-village-says-no-to-non-veg-food-at-mehndi-functions/articleshow/86537238.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

HIghway Safety Patrol officials told TOI that there was no accident, but an influx of vehicles moving from Mumbai to Pune may have caused the situation. Heavy vehicles often move very slowly on an upward gradient from Khandala to Lonavla and this stalls movement of light motor vehicles like cars and SUVs trailing them, said the officials. Normal traffic along the Mumbai-to-Pune corridor of the expressway was restored after two hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pune-expressway-witnesses-two-hour-traffic-jam-on-sunday/articleshow/86542687.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra health minister calls meeting to talk recruitment exam fiasco||MUMBAI: Health minister Rajesh Tope said a meeting has been called on Monday to discuss in detail the issue of why the exams for the recruitment of 6,205 personnel in the C and D categories for the health department had to be called off at the last minute as well as to take a decision on the next date for conducting the exam. The exam was part of a process to clear all non-clinical vacancies, touted as one of the biggest recruitment drives in the health department in 25 years. Tope said the exam will most likely be conducted on October 16 and 17 or October 22 and 23 depending on the availability of schools for conducting the exams. Almost 8.65 lakh applicants were slated to appear for the exams. “It will be ensured that students get their exam tickets at least 8-10 days in advance,” said the health minister. The IT company Nyasa Communication Pvt Ltd was selected from a panel of five appointed by the general administration department, said Tope. The company will be called for an explanation. “It has been directed to hold a press conference and explain to the people of Maharashtra and the students the reasons for the exam having to be called off,” said Tope. While it is understood that there were many problems with hall tickets, Tope said that the mandate of the public health department was only to prepare the question paper. “All the other infrastructure, from selection of schools, issuing of hall tickets, appointment of invigilators, ensuring Covid norms are followed to placing of jammers so no one can use electronic devices, was to be done by the IT company,” he said, adding that a lot of due diligence was done by ACS Pradeep Vyas in the selection of the IT company from the panel. One of the reasons for the postponement of the exams was the delay in securing schools for conducting the exams too, said Tope. The decision to postpone the exams was taken after approval from the CM and the Dy CM, said Tope. He said now deputy health officers in various districts will visit every school to ensure all requirements are met so that there are no glitches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tope-calls-meeting-to-talk-recruitment-exam-fiasco/articleshow/86542246.cms||Clara Lewis

The three cops including sub-inspector Vijay Parmar from the Airport police station had raided the house to nab the accused Vijay Jakhaniya who was wanted in connection with a prohibition case. Police said that Jakhaniya was absconding for a long time and on Saturday he had visited his home. Jakhaniya’s family members attacked the cops when they were leaving the village after detaining him. The cops were attacked with iron pipe and wooden sticks. To warn the attackers, Parmar pulled out his service gun. But in the melee, one of the attackers snatched Parmar’s weapon and the three cops were beaten up before the accused fled. Later, cops from the crime branch and special operations group did a combing exercise in Bedla village to nab the accused and his relatives, but they were not found. During the early hours of Sunday, based on Parmar’s complaint an offence of attempt to murder, robbery, hurting and assaulting public servant and Arms Act was registered against Jakhaniya, his wife Rasila, other family members identified as Bahadur Jakhaniya, Gordhan Jakhaniya, Ashwin Jakhaniya, Ujdi Jakhaniya, Gulab Jakhaniya and Vasant Jakhaniya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-attacked-while-arresting-bootleggers/articleshow/86537298.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mangaluru||Despite limited staff, this PHC has scripted success in vax drive||Mangaluru: Dr Diana Savitha, medical officer, Kaniyoor PHC in Belthangady, and her team has won appreciation from the district Covid officer for working in difficult conditions. With just 50% of the staff, the PHC has managed to administer the first dose of the vaccine to protect against Covid-19, to more than 80% of the population. Kaniyoor PHC has 10 sub-centres, and is one of the largest in the district, catering to a population of 48,760 in 12 villages. Dr Diana, an Ayush doctor posted at the Kaniyoor PHC, told TOI, “Ever since the Covid-19 crisis, we have been on our toes, mainly because of staff shortage, and difficult geographical conditions. We have no full-time staff at our PHC. For field work, we have only five staff for 10 sub-centres. From January this year, we got two lab technicians to collect swabs for Covid-19, and one data entry operator. The contracts of some of the staff will end this month,” she said. For a population of around 48,000, the PHC has 43 Asha workers and 63 anganwadi workers. “We have received great support from staff, including taluk health officer Dr Kalamadhu,” she said. Providing details about the vaccination coverage, she said, “In the age group 18-44, nearly 90% have received their first dose, among those between 45-59, we have covered 78% of the population. Overall, more than 80% have been covered with the first dose and about 60% with the second dose. We also went door-to-door to administer vaccines. This was a big challenge, as some areas had no transportation, and a few lacked roads. We had to cross temporary bridges and hills. We vaccinated 87 bedridden senior citizens and endosulfan victims on Thursday. The PHC also has more than 300 endosulfan victims. They were inoculated on priority,” she said. While the team has hardly taken holidays, on challenges, Dr Diana said, “Reaching out to the primary contacts on the field and collecting swabs was the biggest challenge. Initially, they would even scold us. Over time, people have understood the importance of swab collection and vaccines.” Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19, Dakshina Kannada, told TOI, “Despite limited staff, Dr Diana and her team have done an amazing job, especially in some of the remote villages where there are no roads. When it comes to administering vaccines too, the success rate has been good. Being a mother of a two-year-old boy, there are days when she has been away from her child,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/despite-limited-staff-this-phc-has-scripted-success-in-vax-drive/articleshow/86537304.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Delhi||‘Schools of Specialised Excellence to help students solve real-life issues’||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia spent time explaining the idea behind Delhi government’s Schools of Specialised Excellence and responding to an array of questions from students and parents on the day the new institution took its first steps on Monday. Around 2,200 students have joined the 20 schools in the first batch. “These schools will help children solve real-life problems and make them ready for jobs, even those that haven’t been created yet,” said Sisodia. Sisodia was present at SoSE, Kalkaji, and interacted in a live virtual programme with the students and parents of all 20 SoSEs started this year. Of the 14,245 students who sat for the aptitude test to qualify for admission to SoSE, around 2,200 students have made the grade so far. Students will pursue studies in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), humanities, performing and visual arts and high-end 21st century skills. “We are starting a new chapter in the field of education today,” said the deputy CM. “Almost 70 years ago, the Indian Institute of Technology started with its first campus at Kharagpur and 224 students. That was the need of the hour as India needed specialised education at the higher level. In today’s world, we feel the need for specialised education at the school level. That is why we established SoSE. In the coming years, these schools will set the bar not just in India, but across the world.” Janvi, a student, enquired of Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, “Sir now that we have joined SoSE, has the government planned a university for us after Class XII so that we can continue to pursue our dreams?” Sisodia responded, “As you have cleared a highly competitive aptitude test to be admitted in SoSE, you are assured of good higher education and a career. Today, I want to assure all the students and their parents that irrespective of the careers the children eventually choose, they will have immense belief in themselves. This is what the SoSE will prepare them for.” He added that the objective of SSoE was to ensure that marks weren’t the only criterion to judge a student’s success. The youngsters themselves shared the reasons why they opted for the new schools. One of them said, “I love music and that is why I joined SoSE. I am keen on a career in music and I realised the performing arts course would help me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-of-specialised-excellence-to-help-students-solve-real-life-issues/articleshow/86567326.cms||---

As the festive season approaches, a series of blockbuster banner movies are lined up for release and exhibitors hope that this time they get an extended run. Manohar Wadhwani, a national-level movie distributor based out of Nagpur, said, “The timing (of reopening) is absolutely perfect because we get to head straight into the festive season. The line-up of movies ready for release is absolutely astounding, not only from India but also foreign markets. For Maharashtra, this is one of the best news our industry has got in a long time because many big production houses have held on to their completed films for a long time, as they did not want to release on OTT.” Aditi Deshmukh, an athlete, said, “Watching movies in theatres gives a different kind of feeling. I miss going to the theatres with my friends and loved ones. It’s not actually about the movie itself, it’s about the company too. However, this time we will all have to take extra precaution with masks and hand sanitizers.” Amita Singh, an engineer, said, “No, I can't say I will visit theatres as much as I used to before the pandemic started. I’m not a movie person and used to go only to accompany friends. If I decide to go, I’ll try to go in the mornings or afternoon hours to avoid rush.” Abhiruchi Lakras, a student, said, “It’s about time we step out of our ‘safe-house’, while taking all precautionary measures. Opening of theatres sounds great but the usual hustle and bustle, the jam-packed first day first show excitement, won’t work in our favour. It will work only if the theatre administration is ready to sincerely take all measures and follow appropriate social distancing rules, maybe start the theatres at 45% occupancy, sanitize the premises after every show etc.” Another student Janhvi Jijotiya said, “I would love to revisit the theatres as I’ve been waiting to watch so many movies there. I missed going out for movies and spending time with my friends and family over there. Also, I can’t wait to have snacks from there as they just taste and feel different.” (With inputs from Sahil Pawar and Sara Khan)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/exhibitors-as-well-as-fans-excited-as-big-screens-prepare-to-light-up-again/articleshow/86539353.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Likewise, there was a candidate from Ranawas in Jodhpur who sat for for the exam knowing that she would have to go for delivery either on Sunday evening or Monday. Archana (36) got admitted to Bundi district hospital following labour pain on Saturday. Her family was in a tizzy as they knew that it was her REET on Sunday. But, she decided to sit for the test. “My hope of sitting for the exam diminished with labor pains on Saturday though due date was October 5. But I must thank the government authorities that I could give my exam and hope to clear it. I successfully passed the motherhood exam and now hope to become a teacher,” Archana said. “Special arrangements were made and the new mom was provided a separate room with bed at the centre,” said SDM Keshoraipatan Balveer Singh. A medical team was deputed outside that carried out a medical test before she was allowed in the exam room, he added. Similar were the sentiments of Raveena (28) who delivered a child on Friday at Dholpur. She appeared for the exam from the girls school at Dholpur. “My husband believed that I can sit for the exam and perform properly. The confidence of my family helped me to take part in the exam,” Archana said. Another woman Meenaxi was given a delivery date of Sunday or Monday, but she still appeared in the exam. “My mother-in-law, father-in-law, husband and my parents supported me as I could not clear the exam in the least attempt and was short of just a few marks. Thus, I decided to go for it. I have appeared in the exam and hopefully I will get myself admitted to hospital on Monday,” said Meenaxi, who is presently at Ranaswas in Pali district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/moms-sit-for-test-hours-after-delivery/articleshow/86541457.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Alerts sounded amid heavy discharge from M’wada dams||Aurangabad: The already overflowing Majalgaon and Manjra major irrigation projects in Beed district witnessed further increase in discharge due to rainfall in the catchment areas, prompting several district administrations to sound an alert. Seven other major irrigation projects in Marathwada have also been overflowing. The orange rain alert by India Meteorological Department (IMD) could cause more rain-triggered trouble for the region. As per the flood control room of the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC), Majalgaon dam was releasing water at the rate of 74,193 cusec on Sunday evening, while Manjra dam was witnessing release of excess water at a speed of 67,405 cusec. Beed district administration on Sunday afternoon cautioned people living along the banks of the Sindaphana river, a major tributary of the Godavari river, to remain alert in the wake of heavy discharge from dams. Parbhani and Nanded district administrations have also issued similar warnings. Jaising Hire, assistant superintendent engineer with command area development authority of GMIDC, said flash floods observed in catchment areas of major dams in the region due to overnight rainfall led to increase in discharge of water. “The flood management system involving major, medium and minor irrigation projects is being followed effectively given the chances of heavy rainfall in parts of Marathwada over the next two days. The necessary alerts regarding release of water from dams are being shared with respective district administrations on a regular basis,” he said. Vishnupuri dam (80,882 cusec), Lower Dudhna dam (25,878 cusec), Yeldari dam (12,659 cusec), Siddheshwar dam (17,500 cusec), Isapur dam (18,793 cusec), Lower Manar dam (1,747 cusec) and Lower Terna dam (1,530 cusec) were among major irrigation projects in Marathwada that were witnessing discharge on Sunday. The live storage in Jayakwadi major irrigation project has gone past 82% with the dam getting inflows at 17,570 cusec on Sunday evening. The combined storage in different major, medium and minor irrigation projects from Marathwada has reached to 171 TMC as against the designed live storage capacity of 260 TMC. Earlier, three revenue circles from Beed district and two each from Osmanabad and Parbhani reported over 65mm rainfall between Saturday and Sunday morning.

The Class XII student finally approached Halvad police on Saturday after she confided in her parents about her ordeal for the past many months. According to police, the two accused Jayesh Kanjariya and Mehul Hadiyal blackmailed the girl by using her photos and also threatening to kill her brother if she would not submit to their demands. Kanjariya, who also lives in Halvad, first developed friendship with the girl and used to meet her often. After a couple of meetings, Hadiyal also joined them in their meetings during which he took her private photos and videos and later, the duo started blackmailing and raping her with the pictures. For the past few days, the girl went into depression and turned uncommunicative at home. Concerned with her mental state, her parents asked what was bothering her. After a little prodding, the girl finally opened up on Saturday and narrated the trauma she had been going through. “The family brought the girl to the police station and based on her statement we have booked the two men for rape and blackmail,” said P A Dekivadiya, inspector of Halvad police station. The two accused are yet to be arrested.

Seema Sharma, a homemaker, said that she is very happy with the decision. “As a devotee, I had been waiting for this moment for a long time. While I will definitely visit the temple, I will also ensure to follow all safety measures,” she said. Clement Anthony, a student, said that he looks forward to visiting the church regularly. “Right from the time the pandemic started, the church had shifted its religious services online. But now with cases being so low, it’s a good decision by the state government. Physical presence at religious place creates a stronger bond among people,” said Anthony. Mohammad Moiz, an engineering student is happy with the decision “because people are filled with despair and hopelessness due to the pandemic”. “The pandemic has extended for so long that people have forgotten what makes a human being a human. The sense of being part of a community is missing, which can be discovered by visiting religious places. When you pray, it gives hope,” he said. Premdeep Singh Garkhel, a businessman, agrees with the decision. “One must visit religious places on a regular basis. As responsible citizens, devotees offered prayers from their home when the pandemic was at its peak. Yes, there is a risk of community transmission which we had witnessed during the second wave, but we all need blessings of all the holy gurus,” he said. Peenaz Mavalwala-Chinoy, a senior academic, said, “Acceptance and discipline are two key factors. This is the new normal. If I can go to work and be out for running errands, why shouldn’t I go to the Agyari to pay my respect.” (With inputs from Dhriti Khatri and Christus Phillips)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/visiting-religious-places-will-give-people-hope/articleshow/86539396.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Goa||Provedoria plans to axe 32 trees at Chimbel historic site||Panaji: A tender issued by the Institute of Public Assistance (IPA) for axing 32 trees for a new asylum at a historic site at Chimbel has sparked a row, as natural heritage is likely to be sacrificed instead of an unsafe building. IPA’s - or Provedoria as it is better known - decades-old existing home for the aged along the Ribandar-Chimbel road has been abandoned due to its dilapidated condition. The government had earlier mooted the new project closer to a heritage site. But after protests by heritage lovers and villagers, the department agreed to shift it to another location within the historic complex. It is here that the second indigenous religious order of Goan priests (after Oratorians at Old Goa) was set up. At one stage it also housed Goa’s first psychiatric care institution, sources said. Now, only the ruins of a façade of an 18th century chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel — a remarkable piece of architecture – stand at the spot, which the government had recently notified as a heritage site. The row arose after IPA issued a tender, to be opened on Monday, for cutting and disposal of 32 trees. Some villagers voiced their disappointment over the plan to destroy the thick vegetation that provides a quiet ambience to the place. “We are not opposed to the project, but the existing unsafe old age home can be demolished for it,” Tukaram Kunkolkar, a local activist who wrote to the department, said. Heritage activists and others agree with him. “When there’s a building of no historical value just lying waste, why should 32 beautiful old trees be sacrificed mindlessly,” Goa Heritage Action Group chairperson Heta Pandit said. Pandit said local groups have worked hard in getting the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church ruins declared as a protected monument. “It is a crime to destroy our heritage, history and nature,” she said. Despite repeated attempts by TOI, Provedoria officials were unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/provedoria-plans-to-axe-32-trees-at-chimbel-historic-site/articleshow/86541494.cms||Paul Fernandes

Hundreds of fields were marooned by the incessant rainfall in Deesa and surrounding villages with farmers complaining of heavy losses to the standing crop.  While Saurashtra and central Gujarat have been witnessing wet spells, north Gujarat is still bereft of adequate rain. One person, identified as Ramesh Thakore, died in Baiwada village near Deesa, after his leg slipped and fell into a lake. Chief officer of Deesa municipality said that while traders have claimed humongous losses, the exact damage to the property will be known only after a detailed survey  Deesa was lashed by five inches of rainfall within three hours on Sunday morning, leaving most of the town heavily waterlogged. Rain waters gushed into shops of commercial complexes and huge quantities of goods, including grains, were damaged.  In Deesa town, areas like Sindhi Colony, Sant Anna High School, Lalchali areas among others were in knee-deep waters, throwing normal life totally out of gear.  According to some estimates, nearly 300 fields in the region, mostly growing groundnut, were marooned in the rain. The water level in the fields was nearly three to four foot, farmers said. “We have suffered heavy losses as our field has been flooded completely,” said Pawan Solanki, a farmer in Kansari village near Deesa.  "The water has washed away our groundnut, jowar and other crops which were ready for harvest," said farmer Kumbhaji Thakor. Dantiwada also recorded nearly six inches of rainfall in just two hours, paralysing normal life in the town and nearby villages. Banaskantha still has a rain deficit of 24% while Patan, Mehsana and Sabarkantha have a shortage of 15%, 30% and 27% respectively.  In Gajera village of Aravalli district, a cow died after being struck by lightning. Other north Gujarat districts of Patan, Mehsana and Sabarkantha also reeled under a wet spell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/north-guj-pounded-deesa-gets-150mm-rain-in-3-hours/articleshow/86537401.cms||---

The rate of vaccination has been poor in these regions with Latin America and Caribbean recording a meagre 28% vaccination till the current month. The most affected in Africa, South Africa, has been able to vaccinate only 26% of its population and India’s pledge was seen as significant, said official sources. The Quad leaders, in a joint statement, agreed to donate more than 1.2 million doses of Covid vaccine globally and welcomed India’s move to resume export of vaccines. Modi drew a good attendance when he addressed the UN general assembly and officials accompanying him said the hall was filled, specially with delegates from African and South American nations. After the PM concluded his UNGA address, several African delegates and foreign ministers came up to him backstage and appreciated his speech. He also utilised his visit to showcase India’s soft power as he gave unique gifts to foreign dignitaries. Sources said PM Modi’s gift to President Joe Biden was a painted lord Buddha in Kadam wood (white wood). Kadam wood is a popular choice for handicrafts. The figure of Lord Buddha was crafted in Rajasthan and depicts him seated in a meditative posture showing blessings with his right hand. On return, Modi was greeted by BJP chief JP Nadda while hundreds of people had reached the airport as well.

It was a leader in the state for constructing flyover bridges (FOB) aimed to free congestion on the main roads. However, the flying over was sadly reduced to a frightening bumpy experience, thanks to its craters that only grow bolder with neglect and disrepair. Spot visits by TOI revealed that while the civic body repaired some potholes, but the cosmetic work wore off in one shower within hours. And in spite of this being an annual festival, a permanent solution seems to be a distant dream. “We carry out regular repair work once we receive complaints of potholes. But due to rain and other reasons the road got damaged again,” a senior SMC official told TOI. The damage at a few spots were so severe that potholes have even laid bare the skeleton of the bridge exposing the iron bars used for constructing the concrete layer. Officials, however, fiercely argue that the iron bars exposed due to the pothole does not translate as the structure being damaged, but that the ‘wound’ can be repaired by covering up the crater. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) uses cement or cold tar mixture to repair the potholes on flyover bridges, however, the efforts are increasingly proving to be insufficient. “Multiple flyovers in the city are in bad shape and we had raised the issue in the recent past. After our complaint the road on FOBs was repaired but it got damaged again due to poor quality of work,” said Dharmesh Bhanderi, leader of opposition in SMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pothole-riddled-surat-flyovers-leave-commuters-hurt-embittered/articleshow/86537441.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Builders and ryots hit as workers drawn to rallies in Huzarabad||HYDERABAD: The prolonged campaign blitzkrieg for the yet-to-be announced Huzurabad bypoll has had unintended collateral damage — farmers and builders. The political heat has singed these two as their labourers have trooped out of paddy fields and construction sites to march for any party with a better offer in cash or kind. The desertion has left farmers from surrounding areas worried about finishing sowing on time. Same is the case with builders, as work has stalled and deadlines have gone out of the window. The high-stakes battle in Huzarabad has led to parties pressing for huge crowds even for minor programmes in distant locations. Even in places with less than 1,000 people, fierce inter/intra-party competition has resulted in local workers assembling crowds bigger than area’s total population. There is pressure on rank and file to prove their influence with local public in front of state-level party representatives camping in Huzurabad. “It is not just about election, but also linked to competition among local leaders to outscore others in their own party,” a local TRS leader said To accomplish this, party workers this time threw the net beyond the local youth and the fresh catch brought in farm hands and construction workers. The going rate is usually at least Rs 500 each day, travel expenses and booze for these seasonal political workers. While the parties aren’t complaining, farmers, who don’t have the deep pockets to match, have been left fuming. “We need at least 15 people per acre per day. But we are getting about half of them as parties are offering them better wages. We raised the wages to Rs 350 per day instead of Rs 250, but we are still not getting our labourers back,” rued KV Rajanna, a farmer. Builders are in the same ditch too. Their lofty plans have been grounded as construction work in the town and neighbouring areas has drastically slowed down due to manpower shortage. “Work has been hit badly for past month. Some people have been even forced to postpone house-warming ceremonies due to pending work,” said Ch Avinash Reddy, a builder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/builders-and-ryots-hit-as-workers-drawn-to-rallies/articleshow/86541479.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The NGT committee had visited Narlapur, Yedula, Vattem, Karivena and Uddandapur on September 15 and 16. It had a meeting at KRMB office and deliberated on the issue on September 20. Meanwhile, J Shyamala Rao, secretary, water resource department, in an affidavit, said, “Construction of PRLIS is illegal and unauthorised. There is no allocation to PRLIS and undertaking it without any allocations is not permissible. The water availability for PRLIS is beyond the scope of allocations made by Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-I & II and also beyond the scope of provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.” “Telangana is proposing to draw flood water from +800 feet level from Srisailam reservoir. The question of drawing flood water at +800 feet level does not arise and water available at that level in Srisailam reservoir is dependable water,” he added. KWDT-II had distributed water of inter-state river Krishna up to an average flows 2,578 TMC, the theoretical upper limit for utilisable flows. “The ongoing projects, mentioned in para 10 of the Eleventh Schedule, have to get water to an extent of 172.5 TMC (deducting 25 TMC allocated to Telugu Ganga by KWDT-II and 30 TMC under SLBC) and if any water is available over and above that, if Telangana is given any right to utilize remaining water over and above 2750.5 TMC,” the AP government said. Shyamala Rao further said: “Water Commission gauge data at various reservoir sites in executing PRLIS need to be established after the demands of projects for which KWDT-I & II made allocations and also for on-going projects under para 10 of the Eleventh Schedule of the AP Re-organization Act, 2014, are met. The source of water cannot be shown as flood flows from Srisailam reservoir as a simplifier without considering mandatory compliances to be obtained, the same is illegal and unjust.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/prlis-has-drinking-water-component-panel/articleshow/86541715.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

He was 75 and a six-time corporator, one of Mumbai’s longest serving, with a straight run of victories in civic elections since 1992. He contested his first BMC election in 1985 but lost. He stood again in 1992 and won, after which there was no looking back for the popular “people’s man”. Barot was the seniormost corporator in the 2017 civic house. He won with over 10,000 votes from Malad ward number 45. In 2014, Barot also contested for a legislative assembly seat from Malad constituency but could not win it. He lost the election by around 2,000 votes. BJP corporator and group leader Vinod Mishra, who is also from Malad, said Barot passed away owing to his deteriorating health. “He was admitted to the hospital some days ago and was in a critical condition. He has been chairman of various statutory civic committees in the past,” said Mishra. MLA Yogesh Sagar of the BJP said that Barot was an extremely honest worker for the people. “We worked in the BMC as well together from the year 2000 onwards when I was elected in the civic by election. Barot was a very positive person and would win from any seat in the constituency he contested from,” said Sagar. Nominated BJP corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat said Barot lost his wife earlier this year. “He was unwell for the past one year. He has been instrumental in the reconstruction of the Malad east-west subway during the 1990’s,” said Shirsat. After winning the 2017 BMC election Barot had said: “The BJP is already in power at the Centre and state and now with our party having won such a large number of seats in the civic body as well, I am sure that we would be able to get development works for the city much faster.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-house-loses-six-time-veteran-ram-barot-of-bjp/articleshow/86542269.cms||Richa Pinto

The body is believed to be that of an Army jawan who went missing during an earlier expedition to Satopanth peak, the second highest peak in the Gangotri National Park. It was found, dressed in the remnants of a military uniform, by an Army mountaineering team last week. Army officials are suspecting that the body is that of Anish Tyagi, who had gone missing during the 2005 expedition. Mishra said that Tyagi’s elder brother had been contacted by them and his DNA sample would be taken shortly to ascertain if it matches that of the body’s. “After post-mortem and DNA sample test, the body is likely to be handed over to the family if the samples match,” Mishra said. As reported by TOI, Tyagi had gone missing in 2005 after he stumbled and fell down when the team was returning from the expedition to the Satopanth peak. A search operation was launched but the jawan could not be found. The search was eventually called off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/body-of-mountaineer-recovered-by-army-team-has-hardly-any-flesh-left-it-is-mostly-bone-says-police/articleshow/86537490.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Mumbai||Odisha youth creates fake Facebook profile of judge, arrested||MUMBAI: Health minister Rajesh Tope said a meeting has been called on Monday to discuss in detail the issue of why the exams for the recruitment of 6,205 personnel in the C and D categories for the health department had to be called off at the last minute as well as to take a decision on the next date for conducting the exam. The exam was part of a process to clear all non-clinical vacancies, touted as one of the biggest recruitment drives in the health department in 25 years. Tope said the exam will most likely be conducted on October 16 and 17 or October 22 and 23 depending on the availability of schools for conducting the exams. Almost 8.65 lakh applicants were slated to appear for the exams. “It will be ensured that students get their exam tickets at least 8-10 days in advance,” said the health minister. The IT company Nyasa Communication Pvt Ltd was selected from a panel of five appointed by the general administration department, said Tope. The company will be called for an explanation. “It has been directed to hold a press conference and explain to the people of Maharashtra and the students the reasons for the exam having to be called off,” said Tope. While it is understood that there were many problems with hall tickets, Tope said that the mandate of the public health department was only to prepare the question paper. “All the other infrastructure, from selection of schools, issuing of hall tickets, appointment of invigilators, ensuring Covid norms are followed to placing of jammers so no one can use electronic devices, was to be done by the IT company,” he said, adding that a lot of due diligence was done by ACS Pradeep Vyas in the selection of the IT company from the panel. One of the reasons for the postponement of the exams was the delay in securing schools for conducting the exams too, said Tope. The decision to postpone the exams was taken after approval from the CM and the Dy CM, said Tope. He said now deputy health officers in various districts will visit every school to ensure all requirements are met so that there are no glitches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/odisha-youth-creates-fake-fb-profile-of-judge-arrested-in-mumbai/articleshow/86542272.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||IPB declares 10k sqm land in Cudnem as investment area||Panaji: Five months after the Goa investment promotion and facilitation board (IPB) granted in-principle approval to Team24 Food & Beverages to set up a food and dairy processing unit at Cudnem, it has declared 10,000 sqm of land at Cudnem as an investment promotion area. With the area being thus declared, the powers of the local village panchayat and local planning rules will cease to apply, particularly collection of house tax and other taxes, said industries under-secretary Maya Pednekar. Instead, Goa IPB CEO Swetika Sachan will be the assessment authority for collection of all fees. The company had approached the IPB in December with a proposal to invest in a dairy processing unit, a pulp juice manufacturing plant, and industries for tea premixes and freeze-dried fruits and vegetables, in Cudnem, Bicholim. On April 12, the IPB granted in-principle approval for the investment project, and subsequently recommended to the government to demarcate and notify the area as an investment promotion zone. Officials said that to make up for the loss of revenue to the local governing body, the government will compensate the village panchayat for five years based on the previous financial year’s house tax collection and other taxes. The IPB’s planning, development and construction committee will authorise, control and approve building plans. The government has given locals one month period to submit their objections or concerns regarding the food processing project, which is coming up in Cudnem. The objections have to be submitted in writing with reasons to the director of industries, trade and commerce.

Tirumala Srivari Brahmotsavams will be celebrated on a grand note at the hill town from October 7 to 15. After cracks developed on the concrete rooftop at several places along the 7.6-km long Alipiri pedestrian route about two years ago, the previous TTD trust board under the chairmanship of YV Subba Reddy had resolved to get a new rooftop cover besides taking up various beautification works along the route. After TTD’s engineering department prepared an estimate of Rs 25 crore for the renovation works along the pedestrian route, Reliance Industries stepped in and offered to complete the entire works on a donation basis. The works were fast-tracked when the pandemic situation eased. TTD EO Dr KS Jawahar Reddy and additional EO AV Dharma Reddy, who have been closely monitoring the progress of the renovation works, have already announced that the pedestrian route will be reopened on October 1 after a final round of inspection, later this week. However, TTD said it will not revive the ‘Divya darshan’ token system under which all devotees trekking up will be issued free darshan tokens midway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/alipiri-trek-way-to-reopen-on-friday/articleshow/86537540.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Sources said that the workers were directed to clean the open drain with bare hands on Saturday, and were not provided the necessary safety equipment such as gloves and gumboots. Mandya zilla panchayat (ZP) Divya Prabhu said that she had sought a detailed report from the Belur panchayat development officer. “We have to ascertain if the civic workers were forced to clean the sewage without safety equipment, or if they failed to use them. Strict legal action will be initiated against the officials if they are found to have forced the workers to clean the drain,” Divya said. The villagers alleged that PDO Suresh was not humane towards civic workers. They denied reports of civic workers being provided the safety equipment. President of the Karnataka Pourakarmikara Sangha MB Naganna told TOI, “Courts have taken cognisance of repeated instances of civil workers being treated in an inhuman manner. But the civic authorities appear to have little concern about the safety of civic workers. We cannot accept the explanation of the authorities that these incidents occur inadvertently. Such incidents only go on to show the arrogant attitude of the officers. We will file a complaint of our own against the erring officers of the Belur GP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/report-sought-from-gp-officials-on-civic-workers-cleaning-drain-with-bare-hands/articleshow/86537363.cms||---

Thakre has alleged all civic chiefs had given him misleading information and did not share complete information sought by him in related to taxes being recovered by municipal corporations. The legislator submitted the letter to officiating speaker Narhari Zirwal a couple of days ago in Mumbai. Thakre said that in June he had sought detailed information from 27 municipal corporations related to provisions for recovery of advertisement tax and various types of taxes since implementation of grant of goods and services tax (GST). “I was given misleading information,” he said in the letter. The president of City Congress Committee said that despite sending letters to all again, he did not get information. “Also, all civic chiefs have cheated people by recovering various types of taxes illegally. “Therefore, breach of privilege action should be taken against all. Also, disciplinary action should be initiated against all,” he said in the letter. He had also submitted a complaint with secretary of state legislature on August 31 and demanded action. As per notification dated July 27, 2015, and August 20, it is mandatory for all officials to give detailed and proper information to legislators. Any failure to do so makes them liable for disciplinary action. In a press conference on September 18, Thakre had said the civic bodies are getting GST grant from central and state governments from July 1, 2017. “Therefore, it is mandatory to stop recovering advertisement tax, property tax, water tax and other types of taxes. But municipal corporations have continued to recover taxes from people,” he said. Considering his letter, Ahmednagar municipal corporation has stopped recovering advertisement tax from August 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thakre-submits-breach-of-privilege-seeks-disciplinary-action-against-27-civic-chiefs/articleshow/86539623.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

And of these, 8,853 secretariats have already achieved at least 90% coverage of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It points to the fact that nearly 60% of the total secretariats in the state have administered at least one dose to more than 90% of the people living in their precincts. About 70% urban (ward) secretariats have achieved such a feat. Overall, the first dose coverage has crossed 75%-mark in Andhra Pradesh, while the second dose coverage currently stands at about 36%. Andhra Pradesh rolled out the Covid-19 vaccination for the 18-44 age group about a month ago after the coverage in the then existing priority groups such as healthcare workers, frontline staff, people age 45 and above, young mothers and foreign travellers touched the 90% mark. The cumulative first dose vaccine coverage among the healthcare workers and frontline staff already crossed the 99% mark, while it is 100% in people aged 45+ in Andhra Pradesh. In fact, of the targeted 1.33 crore people in this age bracket, the first dose was given to 1.38 crore people, exceeding the 100% target. Despite the deferred launch of the inoculations, the first dose vaccine coverage among the 18-44 age group has also surpassed the halfway (54%) mark. The state health department has identified nearly 1.94 crore eligible beneficiaries in the 18-44 age bracket. Nearly 1.03 crore people have received at least one dose, while 23 lakh people have been fully immunised against the pandemic. Andhra Pradesh has so far administered 3.9 crore vaccine doses, including the 1.27 crore second dose recipients. The Union government allocated 1.05 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to state for September, the highest ever one-month allocation ever since the launch of the mass inoculation drive in January. According to the state health officials, Andhra Pradesh is one of the few states/Union Territories to administer more vaccine doses to the women. Of the 3.9 crore vaccine doses given in state, women received 2.1 crore doses. The vaccine enthusiasm increased in AP from May with the unprecedented spurt in the daily Covid-19 cases during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/1st-dose-vax-coverage-over-90-in-9k-sectts/articleshow/86537569.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The Centre has recently informed the Supreme Court that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) fixed an ex gratia of Rs 50,000 to be paid by the states from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). In a letter to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday, AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said it was the duty of the state government to extend financial assistance to men, women, and children orphaned by Covid-19. “You may be aware that based on the Supreme Court’s intervention, the Government of India has declared Rs 50,000 compensation. Congress feels that the compensation amount is less and has demanded Rs 5 lakh to family members of every person who died due to Covid-19,” he stated. The Congress leader alleged that the actual number of Covid-19 deaths were not shown by the government and demanded that the CM constitute an apex committee to comprehensively conduct audit of Covid-19 deaths, including those in private and government hospitals and arrive at the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-demands-audit-of-covid-deaths-in-t/articleshow/86539704.cms||---

Rather, it was based on inputs received by the government,” Dhami said. The statement came soon after opposition Congress accused the BJP government of misusing the official machinery to further its agenda before next year’s polls. As reported by TOI on Friday, the Uttarakhand government, in an official communication, had stated that it had come to its notice that “rapid population growth in some areas of the state had led to a demographic shift, whose ill-effects had started showing in the form of migration of people of certain communities”. The release added, “Expressing concern over the situation, the government has directed the DGP, all district magistrates and SSPs to take precautionary steps to address the problem.” Besides, the state government also ordered the police and administrative officers from all the districts to set up peace committees and keep a check on illegal land purchase deals. On Saturday, when TOI had queried additional chief secretary (home) Anand Bardhan about specifics of the alert, he had refrained from commenting on the areas that are under the radar and if any communal violence had been reported which had led to the alert. “We had received some factual inputs, following which the directions have been issued to district authorities and police. We do have information about some areas and are doing a fact-check,” the official told TOI. In a similar vein, government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said, “The move has been initiated by the home department on the basis of some inputs. It is important to ensure that social harmony is not disturbed and illegal activities are kept in check.” Meanwhile, soon after the alert was issued, opposition Congress accused the ruling party of misusing official machinery to further its agenda before the 2022 polls. “If there are specific inputs with the government, it should tell people about these areas and also about how many cases of communal clashes have been reported there,” former CM Harish Rawat said. “If these steps aim at targeting only a particular area or a particular community or are being taken for political mileage by using the administration, then the issue needs serious consideration,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/communal-tension-directive-not-against-any-particular-community-ukhand-cm/articleshow/86537649.cms||---
---||Goa||Jolt to Congress as former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro set to quit today, may join TMC||PANAJI: In a major setback to Congress ahead of the assembly election likely to be held in early 2022, two-time Goa chief minister and sitting MLA from Navelim Luizinho Faleiro is likely to resign from the party and also from the legislature on Monday to join Trinamool Congress (TMC). Faleiro, who was a close aide of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and claimed to be a “loyal soldier” of the party, is likely to tender his resignation to Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar on Monday afternoon. Sources said Faleiro has been offered a Rajya Sabha seat by TMC and the party wants to use his long stint in the north-eastern region as the AICC in-charge to help strengthen its base. Faleiro neither denied nor confirmed the development. “I am in deep meditation. I am reading everyone. One thing I’ll tell you is that people of Goa are suffering. Somebody has to stand up. I will give you my comments at the appropriate time,” he said. With this development, Congress which had won 17 seats under his presidentship in 2017 assembly polls, will find its numbers further reduced to four in the 40-member House. Sources said some of Faleiro's close aides may also resign from Congress to join TMC along with him. His close aides have said that he was sidelined by the party leadership in the state. He was a strong contender for the state party presidentship, before incumbent Girish Chodankar was retained as the state president earlier this month. To placate him, Congress had made him chief of its election coordination committee for Goa. Faleiro’s move comes at a time when Congress has been trying hard to revive its base in the state under the mentorship of P Chidambaram. “Faleiro quitting Congress may not be of much consequence. He was facing a huge anti-incumbency in Navelim. But it certainly creates a psychological disadvantage to Congress as its skeletal presence in the House would be further depleted with all flesh removed,” political observer Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said. Sources said the profile of Navelim constituency, from where he had won several times in the past, had changed with AAP making strong inroads in the once Congress bastion. Some independents were also to contest from the constituency. In this backdrop, political observers said it would not have been a very smooth sailing for Faleiro in the 2022 polls. “It will embolden BJP, which faces an all-time high anger of people over bad administration and Covid mismanagement,” Coutinho said. Senior functionaries of TMC, including its parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O’ Brien and Lok Sabha MP Prasun Banerjee, are already in Goa. TMC had contested 20 seats in the 2012 assembly election under the leadership of former chief minister Wilfred de Souza and secured less than 2% of the total vote share. Churchill Alemao had also unsuccessfully contested the South Goa parliamentary elections on a TMC ticket in 2014. Faleiro was first elected on a Congress ticket in 1980 from Navelim and since then he has continuously won the seat till he was defeated in 2007 by Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao. Faleiro did not contest the 2012 assembly election. In 2017, Congress fought the assembly polls under his leadership and won 17 seats to become the single largest party in Goa assembly, but failed to form the government. In 1999, with Faleiro as the party president, Congress secured 21 seats, which was the first time any political party had achieved the feat in Goan politics. After Faleiro had lost the assembly election in 2007, he was made AICC general secretary for northeast states and under his guidance, the party had won elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jolt-to-cong-as-ex-cm-luizinho-set-to-quit-today-may-join-tmc/articleshow/86541730.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Coimbatore||Young inventor makes loud statement with Bluetooth speaker||Coimbatore: A college student has developed a cost-effective solar Bluetooth speaker with playtime of five hours on a single charge.Inventor M Bharat Kumar, an Electronics student of PSG College of Arts & Science, has registered the Rs 2,200 speaker under Udyam, a scheme of the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises.The 15 x 5cm speaker can be connected through mobile phone or laptop to stream audio. It is small and light enough to carry around. It has a 6.5V detachable solar panel connected to a 20,000 mAh battery that can also be charged using main supply. Bharat has used a coil-induced speaker that gives better performance with less power consumption. While he designed the amplifier board on his own, he used power components instead of surface mounted devices in the amplifier system for lasting performance.“The speaker is serviceable unlike local speakers in the market that have to be scrapped if there is a malfunction. There are big brands selling portable speakers, but their cost is high, so is servicing those speakers,” said Bharath. “The speaker can be put to rough use and it would not break easily even if handled by children. The components are easily available in the market in case any of the components wear out.”C Nagaraj, 20, who bought the speaker, came to know about it through a mutual friend. “The performance is much better compared to the products available in the market for the same cost. The wooden case appears durable,” he said.Bharat had earlier developed a cost-effective sanitiser machine and a Wi-Fi signal booster, which received good response from buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/young-inventor-makes-loud-statement-with-bluetooth-speaker/articleshow/86539708.cms||Sampath Kumar

Local residents and passers-by were left reeling under fear as the transgender gangs came to blows. Sadar police had to deploy force to bring the situation under control and also arrested 15 transgenders for their involvement. Police have also booked them for violation of Covid norms. Around a fortnight ago, a transgender group had ransacked a house near Wanadongri following a dispute over alms. The armed gang had also assaulted an elderly citizen during the ruckus. The city has witnessed a spurt in transgender groups at traffic signals and other places seeking alms. These groups are also into extortion, demanding hefty donations which may go into lakhs of rupees from families where there are newborns. In the latest case, a group of transgenders had allegedly accepted some donations from a family residing at Gondwana Chowk. While the family offered the donations to one group, a rival group too turned up, leading to a confrontation between the two groups of transgenders over accepting the alms. Sources said the group from Motibagh turned aggressive against the other group, claiming the place fell in their area of collection. Heated arguments and angry confrontation continued for long before the cops had to intervene. An insider said five groups of transgenders are active in city. The groups based at Hansapuri and Hansapuri Khadaan belong to traditional ‘Berawala’ who follow more orthodox protocols. There are splinter groups from Hasanbagh, Tajbagh, Mankapur, Mariyam Nagar and Majri near Kamptee Toll Naka, who too have sprung up in last couple of years. The criminal elements among the transgenders have made these gangs notorious. The murder of Chamcham Gajbhiye by Uttam Baba Senapati in the past was the first brutal gang war outcome among these groups. There have been frequent clashes between groups at Motibagh and Jaripatka. Sources said some of these groups are also known to take ‘supari’ to get premises vacated or recover dues. “Most of these transgenders are not originally so, but are either imposters dressed in feminine style or males who have undergone surgeries,” said an insider. Senior inspector Vinod Choudhury of Sadar police station said it was the group from Motibagh that triggered the fight. “Police have taken stringent action against 15 persons for rioting and other violations, including regarding Covid norms, as per the guidance of senior officers who were monitoring the situation,” said Choudhury. Zonal DCP Vinita S said police would also welcome complaints from the concerned family at Gondwana Chowk if they have any objections to raise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/transgender-groups-clash-over-donations-15-arrested/articleshow/86539749.cms||Soumitra Bose

It will avoid big trucks bringing cargo inside the city. Instead, railway and airport can be utilised for hassle-free transportation of cargo.The Centre wants the state government to identify land for the project to develop the facility. It was announced for Chennai and Coimbatore. About 158 acres of land was identified for development, out of which 122 acres is with the Chennai Port Trust. Rest of the 36 acres is under acquisition by the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO). In Coimbatore, a detailed project report and feasibility study is in progress and land is yet to be identified.Industrial bodies suggested Irugur, Vellalore and Chettipalayam as they will be connected to the eastern bypass. NHAI is proposing a road from Narasimhanaickenpalayam on Mettupalayam Road – Saravanampatti on Sathy Road, Neelamnur on Avinashi Road, Karanampettai on Trichy Road and Madukkai before touching Chetttipalayam.If MMLP comes up at any of these locations, trucks can take the bypass and reach the facility and subsequently the cargo can also be distributed to different parts of the city.Coordinator of Coimbatore Development Council J Sathish said that MMLP will improve the country’s freight logistics sector by lowering overall freight costs and time, cutting warehousing costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, improving the tracking and traceability of consignments through infrastructural, procedural, and information technology intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/industry-bodies-suggest-irugur-vellalore-or-chettipalayam-to-set-up-logistic-parks/articleshow/86539720.cms||---

Deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Gajanan Prabhudesai said that the woman had gone to the doctor for a medical checkup as she had some pain in her hip. He said that the doctor took the survivor inside his clinic “without a lady attendant”, and asked her to lie down to conduct the checkup. After she did so, the woman alleged that the doctor removed her pants and when the doctor was about to reach her private parts, she pushed his hand away. Later, the doctor asked the woman to lie on her stomach, the DySP said, adding that the woman then “escaped” from the clinic and went into her car and started crying, and narrated the incident to her partner. Prabhudesai said that the partner went to the clinic and slapped the doctor, and subsequently, the woman approached Mapusa police station to lodge a complaint. An FIR was then filed against the doctor. Prabhudesai said that the doctor has filed for anticipatory bail before a court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/woman-claims-surgeon-molested-her-fir-filed/articleshow/86541762.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Two special teams formed to arrest illegal immigrants in Tirupur, Erode||COIMBATORE: Inspector general of police of west zone R Sudhakar has formed two special teams to nab Bangladeshi nationals who are staying illegally in Tirupur and Erode districts. Most of the Bangladeshi nationals have obtained Aadhaar cards to work for garment industries in these two districts, Sudhakar said. “So, their employers can’t find their real identity. We are trying to identify the people who generated Aadhaar cards for them. Special police teams are working to trace more illegal immigrants.” While the Tirupur rural police registered three cases and arrested 20 such people till September 24 this year, the Erode rural police arrested 11 people. The Tirupur rural police arrested seven Bangladeshi nationals including two minor boys on September 20 for illegal stay. The Perumanallur police arrested L Mohamadul Hassan, 21, M Abul Khair, 25, H Badsha, 20, A Ariful Islam, 23, Ali Hosen Malik, 28, S Alamin, 18 and a minor boy. They were booked under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and lodged in the Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai. Bangladeshi nationals enter India through West Bengal, the officer said. “From there, they travel to Tirupur to work for garment units that offer them good salary unlike garment industries in their country. We are trying to identify the agents who bring them to Tirupur. We can nab all illegal immigrants with the help of agents.” “Some of the Bangladeshi nationals have Aadhaar cards with West Bengal address, which makes it difficult to find their real identity. However, special teams arrested 31 Bangladeshis from Tirupur and Erode district in the last three months,” Sudhakar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-special-teams-formed-to-arrest-illegal-immigrants/articleshow/86539703.cms||A Subburaj

The virtual training to be conducted by qualified professionals is aimed at helping rural students learn and master computer science besides increasing the penetration of Tamil language on online platforms. The initiative is the brainchild of S Sivakumar, retired principal, district institute of education and training (DIET) Kanchipuram, and serving faculty members of the school education department. Assisted by their network, the team entered into an agreement with Tamil Unlimited, a Pennsylvania-based Tamil web education provider in the US to teach various aspects of computer science starting from lessons for beginners to advanced level for five years. Classes will be conducted virtually on Sundays for around 100 children of classes VI to X and government school teachers from different parts of the state including Trichy, Erode, Karur and Tenkasi. Only interested students with the necessary facilities were handpicked for the online sessions. “The objective is to induce curiosity among rural students to master technologies and digital platforms. The students will be encouraged to innovate on Tamil-based digital platforms to augment the online presence of their mother tongue,” Suganthi Nadar, founder, Tamil Unlimited, told TOI. Basic skills such as creating Google forms, using various open source software and a basic understanding of computer hardware will be taught in the first 16 weeks. “Peer group learning will take place after a time, students and teachers will share their knowledge and queries for independent learning of the technologies,” S Sivakumar said. So far, 40 students and 10 teachers have been enrolled in Tamil medium learning. K Maruthanayagam, block education officer, Manikandam said several NRIs have come forward to support the drive and help rural students address their learning needs. Encouraging rural government school students to become tech-savvy on par with their private school counterparts is the core objective of the programme, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/education-officials-tamil-diaspora-join-hands-to-make-rural-students-tech-savvy/articleshow/86539753.cms||Deepak Karthik

The organisers said that it was for the first time that transgender persons were made part of the panel in Mumbai. Law professors and students were roped in too. Among the cases that saw closure was a 53-year-old property dispute from Buldhana. In a domestic dispute, which was five years old, a woman appeared physically and her octogenarian parents-in-law appeared via video conferencing in a hybrid hearing in Mumbai. In Yavatmal, an estranged couple were reunited in a 14-year-long dispute. In the city, over 1.5 lakh cases involving settlements totalling over Rs 335 crore saw closure, said Hitendra Wani, secretary, Mumbai District Legal Services Authority. “To change society’s attitude towards transgenders, for the first time in Lok Adalat history, three transgenders, Salma Khan, Priya Patil and Anita Wadikar, were made panel members at the session held at the city civil and sessions court,” he said. An award or a decision in a Lok Adalat has sanctity under the Legal Services Authorities Act,1987 as a deemed decree of a civil court, with a binding effect on all parties. Parties cannot appeal against Lok Adalat decisions before any court of law. The Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority (MSLSA) conducted the Lok Adalat, guided by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta as the patron-in-chief of MSLSA, and Justice Amjad Sayed, executive chairman of MSLSA, under the aegis of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). “The best take away of this Lok Adalat was disposal of over 4.8 lakh traffic e-challan cases. Rs 22.7 crore was realised by the state traffic police,” said Milind Todkar, deputy Secretary, MSLSA . All notices in such cases were sent virtually. “It would also help in regularizing the registration of already transferred vehicles,’’ said Dinesh Surana, member secretary, MSLSA. To ensure comprehensive outcome in Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), matrimonial, cheque bounce and other civil cases, Justice Sayed had stressed on holding pre-Lok Adalat sittings. Such hearings enabled warring parties to enter into dialogue for settlement, thus saving time. Since the Lok-Adalat was held amid Covid, digital platforms were used to prevent overcrowding. Online service facilitator SAMA was used in a few districts to help settle pending and pre-litigation disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lok-adalat-settles-8-5l-cases-in-one-day-transgenders-on-panel/articleshow/86542294.cms||Swati Deshpande

AIIMS can start heart, lungs, liver, kidney, and eye transplant under one roof,” said Gadkari, who addressed the 3rd foundation day of AIIMS Nagpur from his chartered flight. Highlighting that the recently built AIIMS across the country will correct the long standing regional imbalance, Gadkari said that doubling the number of present AIIMS is the next target. “We all know that even after so many decades of independence, only six AIIMS were built in the country. Since 2014, this number has increased to 22. We need at least 50 institutes of AIIMS standard to deal with our health care needs,” Gadkari said. Union minister of state for health Dr Bharati Pawar and Nagpur guardian minister Dr Nitin Raut also participated in the function virtually. Rajya Sabha MP Dr Vikas Mahatme, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, President, AIIMS Nagpur Dr PK Dave, Director and CEO, AIIMS Nagpur Maj Gen Dr Vibha Dutta, and other senior doctors and administrators were also present in the event. Dr Bharati Pawar, who is also a medical doctor, advised students about empathy and emotional care for patients. “Treatment with empathy is the main responsibility of healthcare providers and each member of the care team. Patients spend a significant portion of their time interacting with nurses, medical assistants and receptionists. These interactions can provide many opportunities to demonstrate compassion and empathy towards patients. Therefore, training, encouraging staff to ensure patient care with empathy will significantly impact the overall patient experience,” she said.

The auction has been postponed in the wake of two stay orders last week by the high court on 11 acres and 18 acres in survey number 301 in Puppalaguda. The dispute is over land notified by Centre for refugees from Pakistan during the Partition. The state has claimed ownership and refused to accept documents furnished by petitioners who have taken the government to court. The state has now approached the Supreme Court against the high court stay. The government had planned to cash in on the real estate boom in Hyderabad’s IT corridor and raise around Rs 5,000 crore in this second round of e-auction. The previous e-auction of Kokapet and Khanamet land parcels in July had fetched Rs 2,700 crore. But the Kokapet land too has been under scrutiny of high court since the auction for alleged violation of green norms under GO 111. Expressing regret over the postponement, industries and commerce department principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said: “The government’s intention has always been to auction land after ensuring clear titles. Some unscrupulous elements have filed frivolous cases regarding land identified for auction, even though the title matter has been well-settled by Supreme Court in government’s favour. In order to provide complete assurance to prospective buyers, the government will ensure speedy disposal of all pending cases before the process of auction is resumed.” The latest auction plan was for 9 plots measuring 22.7 acres at Khanamet village of Serilingampally mandal and 26 plots spread over 94.5 acres in Puppalaguda village in Gandipet mandal of Rangareddy district. These land parcels are located close to the Outer Ring Road (ORR) in the heart of West Hyderabad and surrounded by commercial hubs, recreational zones and transportation facilities. The land was being auctioned by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-postpones-puppalaguda-auction-as-hc-stay-hits-plan/articleshow/86539738.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC slams state, says cannot withhold retirement benefits||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has rapped the state government for withholding retirement benefits of its three employees on the ground that they were paid excess salaries for over five years due to erroneous fixation of their pay scales. The court batted for regular audits to ensure there is no drainage of taxpayers’ money. “In this era of scientific and technological advancement, it is unfortunate that detection of excess payment is made to wait till an employee retires,” ruled Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Makarand Karnik on September 24. They upheld Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal’s (MAT) December 2018 common order to release the retirement benefits of Rekha Dubey, Sitaram Pote and Shashikant Chinchkar who held class III/group C posts and retired on different dates. MAT held they were rightly fitted in the appropriate pay scale commensurate with their status and there was no excess payment. The HC judges could not ignore the factual position that the order of recovery of excess payment for over five years was passed only after retirement. They said “fortunately for the trio”, the state did not allege misrepresentation or fraud by them to receive excess payment. “..hence the recovery process must be held to be correctly interdicted by the tribunal,” said the bench, dismissing the state’s three appeals saying there is no merit in them. The state is directed to implement MAT’s order within 3 months. If it does not, the three retired employees can move MAT. While parting with the judgment, the judges observed that it is high time the state equips its system so that excess pay is detected at the earliest instead of being detected when the pension papers are settled and attempts made to protect taxpayers’ money. The retired employee is subjected to untold hardship, they added. They said the system ought to be revamped in a way that audits are conducted at regular intervals to prevent drainage of taxpayers money and “to send a message to incompetent officers/employees that any remissness would not be tolerated.” Also, the state must explore disciplinary proceedings against erring employees to replenish the loss due to excess payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-slams-state-says-cannot-withhold-retirement-benefits/articleshow/86542299.cms||Rosy Sequeira

He will assume the office after his retirement on September 30. Dr Das has been asked to work from AP Bhavan in New Delhi with cabinet rank. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has plans to utilise Dr Das’ experience, particularly in getting clearances for the irrigation projects, post his retirement. Though the CM wanted another three months extension for Dr Das as chief secretary, he decided to depute him to New Delhi to closely monitor the issues related to the irrigation projects. His appointment is significant particularly in the wake of Telangana government raking up controversies over the irrigation projects and water sharing from Krishna river. Dr Das had worked in the rank of secretary and principal secretary in water resources department in undivided AP. He was made special chief secretary in water resources department soon after Jagan took over the reins of the state in 2019. He held the position till his elevation as chief secretary, nine months ago.  Interestingly, predecessor of Dr Das, Nilam Sawheny was also made state government advisor soon after her retirement in December last. Sawheny was appointed State Election Commissioner in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/das-appointed-principal-advisor-post-retirement/articleshow/86537696.cms||Samdani MN

---||Goa||No more susegad: Tourists give Goa a makeover||PANAJI: A decade ago a visitor coming to Panaji in the evening could not but notice its tranquillity. With offices empty of its staff, Panaji looked as if it was meditating at the end of the day facing its life-long companion Mandovi as the waves touched the shore gently like soft background music. As offshore casinos cemented their rights on the city’s waters aided by state politicians who were in a hurry to make Goa the Las Vegas of India, what one hears today is only the noise of boat propellers rotating, and blaring music playing on river cruises. Today, casinos occupying the city limits of the river are the first claimants of visitors’ attention. Large shining casino billboards beckon every tourist to come gamble. While the state capital lost its majesty amid the hullabaloo of casinos, so also Goa tourism its conventional profile — land of sea, sand, and sun. Now, it is also known as the land of casinos. “Goa is the only state in the country that has offshore casinos. So, whoever is fond of casinos and gambling comes to Goa,” said hotelier Ralph DeSouza. “All hotels in and around Panaji mostly rely on casinos. While Goa does have other attractions, they seem to have been lost or sidelined.” Chief executive officer at Jamboree Cruises Edward Noronha said that whatever queries he received prior to the government lifting Covid-19-related restrictions, were to know if casinos had opened. When the government allowed tourism activities in full swing in October-November of 2020 as the first wave of coronavirus receded, it was casinos that drew all the attention while river cruise operators could not even recover their cost of operations. “We don’t know how things will pan out but when we opened eight months after the first wave, we did not get enough business to cover staff salaries,” he said. “Majority of tourists, who visited Goa after the pandemic began, have high disposable income and can afford casinos. Tourists having average or below-average income, whom we call ‘janata crowd’ are yet to start visiting Goa in big numbers,” he said. It would not be wrong to say that casinos have been bigger beneficiaries of the changing profile of domestic tourists visiting Goa. If a few years ago the well to do young Indian tourist was pleased to enjoy Goa’s nightlife and spend a few leisurely evenings on a beach with a glass of wine or liquor in hand, his present-day definition of ideal Goa holiday is incomplete if he does not spend some time on an offshore casino, irrespective of whether he is a habitual gambler or not. Amey Parsekar of Rediscovery Cruises said that after the pandemic started, holidaying in foreign locales became impossible. The segment of Indians who holidayed abroad increasingly began coming to Goa wanting a premium experience, whether yachting or casinos. “Last November, we noticed that people who otherwise used to travel abroad for holidays landed up in Goa. The trend is likely to continue this year as well,” he said. Parsekar said that since 2010 the headcount of Indian travellers visiting Goa has significantly grown with a larger chunk of them in the 20 to 40-year age bracket, with high spending power. The data of the tourism department shows that annual domestic footfalls jumped from about 27 lakh in 2012 to over 80 lakh in 2019. “The previous generation would save the entire year for annual travel, but youth from cities of India travel to Goa two to three times a year,” Parsekar said. In the last few years, even during the monsoon, Goa sees increased footfalls on weekends and extended weekends with young men and women from metropolitan areas making a beeline to the state seeking freedom from their stressful life. Tourists and their vehicles jostling for space outside casino entrances that have eaten into the city’s promenades, and their four-wheelers parked all along the road from the Captain of Ports till a few meters beyond the historic Adil Shah Palace, is evidence enough that destination Goa has shifted gears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-more-susegad-tourists-give-goa-a-makeover/articleshow/86541828.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Goa||Land records, plans issued online without signature valid: Goa govt||PANAJI: Continuing to bring reforms related to property records through e-governance, the state revenue department has moved to issue record of rights (RoR) and property maps online, without human intervention. The revenue department, in a notification, said that copies or extracts of the computerised property record, map or plan issued online — without any signature — is valid. Also, the revenue department has delegated certain powers of the director of settlement and land records to deputy collectors and inspectors of surveys and land records. Deputy collectors and land record inspectors can now combine land parcels under adjoining survey numbers if they are owned by the same person. The RoR is the primary record that shows the land record and which captures the details of landholdings. Mutation means transfer or change of title in the records of the local municipal body for the property concerned. “The mutation certificate can be obtained online, thus reducing the need for citizens to make repeated visits to government departments to pursue their applications. We are slowly closing the loop,” said a government officer. The notification by the revenue department says that when a copy or extract of the computerised land record, map or plan is issued online, a computer-generated endorsement will be printed on the document with the date, time and an online reference number. “This record is valid without any signature,” said the revenue department official. The directorate of settlement and land records has already begun to issue mutation and partition notices online. The reforms are part of the ‘ease of doing business’ roadmap for Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/land-records-plans-issued-online-without-signature-valid-govt/articleshow/86541854.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Drones to be used to shift logistics in hostile areas||Hyderabad: Drones, that are generally pressed into service for surveillance and anti-sabotage exercises, are now being used by security agencies to shift their logistics in hostile terrains where it takes a lot of time. Now that the government allowed drones to shift more than 300 kilograms of payloads, officials want to use it in terrains like hillocks and in borders where shifting of logistics is difficult and time consuming. Different central security agencies are in discussion with drone developers to procure drones only for the movement of logistics. The officials gave the mandate and it is now for the drone developers to manufacture weather resistant heavy drones, which are suitable for hostile terrains. “This is mainly considered to cut down the travel time and man power. In a hillock area, reaching the destination is highly time consuming but a drone can overcome this problem,” a sources involved in the discussion with a premier security agency told TOI. It will take at least a few months before it is developed and tested for real time usage. In anti-naxal operations too, usage of drones is being explored by police. Even though the usage of a drone to locate the movement of naxals under forest cover is very limited, the available technologies help remotely to identify the presence of a person who is under cover. By remotely judging the body’s temperature, the drone can give information to its handlers about the presence of a human. But there are limitations in using this since one cannot distinguish whether the person under the green cover in the forest is a naxal or a local person in a hamlet.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Students give thumbs down to first year inter exam move||HYDERABAD: Many students and parents have expressed apprehension over intermediate board’s decision to hold first year exams for promoted students currently in the middle of second year. Conducting exams at this juncture would create more pressure, they said. Most were of the view that juggling first and second year syllabus along with preparing for competitive exams would actually adversely affect their overall score in both intermediate and entrances. “At least 70% of students said they did not want to appear for exams at this stage. Last year, hardly any classes were conducted. Further, many have taken up jobs such such as catering, farming or working as labour to support families,” said Krishna M, a lecturer in a government junior college. On September 24, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) had announced exams would be conducted from October 25. “We are in the middle of the second year. How is it possible to attend second year classes every day at college, come back home and prepare for first year? Either the government should direct colleges to revise first year syllabus until exams or conduct exams based on second year syllabus. I don’t think we will be able to excel by listening to classes of second year and appearing for first year exams,” said Abhishek D, a second year BiPc student. Md Naziya Anjum, a second year vocational course student, said, “We hardly understood lessons taught through TSAT. I don’t think we will be able to appear for exams based on digital lessons or after hardly 30 days of physical classes. Several students took to Twitter too. “State has decided to conduct intermediate exams for 1st year students from October 25. It is not a wise decision as students are not vaccinated and have already finished half of the 2nd year syllabus. They are under pressure for entrance exams as well. Is it really necessary to conduct these exams at such a critical time? Please rethink this decision,” tweeted Shashi Preetham with handle @SHASHIP24646360. A few students, however, said that exams should be conducted as it would help them in improving their percentage and subject knowledge.

---||Goa||In just 10 years, 128 land scam cases in Goa||PANAJI: While not much is being said about alleged land scams in the state, Goa Police data reveals a shocking truth. There are 128 cases of land scams registered in the state in the last 10 years and of these, more than half of are in Porvorim and Mapusa of Bardez taluka. Of the 128 land scam cases registered in the state, 73 are reported in the jurisdiction of Mapusa and Porvorim police station. On an average 10 land scam cases are reported every year across the state. A senior police officer said that most of the property owners are unaware that their properties have either been sold or names of property owners have been changed. The officer did not rule out the possibility of a syndicate operating in the state to grab land of those who are not staying in the state. “Citizens who are settled abroad and who have unsupervised properties in Goa are on the radar of this organized syndicate that specializes in grabbing ancestral properties,” the senior police officer said. In most cases the accused identify the land and create fake property ownership papers. The property is then sold to a colleague of the accused before the same property is sold finally to a third party. Police said that some people have been able to halt the transaction when they read notices in local newspapers of people laying claim over the property. The officer said that besides criminal complaints there have also been civil suits pending before the courts in fake property ownership cases. In many cases the actual owner of the property gets to know about the property being sold when buyers who are from outside the state start some construction on the land or when renovation work is started on ancestral houses. There have been cases when mutations have been completed in quick time. TOI has reported many incidents of properties in prime locations being sold off by an impersonator. A case of land-grab in Porvorim area by forging documents was in the news in December 2013 when Goa’s first Arjuna awardee Dr Otilia Mascarenhas fell prey to the racket. Mascarehnas, an orthopaedic surgeon with super-speciality in sports medicine, practices in Germany. Her property was sold by an impersonator in the name of her deceased uncle Jose Fernandes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-just-10-yrs-128-land-scam-cases-in-state/articleshow/86541859.cms||Murari Shetye

They said that even though students would be losing almost a month for these exams, meritorious students are said to be looking forward for the exams. “The 2020-21 batch students did not appear for class 10 board exam.

Questioning the quality of the road work being carried out by the contractor, the villagers have sought the state highways department to conduct a safety audit on the entire stretch as they have apprehensions over the quality. At a cost of Rs 55 crore, the state highways had launched Karur road widening work for a length of 11km last April between Kudamurutti bridge and Thindukkarai. The existing narrow road was to be widened from 7m to 10.5m. While the project is still underway amidst public criticism to complete the work quickly, a portion of the road bordering a retaining wall in Allur Melatheru locality adjacent to an irrigation canal caved in. “I’m shocked to see that the road didn’t withstand even a normal rainfall. We have already expressed our worry over the poor quality of roadwork being carried by the contractor, at least now the state highways must do a safety audit,” Allur Srinivasan, a civic activist said. State highways department officials said the road is still safe and corrective measures were carried out on time to fill the caved-in portion. “We instructed the same contractor to repair the damaged portion.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Rare cuckoo does special appearance in a Raigad town||NAVI MUMBAI: A rare sighting of a Lesser Cuckoo (Cuculus poliocephalus) has been reported from Mangaon in Raigad district, on Saturday. The Lesser cuckoo is difficult to identify as it is often confused with its Indian counterparts. Adult lesser cuckoos are grey with black-barred white underparts and dark eyes. The juvenile birds are brown. Lesser cuckoo is often detected by its typical bird call, which is a short phrase of jumbled notes. “These birds are difficult to spot as they mix up with locally available common cuckoos. They stay here between September and December. These migratory birds get enough food here,” said nature photographer Shantanu Kuveskar, a resident of Mangaon town. “The first such bird was spotted on Saturday and I had clicked the photograph which went viral on social media and was also shared with forest officials,” added Kuveskar. Bird watcher and naturalist-writer Sunjoy Monga told TOI: “The Lesser Cuckoo is a sporadic, even scarce, passage migrant across parts of peninsular India, including the western areas of Konkan that includes the Mumbai environs. We have had some half dozen confirmed sightings over the past 20 years or so from here.” Monga added that a good population of this cuckoo is known to breed along the Himalayan length as also north-eastern India. Environmentalist and bird-watcher Aishwarya Sridhar said: “A rare passage migrant is a messenger of spring. Usually, its migration route is across south India... but seeing it in Maharashtra is definitely exciting. The presence of such birds indicates that our forests are thriving but they need our protection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-rare-cuckoo-does-special-appearance-in-a-raigad-town/articleshow/86540253.cms||Umesh K Parida

In conversation with author Meghna Pant at the Times LitFest on Sunday, the actor spoke about how two people he loved struggled with mental health issues. One was Bollywood actor and ex-wife Parveen Babi and his son Siddharth, who took his own life in 1997. Bedi’s memoir, Stories I must tell: The emotional life of an actor is an honest account of the guilt and burden he dealt with. Talking about the difficult task that caregivers face, Bedi said that Babi’s emotional distress came at a time when he was on a professional high in Europe following the release of his film Sandokan. “It was a strange jugalbandi of an extraordinary euphoria with a cloud of emotional problems with the person you love the most in the world.” He said the struggle becomes easier when the patient realises that they need help. “Self-realisation is the biggest challenge that a person faces. But mental health can be treated much better now,” he added. Underlining the need to end the stigma and shame around mental health, Bedi said, “People must realise sometimes that the caregiver is suffering the most.” He spoke about how caregivers are torn between adjusting to the patient’s needs and wanting the best for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/caregivers-of-mental-health-patients-suffer-too-says-kabir-bedi/articleshow/86539941.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Vidarbha Congress ministers want one or two-member ward system||Nagpur: Cabinet ministers of Congress from Vidarbha were reportedly not consulted before taking the decision to implement three-member ward system in upcoming elections to municipal corporations. The leaders want one-member or two-member ward system, and a resolution to this effect was passed at a city Congress meeting on Sunday. One of the four cabinet ministers of Congress from the region told TOI, “Detailed discussions happened on the proposal seeking revision in ward system from one-member to four-member in the cabinet on September 22. The cabinet failed to arrive at a decision. Therefore, authority was given to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to take a decision. Then, announcement was made by urban development minister Eknath Shinde about three-member ward system. From Congress, two ministers Ashok Chavan and Balasaheb Thorat were consulted before taking the decision. We were unaware of the decision and three-member ward system is not suitable for four municipal corporations of Vidarbha.” Guardian minister Nitin Raut said he would raise the issue at appropriate level and press for revision. Sources in Congress said Raut had suggested two-member ward system in the cabinet along with other Congress ministers of Vidarbha. The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) headed by Nana Patole had on September 23 decided to oppose three-member ward system and demand two-member ward system. City Congress Committee on Sunday held a meeting where president Vikas Thakre sought suggestions of office bearers and corporators. “All said either single-member ward system should continue or be revised to two-member ward system. With three or more corporators from one ward, people face serious inconvenience. Often disputes arise between corporators. Therefore, resolution was passed to have either single-member or two-member ward system, which will be submitted to Patole,” Thakre said. Thakre, also MLA from West Nagpur, said, “Shiv Sena wants single-member ward system so they continued with it. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is of grade-A plus. Pune leaders want three-member ward system, and it will continue with latest decision. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is at grade-A, just like Pune. Nature of work here is different than Mumbai and Pune. Therefore, there should be either single-member or two-member ward system in NMC,” he said. Thakre added there was no need for revision in the decision when it was taken after detailed discussions last year. “BJP government had revised to four-member ward system. Our government had revised it to single-member ward system. Right from booth-level party workers to top, all prepared as per single-member ward system. Now, there will be setback to the preparations,” he said. Three-member ward system was implemented in NMC in 2002. Congress had won and Thakre was mayor. NCP leader and corporator Abha Pande said, “Single-member ward system is best for the people as well as budding politicians. But now that the government has taken a decision, the government should issue notification as soon as possible. Administration should begin the process of delimitation as candidates should get time to know their areas and reach all people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vidarbha-congress-ministers-want-one-or-two-member-ward-system/articleshow/86539930.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Pune||Over 4,000 floating crowd adds to 11,000 active Covid cases in Pune||PUNE: The active case tally in the state's records continues to mark Pune as the district with the highest active Covid patient-load in Maharashtra. The state health department has estimated that there are 10,875 active cases in the region. But, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment across homes and hospitals in Pune is 6,764. The addition of 4,111 patients to the active caseload then are due to Covid infections among those who don't live here but had visited Pune for short work-related trips. They were diagnosed with Covid infection during the short stay. However, the floating population has added to the active caseload in the state's records. Additional district health officer Abhay Tidke said, “We have 6,764 active Covid patients in Pune district __ 3,074 in hospital isolation and 3,690 in home isolation. They have yet to recover from Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment either in home isolation or in hospitals. The state has pegged this number at 10,875. Detection of outstation citizens in Pune has inflated the active case count.” A large influx of citizens have come from outside the district after gradual opening up of businesses. Although Pune district officials do not consider these patients in their active caseload as they are not Pune residents, the government continues to hold them in Pune's active case count as they have tested positive at hospitals/labs in the region. Tidke said, “These are the people who had come to Pune on a short visit either from districts in Maharashtra or other states, but developed symptoms and tested positive for Covid in Pune and are either undergoing care at hospitals or with the confines of the temporary accommodation they were or are staying in.” District officials do not count these patients in Pune's active case tally. “We keep a tab of their health but do not count them in our active case tally. State officials have to consider them in Pune's tally until their names are diverted to the Covid case count of the districts they belong to,” Tidke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-4k-floating-crowd-adds-to-11000-active-cases-in-dist/articleshow/86539950.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Health minister Ma Subramanian said at Trichy on Sunday that the helpline team reached out to all the 1,10,971 students who appeared for the examination through phone to gauge their mental health. “Till Saturday night, 333 psychiatrists and psychologists completed reaching out to all the students who appeared for the exam. But around 20% of the students did not answer the calls. Of the 80% of the students the team interacted with, 200 were found highly stressed. They are being counselled repeatedly. This is the best mechanism that the state has pioneered in the country,” the minister said. He also added that from Sunday, the helpline team has started trying to communicate with the 20% students who did not answer the calls. About the mass vaccination camps, the health minister said that till September 11, 47%-48% of the eligible population were vaccinated with at least one dose of vaccine. After the first two massive vaccination programmes, the coverage increased to 56%. It may cross 60% after the third on Sunday. The minister said there was shortage of vaccines. “The chief minister has written to the Union government and sought 50 lakh doses a week for the state. He had also sent former Union minister and MP T R Baalu to reiterate the demand with the health ministry,” Ma Subramanian said. The minister said a new radiation therapy department will be launched on MGMGH campus. “So far, people from Trichy have been going to Thanjavur for radiation therapy. A GO has been passed and radiotherapy equipment at a cost of Rs 21 crore will be procured and the department will open in a month,” he said. Village panchayat chiefs who achieved 100% vaccination coverage among the eligible population in their panchayats were felicitated. Replying to questions later in the evening at Mayiladuthurai, Ma Subramanian said that vaccination is the only solution to overcome the pandemic. “Only those who have taken the two doses of vaccine develops 97.5% immunity. ICMR and health ministry gave me this information during my recent visit to Delhi. We are creating awareness and encouraging people to take the jab to prevent deaths. There is nothing wrong even if people are compelled to take the jab since it is the government's duty to ensure the welfare of the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/neet-helpline-found-200-of-1-1l-candidates-stressed-min/articleshow/86539934.cms||---
---||Delhi||Teachers in Delhi high court as private school slashes pay||NEW DELHI: For the past 30 years, this teacher has been working at a private school. Come March 2020, when the nationwide lockdown was declared and teaching-learning shifted to the online mode, her salary was reduced to Rs 40,000 from Rs 70,000 earlier. In May, it became half of what she was receiving in the pre-pandemic period. When several requests to the school yielded no results, she and five others from Ravindra Public School, Pitampura moved Delhi high court to be paid what was due. Contract teachers were also sacked after the first lockdown. The educators said they were facing a difficult time as they had to clear the school and college fees of their own children. “Earlier, we understood that fee collection wasn’t taking place. Now, after the Delhi high court order, parents are paying fees along with the arrears. We tried to tell the management, but they didn’t listen. We had no option but to move court,” said a teacher of 33 years. During the pandemic, the government had prohibited schools from levying annual and development charges. After the private schools’ association moved court, they were allowed to collect the annual fees with a 15% concession. “We teachers now have more work than usual. We are not only taking online classes, but are also going to school. Despite this, the management has been treating us badly. We have also not been given the benefits of the pay commission’s recommendations,” said the teacher. The school could not be reached for comments in the matter. Ashok Agarwal, an advocate representing the teachers, said this situation existed across many schools in the city. “Laxmi Public School teachers have not been paid salaries from June onwards. We moved a petition in the high court last week and notices were issued to the government and the school. Eight teachers of Gyan Deep School have not been paid salaries since April 2020,” he added. Teachers of a DAV School branch said they were facing immense financial difficulties as their arrears had not been cleared and they were only being given a part of their salary. While this group of teachers has been meeting lawyers, they have not filed a petition in court as they are scared the school might take action against them. A teacher, on anonymity, said, “Since the pandemic started, we have been receiving only partial pay with no salary slips. We are also not getting any benefits recommended by the pay commission. It’s not like schools are not collecting fees. Parents have been paying the annual/development charges. The school should realise we also have children whose dues need to be cleared.” In July, a report released by Central Square Foundation had highlighted that 55% of teachers in private schools across the country had faced a reduction in salary during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teachers-in-hc-as-pvt-school-slashes-pay/articleshow/86537823.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Stage set for wider use of drug given to Donald Trump||NEW DELHI: Monoclonal antibodies — Casirivimab and Imdevimab — developed for Covid-19 management by US drug major Regeneron have been included by the World Health Organization (WHO) in its latest guidelines for treating patients with mild as well as severe symptoms. Monoclonal antibodies were used for treating former US President Donald J Trump. The drug therapy has been available in India since May for “restricted use” under the brand name, Ronapreve. The WHO approval, doctors say, will increase its demand and acceptance in the country. Read AlsoCDC director warns of ‘dire straits’ in Delta-hit areas of USParts of the US health system “are in dire straits,” as the spread of the Covid-19 delta variant forces some states to prepare for rationed medical care, Rochelle Walensky, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.“Till now, we used it only for patients with mild symptoms of Covid-19 who were at high risk of developing serious illness. For example, people with chronic illnesses. The new guidelines by the WHO state that the monoclonal antibodies can be used to treat severe and critical cases as well, which is important,” Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, director of internal medicine at Max Healthcare, said. Apart from Max Healthcare, private hospitals such as Apollo, Max, Fortis and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital also offer the treatment. Few public hospitals offer it, though, due to the high cost. According to Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care medicine at Apollo Hospital, the monoclonal antibody therapy is imported in India by Roche, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies, and not produced locally. Read AlsoWHO recommends antibody treatment for critical Covid patientsNEW DELHI: Covid-19 patients at high risk of hospitalisation or those with severe disease should be given a combination of two antibody treatments, according to latest World Health Organization guidelines published in The BMJ on Friday. The WHO Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel recommends“It was allowed for restricted use in India in May-June. But since then, Covid-19 cases have reduced significantly and we haven’t had to use it much. However, the new therapy can help in treating Covid-19 cases and reducing the risk of hospitalisation in case there is a third wave,” he said. A spokesperson of Roche, which imports Ronapreve in India, said the price for each patient dose of the therapy — a combined dose of 1,200 mg (600 mg of Casirivimab and 600 mg of Imdevimab) — is Rs 59,750. “We have made available 1 lakh packs (potentially 2 lakh doses) of Ronapreve in the country. It is available through our partner Cipla’s distribution network across the country and is available in all leading healthcare institutions. In Delhi, Ronapreve is available across leading healthcare institutions like Medanta, Fortis, Apollo and Max. Healthcare institutions can place an enquiry by reaching out to their nearest Cipla distributor,” a spokesperson of Roche said. Many doctors and health activists say the price of the drug therapy needs to be reduced for its wider availability. The World Health Organization has made a similar appeal. Read AlsoFew drugs used initially stand the test of timeNew Delhi: In the last two years, since the Covid pandemic began, dozens of drugs have been repurposed to treat the viral infection. While some like the steroids and IL-6 receptors have stood the test of time, many others have not. Public health experts say vaccines available against Covid-19 willThe UN health body has also called for the sharing of technology to allow for the manufacturing of biosimilar versions so all patients who may need this treatment have access to it. An antibody is a protein that is naturally produced by the immune system in response to an infection. A monoclonal antibody is a molecule developed in a laboratory that is designed to mimic or enhance the body’s natural immune system response against an invader, such as cancer or an infection. According to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), prior to Covid-19, monoclonal antibodies were developed to treat several viral infections, such as Ebola and rabies. “SARS CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has a spike protein on its surface that helps the virus attach and enter human cells. The monoclonal antibodies against Covid-19 have been developed to bind to the spike protein of the virus and block it from invading human cells,” the JAMA article says. The latest guideline by WHO says the therapy can be used for patients with non-severe Covid-19, who are at highest risk of hospitalisation, and those with severe or critical infection, who are seronegative, meaning they have not mounted their own antibody response to the disease. The first recommendation is based on new evidence from three trials,` which show that Casirivimab and Imdevimab probably reduce the risk of hospitalisation and duration of symptoms in those at highest risk of severe disease, such as the unvaccinated, older or immunosuppressed patients, the WHO says. It adds that the second recommendation is based on data from the RECOVERY trial showing that Casirivimab and Imdevimab probably reduce deaths (ranging from 49 fewer per 1,000 in the severely ill to 87 fewer in the critically ill) and the need for mechanical ventilation in seronegative patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stage-set-for-wider-use-of-drug-given-to-trump/articleshow/86537842.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||More PUCC issued in July, Aug of 2020 than this year||New Delhi: While the transport department usually begins its drive against polluting vehicles before the winter season, another reason behind the urgency this time is because of a dip in the number of vehicle owners getting their PUC check done.Last week, the department had issued a notice warning vehicle owners of Rs 10,000 fine and suspension of driving license for three months and even imprisonment of up to six months, if they are caught driving without a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) for their vehicle.Sources said that even though the capital is going to see implementation of measures against air pollution from mid-October, the number of PUCC being issued has seen a dip over the last three months.In July 2020, around 4.4 lakh vehicles underwent pollution checks in the city, while the number went up to around 6 lakh in August last year. However, the number of vehicles checked at PUC centres came down to 3.9 lakh in July this year and dipped further to 3.7 lakh in August.Of the 3.9 lakh vehicles that were checked in July, over 10,000 failed to pass the pollution test. A similar number of vehicles failed the test in August this year. The month of September has seen nearly 3.6 lakh vehicles being checked at PUC centres across the capital.“The department issued a notice to vehicle owners on September 19, so that they have ample time to get a valid PUC certificate. We prosecute vehicles that don’t have valid PUCC or are visibly polluting throughout the year, but special drives are carried out ahead of the winter months,” an official said. The special drives are expected to begin from next month with enforcement teams of the department expected to be deployed across the entire capital.While the department has cracked down extensively against polluting vehicles in the last few years, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the numbers coming down. As a result, while the number of vehicles penalised for not carrying a valid PUCC increased from 9,221 in 2016 to 14,938 in 2017, 15,785 in 2018 and up to 16,497 in 2019, the figure halved to 8,237 in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-pucc-issued-in-july-aug-of-2020-than-this-year/articleshow/86537845.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Mucor recurrence keeps under-treatment tally up||Pune: Barring Buldhana, Chandrapur, Hingoli, and Palghar, Maharashtra has active Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM) patients in the other 33 districts. A total of 1,037 CAM patients are currently undergoing treatment across the state. Some of the districts — Wardha, Jalna, Dhule, Bhandara, Washim, and Parbhani — have only a sporadic number of patients on treatment. Pune has the highest active caseload (283), followed by Mumbai (208) and Thane (93). Treating doctors and health officials have underlined that most of these active patients are those who have encountered a recurrence days or months after recovery. “The recurrence is a rule rather than an exception in mucormycosis. Currently, the incidence of recovered patients requiring a revision operation following the recurrence can be pegged at around 80%,” ENT surgeon Samir Joshi, head of department and professor at state-run Sassoon General Hospital, said. Besides, 95% of the patients currently being treated at Sassoon are referred from various adjoining districts — Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, and even Beed and Osmanabad. State surveillance officer Pradip Awate agreed and said, “The rate of recurrence is very high in mucormycosis. A sizable number of patients currently on treatment at various hospitals across the state are those who have encountered recurrence days or months after recovery.” Clearing the entire fungus in one go (surgery) is nearly impossible because the fungus in the broader zone between the dead area (damaged sinus tissues) and living area (healthy tissues) is not seen. “That is why post-operative cleaning, care and injection amphotericin at least for two weeks are so very vital to avoid recurrence,” Joshi said. Usually, areas like frontal sinuses should not see a recurrence. However, many patients are showing recurrence in frontal sinuses, which is a cause for concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mucor-recurrence-keeps-under-treatment-tally-up/articleshow/86540014.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Mayiladuthurai’s DMK MP R Ramalingam, Rajya Sabha MP S Shanmugam, TMC leader G K Vasan and others have been demanding that the decision be withdrawn, but the situation has been continuing for months, they said. At present, both the trains have good patronage as they provide good connectivity for the delta districts to Chennai and southern districts. MPs R Ramalingam and S Shanmugam had written to the railway minister last week urging it to restore the stoppages pointing to the hardship for pilgrims coming from various parts of the country to Papanasam which is also taluk headquarters from the social, cultural and economic point of view. Even considering the ticket revenue, Papanasam station has got more weightage, Shanmugam claimed. However, railway officials said the stoppage for the two express trains at Papanasam was cancelled considering the revenue earned from the station, something that has been disputed by rail users. “We appeal to the concerned authorities at Trichy railway division, Southern Railway and railway minister to consider the request of the people of Papanasam and issue instructions to restore the stoppage immediately,” said the secretary of Train Passengers Association, Papanasam T Saravanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plea-to-restore-stoppage-for-two-trains-at-papanasam/articleshow/86539978.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Emerging Tech courses should be offered as honours degree: Colleges||Hyderabad: While universities and engineering colleges in the state are offering courses like artificial Intelligence, machine learning, data sciences as specialisation courses, some of the colleges have begun a debate saying these emerging tech courses need to be offered as honours degree. While managements say students need to secure 180 credits to get a honours degree in these courses along with computer science engineering for their degree to be valid, officials of Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad (JNTUH) said that 160 credits are enough as per the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE)norms. “Even at the cost of admissions in our institutions, we have been informing the students approaching our institutions that in our colleges, we have only BTech CSE course with 160 credits with an option to secure honours degree in AI&ML / data science / cyber security /lOT, after securing additional 18 to 20 credits,” said KVK Rao, founder & chairman, St Mary’s Group of Institutions. “However, students got confused after seeing the course codes of B Tech CSE (AI & ML) / (Data Science) /(Cyber Security) / (lOT),” said Rao, who is general secretary of All India Federation of Self Financing Technical Institutions. Managements have already submitted a representation to officials of higher education, technical education, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad among others on the issue saying that these courses will be considered illegal and are in violation of AICTE norms. They say that officials will have to change the code name of the courses in accordance with AICTE and offer emerging technology courses as honours degree instead of specialization. The JNTUH registrar M Manzoor Hussain said that 160 credit courses are being followed as per AICTE norms. He said that students have nothing to worry about and that their degree will be valid and recognized by AICTE. “Not just JNTU, other universities, and colleges are offering these courses. If we are offering emerging technology courses as honours degree, then students will need to secure 180 credits, but right now they don’t have to. Why are only a handful of colleges creating issues, when all others are offering these courses,” questioned the registrar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/emerging-tech-courses-should-be-offered-as-honours-degree-colleges/articleshow/86539996.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

He stressed the need for covering the entire household in a phased manner to provide water connections. Work is in progress to eradicate open defecation by constructing individual and community toilets and improving solid and liquid waste management systems in the rural areas across the state. To execute the mission, the Union government has allotted Rs 366.58 crore under Swachh Bharat Mission, he said. Later in the evening, the minister visited Trichy to participate in various events. He inaugurated an overhead water tank and a community sanitary complex built under Swachh Bharat Mission at Samathuvapuram in Navalpattu panchayat in the district.

---||Hyderabad||Taxing times in Secunderabad cantonment areas, claim property owners||SECUNDERABAD: Life in Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) limits has become quite taxing, claim property owners worried over rising taxes. The SCB’s revised tax plans for 2022 fiscal, which is likely to include a steep rise, is already giving sleepless nights to property owners. This year alone the SCB has collected about Rs 80 crore to Rs 100 crore in property taxes, an SCB official said. “If as taxpayers we question the Cantonment Board officials on infrastructure development, they chant ‘no funds’ mantra,” B Dileep Reddy, a resident of Dhanalakshmi Colony in Bowenpally told TOI, adding that unlike GHMC, the SCB has failed to use taxpayers’ money to improve civic amenities. For some, selling their properties and shifting to GHMC areas seems to be a better idea unless there was a merger between the two bodies to bring uniformity in taxes for residents in the twin cities. Commercially, the SCB area has grown rapidly on a par with GHMC, but many tenants have been spooked by rising rents as property owners deftly passed their higher tax burden on to them. When TOI spoke to a few commercial property owners in Trimulgherry, Bowenpally, Karkhana, Picket and Marredpally, the common refrain for raising rent was ever increasing tax burden. Covid-19 has now multiplied their financial woes. “There has been no business due to Covid-19 pandemic. But taxes are still high. So, we raised the rents,” a property owner admitted. The old tenants are the once feeling the pinch most as their low rents have skyrocketed. “A steep hike in property tax every year has led to owners raising rents. They are not sparing even long-time tenants,” said B Chakradhar, a grocer running his business from a rented premise for more than two decades in Trimulgherry. As per official SCB records, there are over 36,000 properties now paying taxes, while there are close to 15,000 illegal properties (not on records) missing from the tax net. “People in the tax wing have been minting money. It can’t be ended unless there is a merger,” BVSS Srinivasa Rao, a resident of Greenview Enclave, claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/taxing-times-in-cantonment-areas-claim-property-owners/articleshow/86540018.cms||Sunil Mungara

The court was hearing the criminal revision petition filed by Rathinam. He had complained to his mother that his newly wed wife was dark in complexion, her lips were broad and she was ugly. He had also proposed to offer Rs 25,000 to her to get a divorce. The woman became depressed and also told her friend that she was unhappy. Subsequently, she set herself afire and died nearly 45 days after marriage. Following the incident, police registered a case and filed a final report before the Nagercoil chief judicial magistrate court. Taking into account the statement of witnesses, the trial court in 2006 convicted and sentenced Rathinam to undergo four years rigorous imprisonment under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and two years rigorous imprisonment 498 A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of IPC. When Rathinam filed an appeal, the Nagercoil mahila court dismissed it and confirmed the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court in 2016. Challenging the order of the trial and appellate courts, Rathinam filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench in 2017. Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup observed that the demeanour of witnesses can be appreciated only by the trial court. The appellate court does not have the benefit of trial court. The concurrent finding of the trial and appellate courts cannot be interfered with by the revisional court. The trial and appellate courts had discussed the law as well as the evidence in proper perspective and answered the point in favour of the prosecution and against the accused. Hence, the judge dismissed the revision petition, stating that the conviction awarded by the trial court was not perverse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-conviction-jail-sentence-of-man-forabetting-wifes-suicide/articleshow/86540022.cms||---

The court was hearing the criminal revision petition filed before it by suspended sub-inspector of police (SI) P Raghu Ganesh challenging the order of I additional district and sessions court at Madurai which had dismissed his plea seeking to discharge him from the charges against him. Partly allowing the revision petition, Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup discharged the petitioner only from the offence under Section 188 of IPC and not from the entire case. Regarding the other offences, evidence is to be recorded and the trial court shall pronounce judgment after that, said the judge. Raghu Ganesh had also filed another criminal revision petition challenging the trial court order which had dismissed his petition filed under Section 207 of CrPC, seeking to furnish copies of the statement recorded from 45 witnesses by CB-CID. Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup observed that the state government had transferred the investigation from CB-CID to CBI. When the CBI has taken up investigation, its investigation officer conducts independent investigation and does not depend on the investigation already held by CB-CID. The judge observed that the previous investigation conducted by CB-CID had been closed mid-way. Therefore, the accused cannot have the right to claim such statements of witnesses. Even if the accused receives copies by unfair means, the same cannot be relied on before the sessions court to protect the valuable right of defence. Dismissing the revision petition, the judge observed that the petitioner’s attempt is found to be mischievous. However, the judge directed the trial court to furnish a copy of the CD containing the videograph of the postmortem conducted on the bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cop-accused-in-custodial-deaths-case-discharged-from-one-offence/articleshow/86540013.cms||---

The orange rain alert by India Meteorological Department (IMD) could cause more rain-triggered trouble for the region. Beed district administration on Sunday afternoon cautioned people to remain alert for floods in the wake of heavy discharge from dams. Parbhani and Nanded have also been issued similar warnings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-marathwada-on-alert-dams-overflow/articleshow/86542328.cms||---
---||Delhi||Few drugs used initially stand the test of time||New Delhi: In the last two years, since the Covid pandemic began, dozens of drugs have been repurposed to treat the viral infection. While some like the steroids and IL-6 receptors have stood the test of time, many others have not.Public health experts say vaccines available against Covid-19 will certainly help reduce the incidence of the disease and morbidity and mortality caused by it. But, they add, developing anti-viral drugs to treat the infection is equally important.“The global efforts to develop vaccines against Covid has been a great success. More importantly, we have been able to do this in record time. But now, focus must shift on developing drugs to treat the disease,” Dr N K Mehra, emeritus scientist, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said. He added that most of the drugs used for Covid management so far have been old ones that were repurposed to treat the viral infection or manage symptoms caused by it.“Regeneron, monoclonal antibodies that were used to treat former US President Donald Trump, is the only drug developed specifically for Covid management. It binds to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, virus that causes Covid, and blocks it from invading human cells, thus reducing the risk of virus replications and preventing serious illness,” Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care at Apollo Hospital, said.Monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat some patients suffering from Covid at AIIMS, too, Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of AIIMS, told TOI.But the mainstay of Covid management are steroids and IL-6, which prevent the immune system from overreacting dangerously. The latest guideline by WHO recommends them strongly for administration in patients who are severe or critical. They are not recommended for non-severe cases. The WHO does not recommend anti-viral drug Remdesivir for patients with Covid at any severity. When the second wave was at its peak in India in April-May, the anti-viral drug was in very high demand and hapless patients purchased it at inflated rates because some of the initial studies suggested it helped in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease.Similarly, there was a rush to get convalescent plasma therapy. That, too, has been proven to be ineffective and many studies suggest that the administration of the convalescent plasma — blood plasma derived from patient’s who had recovered from the disease — actually caused harm to the patient. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is an anti-malarial drug, was used to treat admitted patients, in addition to its use among healthcare workers for prophylactic purposes. New evidence doesn’t support its use.Other repurposed drugs that were popular in the beginning of the pandemic, but failed to stand the test of time include anti-viral drug Fabipiravir, anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin and the use of antibiotic therapy, among others. Ivermectin was, in fact, removed from the list of drugs recommended for Covid management last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/few-drugs-used-initially-stand-the-test-of-time/articleshow/86537856.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The woman also alleged that he gave her abortion pills that caused a miscarriage. Sources said the 23-year-old constable has been suspended. The case is being probed by an ACP-rank officer. The accused has been booked under IPC Sections 376 (rape) and 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent). In her complaint to the Khandeshwar police last week, the woman (who hails from a minority community) alleged that the accused also hurled casteist abuses at her. Accordingly, cops also invoked the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/cop-charged-with-rape-gets-suspended/articleshow/86542342.cms||George Mendonca
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Fight lies on social media with facts’||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has instructed its various departments, agencies, PSUs and all the government-controlled bodies to actively utilize the services of the government’s fact-check division to counter the social media posts that are intended to spread wrong information about the government and its officials. As per the government’s instructions, the posts have to be categorized and should be dealt with according to the seriousness of the matter. In a detailed standard operating procedure laid out by chief secretary V P Joy in the first week of this month, the government asked all the stakeholder departments, district collectors, heads of public sector undertakings and other government-controlled bodies to categorise all social media posts to “red, green or white” categories, depending on the urgency or importance of the matter. “All texts or photos of serious nature that would adversely affect the government or the public should be categorized in the red category. Such posts should be given priority and urgent steps should be taken,” it said. The posts under the red category should be examined, and permission should be taken from the concerned department secretary or the chief secretary and a press release or appropriate response should be given. Those in the green category should be given a response or press release through the public relations department (PRD), while those in white category need not be given any response. The posts that have importance only at the district level will be the responsibility of the concerned district collector. Any social media posts that are against the state government, its various departments, bodies or agencies, public sector undertakings and against the government officials, should be scanned for dealing with them using the fact-check division, the circular said. All the departments and bodies should appoint an inter-departmental coordination officer who should also function as the fact-check nodal officer in that body. The details of such a designated officer of the department, including his WhatsApp number and email address, should be shared with the fact-check division of PRD, the instructions said. However, the traditional news media, including newspapers and news magazines, television, radio and their web portals have been excluded from this exercise. The government had on June 22 last year constituted a fact-check division under the information and public relations department to identify fake news relating to the government and clarify the real matter through the government’s official websites. The division had also decided to refer such fake news which are “serious in nature” to the police Cyberdome for further action. However, since there are no specific laws for taking action against such fake news, police have been able to act only on news that could be charged under sections of the existing laws. Last year, the government had constituted a team of police officials to take action against those spreading fake news. The police have been using sections in IT Act, Kerala Police Act and IPC for booking such cases. “There are no acts that enable the police to take legal action against fake news. If specifically related to something enacted by law and needs the public to follow it, but if a social media post intentionally spreads wrong information about it, like in the case of Kerala epidemic disease ordinance, such posts can be booked under that law,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fight-lies-on-social-media-with-facts/articleshow/86537921.cms||KP Saikiran

The leopard, which had eluded capture for nearly six days, had been a source of much anxiety for both the residents and foresters. After the big cat eluded capture on Saturday, the foresters intensified the drive and set up six cages around the sugarcane field to trap the leopard.Deputy conservator of forests Yashpal Ksheersagar, who led the operation to capture the leopard, told TOI, “The big cat strayed into the sugarcane fields in Kavalgeri on Tuesday. Maruti Uppar, a resident of the village, spotted the big cat, and intimated the forest department.”During the operation, the foresters found traces of the leopard, which helped them narrow down the area of the search. On Friday, foresters involved in the operation spotted the leopard, which subsequently escaped into a banana plantation.More than 60 forest guards, and tranquillisation experts from Kali Tiger Reserve were pressed into the operation. The elusive big cat was finally trapped in the cage on Sunday morning, and is slated to be released into the Dandeli Forest.Ksheersagar said that they were awaiting results from the tests conducted on the leopard’s excreta collected at Kavalgeri and the samples obtained from Nrupatunga Betta, which would help them ascertain if both the leopards were the same. The results are expected on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/leopard-prowling-around-kavalgeri-trapped/articleshow/86535772.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Cantts relics of past, have become islands inside cities||Cantonments were a creation of the East India Company to keep natives out and provide safe place for British to live. Cantonments are unique to India and do not exist anywhere else in world, not even in Britain. Countries across the globe, armies live in military stations or among civilians. The 62 cantonments across India house less than 20% of Army strength while 80% live in military stations. Air Force, Navy, BSF, and CRPF have no cantonments. This proves cantonments are not central to providing extra safety to the Army. They are not sacrosanct that they cannot be abolished. Indeed, over 41 cantonments have been abolished, the biggest being the Bangalore Cantonment which was abolished in 1881 and since then, has grown on par with the rest of the city. Other than a station named Bangalore Cantonment there is nothing to distinguish old cantonment area from rest of the city. Infrastructure at cantonments is antiquated and rules are relics of colonial era, some older than 200 years! These are bottlenecks not only for dwellers but the city at large. Cantonments have become small islands inside larger adjoining cities which have grown on all sides. Presence of Army in high density civilian areas puts their own security and that of civilians at high risk. Existence of ammunition dumps in city area is a matter of concern. Secunderabad was not part of British India and only Nizam government land was given to British for military purposes only. All cantonments, particularly Secunderabad, must be de-notified at the earliest and merged with adjoining municipalities. The crumbling infrastructure of roads, sanitation, water supply, lighting etc have to be upgraded. Civilians owning properties will be able to develop them resulting in better housing and commercial spaces. These will create more employment; generate more taxes for local body, state and Centre. Additional funds generated can be used for betterment of Army.

For the first time since the seventh phase of excavation began in Keeladi and its cluster of villages, the public were officially allowed to visit it and over 1,200 people visited the site. Agaram is not open to visitors yet and people were allowed to visit only Keeladi and Konthagai. The visitation is being organised by the South Tamil Nadu Association of Travel and Tourism (STATT), in coordination with the Tamil Nadu State Archaeology department. . People would be allowed to visit the site on Sunday and Monday, between 9 am to 3 pm. Suresh Kumar from Udumalaipet, who had come with his family, said that he had come for the weekend and did not want to miss the opportunity to see this site. “It did not disappoint me,” he said. The excavations have stopped now as the seventh phase that began in February this year has almost concluded and the quadrants have been closed with tarpaulin. The documentation is underway. President of STATT, K Senthilkumar, said that they had expected about 500 people but more people turned up. This is a site which has high potential as a tourist destination, he added. Archaeologists at the site explained about various artefacts that had been found in this phase. A photo kiosk was also setup to help people take photographs. “The opening could have been more publicised because many of my friends from Chennai have been waiting for an opportunity to see it,” said T Josephine of Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hundreds-throng-keeladi-site-as-it-is-opened-to-public/articleshow/86540045.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Muslims of Jamia Nagar help save temple from damage||NEW DELHI: A swift legal move by a concerned group of Muslim residents of Jamia Nagar has ensured halting of damage to the premises of an old temple in the locality by Delhi high court. A part of the dharamshala next to the temple was razed by miscreants recently. The court stepped in last week after the Jamia Nagar 206 ward committee approached it and highlighted encroachment and demolition of the only temple in the area, which included the dharamshala situated at Johri Farm. The upset petitioners, who live in Noor Nagar Extension colony, informed the court that a part of the dharmashala had been demolished overnight in haste and the entire land was levelled so that it could be encroached upon by the miscreants/builders. Citing the layout plan of the area, in which the mandir premises were marked clearly, the committee headed by Fouzul Azeem alleged that a part of it had been demolished to erect a building and sell flats. Not only was the act by the builder illegal, it was aimed at earning money by creating communal tension in the locality, the plea warned, urging the court to direct the municipal corporation and Delhi Police to protect it. “Noor Nagar is a huge area with a dense Muslim population and a few houses of non-Muslims (40-50 families). It is important to submit that both the communities have been living here for years with love, affection and brotherhood. However, the builder/miscreants are trying to disturb the brotherhood and harmony among both the communities,” the plea filed through advocate Nitin Saluja contended. The residents further stated that they had made repeated calls to police and South Delhi Municipal Corporation officials regarding the encroachment and illegal demolition, but no action was taken, prompting them to approach the court. When the bench queried about the razing of the dharamshala, the corporation clarified that it had not carried out or authorised any demolition. It added that when the property was inspected, no construction activity was found. However, since the issue was related to law and order and protection of the area, it had sounded out the police. Police assured the court that it would ensure there was no encroachment on the temple premises and it would be preserved and protected. Binding both police and the corporation to their assurance, the court ordered them to ensure there was no law and order issue in the area and “the area depicted as mandir in the layout plan is protected and maintained as a mandir and no encroachment by any miscreant is permitted on the same”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/muslims-help-save-temple-from-damage/articleshow/86537876.cms||Abhinav Garg

The streamlined supply of vaccine doses and consistent special drives resulted in September recording the highest monthly vaccination. Now, an estimated 17 lakh beneficiaries remain who are yet to receive their first dose of the vaccine. According to the data provided by the district health office, of the 19 lakh doses of vaccines administered in September, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has recorded the highest with over 8 lakh doses; Pune rural administered around 7.30 lakh doses while the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) administered 3.34 lakh doses. September’s inoculation figures are the highest for the PMC since the vaccination drive began in January 2021. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have done exceptionally well in the month of September, and two more lots of doses will be received in the next four days, making it an excellent month for the vaccination efforts against Covid-19.” Deshmukh added that in October, the district is likely to receive around 30 lakh doses, which will be higher than September. “We want to cover the remaining 17 lakh recipients, awaiting their first shot, by October end and achieve at least 40% coverage of those who are due to receive their second shot. Currently around 30% of the total beneficiaries have received their second shot,” said Deshmukh. Meanwhile, on Sunday, despite many centres remaining shut, the district managed to administer 56,998 doses. According to CoWIN details, there was a good response to the vaccination across 176 private sites on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-19l-pune-administers-highest-number-of-vax-doses-in-a-month/articleshow/86540050.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Telangana may need 2.15 crore vaccine doses to complete immunisation drive||HYDERABAD: If the Covid-19 vaccine supply is maintained adequately by the Centre, achieving the target of giving single doses to the eligible population in the state within the three-month deadline appears to be feasible. The Centre sends approximately 50 lakh to 60 lakh doses per month, and the state has a population of 2.86 crore eligible (those aged 18 and above) for vaccination. Currently, roughly 1.79 crore first doses have been administered, with 67 lakh people receiving a second dose as well. In the coming months, the state may require 2.15 crore doses to complete the immunisation drive (both doses to eligible people). “For the past three days, the state has been distributing 3 lakh to 5 lakh doses daily. Given the gaps in between and the occasional supply hitch, it is possible that the drive will last longer than four months,” said officials. The state has the potential to provide 10 lakh doses every day. Until recently, one lakh doses were administered daily, however, after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s directive to the health department, daily vaccine coverage has reached 3 lakh, and in certain cases, 5 lakh. “The state government has obtained certain doses on its own from companies,” said sources. In terms of supply of doses, the state ranks 13th in the country. “Many individuals are hesitant to travel to private hospitals to get the vaccine because of the hefty expenses, if that is picked up, then numbers will increase,” officials added. The state administration has prioritized isolated and rural areas where vaccine reluctance persists. The state was recently ordered by the high court to complete the immunisation programme in three months. “If vaccination supplies improve, it is not a herculean task, but everything depends on supplies,” said sources. So far, the state has given 41.37 lakh Covaxin doses, which is quite less when compared to the 2.03 crore Covishield doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-may-need-2-15-crore-vax-doses-to-complete-immunisation-drive/articleshow/86540054.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

As most of the stations along the Collem to Vasco stations have just one platform, the expansion of the railway track has entailed addition of two or more platforms at these stations. The Collem railway station will now have three platforms and a new station building that is under construction. At Kalay, which had a single platform, an additional platform has been constructed. While Sanvordem railway station will have three platforms, the station building has undergone redevelopment and staff quarters have also been constructed in its proximity. Sao Jose de Areal railway station, which is designated as a halt and currently has minimal passenger amenities, will now have a passenger hall and will be equipped with two platforms. At Chandor, the single-platform railway station will now have an additional platform, sources in the Railways said. Speed trial run on the newly laid second track on the Margao-Chandor-Curchorem (Sanvordem) section of SWR was conducted by the CRS on September 23. The train clocked a speed of 124 kmph during the trial run. The inspection report of the CRS is likely to be received by SWR soon. Once the CRS submits its inspection report, SWR will act on the suggestions and carry out improvements, if any, recommended in it before commissioning the second track. The 15.6km Margao-Chandor-Curchorem (Sanvordem) section is a part of the Hospet-Hubli-Tinaigat-Vasco double tracking project. SWR has already scheduled the work of switching over of the train signaling system from single track mode to double track between October 3 and October 10 ahead of the commissioning of the Margao-Chandor-Curchorem double tracked route. Several trains have been cancelled/partially cancelled on the route during the period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/swr-to-upgrade-stations-to-facilitate-double-tracking/articleshow/86541946.cms||---

The regional joint registrars would submit their compiled reports on the status of the loans in their regions to Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Chennai by November 20. This was stated in a communication dated September 24 from the registrar to the managing director, Central Cooperative Bank, Chennai, regional registrars and other officials. It said the chief minister had announced under Rule 110 of the Assembly that all eligible gold loans up to five sovereigns obtained through cooperative societies would be waived. But it has been detected that misappropriations have taken place in providing these gold loans and hence it has been decided to scrutinize the loans provided through the societies. According to the chief minister’s announcement in the Assembly, the state would incur an expenditure of Rs 6,000 crore due to the waiver. The registrar has said that all gold loans that had been obtained till March 31, 2021 and from April 1, 2021 to the date of scrutiny should be reviewed 100%. Committees comprising joint registrars of the societies should decide on the number of gold appraisers needed for the scrutiny and form committees.  Cooperative societies in each region would be scrutinized by teams from the neighbouring region. For example, Trichy region would be reviewed by officials from Ariyalur, Karur by Dindigul, Theni region by officials from Madurai etc..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/panels-to-scrutinize-all-cooperative-gold-loans/articleshow/86540068.cms||---

---||Delhi||Temple dharamshala hosted festivals of both Hindus and Muslims||New Delhi: The residents of Noor Nagar have many memories associated with the dharamshala of an old temple in their locality, a part of which was demolished overnight a few days ago by alleged miscreants. Not only did the Hindu residents pray in the temple, but the premises, including the dharamshala, was used by Muslims for many events, including festivals, weddings and ceremonies.Syed Azeem Faizul (Arshi), a resident of the locality, said, “I moved court to ensure that the friendly atmosphere of the area was not vitiated. Noor Nagar is a Muslim-dominated area, but there are 50-odd non-Muslim families living here too. We have always promoted communal harmony in the area.”Mathura Dutt Sharma, a 56-year-old local resident, said, “Years ago, people used to pray in the temple, celebrated festivals and performed marriage rituals. But suddenly it was closed. The Muslim community has always supported us. Even during weddings in Muslim households, people used to stay in the dharamshala. It was also very helpful for the poor.”Ram Naresh (46) said they had been living in the area for several years and had never been harassed by the other community. “I was 10 years old when I started going to the temple. I saw our Muslim brothers helping and supporting us during festivals,” he added.Another local resident, 62-year-old Shanti, said, “After the temple was closed, we started celebrating festivals on the streets.” Munna (80) said the nikah of his daughter was conducted at the dharamshala 17-18 years ago.Reminiscing the Janmashtami festival that was celebrated with great fervour in 2015, Mohammad Harun (53), who lives near the temple, said, “We were all so happy. Later, the main gate was built and the temple was closed to the public. We will not allow any kind of communal disharmony in the area. I have also objected to the demolition.”On Sunday, the temple gate was locked and a police Quick Response Team had been stationed there.On September 23, the then deputy commissioner of police (Southeast) RP Meena had tweeted: “The property belongs to a member of the Hindu community who himself was dismantling and clearing the built-up area adjacent to the temple in his own property. No harm to the temple has been caused and it is intact.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/temple-dharamshala-hosted-festivals-of-both-hindus-and-muslims/articleshow/86537906.cms||Abhay Singh

With 12,767 more people receiving the second jab on Saturday, the number of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 in the city crossed the 5.39 lakh mark. Over 1.59 lakh recipients of all age groups have taken the second dose in just 25 days of September. The number of recipients who were administered the second dose till September 1 was 3,80,525, which rose to 5,39,555 on September 26. Up till August 1, only 2,32,156 recipients were fully vaccinated. Moreover, 43% of the targeted recipients, that is, 19.87 lakh people, have received the first dose in the district so far. The district health department has set a target of vaccinating around 46.10 lakh recipients of all age groups, including 34 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 years and 12.10 lakh above 45 years of age. As per the latest data released by the health department, a total of 25,27,181 shots have been given to recipients of all age groups in the district till September 25.

Recent spells of rain, with more expected in the coming days, have weakened the mosque’s structure and further water leakage may cause damage to its entrance and walls. Leakage and crumbling pieces around the structure have prompted the mosque’s caretakers to raise the issue with officials but they said there has been no movement on these complaints so far. “The matter was taken up with concerned authorities on the instruction of our party chief Asaduddin Owaisi while representations have also been made in this regard. Water leakage inside the mosque and the developing cracks at the entrance need to be repaired immediately. The mosque should be protected as it an old and beautiful monument,’’ former AIMIM corporator, Mohammed Abdul Samad Warsi, told TOI. The mosque was constructed between 1676 and 1678 by Mia Mishk, an employee under Abul Hassan Tana Shah, the ruler of Qutub Shahi dynasty. The façade of the masjid resembles the Charminar. The mosque has a unique structure and fountain while it also houses a dargah within the premises. People from various places pay visits to the site but many are disappointed over the structure’s upkeep. The mosque is also listed among the archaeological monuments of the state as it almost as old as Charminar. An archaeological official told TOI they have taken up works to clear debris and remove bushes from the terrace and walls. “We have started cleaning works here. Mud, debris and bushes are being cleaned to stem the leakage, “he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/400-yr-old-mosque-crumbling-in-need-of-upkeep/articleshow/86540113.cms||Omar bin Taher

Doctors treating children with the MIS-C at state-run Sassoon General Hospital are seeking donations to make the expensive therapy available for children. “In June, we had appealed to the government to make MIS-C treatment universal and comprehensive, which will help the kids affected as IVIG is very expensive. The state’s Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Arogya Yojana takes care of only a small portion of the treatment cost. We have to raise the remaining cost through donations,” said Sassoon paediatrician Aarti Kinikar. A 10gm vial of IVIG costs around Rs20,000. Depending upon weight — 2gm per kg of bodyweight is to be given in 12 hours — a child weighing 25 kg will need 50gm of IVIG, which will Rs1 lakh. “The packages offered under MPJAY have a ceiling. It does not provide for the entire treatment, which is costlier,” Kinikar said. Sassoon is a referral tertiary care centre that gets patients not only from Pune, but from adjoining districts like Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and Kolhapur. “We have treated over 38 children with MIS-C in the past four months. They were from various neighbouring districts. Every time a child gets admitted we must seek donations. Private hospitals also referred patients to Sassoon, when they find the child’s family not able to afford treatment and we cannot deny them,” Kinikar said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, is one of the many donors who have helped Sassoon’s paediatrician to procure IVIG for kids. “A few of my friends had come forward to bear the cost of IVIG for kids with MIS-C admitted at Sassoon. That the state’s own hospital’s doctors are struggling to procure IVIG and are reaching out to private donors is demoralising,” Patil said. Amol Maske, regional manager of MPJAY, said, “I will talk to Sassoon hospital’s doctors and explain how they can cover all treatment costs using various packages meant for treating children.” Considering the incidence calculated in studies conducted in the US, there may be around 500 children affected by MIS-C in Maharashtra. Despite repeated attempts, additional chief secretary (health) Pradeep Vyas and the scheme’s chief executive officer Sudhakar Shinde could not be reached for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/free-ivig-still-ineffective-sassoon-docs-raise-funds/articleshow/86540117.cms||Umesh Isalkar

According to archeologists, though Ramanathapuram is known as a drought prone district, it is also home to many rare trees, especially in the sacred groves of the numerous temples in the region. Some very rare trees and herbs can be found in the sacred groves of the Ayyanar, Karuppasamy and Muneeswarar temples found in villages in the district. One such interesting grove is that of the Darma Muneeswarar temple in Koorankottai, where around 20 huge rare miswak trees are seen. It has the scientific name Salvadora persica and is said to have many medicinal properties. The temple is famous in the region and a large number of devotees visit it regularly. The miswak trees found in the grove and about another fifty trees found on the banks of the Kundaru river that flows through the village are big and would be more than hundred years old, said V Rajaguru, president of the Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation. It is a tree that is mentioned in Sangam literature and is said to be endemic to arid or desert regions. The bark of the tree is grey in colour and looks like the back of a pigeon in the Sangam literature. The fruits are tiny red balls and the leaves are oval in shape. According to commentators of the prophetic narrations, Prophet Muhammad is said to have used miswak twigs to brush his teeth. Sangam literature such as Natrinnai has a poem by Inisantha Naganaar referring to this tree. One of the 99 flowers referred to in poet Kabilar’s Kurinjipattu is said to be the flower from this tree. The branches hang around the tree and people can walk into the lush foliage of the tree to see the trunk. Though they have flourished in the temple, smaller plants are not seen, so there may be problems in its propagation and steps should be taken to protect the existing trees and showcase their importance, Rajaguru said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-conserve-rare-miswak-trees-at-ramanathapuram-temple/articleshow/86540102.cms||---

The petition sought removal or sealing of encroachment in the form of unauthorised construction over public land at the graveyard maintained by Delhi Waqf Board.“Let the deputy commissioner of the south corporation file an affidavit explaining why the unauthorised construction and encroachment were allowed to come up in the first place and fix responsibility upon the officers, who may be found derelict in their duties. The affidavit shall also explain as to why the above-mentioned order (of division bench) has not been complied with,” the high court said.With regard to the street or public access, the court said this ought to be cleaned up by the land owning agency and asked the municipal corporation to look into the issue of recent construction, which has been attempted at the spot.The plea claimed that illegal construction has been done in the form of opening of various offices, eating points and shops on the way to the graveyard and outside the premises. It had alleged that the activities were in the knowledge of Delhi Waqf board and South Delhi Municipal Corporation and BSES, which had installed electricity connections there. The plea had alleged that graves were being sold at the graveyard at exorbitant amounts to the public and more space given to influential persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/explain-unauthorised-construction-near-bsz-graveyard-hc-to-sdmc/articleshow/86537949.cms||---

AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar and KPCC president K Sudhakaran are also likely to meet the senior party leader to persuade him to withdraw the resignation from PAC. During the meeting the opposition leader had with Sudheeran, the former KPCC president is learnt to have explained about the issues and grievances he had with the present party leadership. However he was firm on the resignation and was not ready to reconsider it, said sources. After about an hour-long discussion with Sudheeran, Satheesan said, “I did not come to request him to withdraw the resignation. I was sure that he would not relent. Even if ten Satheesans tried to persuade him, he would not go back on his resignation. I came here to apologise to him over lapses on my part. I have the freedom for this since I enjoy a very close relationship with him.” There were reports that Sudheeran was upset with the way he was sidelined in the discussion on restructuring the party committees. However, K Sudhakaran said that Sudheeran was given ample opportunities to comment during the discussions but he did not utilise it. “I had personally gone to meet him when we learnt that he was upset. The PAC has met regularly to discuss policy decisions. But every matter has not been discussed in the PAC,” said Sudhakaran. He said all decisions taken by the party leadership were supported by the party high command. All senior leaders were consulted whenever a decision was taken and no one was isolated in the party. “I am ready to meet Sudheeran and hold discussions. KPCC will urge Sudheeran to withdraw his resignation,” said Sudhakaran. Meanwhile, several senior leaders termed Sudheeran’s resignation from PAC as unfortunate. Ramesh Chennithala said Sudheeran should be there in the policy-making body of the party and he hoped that the present leadership would persuade him to withdraw his resignation. UDF convener M M Hassan too said the party leadership would discuss the issues with Sudheeran and resolve it at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-leader-rushes-to-sudheeran-to-pacify-him/articleshow/86538001.cms||---

Instead, the government has reconstituted the dispute redressal committee and also warned that if any of the government-controlled body approaches any court, tribunal or any other legal forum in intra-governmental matters without clearance from the committee, the entire cost of such litigation including the interest will be considered as wasteful expenditure and will be recovered from the officer who has authorized filing of the case. “It has come to the notice of the government that certain government departments, PSUs, corporations, boards, local self-government institutions, autonomous bodies are still approaching various courts, tribunals and other legal forums for resolving disputes spending huge amounts of money as court fees and procedural expenses and thereby wasting time and resources by neglecting the standing orders on dispute redressal,” said the government order issued last week. Such practices need to be dispensed with in order to reduce the burden on the government exchequer, and to avoid delay in administration and project implementation, it said. The reconstituted committee will be chaired by the chief secretary and additional chief secretary or the principal secretary (finance), secretary (home), secretary (planning) and the secretaries of the disputing departments as the members of the committee. Any dispute raised by a government organization against another should be referred to the secretaries of the departments involved in the dispute. The PSUs, boards and corporations, local self-government institutions, autonomous bodies, etc should approach the secretaries of the concerned administrative department, in case of a dispute. After the secretaries of the disputing parties arrive at a settlement, a copy of the settlement should be communicated to each party of the dispute for implementation. The need for litigation will thereafter be avoided. In case the disputes remain unresolved even after deliberation by the concerned secretaries, it should then be referred for dispute resolution to the committee chaired by the chief secretary. The committee will then examine the dispute and resolve the same. In case recourse to legal measures are required, it will be the committee that will then grant permission for the same, the order said. There are hundreds of litigations pending in various legal forums in the state involving the government. In many of these, the disputes are between government bodies. Also in several cases, the delay by the government bodies in filing their part on time due to bureaucratic delays leads to heavy wastage of public money and resources, which also drags the litigation for a long period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/resolve-inter-dept-issues-via-redressal-panel-not-courts-go/articleshow/86535941.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Pune||Motorists seek better lights along eway, inside tunnels||Pune: Commuters who travel regularly to Mumbai have highlighted the need for weather-proof lighting along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, especially in the tunnels and ghat sections of the route. Middle-aged Amit Doshi, who drove from Mumbai to Pune late in the evening last week with his family, said there was heavy rainfall throughout which impacted visibility. “Two of the four tunnels on the route were dimly lit with the lights inside being reflected by the drenched road making it difficult to drive,” said Doshi, adding that the ghat section, with multiple twists and turns, was also badly lit and difficult to navigate given the weather.  Businessman A K Menon, who frequently travels between Pune and Mumbai, said that while the tunnels are lit properly, there are times when there is little to no lighting. “The ghat section of the route, which is tricky to navigate, has no streetlights. It is difficult to drive late in the day, especially when it is raining,” said Menon. Suresh Bhor, another businessman who travels to Mumbai three to four times a week, said that he has started going bus lately. “About a month ago while driving back from Mumbai during the rainfall I had a couple of near-misses and found it difficult to drive in the ghat section,” said Bhor, adding that better lighting is required, , especially at tricky junctions. According to an official of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation, which manages the expressway, lights in the tunnels have been installed in a scientific way. “There are three zones in any tunnel—the entry point, middle point and the exit point. The prescribed lux (measure of illumination) levels are maintained,” said the official. “At times, the lights develop snags and the maintenance has to be carried. We are proactive but during maintenance some lights, or a full row, has to be switched off. With frequent rainfall, maintenance work is carried out at all times. ,” said the MSRDC official “The lighting system in the tunnel will be upgraded in the near future so that motorists don’t face problems. Regarding the streetlights, the need has not been felt until now but studies always take place,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/motorists-seek-better-lights-along-eway-inside-tunnels/articleshow/86538027.cms||Joy Sengupta

It has a 10m diving board, and is 50m in length by 25m in width, having a minimum depth of 3ft and maximum depth of 18ft,” said assistant director of sports B Srinivas. “Due to the lack of a functioning swimming pool here, local swimmers who are competing at the national and international level are getting trained in a swimming pool in Harihar, which is a smaller one,” said Laxmana, father of national level swimmer Manikanta L. “There are many talented swimmers in Davanagere, but due to lack of swimming pools, they are not getting the necessary exposure,” said Sundaresh Satyanarayana, the first swimming coach in Davanagere. “Local girl Revathi Nayaka, the daughter of Huchhavvanahalli Manjunath, became an international swimmer, as I coached her,” said Satyanarayana. Davanagere could become a hub for swimmers, if the swimming pool is renovated, he observed. Several aquatic sports events, including water polo, diving and swimming could also be conducted in this pool after its renovation, he added. The renovation of the pool is going on by replacing the tiles and machinery, including pumps, with grants of over Rs 2.5 crore given by the Davanagere Smart City Project Limited. “We are constructing a gym room, balcony, sheets with a truss for spectators gallery, apart from solar roofing, and incorporating advanced technology. The pool will get a facelift by the end of November,” said Smart City project MD Ravindra Mallapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/swimming-pool-in-dgere-closed-since-2015/articleshow/86535889.cms||S A GANGARAJU

Speaking to TOI on Saturday, Karjol lambasted the previous Congress governments charging that they meted out step motherly treatment to the projects in north Karnataka including the Upper Krishna Project. “We need space to store our share of water and for that we must acquire land. Before acquisition, we should provide rehabilitation and resettlement to those who will be evacuated. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who has earlier handled the water resources department is supportive of my ideas,” Karjol said. “The tribunal’s order is yet to be notified in the gazette. The matter is in the Supreme Court and the verdict is expected soon. Hence preparations are on to start works for storing our share of water. When the height of Almatti Dam is increased to 525 meters, about 20 villages will be submerged. We must acquire one lakh acres for the rehabilitation of people from these villages. Hence, the priority is for rehabilitation and resettlement,” Karjol said. The minister said 6,400 acres will be acquired to construct rehabilitation centres for the people of 20 villages that will submerge. Karjol blamed successive Congress governments for the delay in completing UKP works and said the state and central governments run by Congress did not provide adequate funds since 1956. He reminded that people of undivided Vijayapura district had weighed Congress leaders Indira Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Nijalingappa with gold seeking funds for UKP but the Congress governments did not respond. Between 1964 and 1983, only Rs 224 crore was spent on UKP, he said. Revealing statistics, he said the Janata Party government spent Rs 278 crore between 1983 and 1989 while the Congress government spent Rs 836 crore between 1989 and 1994. This was the reason why Karnataka could not utilize 123 TMC feet of water awarded to Karnataka by Bachawat Tribunal, he said. The Brijesh Kumar Tribunal awarded 130 TMC feet of water to Karnataka on December 390, 2010. The BJP government in the state had approved a construction of rehabilitation centres at a cost of Rs 17,207 crore and acquisition of 1,34,000 acres. “Congress leaders had taken out a march from Kudalasangama to Almatti Dam promising funds for UKP did not keep up the promise when the party came to power in 2013. Only Rs 7,728 crore was spent, and 1,967 acres was acquired, Karjol said. The HD Kumarswamy-led coalition government spent Rs 478 crore while the Yediyurappa government spent Rs 1,165 crore, he said, adding that for the third stage of UKP, the Siddaramaiah government spent Rs 5,700 crore, Kumarswamy government Rs 600 crore and Yediyurappa government spent Rs 2,500 crore. Now for third stage of UKP, the estimated cost is Rs 65,000 crore as the project size is increasing with the change in Land Acquisition Act and the Centre has responded positively to our pleas, Karjol said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rehabilitation-is-my-top-priority-in-ukp-karjol/articleshow/86535866.cms||---

The group, known as ‘Taljai Bachav Abhiyan’, claim the project will hamper flora and fauna of the hill and the concrete structures will disturb ecology. Around 2,000 people participated in the campaign and they urged people to give suggestions and objections about the initiative. They have given out forms and letters to express dissent about the proposal. All this will then be submitted to PMC and the demand to cancel the initiative will be made. “The commercial activities planned in the proposed park should be cancelled. Even the idea of constructing different concrete structures should be scrapped,” said the opposing residents. The PMC has finalized the plan of the biggest biodiversity park at Taljai hill. The park, Vasundhara biodiversity park, will come up on 102 acres and will be built at a cost of Rs120 crore. The park will have seven gardens, a ‘Gurukul style school’ and grey water harvesting project. This initiative was approved by the civic standing committee in 2002. As per the civic body’s proposal, a significant stretch of the project land is to be used for developing an Oxygen Park. It also includes small amphitheatres, cultural facilities and a cricket stadium. A Bamboo park, a skateboarding ramp and a rock climbing wall will be made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sign-campaign-against-concreting-on-taljai-hill/articleshow/86538077.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

In a letter to the President, Prime Minister, Union home minister and the chairperson of National Human Rights Commission, IUML MPs ET Mohammed Basheer, Abdul Wahab, MP Abdussamad Samadani and Navas Kani said that the violence that marked the eviction drive by Assam state government on Muslim villagers near Sipajhar town on Thursday in which two persons were killed in police firing was a case of government-sponsored human rights violation. They said that the district administration had handed out eviction notices asking the residents to move out within 12 hours, which was inhuman, arbitrary and violates the principles of natural justice. “The state police did not allow the people even to dismantle their houses on their own and began bulldozing the structures. This angered the residents as they are poor and would not be able to reuse their tin sheds and other materials needed to rebuild their dwellings at the relocated site which led to the shooting and killings by the state,” the letter said. The IUML MPs added that the intervention by the police was pre-planned as there was no provocation from the evictees because they were peacefully waiting for the district administration to allot them a relocation site. “The act of the Assam government, which led to human rights violation, is highly deplorable and reprehensible. Therefore interference of the Union government is highly necessary at this juncture,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-mps-want-centre-to-mediate-in-assam/articleshow/86538096.cms||---

Fresh waterlogging, the residents fear, may undo all their efforts to drain the stagnant water. Areas near Bagjola canal have been the worst affected, with the water flooding the localities. Apart from Shukhobristi, complexes like Elita Garden Vista, DLF Heights New Town and Balaka Abason have been hit by waterlogging. NKDA officials said they were taking all possible preventive measures to tackle the likely recurring waterlogging situation in New Town this week. “Over 100 pumps have been used and all pumping stations have been kept ready for optimal functioning. A sandbag wall has been set up along Bagjola canal to prevent overflowing if heavy rain occurs. All drainage lines are being cleaned up and a control room has been set up for round-the-clock monitoring,” an NKDA official said. The worst affected among the gated communities has been Shukhobristi. “It has been a tough time for residents. Lifts have remained shut and even dialysis patients had to use the staircases. With the forecast of heavy rain, we are tense,” said Mainak Kanrar, a resident. “We were stuck at home, our vehicles were submerged and a few of them were damaged. There was a foul smell on the lower floors due to the stagnant water and residents have been in constant fear of contamination and diseases,” said Souvik Bhattacharya, a resident of Elita Garden Vista. “The entire complex was waterlogged,” said Sameer Sharma, a resident of DLF Heights New Town. Several cooperative housings were also badly affected by waterlogging, power cuts and reservoirs being submerged. “The encroachments along the canal are major problems. We will meet with Rajarhat New Town MLA Tapas Chatterjee on Monday to discuss plans,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-water-yet-to-recede-locals-keep-wary-eyes-on-weather-bulletin/articleshow/86538097.cms||Suman Chakraborti

According to the GP officials, the lake was polluted due the garbage dumped by the villagers and the sewage that enters the water body. Previously called Makkala Katte Kere (Children bund lake), it is one of the oldest lake in the region. Later, it came to be known as Gangappa master lake, named after former president of TMC Gangappa Karkera. During his tenure as the president, he had arranged for de-silting of the lake every year. However, a proposal to set up a garden around the lake never materialised. When several buildings and houses occupied the surrounding area, construction debris continued to be dumped at the lake premises, polluting it further. Due to lack of maintenance, the lake was covered in shrubs and weed. “Nearly 1acre of land surrounding the lake will be developed as a mini garden under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) at a cost of Rs 10 lakh,” disclosed gram panchayat PDO B J Medappa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/gram-panchayat-to-rejuvenate-makkalakatte-kere/articleshow/86536786.cms||---

The sheep were owned by Akkatayamma, who is understandably distraught in the wake of her loss. The members of Akkatayamma’s family woke up to the cries of the sheep wailing in the night, but were too late to save the livestock. Unfortunately, the big cat had killed all the sheep and fled the scene. The villagers are understandably perturbed with the intrusion of the leopard into human habitat. “The leopard entered the shed, and killed the sheep. Killing domestic animals on agricultural fields is really terrifying. Leopards straying this deep inside human habitats is a cause for concern,” said the worried villagers. Akkatayamma urged the forest department to take steps to capture the leopard before it preys on more livestock. She also demanded monetary compensation for the loss she had sustained. Foresters have assured the villagers of placing the cage and capturing the leopard. They cautioned the residents of Ragimuddanahalli to be vigilant, and be wary of their surroundings till the big cat was captured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/leopard-enters-mandya-village-kills-eight-sheep/articleshow/86536921.cms||---

Several low-lying areas in Kawant town were inundated due to which water entered houses in these areas. Residents were forced to move their belongings and furniture to a height as it rained incessantly until noon. Due to fresh inflow of water, Rami dam in the region started overflowing and the road leading to the dam too became inaccessible. Sources said that in the morning half-a-foot of water was flowing above the dam which increased to one foot by evening. District administration warned sarpanch and other officials to alert villagers to not venture near the Heran river. Several check dams too started overflowing due to which roads above them were not motorable. However, two bikers dared to cross a check dam near Samalvant village and got dragged. The duo was saved timely as locals rushed to their help and pulled them out safely along with their vehicles. Authorities said that the district has received 91% of the season’s rainfall due to which seven of the 13 irrigation ponds are completely filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/chhota-udepur-reels-under-wet-spell/articleshow/86537850.cms||---

HIghway Safety Patrol officials from Pune told TOI, “There was no accident, but an influx of vehicles moving from Mumbai to Pune may have caused the situation. Heavy vehicles often move very slowly on an upward gradient from Khandala to Lonavla and this stalls the movement of light motor vehicles like cars and SUVs trailing them.” At times, impatient car drivers tend to overtake the heavy vehicles from either sides and this leads to a choke up of traffic ahead, they added.

---||Kolkata||System weakens but expect heavy rain spells in Kolkata: Met||KOLKATA: As cyclone Gulab headed towards north Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur, threatening to hit land around midnight on Sunday, Kolkata and south Bengal remained unaffected by it. The city, however, is set to receive moderate to heavy rain between Tuesday and Wednesday. Weathermen have sounded a rain alert for Kolkata triggered by a cyclonic circulation that will emerge over northeast and east central Bay of Bengal on Monday. It had been predicted to intensify into a low pressure over the subsequent 24 hours, but has now turned weaker. “The system, however, has been diluted and may not intensify into a low pressure now. It will head northwestwards and could reach the Bengal coast on Wednesday, causing moderate to heavy showers across Kolkata and Gangetic Bengal,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He said that depending on the pace of movement, the system could start having an effect on south Bengal and Kolkata on Tuesday. “We expect moderate to heavy rain either on Tuesday or Wednesday, including an intense spell. Subsequently, the circulation will lose sting and pass away, but light to moderate monsoon rain will continue,” said Das. The city received spells of light rain on Sunday, but they were unrelated to the approaching cyclone, said the Met office. “Local thunderstorms have been striking Kolkata and its neighbouring districts over the last few days and Sunday was no exception,” said an official. Gulab was likely to have a landfall with a wind speed of 75kmph-85kmph, gusting up to 95kmph. The Met office sounded a rain alert for East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas under its impact on Monday. On Tuesday, however, heavy rain has been forecast in Kolkata and south Bengal districts as the cyclonic circulation will hit the coast and approach the city. Squally winds reaching a speed of 30kmph-40kmph have been predicted along the Bengal coast, including in East Midnapore, South 24 Parganas, Jhargram, Howrah, Hooghly and Kolkata. Even if the circulation loses steam, Kolkata may still receive 70mm-110mm rain between Tuesday and Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/circulation-loses-steam-but-showers-to-hit-kolkata-on-tuesday/articleshow/86538128.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Local corporator Ashwini Landge said the work began around mid-September. “Sewage water was entering peoples’ homes. The narrow drainage pipes are now being replaced with bigger ones,” said Landge. The civic administration has already replaced pipes in some crucial stretches to arrest sewage overflow. Local resident Ashok Shinde said that despite repeated repairs, drainage lines were getting choked frequently and there was a risk of mosquito-borne diseases. Corporator Landge said the work was delayed over the past few months due to the pandemic-related restrictions and reduced allotment of funds. “The current work has been taken up using funds under other projects. We want the civic chief to ensure that work such as drainage and water supply are not affected and that adequate funds are available,” said Landge. Bigger drainage pipes will also be laid in New Khadki area in the next few months. Officials said they plan to replace the main pipelines and that work will be done in phases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-starts-replacing-drainage-pipes-in-yerawada/articleshow/86538100.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Over 100 illegal borewells shut down in Delhi, Delhi Jal Board tells NGT||NEW DELHI: Over 100 illegal borewells, which were found to be in use by both industries and residents, were shut down in Mayapuri by Delhi Jal Board (DJB). In a submission to National Green Tribunal (NGT), DJB said 107 out of 141 illegal borewells had been shut down, while an additional five borewells were shut by the residents themselves. The jal board said it would carry out another inspection to shut down 17 ‘missing’ borewells, which they were unable to locate during inspections last year.  DJB had been acting on a 2019 NGT order, which had asked them to take action against all illegal borewells being used for commercial purposes in Mayapuri. In a submission made to NGT last year, officials had said that additional two borewells were found to be operating illegally and they too had been shut down, with fresh inspections carried out this year to identify more such borewells. “During inspections, each borewell was identified and the legal ones were marked. The remainder of the borewells were shut down and an inspection report was submitted to NGT last year,” said a DJB official. More drives would be carried out under each constituency and district to identify borewells extracting water without permission, he added. According to latest data, till August 31, over 11,000 illegal borewells had been shut down across Delhi with fines amounting to over Rs 70 crore. Another 8,426 borewells were yet to be sealed, with drives to continue for the rest of the year. Delhi Pollution Control Committee, too, had made a submission to NGT recently, stating the progress had been slow, owing to the pandemic. According to a data by Central Groundwater Board, from 2005 till 2014 the groundwater table fell by around 2-4 metres in almost every location across Delhi. A large reason for this was illegal extraction of water. Only parts of Delhi — along the Yamuna floodplains, central Delhi, southwest Delhi near Najafgarh and a part of northwest Delhi — showed an increase in the groundwater table, indicating more recharge than extraction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-100-illegal-borewells-shut-down-in-delhi-djb-tells-ngt/articleshow/86538133.cms||---

In a letter sent to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Tariq Anwar and KPCC president K Sudhakaran, Prathapan requests the party leadership to consider the concerns raised by Sudheeran. “A leader like VM Sudheeran is an icon not only for Congress activists but also for the public society of Kerala at large. His presence in Kerala political scenario has been a symbol of political purity, righteousness and corruption-free politics. In my opinion, our efforts to bring new life to our party should be with the guidance of leaders like Sudheeran, whose experience and knowledge will definitely act as catalyst in this process of revamp. A leader like Sudheeran shall not be kept away from the decision making process in the KPCC leadership,” said Prathapan letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sudheeran-issue-prathapan-urges-high-command-to-step-in/articleshow/86538191.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyd confidential||Will Bhagwat replace Anjani? The buzz in IPS circles is that Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat, who has been in the saddle since 2016, is now eyeing the Hyderabad police commissioner’s post. Bhagwat, the grapevine has it, was interested in the intelligence department, anti-corruption bureau and Hyderabad city police chief’s posts. But Anil Kumar has been posted as intelligence chief, and Govind Singh has been given additional charge of ACB. The only plum post for Bhagwat is Hyderabad city police chief if Anjani Kumar is shifted out. There are a few other names doing the rounds to replace Anjani. Let’s see who breasts the tape. Top cops’ reshuffle likely in October While Ganesh immersion process has put the impending IPS transfers on hold in September, officers of various ranks who have been waiting for transfers for a long time are now hopeful that their wishes would be fulfilled in October first week. Prisons DG, Rajiv Trivedi is retiring by the end of September. While 1989 batch officer Umesh Sharraf was already promoted to the rank of DG and posted as commissioner of printing and stationery, 1990 batch officers, Hyderabad CP Anjani Kumar and principal secretary (home) Ravi Gupta, CID chief-cum-DG of ACB, vigilance and enforcement, who are already empanelled to the rank of DG, are on the top of the list to get new postings. Saffron veterans see red over musical chairs Many BJP veterans in Telangana are unhappy with the BJP's top brass for changing chief ministers in Gujarat and Karnataka. Insiders say some seniors, who have fought numerous elections but not won any, are staying away from party activities, including the Huzurabad campaign and Bandi Sanjay's padayatra. Former health minister Eatala Rajender is said to have reported this lack of cooperation to the high command. Booze quota can be muddled with benami trick There is a lot of excitement around the state government’s decision to have reservations for the Goud community (BC), as well as SCs and STs in liquor licences. But there is one concern. It is open secret in the trade that many licence-holders are ‘benamis’ of the rich and politically-connected. Those in the know of things say that many businessmen from the SCs and ST community cannot afford hefty license fees starting at Rs 50 lakh and could be used by politicians with good ground and government connect to keep their grip on the trade. Touch cop ruffles tech city feathers Stephen Ravindra, known as a tough cop, is facing stiff resistance from some in the business lobby in Cyberabad. Within ten days of taking over as Cyberabad police commissioner, he got strict with timings of hotels, restaurants, bars and liquor shops. He also cracked the whip on spas and massage centres. A little birdie tells us some businessmen met a Cabinet minister with a request to shift him out or ask him not to do 'moral policing'. Cabinet’s glass ceiling shattered Minister for women and child welfare and tribal welfare Satyavathi Rathod has become the first cabinet minister to chair a cabinet sub-committee in Telangana. After TRS came into power several dozens of cabinet sub-committees were constituted to look into various issues and women ministers were members of the committees. But for the first time a women minister, that too a tribal, is heading the cabinet sub-committee on Podu lands. Let’s call this a good beginning. Fortune favours a relative There is a buzz in police circles that an officer who is a relative of a key person linked to government, will be appointed as deputy commissioner of police of one of the three zones in Cyberabad, during a reshuffle after the assembly session. This officer, who is already holding a key post, was promoted to SP rank (non-cadre) a few months ago. In the last few years, he has been given important postings in city and talk is that his stars are looking up. Tantrum takes flight, then crash-lands CISF personnel on airport duty are tough nuts to crack. Especially, when it comes to security checks. An IPS officer found this much to his chagrin at the Shamshabad airport recently. Clearly miffed that he was singled out for a bag check, the officer tried to throw his weight around. Nope, no luck. The duty officer did not relent till he was satisfied that the cabin baggage was safe to go onboard. The IPS officer could do little but mutter his displeasure. Guess what goes around, comes around. Tailpiece There is considerable heartburn in the rank and file of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA). With reason too. India will play four Tests, three ODIs and 14 T20I at home this season involving New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies and South Africa. In a clear snub, BCCI has not allotted any match to Hyderabad. It is an indication that HCA needs to get its act together in order to get into the good books of the governing body. While new venues like Nagpur, Ranchi, Indore, Rajkot and Lucknow, or for that matter Visakhapatnam, which gets to host a T20I against Windies, now boast of top-class infrastructure, Hyderabad is clearly lacking. Unveiled in 2005, Uppal stadium is still not a finished product. The canopy at the southern end was blown away by gale in 2019 and is yet to be replaced. Add to this the infighting among office-bearers. All this was not lost on BCCI. There was a time when a match in Hyderabad topped the list of all stakeholders as the hospitality was unrivalled. Alas, what a fall!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-confidential/articleshow/86540281.cms||---

TimesViewWe, too, will have to behave a little more responsibly. Proper disposal of waste is important throughout the year; it becomes even more so during the monsoon.In the last few days, the civic authorities have been working on opening and cleaning the gully pits and drainage lines to ensure that excess storm water gets flushed out after heavy showers. “Kestopur canal has overflowed during heavy rain. The choked drainage lines are adding to the problem,” said a civic official, urging residents not to dump waste on the road. Environment experts said plastic waste is not only choking the drainage lines, but also causing bigger hazards. “It is the non bio-degradable waste which is mostly being dumped, creating a layer of plastic. This is getting converted into micro plastic, which clogs pipelines and eventually becomes toxic and affects the soil layers. Massive awareness among the people is needed to prevent this,” said environment scientist Swati Nandi Chakraborty. “The drainage lines in Salt Lake are straining under population pressure. Moreover, the dumped plastic trash is going into the sewer lines and clogging the drains. It is high time that segregation of bio-degradable and non bio-degradable waste is done properly to prevent this haphazard dumping of waste. A comprehensive plan in this regard is the need of the hour,” said Tamal Pal, a resident of HB Block. BMC authorities said they will be conducting a survey on which areas have witnessed the most waterlogging this monsoon and will look into the existing drainage system of those places to prepare a revamp plan. As for round-the-clock monitoring in the next few days with forecast of heavy rain and a cyclonic circulation, BMC has set up a control room at its headquarters in Salt Lake’s FD Block and has provided a list of officers who can be contacted for specific locations across the township during an emergency. “Our team will be ready to cut and remove trees if they get uprooted on the road and we are also urging residents to stock up on water and other essentials,” said a civic official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plastic-tyres-choke-salt-lake-gully-pits/articleshow/86538161.cms||Suman Chakraborti

After the meeting on the sidelines of UNGA in New York, he tweeted: “A good discussion on the situation in Myanmar with its other neighbour Thailand. Expressed our support for the Asean initiative to Thailand FM Don Pramudwinai.” The talks were held after reports came of scores of Buddhist monks holding protests against the military junta in Yangon on Saturday. The reports quoting local groups said the junta had killed over 1,100 people and arrested over 8,400 in a brutal crackdown on protests. The UN, however, did little more than record Myanmar’s plight, with no agreement on how to move forward. While Asian powers like China, India and Japan are against imposition of sanctions against the ruling regime, western powers are more than happy to slap them. The UN has not yet given Myanmar’s seat to a representative of the military regime. The current envoy, Kyaw Moe Tun, will remain in his position after the UN’s credentials committee deferred a decision on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreign-minister-s-jaishankar-thai-minister-hold-discussions-on-myanmar-crisis/articleshow/86543807.cms||---
---||Goa||Chimbel locals protest axing of trees at historic site||Panaji: Chimbel residents held a peaceful protest outside the Provedoria-run, old age home to oppose the cutting of 30-odd trees at the heritage site for a new project. A few issues about the safety of the existing building and ownership of Provedoria land surfaced at the event. The locals are opposed to axing of decades-old trees, including 20-odd teak and three rain trees, as they say that the old building can be demolished or renovated instead of clearing a part of the green area. With the existing home for the aged abandoned due to its dilapidated condition, the Institute of Public Assistance (IPA) — or Provedoria as it is better known — has issued a tender, to be opened on Monday, for cutting and disposal of 32 trees to make way for a new asylum at site. Various speakers interacting with the media raised the issue of the building’s safety. While the senior citizens have been relocated to another facility, some said that the building is only three decades old. “The building could be renovated with minimal investment instead of wasting money for a new project,” a local activist Tukaram Kunkolkar said. Another resident told TOI that a health centre with an out-patient department is functioning here as also a Covid-19 testing centre. The villagers flayed the government for the lack of transparency about the project. “It is proposed here, but people have not been taken into confidence. Many trees are proposed to be cut, but locals will not allow it,” Rudolf Fernandes, a local politician said. Former MLA Victor GonsaIves alleged that the land on which the project is coming up belongs to Provedoria and not the government, a matter that is being examined, he said. Ane Gracias, a local, alleged that there is no provision for a health centre for Chimbel locals, which could have been easily made in the new project. The site is steeped in history, as a facade of the 18th century chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel still stands at the site. The spot had other institutions, like the first psychiatric care facility, which was later shifted to Altinho.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chimbel-locals-protest-axing-of-trees-at-historic-site/articleshow/86541969.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rain forecast puts Kolkata Municipal Corporation focus on EMB pockets||KOLKATA: Though the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is taking comprehensive measures to prevent severe waterlogging, the focus will be on vast stretches of EM Bypass and the Behala-Joka belt in the wake of a rain alert sounded by the Alipore weather office. The KMC drainage department has been asked to keep ready adequate portable pumps to flush out storm water from large stretches of Mukundapur, Nayabad, Panchasayar, Madurdaha, and parts of Patuli. Residents of these areas experienced a deluge in the beginning of this week. Though the storm water receded a couple of days ago, residents are scared of the rain alert that might inundate these Bypass neighbourhoods again. “We have arranged for portable pumps to flush out storm water from low-lying areas in the event of heavy showers. This will give some relief to residents of Mukundapur, Madurdaha, Panchasayar and Nayabad,” said a KMC drainage department official. However, the official conceded it would be an uphill task to give immediate relief to the residents as these areas don’t have a drainage network. “If it rains heavily on Tuesday, the residents will have to suffer waterlogging for at least a couple of days even if we press into service portable pumps. We also need a prolonged dry spell to flush out storm water,” the official said. Similar arrangements have been made for residents of Joka and low-lying areas of Behala. Keeping in mind the rain alert, the KMC and Kolkata cops have decided to set up some makeshift shelters for residents of remote areas in Garden Reach, Behala, Joka, Garia and Bypass. “If needed, we may have to shift people from low-laying areas to these camps,” an official said. The KMC drainage department is keeping all heavy-duty pumps ready at major drainage pumping stations to drain storm water fast in the event of severe waterlogging. A section of the KMC sewerage and drainage department officials is also worried about perennial waterlogging-prone spots, like Thanthania, Amherst Street, MG Road, Beliaghata, Chittaranjan Avenue, Sukia Street, Bowbazar Street, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road, Bhowanipore, Harish Mukherjee Road, Kidderpore, Gariahat, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens and Golf Green, among others. “Accordingly, we have alerted executive engineers of Ultadanga, Maniktala, Beerpara (Belgachhia), Palmer Bridge (Beliaghata), Thanthania, Ballygunge, Jodhpur Park, Topsia and Mominpore drainage pumping stations. All heavy-duty pumps are ready to drain rain water,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-forecast-puts-kmc-focus-on-emb-pockets/articleshow/86538204.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Dehradun||Given triple talaq, woman refuses to leave home, husband gets child killed to frame mom||Meerut: A man in Uttar Pradesh allegedly “hired” his neighbour to kill his seven-year-old daughter — for Rs 8,000 and free liquor for two days — so he could frame his wife for the child’s murder after she refused to recognise the “triple talaq” he gave her and stayed put in her matrimonial home`. The victim, Saba, was found lying in a pool of blood with her throat slit in Bulandshahr on September 19. Her father, Muzammil Shamad, who runs a cab service in Delhi, was arrested on Saturday along with their neighbour, Amir (identified only by his first name), and her uncle Mudassir Shamad following a complaint by her mother, Shabnam. The accused have been booked for murder and criminal conspiracy among other sections of the Indian Penal Code. The superintendent of police (SP) Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh, told TOI, “During investigation, we found that Saba was held by her uncle Mudassir who attacked her with a hammer while Amir slit her throat. The two had entered the house through the backyard,” The father of the girl stayed in Delhi to ward off suspicion, said the SP. “The accused had met his brother and neighbour earlier this month and wanted to frame Shabnam for the killing of their daughter,” the SP said, adding that they have found Amir’s clothes soaked with the victim’s blood from a nearby field. According to Shabnam, she had married Shamad in 2010 and he had given her triple talaq in 2014. “He gave me the talaq in my absence, rendering it invalid. He remarried the following year and has been trying to make me leave my matrimonial house. He even tried to throw acid on me in 2018, but failed,” Shabnam told TOI. The SP confirmed that Shabnam had filed a complaint about the attempted acid attack in 2018, but admitted that no action was taken against the husband due to “lack of evidence”. The woman also lost her son three years ago and believes her husband had a role to play in the incident. “My husband killed our nine-year-old son as well. He fell from the terrace three years ago, but I believe he was pushed,” she said. Her eldest son stays with his maternal grandparents. “I have lost my children. I have nothing else to lose. I will fight for justice,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/given-triple-talaq-woman-refuses-to-leave-home-husband-gets-child-killed-to-frame-mom/articleshow/86534437.cms||Ishita Mishra

Rajashri Patange (48), who sustained 50% burns to her face, torso and legs, was taken to a hospital where she recorded her statement on Saturday. The police have registered a case of attempt to murder against her brother Shyam Manohar Patange (45). Assistant inspector Sandeep Pawar of the Chatushrungi police said, “Shyam lives with his family in a rented flat at Bibvewadi. Rajashri, who is unmarried and unemployed, stays with her other brother in the Aundh flat which was bought by their father, who passed away a few years ago.” “Shyam wanted to sell his father’s flat and get a share in the money, but Rajashri was not willing to sell the property. Around 12.30pm on Friday, Shyam reached the Aundh flat to discuss the matter but Rajashri turned down his proposal to sell the flat.

This will be the third case against Singh and his accomplices to be probed by the state CID. Earlier, inspector Bhimrao Ghadge’s FIR and builder Shyam Sunder Agarwal’s case registered at Thane and Marine Drive police stations, respectively, were transferred to the probe agency. In the FIR registered in July, Sharad Agarwal, the nephew of Shyam Sunder Agrawal, had claimed that between November 2016 and May 2018, Singh, who was then Thane DCP, and others, in connivance with each other, had initially ‘extorted’ Rs 2 crore from him. He also said that they forcibly made him sign documents to grab his land in Bhayander, which was in the name of his mother, and threatened to book his uncle Shyam Sunder under MCOCA and grabbed his land in Nashik and Sinnar. A police officer said that the demands were made at Singh’s official residence in Kopri’s Bara Bangla area and Punamiya’s Marine Dr-ive flat. Punmiya and Agrawal were business partners and after the latter’s arrest in the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act scam, the police demanded money for his release, it is alleged. Sources said that these cases have been transferred to CID as they are complex and most of the accused are “influential” senior police officers. A total of five FIRs have been registered against Singh and his accomplices so far. Sources said that bookie Ketan Tanna’s FIR and businessman Bimal Agarwal’s FIR too are likely to be transferred to the state CID so that one agency will be able to present all the cases. The government has already appointed special public prosecutor Shekar Jagtap for the state CID. Meanwhile, Punamia has been admitted to a private hospital in Thane after he tested positive for Covid-19. The public prosecutor has filed an appeal against a Thane court’s order for his admission at Jupiter Hospital. “We have challenged his admission to a private hospital as he does not have any other ailment. State-run hospitals, like JJ and St George, are equipped to treat Covid-19, so why should he be treated at a private hospital,” said Jagtap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cid-takes-over-another-probe-against-param-bir/articleshow/86542375.cms||Ahmed Ali

Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane said that the decision was taken after examining the solid waste management system in Indore, which holds the top rank in Swachh Survekshan. According to Dhakane, the civic body wants to improve solid waste management in the residential areas. The tendering process was underway for the same, he said. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said that the initiative was nothing new and it had been carried out in the past as well. “Every time such decisions were taken, there was controversy, and we hope that the civic body maintains extreme transparency in this matter. Some private parties were given the contract for doorstep waste collection in 2017, but the problems related to waste collection are far from over,” he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said that the civic body was going to proceed with its plan of doorstep waste collection regardless of any reservation. “During our drive across four wards, we managed to take the waste segregation to almost 70%. Our focus currently lies on garbage management (collection, transportation, processing and disposal),” he said. Patil added that if the households can segregate wet, dry and hazardous garbage, it would be easier for the municipal corporation to transport the waste to the processing units. He said that this needs to be streamlined and the civic body was working on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doorstep-waste-collection-in-all-32-pcmc-wards-from-sat/articleshow/86538233.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Search conducted by police and locals proved abortive till late evening. Due to warnings for cyclone Gulab and its possible impact on coastal Bengal, East Midnapore District police had issued strict prohibition against bathing in the sea in Digha and maintained vigil along the shore. This group of tourists, who had checked into an Old Digha hotel on September 25, had gone to Talsari, that falls under jurisdiction of Odisha police, to have fun in the sea. As per precautions, hoteliers were told to cancel bookings and tourists in Digha were asked to vacate the hotels. DM of East Midnapore, Purnendu Kumar Maji, said, “This decision was taken for the safety of the tourists. Violent waves had been lashing the beach on Sunday and breached the guard wall to enter Digha town.” BDO of Ramnagar I, Bishnuapada Roy, visited Digha beach to ensure the safety of tourists. DM of South 24 Parganas, P Ulganathan said that they cancelled hotel bookings of tourists in Bakkhali, Gangasagar and Gosaba. “An NDRF team had been deployed in Kakdwip,” Ulganathan said and wanted four more teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-youths-go-missing-in-the-sea-near-digha/articleshow/86538243.cms||Suman Mandal

On August 10, the authority had approved a policy for e-auction of CNG station sites, under which DDA will allot sites to individuals or gas distribution companies or its ‘letter of intent’ holders through the mode of auction on licence basis. The authority believes this will bring in transparency and increase efficiency in the process as earlier, land was allotted for five years and increase in the rates was also uncertain as it was related to average auction rates. Under the new policy, the tenure of the licence is 10 years renewable up to 30 years and an increase in the licence fee is fixed. DDA has also decided to grant a discount of 50% on the value of land in fixing the reserve price to promote green fuel in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-to-conduct-e-auction-of-cng-station-sites-for-the-first-time-in-oct/articleshow/86538335.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As one dose of Covid-19 vaccine is at least required, more students are now on campus after being vaccinated through special camps. Colleges have so far allowed only second and third year UG students and second year PG students to come to the campus for classes. “Only 50% of students are allowed on rotational basis, but within that we are seeing most of them come for classes to college. We have also held Covid-19 vaccination camps and more than 80% of students have been vaccinated at least for the first dose,” said S Vanathi, principal, Sri Meenakshi Government Arts College for Women. With many colleges holding special camps and mega Covid-19 vaccination drives, students have been keen to get vaccinated. “I got vaccinated at the special camp held in our college. It would have been difficult for me otherwise as I come from outskirts of the city,” said K Nithyashri, a second year BSc Physics student. Another third year BSc Zoology student, S Rashmi said that final year students in particular don’t want to miss out on coming to the campus. A T Senthamarai Kannan, treasurer, Madurai Kamaraj, Manonmaniam Sundaranar, Mother Teresa and Alagappa University Teachers’ Association (MUTA) noted that compared to online classes, attendance is higher for offline classes. “Many colleges in the city are even seeing 90% attendance or full strength. However, colleges in rural areas are seeing a less attendance, but it is still more than 60%,” he added. At The American College, which had only around 10% attendance of students for the first few days now has attendance of around 75%. “We are allowing students who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine on campus. Around 80% of students in our college are vaccinated with one dose, while around 20% have got both doses,” said Davamani M Christober, principal of the college. The Lady Doak College meanwhile has been strict on allowing only those who are fully-vaccinated to attend classes on campus. “We have more students coming in than the first few days. However, the number of students on campus is still less than 100. We found that around 50% students are not vaccinated for Covid-19. As more students get their second dose soon, they can be back on campus,” said Christianna Singh, principal. Madurai Kamaraj University registrar (in charge) V S Vasantha said that most of the second year PG students have gradually returned to campus. “We are cautious as well. Some students especially from other states are a little hesitant to come back to stay in hostels,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/attendance-in-colleges-rises-as-more-get-jab/articleshow/86540403.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wet & dry spells may push up vector-borne diseases, fear doctors||KOLKATA: City hospitals have seen a rise in the number of patients with vector-borne diseases, which, healthcare experts feel, could spiral further with intermittent rain and sunshine allowing water to accumulate and serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes. They apprehend that the number of dengue and malaria patients could shoot up in next three to four weeks. A few days ago, dengue had claimed life of a 19-year-old boy, the first death this year, in Kolkata. The state health department has collected some samples for sero-typing to know the strain of dengue in circulation. “Continuous rain does not allow mosquito larvae to settle. But stagnant water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The Aedes aegypti, whose sting causes dengue, needs a little over an inch-deep clean water to breed. Now, this intermittent rain with sunshine in between and cooler temperature will only help in breeding,” said Belle Vue medicine consultant Rahul Jain. Among those admitted to this Minto Park hospital is a 25-year-old from a posh locality in Kolkata. The hospital is currently getting about two patients daily who need admission. “There is a gradual rise in the number affected by mosquito-borne diseases,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. Hospitals last year hardly came across dengue or malaria cases. “Stagnant water in potted plants could be breeding zones. Some mosquitoes can also cause chikungunya,” said Fortis Hospital internal medicine specialist Dibyendu Mukherjee, who is also a professor of medicine at KPC Medical College. “We have five dengue patients admitted daily now, which was not the case even three weeks ago,” said Subhasish Datta chief general manager (operations) at Ruby Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wet-dry-spells-may-push-up-vector-borne-diseases-fear-doctors/articleshow/86538283.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kochi||Coffee growers in Kerala expect better crop||KOCHI: The coffee growers in Kerala are expecting a good crop this year. According to the post-blossom estimate of the coffee board, coffee production in Kerala will go up from 69,100 tonne during coffee year 2020-21 to 70,570 tonne in coffee year 2021-22. “We are expecting the next coffee year’s crop also to be slightly higher,” said Prasanth Rajesh, president, Wayanad Coffee Growers’ Association. Wayanad accounts for almost all of the coffee production in Kerala with 59,320 tonne expected to be produced during tAhe coffee year 2021-22. Travancore area is expected to produce 8,550 tonne and Nelliampathy is expected to grow 2,700 tonne of coffee during the period. Recently, coffee prices have gone up slightly. “Prices have increased from the comparatively dismal figures, but still we have reached only the five-year-old price levels. During the last harvest season of January-February, the prices had been down at Rs 115 per kg,” Rajesh said. Currently, the prices of beans stand at Rs 135 per kg. “This is because of frost in Brazil and Covid in Vietnam,” he added. The International Coffee Organization had noted, “In August 2021, coffee prices recorded the tenth consecutive month of increase, sparked by concerns of oversupply, due to climate adverse conditions in major producing countries and increasing freight costs coupled with Covid-19 lockdown restrictions disrupting trade flows in Asia”. Concerns over the size of the next Brazilian crop, exacerbated by the recent frost, have led to record high volatility of the spot and futures prices, ICO’s report added. Coffee planters are disturbed by the scarcity of fertiliser in the Indian market — they mainly depend on urea and potash. “Most of the potash is imported and part of the urea is manufactured here,” Rajesh said. According to him, the scarcity started a month ago, post-monsoon. Currently, it is the time for fertilisers and the next round comes after the harvest. “Fertiliser used now will help the bean growth of the current crop and the growth of the branches of the next crop,” he added. Coffee farmers’ community in Kerala are disturbed by the step-motherly attitude shown by the coffee board towards them. “A few days ago, the Union commerce minister visited coffee board’s office in Bengaluru, but only the Karnataka farmers were invited for a discussion with him. We came to know about the meeting only when the farmers shared the photos of their interaction with the minister on social media,” they complained on conditions of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/coffee-growers-expect-better-crop/articleshow/86536148.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Nagpur||Two contrasting worlds, six-hour gruelling walk apart||Nagpur: Last week, when his 12-year-old daughter Muri had high fever and swelling, Pandru Pungati of Metawada village in Chhattisgarh decided to rush her to a hospital. The nearest was a primary health centre (PHC) at Laheri village, 30km away in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district. The only means to reach there was on foot. Pandru made a rudimentary stretcher with bamboo sticks. The family set out for the six-hour journey on foot, with his wife also cradling their five-month-old daughter in her arms. “They started at 10 in the morning and reached by 4 in the afternoon,” says Dinesh Timma, Pandru’s relative in Laheri. Even others come the same way, as there is no road between the two villages. There is no hospital close to Metawada and nearby villages. “People there requiring medical help have to walk down to Maharashtra,” says Timma. Pandru’s village is in Narayanpur district in the Abujhmadh pocket, known to be a Maoist stronghold and an area cut off from the rest off the world. He can only speak Madiya, a local tribal language, and Timma translates his answers. Timma, at Laheri, was able to quickly send the family’s pictures on WhatsApp and also made a video call. “Yes, I have an Android phone,” he says. Just 30km away, his kin Pandru, around 40 years old, lives in a different world. He does not have even a basic phone. For many like him coming to Laheri, a remote area even by Vidarbha standards, means reaching the modern world. Narayanpur district collector Dharmesh Sahoo admitted that the area remains largely inaccessible due to the Maoist presence. “A 30km highway connecting the area with Gadchiroli in Maharashtra was planned long ago, but the work could never take off. Even the survey has not been done yet,” he says. “The presence of Maoists keeps the government machinery away, due to which none of the facilities like a hospital could be built over the years. The ground reality cannot be denied,” says Sahoo. The nearest hospital on the Chhattisgarh side for the villages here is 46km away. This makes Gadchiroli closer and people walk through a forested patch. “Even entering the area needs permission from the collector,” says Sahoo. Metawada is a village of 5 to 6 homesteads. The families cultivate their land for a living but they don’t even have bullocks. They simply dig the fields with hand and sow the seeds. “There is no power either nor a school close by,” says Timma, translating Pandru’s answers. Homes are lit with solar lamps. Pandru, however, has an Aadhaar card and knows who is the state’s chief minister. Timma adds that another woman had also come down to Laheri for treatment. With Muri quite healthy now, the family plans to return soon. “We will walk down. Muri too can walk down the road,” say Pandru and adds there are wild animals on the way, they were lucky to have only come across snakes while reaching Laheri. Muri has never been to a school. “There were plans to send her to one but it was shut due to Covid,” says Timma. The collector says there is an Ashram Shala for a group of villages but not a government school. The primary health centre (PHC) at Laheri, which is a lifeline for Chhattisgarh villages, also caters to a population of over 10,200 from 42 villages in Gadchiroli itself. For most of the year, the PHC remains cut off by a rivulet, Gunder nullah, over 1.5km from the clinic. “During rains, the PHC can only be reached by boats. Thankfully this year, it’s not the situation. In winters, a makeshift bridge is made on which vehicles cannot ply. Only in summers can we crossed on a bike,” says Dr Mahendra Jamdade of Laheri PHC. Even after crossing the nullah, patients and even health workers have to reach villages after walking as much as 10-15km in some cases. “On humanitarian grounds, even villagers from Chhattisgarh are attended,” says Jamdade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-contrasting-worlds-six-hour-gruelling-walk-apart/articleshow/86538285.cms||Shishir Arya

The deceased have been identified as Karthik (22), hailing from Pudukkottai and Salim Khan (26) hailing from Tirunelveli. Three other labourers, Thankaraj, Jeeva and Ganesh were injured and are being treated at a hospital. The condition of Ganesh is said to be serious. The accident happened around 7.45am when the precast concrete beams and slabs were being assembled at the fourth floor of the building. While the slabs were being put in place over the beams using a crane, a temporary support pillar gave way following which the slabs collapsed over the two deceased. Fire force personnel had to cut the concrete slabs to extricate the bodies. The rescue works were conducted by personnel who arrived from Beach fire station and Vellimadukunnu. Karthik was pronounced dead on arrival at Kozhikode medical college hospital while Salim died at a private hospital. A Tamil Nadu-based company was undertaking the construction of the building belonging to a textiles retailer based in Thrissur. Police have registered a case in connection with the mishap and Kozhikode corporation has ordered to stop the building’s construction works after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/2-killed-as-concrete-slab-falls-at-work-site/articleshow/86538286.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: How far does Rs 50,000 go? A lot, if you ask Covid widows||MUMBAI: Half a lakh rupees in compensation for the next of kin of those who died of Covid may seem too little, but it will help many families to at least float for some time. "Every day has been a struggle since my husband died. For families like us who are living a hand-to-mouth existence, any relief would be a big help,” said Ishrat Shiekh, a 38-year-old mother of three who lost her husband to Covid last year. She was unaware of the recent decision of granting relief to families like hers from the State Disaster Response Fund. Ishrat's husband Shaukat Ali, a Unani practitioner who was 45, died last June. Ali had come to Mumbai nine years ago from UP to build a better life for his family. During the pandemic, he stayed back in Mumbai and sent his family to their native place. After he caught Covid, he struggled to find timely and appropriate care, running from one hospital to the next, before succumbing to the infection. His employer had promised to help with money or a job, but nothing has materialised yet, Ishrat said. Ali was keen on their elder daughter pursuing a degree in Unani and was saving for it. Since his demise, Ishrat has had no choice but to dip into their savings. With the state's relief of Rs 50,000, she wants to admit her younger children to better schools. There could be a catch, though. Till now, she has not looked at his medical papers or even his death certificate. “I am not sure if it mentions Covid," she said, visibly stressed. While the idea of financial relief has been welcomed, public health researcher Ravi Duggal said that real compensation should be based on loss of earning members and this would mean many times more funds. “Given the 4.5 lakh officially recorded deaths at present, this would mean Rs 2,250 crores,” he said. In Maharashtra, the number of confirmed deaths is 1,38,870. Duggal expressed concerns over the fulfilment. “I think it is a political gimmick for oncoming elections and may not actually happen as was the case with insurance cover for health workers,” he said.  Khar resident Srikant Mhatre who lost his 57-year-old father to Covid said they don’t have a confirmed report and he could never get a hospital bed so they didn't have a confirmed diagnosis either. “Would we still be eligible for the amount?” he wondered. A state official said that the decision has just been passed and it may be a month or more before detailed instructions about implementation arrives. The family of Zabir Usmani (51), an alternative medicine practitioner who died of Covid last May, said they were given Rs 5 lakh by the 108 ambulance service, for which Usmani worked. His son Adil (18) said any compensation was welcome as Usmani was the sole earning member of a family of five.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-how-far-does-rs-50000-go-a-lot-if-you-ask-covid-widows/articleshow/86542060.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The mahapanchayat was called by Gathwal Khap and Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti (HMKS), which has extended its support to three contentious agriculture laws brought by the BJP-led Central government. Gathwal Khap chief Chaudhary Rajendra Mallik had distanced himself from the recent mahapanchayat called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on September 5 in Muzaffarnagar. “A 112-like emergency service should be launched to tackle the issue of stray cattle. It is a big concern for the farmers in western Uttar Pradesh,” Malik said while addressing the crowd. He added, “Electricity prices have gone up. Connections of those farmers who are unable to pay the bills are being snapped. Prices of sugarcane have also not increased for the last four years.” Meanwhile, even as the mahapanchayat was in progress, the UP government announced a hike of Rs 25/quintal in MSP of sugarcane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mahapanchayat-in-up-demands-emergency-helpline-to-deal-with-stray-cattle/articleshow/86536181.cms||Mohd Dilshad

MTDC officials said the events are based on UNWTO‘s theme for World Tourism Day 2021 (September 27) which is Tourism for Inclusive Growth. They will also be collaborating with other professionals from the tourism industry to adapt to the changes brought on by the pandemic. “World Tourism Day is an opportunity for all tourism-related businesses to reflect on how they can be more inclusive when tourism resumes post pandemic. Inviting tourists to listen to their ideas on how the industry can improve will help us to overcome stalemate. Social media will also be used to reach as many people as possible and to spread the concept of inclusive growth,” said Deepak Harane, regional manager (Pune), Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation. Among online activities, a webinar has been organized in association with Telang College of Hotel Management, Pune, and Shivaji University, Kolhapur, on the revolution of the tourism industry post the pandemic.

Headed by deputy commissioner of police Sarang Awad, the traffic police have approached the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to close the punctures in the road dividers. Traffic cops told TOI that apart from traffic congestion, these road cuttings are also contributing to minor and sometimes, major accidents too. According to them, most of the roads in the city have been widened and also have proper dividers. In proportion to the rising population in the city, the number of vehicles plying on city roads too has increased considerably. Punctures in road dividers are being used as short-cuts by many, the traffic cops observed. Even the road cutting in the divider of the Sakkardara flyover ramp on Umred Road side too is facing similar problems. The study also found the road cutting between Mate Chowk to RPTS is also an accident-prone spot apart from creating congestion. Citing an example, traffic cops pointed out that the cutting in the road divider near Bharat Nagar turning point on busy Amravati Road has literary become an accident-prone zone. On this road, many motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, on either side of the road suddenly take a U-turn and cause mishaps. The road cutting near Baidyanath Square has become prone to traffic congestion with private buses operating from nearby places and unruly autorickshaws. To avoid the detour route, private buses use this cut quite often and it has become a chockablock spot, traffic cops said. Similar is the situation at two more spots on the stretch from Jadhav Square to Agyaram Devi Square. With stops of private buses on this stretch, dividers were punctured at two places on a small stretch leading to chaos, the study added. The study even pointed out the need to close the puncture on the nner Ring Road near the Gorewada gate. The road cutting near Santra Market Metro station is also contributing to the jam on the already congested stretch. Traffic cops also pointed out how trees planted on the dividers too are contributing to accidents. “In many places like Civil Lines, Ramdaspeth, Ravi Nagar etc, the NMC has planted trees on the dividers. Though the plants on the dividers save motorists from the glare of the high beam headlight from oncoming vehicles, they also obstruct the visibility of drivers near the punctures in the dividers, which result in accidents,” the traffic police said. NMC’s traffic engineering department will now conduct a spot inspection and then take a decision to close the punctures in the road dividers at 22 different places in the city.

These schools are managing the SPC operations with financial contributions from teachers, parents and teachers association (PTA) and well-wishers. Nearly 10,000 SPC cadets in these schools are affected by the fund shortage and the government is yet to take any action to resolve it. Due to lack of funds, even the routine activities like parades, training, etc, are not happening in these 115 schools. Moreover, additional activities to be carried out as part of social service and public awareness too do not happen in most schools. The aided schools which started the SPC project since 2014 are the most affected. However, schools which had SPC before 2014 face no fund crunch. A coordination committee, formed by the 115 community police officers, who are the teachers in-charge of SPC in each school, has informed the state government seeking immediate help but no positive steps have been taken so far. Anoob John, coordinator of the committee, said that when SPC project was started in aided schools in 2014 the government announced that Rs 5 lakh would be allotted for each school for the operations of SPC units for the next two years and additional funds would be allotted subsequently. But even after seven years the funds are not allotted. “Community police officers often have to spend money from their pockets and seek the help of PTA, management, etc, to meet the expense of routine operations. Around Rs 2.5 lakh is need every year for the operations like distribution of uniforms, conducting parades and camps, providing food on each parade-day, special classes by the experts, etc. Without government’s support the project will fail to serve its purposes,” said John.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fund-crunch-hits-spc-units-in-schools/articleshow/86538364.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||UP ATS arrests three aides of cleric Siddiqui in conversion case||MEERUT: The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has arrested three aides of Meerut cleric Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui on Sunday for allegedly assisting him in running the “biggest religious conversion syndicate” in the country. The ATS claimed that bank transactions worth Rs 20 crore were found linked with the men involved in the syndicate and they have failed to provide a detailed account. Inspector general of police, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswamy, who is spearheading the probe, said that names of the three accused surfaced during questioning of Siddiqui. “We arrested Idris Qureshi, Saleem and Kunal Ashok alias Atif from Lucknow,” said Goswamy. The officer said that probe into the accounts of Siddiqui, who was arrested on September 22 and is on a 10-day custody remand, has revealed that apart from Rs 1.5 crore illegally routed through Bahrain and Rs 3 crore from other Gulf nations, a sum of Rs 20 crore has been received by the trusts operated by the cleric. Goswamy further said that Atif got in touch with Siddiqui due to “temptation to take the Medical Council of India (MCI) examination, but for the last two years was working with him”. He also said that accused Atif was converted during his medical studies while living in Russia and was running a medical clinic in Nashik “illegally”, after he failed to pass the MCI examination. “During the course Atif used to try to convert patients and had Siddiqui's support,” said the IG. The IG said that Qureshi collected funds for the past 20 years for a madrassa run by Siddiqui and is also actively involved in the seminary’s operation. “The above madrassa is the centre of conversion of Siddiqui,” said Goswamy. It also surfaced in the probe that in the last three months, Qureshi has built a residential house of about Rs 60 lakh in Muzaffarnagar and has acquired a motorcycle which is said to be worth about Rs 2.5 lakh, in “contrast to his earnings”. The 64-year-old Siddiqui had shot to fame last year after solemnising the wedding of actor Sana Khan. A statement from ATS makes a mention of a dozen Youtube videos that allegedly have "hateful speeches". The ATS has, so far, arrested 10 people, including Head of Islamic Da’wah Centre Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam, from different parts of the country. It claimed that "more than 1,000 vulnerable individuals have been converted with the promise of jobs or by inciting hatred”, and foreign funds were directly involved.

The supply cut from 10am on Monday to 4pm on Tuesday will impact supply in Vidyadhar Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Harmada, Murlipura, Vishwakarma and Ambabadi. Public health and engineering department (PHED) said a population of more than 5 lakh will face water crisis. PHED officials, however, said supply would be done through tankers. Additional chief engineer of PHED Manish Beniwal said, “Maintenance and cleaning will be done at the storage and pump house at Amanishah headworks. Apart from this, there is leakage at some places in the pump house as well, which made it necessary for repairs. We will be supplying through tankers and will try to minimise any kind of problem faced by the public.” Normal supply will resume from September 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/water-supply-to-be-hit-in-city-today-tomorrow/articleshow/86540465.cms||---

---||Patna||Centre should reconsider its caste census decision: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Reiterating his demand for a countrywide caste census, CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday said it is the need of the hour and the Centre should reconsider its decision against it. “Caste census is in the interest of the country,” he said. The Centre, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court recently, virtually ruled out holding a caste census. Nitish said the matter in the apex court was was not directly related to the caste census. “It is related to the socio-economic caste census-2011,” he pointed out. Talking to reporters after participating in a review meeting on left wing extremism with Union home minister Amit Shah at Delhi, Nitish said caste census is pro-development and it will help policymakers frame targeted welfare policies for the backward castes. The CM said a delegation of 10 political parties from Bihar had met PM Narendra Modi and explained everything to him in favour of the caste census. To a query whether he would hold a caste census in Bihar, Nitish said he would convene an all-party meeting in the state to decide the future course of action on the issue. “The state legislature has already passed a resolution in favour of holding a nationwide caste census,” he said. Asked whether JD(U) would continue in the government if the Centre refused to hold a caste census, Nitish said, “It is not proper time to speak on it.” When his attention was drawn to Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren’s meeting with home minister Shah on the issue in the evening, Nitish said, “This is the demand of all the states.” When asked whether he would tour the country and unite all parties on the issue, the Bihar CM said, “It is a different subject.” Rejecting the BJP leaders’ arguments that a caste census would not be feasible because the country has thousands of castes and their sub-castes, Nitish said it could be done by properly training the enumerators about different aspects of castes and sub-castes. “During the house-to-house enumeration, if someone tells his sub-caste, the trained enumerators will include him with his actual caste by verifying from his neighbours. The caste census can be accurately done by imparting proper training to all the personnel involved in the exercise,” Nitish said and added: “It’s not a proper argument that caste census is not possible because the findings of the socio-economic caste census-2011 was not accurate.” Earlier, on August 23, an 11-member delegation from Bihar led by Nitish had called on PM Modi and demanded caste census across the country along with the census-2021. The issue was revived in July this year after the Union government informed the Lok Sabha that it would not enumerate the population on caste basis, except the SCs and STs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-should-reconsider-its-caste-census-decision-nitish/articleshow/86538358.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Jaipur||Residents feel metro phase-2 can reduce traffic chaos in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Despite spending crores of rupees for preparing the detailed project report (DPR), the state government has been sitting over the Jaipur Metro phase-II project for over seven years now. The project was proposed to improve traffic on Tonk Road. In the absence of mass public transport, traffic conditions have deteriorated and the city remains unprepared to ferry common people including students. Many students who appeared for REET say a proper Metro connectivity would have been helpful. “Chandrika Kanwar, an aspirant said, “Most of the buses were full and we had to walk for a long time to reach home. I live in Barkatnagar with my sister and my centre is in VKI. A proper transport system would have been beneficial for us.” Commuters using cars on arterial roads believe they can switch to Metro if proper connectivity is provided. cmmuter Imran Khan said, “I have a garage in Ambabari. I face long jams in the evening. A Metro is need of the hour as traffic in the city has increased manifold.” A survey conducted by Jaipur Metro Rail Corporation (JMRC) in 2018 revealed that the city has 470 cars per thousand people, the need for Metro trains on this route is increasing. A JMRC official said, “The average travel speed has dropped to less than 20 kmph. The average travel speed in non-commercial areas of city came down from 28 kmph in 2009 to 18 kmph in 2018.” In absence of efficient public transport system, thousands of office goers and residents have switched to other means of transport, resulting in a cascading drop in public transport share in the city. A retired JDA engineer, who wished not to be quoted said, “About 890 vehicles are added to city roads every day. The public transport share that was around 31% in 2009 has fallen to 18% in 2018. The government should soon work on constructing a Metro.” Metro on Tonk Road is the need of the hour as the peak hour per direction traffic (PHPDT) is around 20,500 vehicles for the proposed corridor. The survey conducted also reads that once the corridor is constructed, it would ferry 3.75 lakh commuters. Moreover, the Metro corridor would avoid emission of at least 5.6 lakh tonnes. According to experts, the extension of the Metro corridor is essential for increasing ridership. Over the past three years, the JMRC has extended the corridor by approximately 3 km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/residents-feel-metro-phase-2-can-reduce-traffic-chaos-in-city/articleshow/86540487.cms||---

Jailor Mrityunjay Kumar Pandey said that there is a great demand for these attractive idols and diyas, as they have received around 10,000 orders from Amazon in view of the festive season ahead. These orders will be completed by the inmates in 20 days. The Dyvigya Care Wellness Foundation has been assisting the inmates. Moradabad district jail superintendent Viresh Raj Sharma said, “Currently, around 20 women inmates have been preparing the idols and diyas, but considering the appreciation and huge demand, more women inmates will be roped in to ensure that the demands are met in time. These items are made using a mixture of cow dung, fuller’s earth and a few other ingredients.” “The mixture is then put into moulds and left to dry. Once fully dry, the idols and diyas are coloured,” added the jail superintendent. “Recently, there has been a huge demand for these idols from Surat. As more and more orders are coming, more inmates will be joining to prepare these. At present, 130 women inmates are lodged in the jail and of these, 20 have been working on preparing the idols,” said director of the foundation, Gauri Jain. According to the jail authorities, both Hindu and Muslim inmates have come together to work for promoting the eco-friendly initiative. Some of these are Renu, Momina, Shabina, Rani, Qamar Jahan, Manju and Sonam. Jailor Pandey said, “Opening of bank accounts for these women is in process, so that they can receive their earnings.” The diyas are sold for Rs 2.5 apiece. The idols being prepared range from six to sixteen inches, small ones being sold for Rs 251 each, and the big ones for Rs 3,100. “The inmates have been making these idols for the past two months, and so far around 2,000 idols and diyas have been made by them,” said jail superintendent Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-inmates-in-mbad-jail-make-lakshmi-ganesh-idols-diyas-using-cow-dung-receive-orders-through-amazon/articleshow/86536285.cms||Maria Khan

It will be released in Amangarh tiger reserve (ATR), said Devmani Mishra, Amroha's district forest officer. Residents said some 15 days ago, they had spotted a pair of leopards lurking in the cane fields. They were frightened as the big cats lifted several dogs in the village, they said. On being informed, the forest authorities set up a cage in the cane field. It took 10 days for the department personnel to capture the three-year-old leopardess. DFO Mishra said, "Our staff has caught two big cats in the last 15 days. Earlier, a leopard was caught from Sunpura village and set free in the ATR.” The sugarcane fields of Bijnor, Moradabad and Amroha districts have turned into habitats of the leopards. There are an estimated 100 leopards living in the cane fields of Bijnor district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/leopardess-evades-capture-for-10-days-trapped/articleshow/86536257.cms||Harveer Dabas

To start with, the CM handed over the letters to one farmer and a farm labourer’s family at their respective homes in Bathinda district. The jobs have been provided to farm labourer Natha Singh, whose younger brother Sukhpal Singh (30) of Mandi Kalan village had died during the protest on March 31. The second letter was provided to farmer Gurmail Singh of Chauke village as his only son Jashanpreet Singh (18) had died at Tikri border on January 2 this year. Earlier the outgoing CM was to hand over appointment letters to kin of farmers at a state-level function at Barnala on September 20, but he submitted resignation on September 19, the said programme was cancelled. Channi accompanied by deputy CM Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on his visit to the villages of Bathinda to take stock of the pest attack on cotton crop. He expressed solidarity with the families of the deceased farmers, who lost their lives during agitation against farm laws, and stated the appointment letters to all beneficiaries would be provided soon. Natha Singh said. “As per the announcement made by the state government, we have already got financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh, which is being utilised to rebuilt our dilapidated house, and we have got the job letter.” Reiterating his government’s firm commitment to oppose these anti-farmers laws, Channi said his government would not allow these laws to be implemented in the state and Punjab assembly had already rejected these laws because they were primarily aimed at ruining the farmers just to pursue the vested interests of big industrialists and corporate houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kin-of-dead-farmers-get-job-letters/articleshow/86540511.cms||Neel Kamal
---||India||PM Modi: UPI transactions making economy more transparent||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modion Sunday said growing volume of UPI transactions was making the economy more transparent and helping boost fin-tech. In his monthly radio broadcast Mann ki Baat, he also nudged Indians to buy khadi, handloom and handicraft products during the festival season as part of his push for local items. “…we can say with satisfaction today that our young generation is giving khadi the place of pride that khadi had during freedom struggle. Today the production of khadi and handloom has increased multiple times and its demand too has increased,” he said. The sectors are seen to be massive employment generators with handcrafts alone employing an estimated 69 lakh workers with the handloom sector providing another 35 lakh jobs to weavers and allied workers. The handloom sector accounts for nearly 15% of the cloth produced in the country. Similarly, the khadi and village industry units employ over 1.5 crore workers and artisans. Over the last few years, the Prime Minister has been pushing for khadi and other products, which many believe has helped boost their sales. The sale of khadi products for instance shot up from Rs 1,170 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 3,527 crore last year. Pointing to the Rs 355 crore UPI transactions in August, the PM said: “Today, because of this the rightful money of the poor is getting credited directly into their accounts and because of this, obstacles like corruption have reduced very significantly. It is true that technology can help a lot in economic cleanliness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-upi-transactions-making-economy-more-transparent/articleshow/86543855.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Heritage panel to fund author Toru Dutt’s grave restoration||KOLKATA: Author Toru Dutt’s grave at the Maniktala Christian Cemetery, whose appalling condition was highlighted by TOI recently, will soon get restored. The West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) has agreed to the request of Bishop Paritosh Canning, who heads CNI in Kolkata that looks after the cemetery, to provide funds for its restoration. The Bishop on Thursday has permitted the WBHC to put up a plaque in the memory of the Dutt sisters. In a letter addressed to WBHC, Canning has also requested WBHC to send its representatives to the cemetery on Monday to choose the site for its plaque installation in the presence of Raghab Naik, secretary of the Diocesan Property Committee, and Sanchita Biswas, secretary of the Maniktala Christian Cemetery Board. Dutt, regarded as India’s Keats, was the first Indian woman to write prose and poetry in both English and French. The author of ‘Le Journal de Mademoiselle d’Arvers’, ‘Sheaf Gleaned in French Fields’ and ‘Ancient Ballads and ‘Legends in India’ is buried at the Maniktala Christian Cemetery along with her father Govin Chunder, mother Khetramoni, elder sister Aru and younger brother Abju. Incidentally, Rome’s Non-Catholic Cemetery, also known as the Protestant Graveyard, is the final resting place of Keats (1795-1821). His gravestone, inscribed with the immortal words ‘Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water’, draws tourists from across the world. Dutt’s grave, in contrast, is a shameful picture of neglect that has long upset litterateurs who insist on its regular maintenance. In the letter, the Bishop has highlighted the “terribly dilapidated condition” of the cemetery and the need for funds. “The boundary wall is broken and there is rampant encroachment from the local people, who desecrate this holy ground with impunity. The grounds have overrun with weeds and bushes, and the path through the cemetery, needs fresh paving. There is also a need for proper electric lighting, throughout the cemetery as well as regular water supply, neither of which is currently available,” his letter mentions. Reacting to it, WBHC chairperson Suvaprasanna told TOI on Friday, “On Monday, conservation architect Partha Ranjan Das and members of WBHC will go to the cemetery to get an idea of the funds required for restoration. That will be disbursed soon so that restoration work begins at the earliest. I have also got in touch with author Chinmoy Guha for writing the text of the plaque.” Biswas called this an “encouraging” development. “On Monday, we will identify the location where the plaque will be placed. We are looking forward to a partnership with the Commission so that we can turn this place into an international tourist destination,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-panel-to-fund-toru-dutts-grave-restoration/articleshow/86538437.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Cybercrooks fleece Rs 9.18 crore from hapless targets so far in this year||Pune: There was a sharp rise in the amount lost by victims of cybercrime this year when compared to last year, as per the city cyber police. Till the first week of September, 42 cases were registered with the cyber police in which the complainants reported total losses of Rs9.18 crore. In 2020, 46 cases were registered, but the amount lost was nearly two-thirds lower at Rs3.2 crore, as per data available with the police. Cyber police said sharing ATM card credentials and one-time passwords was among the most common cause of the fraud, followed by fraudulent business offers, fake insurance and gift-related frauds. Deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake said most cybercrime can be avoided if people exercised more caution while using netbanking or Uniform Payments Interface (UPI) applications. Cyber police inspector D S Hake said the rise in the amount lost can be attributed to the increased usage of smartphones. “While looking at their screens, people are more prone to clicking on links to unsafe websites. Secondly, people also share ATM card or bank credentials with strangers without giving it a second thought,” Hake said. In most cases, Hake said, the victims trust the digital/virtual identity presented by the crook posing as a friend or an acquaintance. “They share their bank account credentials, UPI application details or debit/credit card information, assuming they were interacting with a friend or relative. In many cases, people fall prey to online business deals and transfer money to the suspect’s account without background checks,” he further said. “This year, most victims have fallen prey to gift baits and lost a whopping Rs4.42 crore, while last year, people lost a total of Rs1.83 crore after sharing their debit/credit card credentials,” Hake said. “Similarly, people have also fallen prey to herbal oil fraud cases — crooks floating fake business schemes — and lost Rs1.27 crore to fraudsters,” he said. Police have received over 350 complaints of sextortion this year, though the collective amount extorted by the crooks was just Rs 84,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cybercrooks-fleece-rs-9-18-crore-from-hapless-targets-so-far-in-this-year/articleshow/86538409.cms||---

The principal, Deepmala Pandey, was joined in her effort by 350 teachers across the state. The turning point for Pandey as an educator had come in 2018 when she met Anmol (who uses his first name), a mute student with learning difficulties, who had enrolled at her institution. “When I saw his eagerness to come to school and learn things, I became more sensitive towards children with special needs like him. I realised many students like him are never sent to school by parents who think they can’t learn. I decided to change that attitude,” the 38-year-old, who heads the primary school in Dabhora Gangapur, told TOI. Pandey started travelling to villages in Bareilly, talking to parents, urging them to send disabled children to school. When the pandemic broke out last year, the schools shut down, but Pandey decided to scale up her mission which she named in ‘One Teacher, One Call’. The principal started posting regular updates on social media about the initiative which inspired 350 teachers from various districts such as Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Farrukhabad and Ayodhya to join in. A total of 600 students with varying levels of disabilities have been enrolled in schools since then, said Pandey. The teachers visited students' homes during the pandemic to check their progress and to help parents set up online classes for them, said Pandey. But getting children to school is just half the battle won. Teachers need special training to cater to students with different needs. “We have special educators that instruct teachers on special teaching techniques. We also keep abreast of the latest teaching methods on the internet. We also implemented a STEM learning method which is about learning something by doing it,” said Pandey. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi heaped praises on Pandey in his ‘Mann ki Baat’. “This unique effort in Bareilly is showing a new path to divyang children. This campaign is being led by the principal of a school in Dabhaura Gangapur, Deepmala Pandey ji. During the corona period, due to this campaign, not only did the admission of a large number of children become possible, more than 350 teachers have also joined it with a spirit of service,” he said. The PM added that every such effort in the field of education is “going to shape the future of our country.” Pandey said she was “overwhelmed” with the congratulatory messages that followed. “I never expected recognition from PM Modi. The credit goes to all the teachers.” Parents, meanwhile, said Pandey has brought hope to their lives.

Kamat has stated that the public works department (PWD) and the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) have ignored this aspect for long. The council member has said that photographs of poor conditions of roads in rural and urban areas have emerged this year and, on the face of it, it appears that the erosion and formation of potholes could be due to poor drainage and bad workmanship. However, Kamat has said that in the coastal regions of the South Asian countries, there is increasing recognition given to the new factor that is leading to quick deterioration of roads. Acidity of the rainwater and presence of dissolved sea salts like various chlorides and sulphates have been recognised as a reason, Kamat has said. “Both acidic rainwater and salts like chlorides and sulphates interfere with the asphalt used in road construction. PWD has never cared to find out the chemical quality of rainwater falling on the road surfaces. Therefore, I urge your government to immediately undertake a proper technical study of this issue,” the scientist has said. Kamat has said that climate change should also be considered as a factor. “With climate change, industrial pollution and dust entering the west coast from deserts in the Middle East, the poor chemical quality of rainwater, the old methods of road construction and maintenance won’t work. I submit that the same old composition of asphalt would not work,” said Kamat. An acid and salt-resistant special asphalt mixture should be used for post-monsoon repairs of all the eroded and damaged roads and in construction of the new roads, Kamat has suggested. “The effect of corrosive rainwater is more intensive on the Atal Setu. Therefore, we see the deterioration of its asphalted roads. GSIDC, which has hired IIT Chennai to offer consultancy to study the deterioration, needs to get examined the impact of rainwater chemical quality on asphalt used for the Atal Setu. I am sure the salt is preventing proper binding of the asphalt,” Kamat has told CM, who is the chairman of GSIDC. He has also provided in his petition a list of some standard studies carried out in other countries on the issue and on pollution impacting the Goa area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/acidic-rainwater-affecting-roads/articleshow/86542093.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Year later, farmers say BJP’s egoistic approach strengthening resolve to fight further||Bathinda: The Monday Bharat Bandh marks one year of the farmers on the roads in Punjab and 10 months at the borders of Delhi. The long time away from home has failed to deter farmers in demanding repeal of farm laws and now the echo of their determination is being heard in many countries, said the farmers. On September 27, 2020, the President of India had given its assent to farm laws and immediately after that farmers had chalked out its action plan from October 1. Two months later, they started the journey towards Delhi. Though the seeds of unrest among the farmers were sown on June 5, 2020, when the farm ordinances were issued but it spread vastly after both houses of parliament passed the ordinances turned into bills and finally into the law in late September. Upping the ante against the action of the Narendra Modi government, farmers turned its protests into a do or die battle terming the laws as the death warrants for the farmers. With no words from the central government, the protesting farmers decided to give a political blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and after making its presence felt in West Bengal, the farmers are concentrating their energy in bringing BJP’s efforts to naught in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Uttrakhand. Mission Uttar Pradesh is being seen as litmus test for the protesters and the senior leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) have started visiting UP to mobilise people against the BJP. Major role is being assigned to UP-based farm leader Rakesh Tikait. “It is not just about opposing a decision of the central government. We are saving our future generations from corporate sector taking over agriculture. We have the example of Europe ahead of us, where the corporate control of agriculture has ruined individual farmers, pushing them out of the agriculture even though the farmers in these rich countries had big chunks of lands. In our country, the majority are small farmers — which is pegged at 85% — and their future is certainly bleak if the laws are implemented. This fear of future made us to jump in the protests, turning this into battleground. When Punjabis enter the battle ground, they never run away,” said farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan. “The BJP took it lightly thinking that the farmers may retract with passage of time, but they failed to gauge the anger and now privately might be repenting its decision, but its egoistic approach is stopping to listen to the miseries of farmers. Our farmers are also fully determined and not ready to listen anything less than repeal of laws. As the battleground is fully active we are actively playing our part and will keep on playing even if we have to spend years on the roads,” said BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/year-later-farmers-say-bjps-egoistic-approach-strengthening-resolve-to-fight-further/articleshow/86540533.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Narayan Rane records statement in defamation case online||NASHIK: Union minister Narayan Rane on Saturday recorded his statement with the Nashik police in connection with the defamation case registered against him with the Cyber police station of the city on August 24. Shiv Sena city chief Sudhakar Badgujar had lodged an FIR against Rane for allegedly making derogatory remarks against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. On Badgujar’s complaint, the police had booked Rane under sections 500 (punishment for defamation), 505 (2) (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred, or ill-will between classes), and 153 B (imputation, assertions prejudicial to national integration) of the Indian Penal Code. Soon after the complaint was lodged with the cyber police, a team of the city police had left for Ratnagiri to arrest Rane on the same day. However, the plan to arrest Union minister was altered and he was instead served a notice to present himself before the Nashik police for questioning. The Union minister was served a notice to present himself physically in Nashik on September 2. Subsequently, new dates were given and the minister was later permitted to attend the questioning online. DCP Sanjay Barkund confirmed the Union minister attended the proceedings of police questioning through an online system. Rane was sent a video-conferencing link and ID beforehand. The minister was present for the meeting 10 minutes beforehand, after which the process of recording his statement continued for about half an hour. The minister was given a questionnaire beforehand and additional questions were asked during the meeting. Police said the Union minister was extremely cooperative. Barkund said the case will be investigated further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rane-records-statement-in-defamation-case-online/articleshow/86542398.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Shah non-committal on caste-census||Ranchi: An all-party delegation from Jharkhand led by state chief minister Hemant Soren met Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday to demand a caste-based census. The delegation, however, did not put up a demand for a separate column for a Sarna religion in the exercise. Later, the delegation returned empty-handed as Shah indicated that the Centre is not keen to implement the demand and also cited administrative difficulties. The CM’s delegation included representatives from ruling alliance partners, Congress and RJD along with opposition BJP, Left parties like CPI(ML), CPI and CPM. The state unit of the BJP, which had earlier refused to be a part of the delegation, took a U-turn and its president, Deepak Prakash, joined the entourage in a bid to keep its vote bank in good humour. Sudesh Mahto, the president of BJP’s NDA ally, Ajsu-Party, could not join the delegation as he reached New Delhi late. In the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes over tea and ice cream, Soren handed Shah a four-page memorandum advocating the need for the caste census. Terming the Centre’s decision not to conduct it as unfortunate, the memorandum justified the need for the survey, saying that it will help in providing reservation to people of the backward classes and will shed light on the socioeconomic disparities in society. “Policymakers will be able to draft better welfare blueprints which will help uplift people from the backward sections. It will also help in forming a dedicated commission for socially backward sections, which has been mandated in the Constitution,” the memorandum reads. After the meeting, Soren said in New Delhi, “We have passed a resolution in the Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha in favour of a caste-based census (on September 9). We shared the state’s sentiments on the issue with the Union home minister.” Talking to TOI over the phone, Alamgir Alam, the state rural development minister and Congress leader, who was part of the delegation, said, “Shah reiterated that it was difficult and cumbersome to conduct a caste-based census. He did not assure to reconsider the Centre’s stand that it will go ahead with a census without any headcount based on caste.” Jharkhand Congress president Rajesh Thakur said since the Centre has not met the demands of the delegation, all like-minded parties will huddle in Ranchi and decide the future course of action. “Census is a central subject and the state governments have no role in it. We had requested the Union minister to revisit his government’s stand and we will wait and see what is being done. After the agraha (request), we will take up Satyagraha,” Thakur told TOI. The role of the delegation, however, raised many eyebrows after it did not mention the demand for a separate column for Sarna in the census, a resolution for which was passed by the Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha in November last year. “The demand was omitted after several political parties in the delegation expressed their reservation to it. The CM will lead another delegation of social organizations on the issue very soon,” a senior member in the JMM leadership told TOI on anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/shah-non-committal-on-caste-census/articleshow/86538939.cms||Dhritiman Ray

TOI spoke to tent house operators and decorators who said owing to the state government’s restrictions on theme-based pandals as well as events and fairs during Durga Puja celebrations, business has reduced to negligible level. Talking to TOI, proprietor of Ranchi Tent House, Kunal Ajmani, said, “As big pandals will not be constructed and theme-based pandals have been banned by the government, the decoration business will be negligible as the Pujas will be representational.” Ajmani said as the government has also banned all kinds of fairs and events during the Pujas, it will also affect business as the stalls and other structures which used to be installed in and around the pandals will also not be allowed. Hitesh Bhagat, proprietor of Doon Tent House, said, “Definitely the state government order has hit business. We too have suffered losses. However, I am optimistic that the situation will change and we will come out of it soon.” As Durga Puja celebrations are starting from October 11, the pandals have started coming up in different areas of city. Pandal construction is in full swing at Station Road, Rajasthan Mitra Mandal Upper Bazar, Bhartiya Navyuvak Sangh and Ratu Road. Organisers of Durga Puja committees said they are sticking to the guidelines of the state government and it will be a simple affair this year too as collections are low and the guidelines have also forced them to cut down on grandeur. General secretary of Mahaveer Mitra Mandal, Lalit Ojha, said, “The celebrations will be a low-key affair this year and we are also not collecting any funds for the Puja as our donors have also suffered losses. As visitors aren’t allowed to go for pandal hopping we are also keeping it simple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/decorators-stare-at-another-year-of-lossses-for-curbs-on-theme-pandals/articleshow/86539373.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||CM Hemant Soren seeks SCA funds for more Naxal-affected districts||RANCHI: Jharkhand government has demanded reinstatement of Special Central Assistance (SCA) fund to more districts in the state falling in Naxal-affected regions and has urged the Central government to stop imposing bills on the state government in lieu of deployment of central forces for anti-Naxal operations. Chief minister Hemant Soren, who took part in the review meeting on Left wing extremism (LWE) and related issues of law and order of all the states under the chairmanship of union home minister Amit Shah, also aggressively batted for rational approach towards planning and allocation of plans and schemes to states, especially to tackle the concerns of extremism. Soren also appealed to his counterpart in Chhattisgarh to extend cooperation for a joint security operations to flush out rebels from the areas bordering both the states. Though the Naxal footprint has reduced to a large extent in the state compared to the situation five years ago, Soren stressed on intensifying ante against the rebels with a more concerted efforts from both the state and the Centre rather than getting complacent. Making his address during the meeting in Delhi on Sunday, Soren raised the issue of cuts in SCA funds reiterating what he spoke during a meeting with the members of Niti Aayog in Ranchi earlier this month. He said, “The discontinuation of SCA funds for 8 LWE affected districts could prove hurdle in affectively tackling Naxal menace in those districts. Under SCA, every LWE district receives Rs 33 crore from the Centre which helped in addressing critical infrastructural gaps. However, recently, this scheme was cut down to only eight districts against 16 in Jharkhand. Koderma, Ramgarh and Simdega have been excluded from the scheme. It is my request to continue these schemes for Naxal affected districts for the next five years." He added, “I do not know the criteria upon which the decision was taken to discontinue these schemes. But I would like to say that absence of incidents of extremism cannot be the basis for concluding that extremism has been eradicated in those districts. Sudden discontinuation of these schemes may allow the Left-wing to emerge again in the respective regions." Stressing that Naxalism isn’t a state specific problem, but pertains to overall wellbeing of the country, Soren also expressed concern over hefty bills sent by the Centre to the state government for deployment of central forces. "The LWE problem is a big challenge for both the Central and the state governments. Hence, it is a collective responsibility of both to fight it out. Hence, it is not pragmatic on the part of the union government to demand money from the state governments for the deployment of the central security forces. I have been informed that till now a bill of Rs 10,000 crore has been raised by the Ministry of Home Affairs from Jharkhand. I seek the Centre’s intervention to write off those bills and a decision shpuld be taken so that such bills are not sent in the future," he said. Detailing on the current scenario, he said that sustained efforts from the state and central forces jointly have led to improvement in extremist situation in the state. “Today, presence of hardcore extremists in the state has been limited to mainly four regions — Parasnath Pahar, Budha Pahar, tri-junction of Seraikela-Khunti-Chaibasa districts in Kolhan and some parts of Bihar border,” he said, adding that compared to 196 extremist incidents in 2016, it has now come down to 126 in 2020. “Similarly, opposed to death of 61 civilians in 2016, 28 died in 2020. A total of 715 militants were arrested and 18 killed in last one year,” he said. Crediting state’s surrender policy, he said, “Since last year, 27 extremists surrendered till August 21.” Soren sought Chhattisgarh government’s intervention for a joint operation between the states. “Burha Pahar in Jharkhand along Chattisgarh border is a den for Naxals. But large parts of the Pahar falls in Chhattisgarh. I would request Chhattisgarh chief minister to instruct his officers to coordinate with the Jharkhand Police for conducting a joint operation against the Naxals in this region," he said. Soren also talked about the state’s future plans to engage youths in Naxal areas through constructive ways with the help of sports, education among others, demanded central government for hike in MNREGA wages in rebel-hit areas, granting more centrally funded schools to improve education among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-seeks-sca-funds-for-more-naxal-affected-districts/articleshow/86539082.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The nationwide bandh has been called by Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the agitation in Delhi and along the borders of the national capital since the past 10 months. Reportedly, the bandh has received widespread support across different outfits from banking to industries and other trade bodies this time. In Jharkhand, the ruling alliance comprising the JMM-Congress-RJD along with other non-NDA parties have announced to extend support as a result of which different non-NDA constituents on Sunday staged marches seeking public support to make Monday’s dawn-to-dusk bandh a success. Sufal Mahto, convenor of Jharkhand Rajya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (RKSSS), a Left-backed farm body, said all their affiliates across the districts will hit the streets and railway tracks since 6am to enforce the bandh. “The bandh is till 4pm and will be a huge success in Jharkhand this time as almost all political parties and different trade bodies here are supporting it against the anti-people policies of the Union government,” he said, adding that the bandh is also against the Narendra Modi government’s other anti-people policies ranging from price hikes to national monetization pipeline among other. Public transport such as buses and autos may remain paralysed on Monday. An office bearer of Jharkhand Bus Owners Association said that they haven’t yet taken a call to keep buses off the road but will decide based on the situation. “Bus owners will take a call depending on the situation on Monday whether to stay off the roads,” said an official. To ensure law and order, Jharkhand police have alerted all the districts to be extra careful to avert any law-and-order situation and inconvenience to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/torchlit-marches-in-ranchi-precede-bharat-bandh-against-farm-laws/articleshow/86538862.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Aloe vera village farmers jubilant after PM’s pat in Mann ki Baat||RANCHI: Little was known about the small hamlet of Deori in Nagri block, 25km from the state capital before Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special mention of Manju Kachchap and the villagers on Sunday morning. While addressing the nation through 81st edition of Mann ki Baat, he praised the villagers for taking up aloe vera cultivation with the support of Birsa Agriculture University which increased their income besides aiding the traditional healthcare. Expressing happiness for finding a mention in the PM’s address, Manju Kachchap (Tirkey) said they are hopeful of getting more support for their medicinal plant-farming idea. “We were chosen for a training to adopt plantation of aloe vera by the Birsa Agriculture University in 2018 and at least three dozen villagers under Deori panchayat decided to try out cultivation of the medicinal plant instead of traditional crops like vegetables,” she said. Along with Manju, Meena Devi Bhagmani Tirkey and other realised the benefits of shifting to a new cash crop. “The input cost is less, as we don’t have to purchase seeds every year and the produce, mature leaves in this case, are readily sold,” said Manju, who has been producing around 1.5 quintals of aloe vera leaves every year from the small plot of land she chose for the experiment. During the peak of Covid infections, the demand for freshly grown aloe vera increased manifold. “Buyers came to our field as the demand for aloe vera juice and gel was very high,” Manju said. She wanted to install the necessary set-up for production of gel but in the absence of necessary support and knowhow, she is still selling the leaves. Head of department of forestry products and utilization, Birsa Agriculture University, Dr Kaushal Kumar, who was the pioneer in introducing aloe vera cultivation in Jharkhand, said the project was funded by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) under Tribal Sub Plan (TSP). “We chose a few tribal villages to see if the dream of doubling farmers’ income can be realised through medicinal plants, a new concept for the state,” he said. Having trained over four dozen villagers, out of whom only a few agreed to adopt the new crop, BAU has been monitoring and extending all necessary help as far as technology transfer is concerned. Kumar said aloe vera suited the agroclimatic condition of the region and also had a readymade market. Under the leadership of Manju Devi, many villagers agreed to adopt farming of the medicinal plant, that was new for them. “Since many people started cultivating aleo vera on whatever plot they had, we can see these plants almost everywhere in the village prompting visitors to call it aloe vera village,” Kumar said. Though aloe vera grows in tough conditions, it requires irrigation in summer and the leaves take almost 18 months to mature. Manju said since their wells dry up in summer they are worried about irrigation in summer months. “Since the PM has mentioned name of our village we are hopeful that some irrigation facility would now be provided to us,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aloe-vera-village-farmers-jubilant-after-pms-pat-in-mann-ki-baat/articleshow/86539311.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Though the pandemic is still not over, compared to last year the situation has improved as the state is witnessing a dip in cases prompting the state government to unlock almost every sector. Based on the initial trends of festive shopping in Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum), traders are confident that this festive season would bring money into the market and boost the sales unlike previous year. "With majority of the companies announcing annual bonus and the government easing the regulatory guidelines, people have started arriving in the markets. Next two weeks would see an increase in the footfalls and hopefully in the sales," said proprietor of an electronics shop Raja Singh. The traders said that people prefer buying clothes, footwear, household interiors/decoration items and kitchen appliances mostly around Durga Puja. "Vehicles, ornaments, electronic items, mobile phones, plots, house, apartment bookings are done during Diwali, sales trends of past years suggest so," said loan advisor at HDFC bank, Shailesh Tiwary. "It is an early trend, but confidence is building up. At least, the government has allowed the markets to open in compliance with Covid-19 guidelines," said Avtar Singh, who owns a shop in Jugsalai. Footwear shop owner Mohammed Imtiaz said: "Companies had given annual bonus last year also but due to the pandemic, markets were tightly regulated and people also preferred to save money because of the difficult times hence sales during Durga Puja was not very profitable.” Market experts said Rs 250 crore, by and large, are given to the employees in the form of annual bonus, out of which 40 per cent goes to the market in the form of festive sales. "Jamshedpur and Adityapur are industrial towns wherein the residents mostly comprise company employees but there are government employees and business families who also do good amount of buying in festive season," said Confederation of All India Traders, (CAIT), national secretary, Suresh Sonthalia. Big companies like Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tinplate have announced annual bonus, while the SMEs in the Adityapur industrial town are steadily announcing the annual bonus. "Due to moderate earnings in the 2020-21 business year, bonus in several ancillaries would be mediocre this year," said 40-year-old S K Sarkar, an ancillary worker. The Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry president elect, Vijay Anand Moonka, said with e-commerce growing, local shopkeepers keenly wait for the festive season to do encouraging sales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/markets-eye-revival-during-festive-season/articleshow/86539174.cms||---

Villagers caught the accused and later police arrested him in the night. The elderly couple were first killed and when Basmati came out hearing their cries, she too was murdered, police said. Gumla SDPO Manish Kumar Lal said, “One relative of the deceased family carried out the killing. He has been arrested." "The accused told the police that he had gone to Tamil Nadu to work but came back after feeling mentally disturbed. After coming back on September 17, he took some traditional medicine but it didn’t help him feel better. He suspected that his uncle and aunt practised black magic on him. So he beat them to death with an iron pipe," the SDPO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-of-a-family-killed-in-gumla-over-suspicion-of-witchcraft/articleshow/86539405.cms||K A Gupta

Officials of the airport said they will start an In-Line Baggage Screening (ILBS) system for passengers and the new Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower will also start functioning. Moreover, the airport will add two additional aerobridges which will help in easing entry and exit to flights. Talking to TOI, the director of the airport, Vinod Kumar Sharma, said: “We are going to start the ILBS system for passengers in compliance with the BCAS norms. It will help in eliminating queues near the x-ray machines as the baggage will automatically be screened fixed to the system. The service will start in November this year.” Sharma also said the two additional aerobridges and more parking bays at the airport will help in easing flight movements. “With the two aerobridges, we will have a total of four. Four more parking bays for flights will be added to help us in operating late night and early morning flights. The under-construction ATC tower will be also operational by November,” he added.

Justifying his stand, Oraon, who was the former president of the state Congress, said the move will give more teeth to Jharkhand to counter Centre’s claims on population figures as and when required. “We will also be in a better position to demand funds in accordance with the needs,” he said. Talking to TOI, Oraon said, “Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had already announced that if the Centre doesn’t agree for a caste-based census, he will get it done on his own. Jharkhand, too, must think of doing our own census of OBCs and STs to get a clear picture of their status. I will soon write to the CM in this regard.” In Jharkhand, OBCs are roughly 46% of the population while STs form about 26% as per the 2011 census. Oraon conceded that OBCs are a larger chunk in the state while the population of STs has dwindled because of unchecked migration and faulty census patterns. “The lack of a proper headcount has a direct bearing on the state’s resources, its planning, framing of policies for the development of the state and all strata of society, especially the marginalised group,” he stressed. Asserting that the real situation of the tribals in the state is still not available due to issues of migration, he said, “When tribals migrate to other cities or states for work, their headcount in the census is usually registered in the general category. For example, if any tribal family is in Punjab and if the census exercise got underway, they were included in the general category. Ideally, the Centre must devise a system irrespective of the place of their stay during the census and registered records must be added to their home state. But this has not been in practice.” Oraon further said when he was the chairperson of the ST Commission, he wrote letters to the Union government and the President in this regard but to no avail. “The other flip side of the dwindling tribal figures will be seen during the delimitation exercise and it leads to a slash in the reserved seats for STs. After Jharkhand was carved out from Bihar, an attempt was made to slash the reserved seats but I fought along with other tribal leaders from the state following which it was halted a few years back,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/if-centre-doesnt-agree-state-must-do-its-own-obc-and-st-census-rameshwar/articleshow/86539244.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The TATR management says it is implementing the decision taken by the Local Advisory Committee (LAC), a statutory body taking a call on tourism-related activities to phase out outside Gypsys. However, PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said, “There is no issue of locals and non-locals. Field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar will hold a meeting in a day or two with all the stakeholders and then we will take a call.” Since 2019, the decision was not implemented under pressure from Gypsy owners. At least 60 Gypsys are owned by government employees, resort owners and outside people. Then LAC member Bandu Dhotre said, “The decision to phase out private gypsies was taken to provide more livelihood opportunities to locals.” Till now outsider gypsies were allowed entry in the core as per the rotation. Now they will be out of the purview of the roaster, which means if they jump rotation, they will have to shell out Rs 3,000 to the local persons in line and Rs 1,000 to the Tadoba Foundation. A delegation of resort owners led by ex-LAC member Dhananjay Bapat met PCCF Limaye and discussed the issue. “Though I have no vehicle interest, the move is disappointing. In 2012, when the park needed us it forced us to buy gypsies so that private cars and vehicles entering the core area are phased out,” said Bapat. “Now after 9 years when the park’s necessity is over, we have suddenly become outsiders. Earlier, the situation was such that if resort owners did not have Gypsys their guests were not allowed to enter the park. We pay conservation fee and terming us outsiders doesn’t auger well,” said Bapat. Another resort owner Bandu Wekhande echoed the same feelings. “I was the first person to set up a resort in Mohurli. As the park needed our help, resort owners, some employees and private people procured 60 Gypsys. This was the minimum number needed to ban private vehicle entry in Tadoba. While operating these vehicles, drivers are local youth being paid Rs 7,000 per month salary. We are also employing them in our resorts. So, where is the issue of unemployment? Any decision in this regard should be taken in coordination with all the stakeholders,” said Wekhande. However, ex-officials who worked in Tadoba said, “The park never forced people to buy Gypsys. These people saw business opportunities in safari vehicles and procured them. There are people who have 3-4 Gypsys. They procured them as they reaped huge profits. Now the park wants to pass on the same profits to local families.” A stakeholder from Kolara, Ranjeet Mondol, said, “It is true that we were encouraged to procure gypsies. In 2009, when we started the resort, we used to call for gypsies from Mohurli. We have supported the local economy since the beginning. However, paying Rs 4,000 for jumping rotation will be too taxing for the tourist, who has already paid the Gypsy charge while booking a safari. To jump rotation, why should a local gypsy owner get Rs 3,000 when he has not used his vehicle?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-move-on-local-gypsys-leaves-resort-owners-fuming/articleshow/86538522.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||India||Teacher who enrolled disabled kids to school gets PM’s salute||BAREILLY: An initiative by a Bareilly school principal to ensure disabled children have access to education was lauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme after the campaign was able to enrol 600 students with special needs in schools in various districts of Uttar Pradesh since the pandemic last year. The principal, Deepmala Pandey, was joined in her effort by 350 teachers across the state. The turning point for Pandey as an educator had come in 2018 when she met Anmol (who uses his first name), a mute student with learning difficulties, who had enrolled at her institution. “When I saw his eagerness to come to school and learn things, I became more sensitive towards children with special needs like him. I realised many students like him are never sent to school by parents who think they can’t learn. I decided to change that attitude,” the 38-year-old told TOI. Pandey started travelling to villages in Bareilly, talking to parents, urging them to send disabled children to school. When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year, the schools shut down, but Pandey decided to scale up her mission which she named in ‘One Teacher, One Call’. The principal started posting regular updates on social media about the initiative which inspired 350 teachers from various districts such as Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Farrukhabad and Ayodhya to join in. A total of 600 students with varying levels of disabilities have been enrolled in schools since then, said Pandey. The teachers visited students’ home during the pandemic to check their progress and to help parents set up online classes for them, said Pandey. On Sunday, PM Modi heaped praises on Pandey. “This unique effort in Bareilly is showing a new path to divyang children. This campaign is being led by the principal of a school in Dabhaura Gangapur, Deepmala Pandey ji. During the pandemic period, due to this campaign, not only did the admission of a large number of children become possible, more than 350 teachers have also joined it with a spirit of service,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/teacher-who-enrolled-disabled-kids-to-school-gets-pms-salute/articleshow/86543877.cms||---

Former deputy CM and SAD president Sukhbir Badal claimed that three groups in Delhi were running the Congress government in Punjab. “The Congress is on self destruction mode now and very shortly it will be wiped out from Punjab,” said Sukhbir, who was here to attend various programs. Interacting with mediapersons, he said, “When the CM cannot decide his own cabinet and is looking towards the high command in Delhi, what he will do for the people of Punjab? It is painful to watch the new CM being overshadowed by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu and deputy CM Sukhjinder Randhawa.” “All decisions — be it choosing the cabinet, the chief secretary, the state police chief or the advocate general — are being taken by others. Files are only put before Channi for his signatures,” Akali Dal chief alleged. He claimed that Channi should be thankful to Akali Dal because SAD had first announced to make a scheduled caste community member the deputy CM of Punjab, which prompted the Congress select him for CM post. Taking a dig at induction of new ministers, he said, “On the first day, CM Channi had said sand mafia should stay away him. Now, he has taken in his cabinet Rana Gurjit Singh, who was removed due to charges against him for his involvement in sand mafia. Then Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, who has involvement in suicide of three children in Faridkot, had also been given space in cabinet.” He said former CM Captain Amarinder Singh wasted 4.5 years without any development work and now in remaining three months, the Congress had nothing to do except for looting the public money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-cant-decide-on-his-own-sukhbir/articleshow/86540702.cms||---

According to statistics, city police have this year rescued nine minors from different parts of the city while one was from Ganga Jamuna. This year, 20 raids were conducted against sex racketeers at different parts of the city while one was at Ganga Jamuna locality. Around 21 women and 21 men were booked for their alleged involvement in the sex trade. Three men and an equal number of women from Ganga Jamuna were among the ones booked this year for running brothels. City police also rescued 38 women from different flesh trade dens during raids this year. City police chief Amitesh Kumar said any illegal act under the provisions of immoral prevention of trafficking Act (IPTA) would face stringent action, irrespective of the location. “All necessary efforts would be undertaken to crack illegalities under IPTA,” he said. On concentration of action at Ganga Jamuna, Kumar said the red-light area had organized illegal activities at brothels which warranted such orchestrated efforts. “Ganga Jamuna had turned into a hub of illegal human trafficking over a period of time which is a violation of humanity apart from a grave illegal and anti-social activity,” he said. The CP said his surveillance is uniformly spread across the city without discrimination against any particular locality. Kumar also said that rescuing minors is his priority. “Apart from minors, we are also setting a target to rescue any adult compelled to be part of the flesh trade and willing to be rescued and rehabilitated,” said Kumar. Kumar’s efforts to shut down sex work at Ganga Jamuna’s brothels had triggered a wide debate on the issue of right to livelihood. At present, city police are on the verge of sealing around seven brothels at Ganga Jamuna bringing sex work to a halt. With a strong police bandobast continuing to keep the bulk of the visitors at bay from the lanes of red-light area, it’s learnt that some of the downtrodden women are managing to earn some livelihood by playing hide-and-seek with the cops on duty. According to an insider, city police face a tricky challenge to put a spanner in the wheel of flesh trade at salons, spas and private apartments with kingpins like Roshni, Shilpa and their likes still thriving in different pockets in the city. Sources also stated that Shilpa is having good contacts in the police department too. Contempt notice to CP on Ganga Jamuna Nagpur: Renu Associates have served a legal notice on the city police chief for evicting and sealing premises of three residents of Ganga Jamuna ignoring the interim protective orders of the Bombay high court issued this year. The law firm has also served notices to Maharashtra state electricity board and Orange City Waterworks for discontinuing supplies to the premises from where their occupants were removed after the sealing action. Challenging the possible similar action in future against other residents of Ganga Jamuna, the law firm has asserted the order of CP as a contempt to court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/90-minors-in-flesh-trade-were-not-in-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/86538602.cms||Soumitra Bose

The day marked beginning of the International Week Of The Deaf. Dr Prashant Nikhade, president of the AOI Vidarbha, said, “We recommend that young people limit exposure to loud sounds and the use of audio players to not more than an hour per day.” The association organized a Walkathon on Sunday in which hundreds of citizens participated. It stared from Lokmat Square to Variety Square and back to Lokmat Square. ENT specialist Dr Nandu Kolwadkar said, “The purpose was to educate people and highlight the issues which the deaf community faces, promote their acceptance and integration in the social fabric while celebrating their achievements and culture.” Doctors said that effective strategies for reducing chances of hearing loss at different stages of life includes immunization, good maternal and child care practices, genetic counselling, identification and management of common ear conditions. Dr Ashish Disawal said that early identification and support are particularly important in children. “For many, hearing aids, sign language, cochlear implant and captions are useful,” he said. Paediatricians said that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling. “Children must get tested first when they enter school, then at the ages 6, 8 and 10, then at least once during middle school and at least once during high school,” said Dr Vijay Dhote, president of Academy of Paediatrics, Nagpur, adding that children with hearing loss often do not receive schooling. Neonatologist Dr Pratima Shah said that universal newborn hearing screening is recommended with ‘1-3-6’ formula. “Screening by one month, confirmation by three months and management by six months is the key to effective management of deafness,” she said. * About International Week Of The Deaf - Celebrated during the last full week of September every year - This year’s theme is ‘Celebrating thriving deaf communities’ - Prevalence of hearing impairment in India is around 6.3% - Adult onset deafness is 7.6% and childhood onset is 2.4% - 24 in every 1,000 children suffer from severe to profound hearing loss - Over 1 lakh babies are born with hearing deficiency every year - Early identification of hearing loss and ear diseases is key||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/health-measures-can-prevent-half-of-hearing-loss-cases-docs/articleshow/86538753.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A message from Faleiro’s office said that the former Congress Working Committee member would address “an important press conference” on Monday afternoon. Interestingly, the venue of Faleiro’s press conference is a Goa resort where TMC MPs Derek O’Brien and Prasun Banerjee have been putting up ever since they arrived in Goa last week to participate in a series of meetings with aspiring candidates for the assembly polls and with media persons and a cross section of people. TMC is seeking to make a re-entry into Goa politics ahead of the 2022 polls. Last week two of Faleiro’s key aides and state Congress office bearers Yatish Naik and Agnelo Fernandes claimed that Faleiro was being sidelined in the opposition party. Faleiro is one of the five Congress MLAs in a 40-member state legislative assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/buzz-on-former-goa-cm-faleiro-joining-tmc-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/86543883.cms||---

---||Goa||30 tonne of tarballs cleared from beaches in three talukas of Goa||PANAJI: The recent tar ball deposition on Goa’s popular tourist beaches — one of the worst to hit the state’s coastline — has indicated how the problem is slowly assuming alarming levels, something even scientists admitted. Nearly 30 tonne of the muck was gathered by the government-appointed beach cleaning agency, Karnataka Industrial and Commercial Corporation Pvt Ltd (KCIC) from beaches in three talukas. The episode, massive and prolonged, played out for nearly two weeks. Ever since tar balls first started being spewed on Goa’s beaches in the 1970s, the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) scientists have been studying the possible source of the pollution. In August 2010, April 2011 and May 2011, tar ball deposition was particularly massive on some beaches. There was no oil spill reported in the Arabian Sea and NIO concluded that “the only source for formation of tar balls could be the spill/tanker wash from the tankers passing through the international tanker routes across the Arabian Sea.” In a study, using hydrodynamics and particle tracking models, tar ball particles were released numerically at eight locations out at sea and five of them reached the Goa coast. This indicated the washing of tankers and accidental oil spills along the international oil tanker route. While nearby coastal areas on either side of Goa’s borders also report tar ball pollution, NIO studies have found the deposition contains biological communities such as diatoms, bryozoans, blue-green algae, and goose barnacles, which mix with the oil. Another study also found that tar ball formation can occur due to release from oil installations like Bombay High (BH) oil fields. A 650km stretch of the west coast can be vulnerable to the problem. Scientists say that being an international issue, the government should engage marine chemists, microbiologists and coastal managers to draft a management policy to tackle it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/30-tonne-of-tarballs-cleared-from-beaches-in-three-talukas/articleshow/86541261.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Goa||In hint to dissidents, Cong says many waiting to join party||Panaji: Under fire for inducting young faces, opposition leader Digambar Kamat and state Congress party president Girish Chodankar shot back saying that “a long queue of young leaders” are waiting to join Congress. Kamat and Chodankar issued a joint statement on Sunday, a broad hint to the dissidents, a day before the Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro is likely to quit the party. While Kamat did not name any particular individual, he said that political parties are “built by workers, not leaders” and that All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) should understand that by contesting Goa’s assembly elections, it would “divide secular votes”, thus benefiting BJP. The joint statement comes amidst strong indications that Faleiro may break his decades-long relationship with Congress and join TMC. Faleiro’s aides have said the former chief minister is “upset and humiliated” after being sidelined by local Congress leadership. Congress also appears to be sending a message to TMC, which has announced that it will make yet another attempt to gain a foothold in Goa’s political arena. “Some political parties, which are now trying to make a comeback in Goa, have already tested the Goan waters in the past. They failed miserably earlier and will repeat it once again,” said Chodankar. “I don’t think Mamata Banerjee is a political fool to come to Goa.” Veteran Congressmen such as former Calangute MLA Agnel Fernandes, party general secretary Vijai Pai, former CCP mayor Surendra Furtado, secretary Mario Pinto and general secretary Yatish Naik have lashed out and said that Congress appears directionless in Goa. They questioned the “sudden” induction of new members into Congress who have been promised tickets in the coming assembly elections. “There is a long queue of young leaders waiting to join Congress,” Kamat and Chodankar said in response. They said that “political gambles and gimmicks” will not work in the coming polls as voters know that “new political parties will only help split the secular vote” and allow BJP to win.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-hint-to-dissidents-cong-says-many-waiting-to-join-party/articleshow/86541297.cms||---

Former bureaucrat and co-chairman of the manifesto committee Elvis Gomes said that nearly 5,000 land deals have taken place on the basis of bogus documents. Congress wants a judicial commission to investigate the property transactions. Gomes alleged that the government would initially threaten to acquire land after which the “land mafia” would make “tempting offers” to the farmers and convince them to go for mutation of the land records. “Thereafter, the land mafia, having nexus with ministers and officers, goes for sale deeds on the basis of such inadmissible documents, thus committing fraud on the people.

---||Goa||Goa: After months of hesitancy, transgenders warm up to jab||PANAJI: Even as the Goa government claimed that it has vaccinated 102% of its eligible population with the first dose, the state’s transgender community has only just started receiving their vaccines. The community has been skeptical about the vaccine since the drive started, with various fears ranging from side effects of the vaccine, doubts on its impact on hormone medication, and non-change of their Aadhaar card after gender affirmation surgeries (procedures that help people transition to their self-identified gender). Lack of sufficient information has left many members of this community hesitant to take the jab. “For the longest time, we were unsure of whether or not we would get vaccinated,” said Julie, a transgender from Margao who makes a living by begging at the Margao railway station. “We still do not know if there will be side effects of the vaccine to the hormones, yet I got my first jab because I neither want to die of Covid-19 nor of hunger,” she said. Every day, Julie takes a train from Margao till it reaches the Goa border, and then takes another to alight at the Thivim station. Over the past few months, however, trains have been denying her entry owing to her unvaccinated status. After getting their first jab, Julie and six other members of the trans community are hopeful they will be allowed on the trains again. But it’s not just the trains. Some transgender persons do not have Aadhaar cards, and are therefore unaccounted for. Others had the card made before their gender affirmation surgery, and it reflects their former name, gender and identity. “There is a very strong community of transgenders in Kerala and Karnataka who are supported by government welfare schemes,” Julie said. “Getting an Aadhar card made according to their new identity is a seamless process there. In Goa, we are neither recipients of such benefits nor are there awareness drives to explain to transgenders the pros and cons of taking the vaccine.” More than the transgenders that make ends meet by begging, it is those transgenders that engage in the sex trade that are hesitant to get vaccinated. Now, the organisation Arz is assisting the community in Goa to get vaccinated by helping them to access documents and providing counselling to address fears about vaccination. In some cases, the organisation even accompanies them to the vaccination centre to ensure that they do not suffer any stigma or discrimination. “We have intervened at the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) level to ensure that transgenders receive proper documentation, and also to see if special facilities can be created for them to take the vaccine,” said Arz director Arun Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-months-of-hesitancy-transgenders-warm-up-to-jab/articleshow/86541439.cms||Nida Sayed

The e-commerce giant is adopting more vernacular languages, expanding ‘voice buy’ options in its app to break the technology barrier and continue its outreach expansion across uncharted geographies. “From the current 75,000 kirana stores across 450 cities, we are going to increase it to around 10 lakh by 2025. We are raising speed and last-mile delivery by giving more options to buyers and sellers,” said Manish Tiwary, VP, Amazon India, after announcing The Great Indian Festival (GIF) 2021, which starts from October 4. Giving an idea of Amazon India’s business jump amid Covid-19, Tiwary said that the company has added around 3,00,000 sellers to its kitty in the last 16 months — from 5,50,000 to of 8,50,000. “We currently have 85% customers in small cities, which was 60% just two years back. Besides its ever-increasing product portfolio, the e-tail major is educating and enabling sellers and buyers, especially in smaller cities and towns, with an added focus on small medium businesses (SMB). “We have around 58,000 Amazon Easy stores, where any new buyer can just walk in to be hand-held by trained shopkeepers. Newbies can have touch & feel product experience through a physical product buy-cum-delivery display. As many as nine local languages in the mobile app and an Alexa-based voice buy services in Hindi and English could be a game-changer for enabling more customers, especially in small towns,” Tiwary added. The company has given a thrust on training its new sellers through online and offline training sessions, webinars and Seller University programmes. In July this year, it has launched its first Digital Kendra — brick and mortar resource centre — in Surat, Gujarat, to educate micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) on availing a range of third-party services such as shipping and logistics, cataloguing, digital marketing, GST and taxation support. In 2020, Amazon had announced that it would invest $1 billion in India to help digitize 10 million MSMEs by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-goes-hyperlocal-to-rope-in-10l-kiranas-by-25/articleshow/86539256.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Goa||No decision about joining TMC: Alemao||Margao: Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao on Sunday said that that he, too, had been approached by Trinamool Congress (TMC) but that he was yet to take any decision about joining the party. “I haven’t taken a decision yet because I don’t want to ditch my party leaders, Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel. If they take any decision concerning me then I will give a thought to it,” Alemao, the lone NCP legislator in the state, told reporters. He said that as Pawar and other NCP leaders hadn’t hurt him so far, he has been slow in taking a decision. “Had they hurt me, I would have taken a decision instantly like how (Congress Navelim MLA) Luizinho Faleiro did,” Alemao said. While Faleiro has reportedly held talks with TMC, which has decided to contest the 2022 Goa assembly polls, the former has denied having met any TMC leader. “The way Faleiro is speaking, it looks like he will be quitting Congress soon to join the TMC,” Alemao said. The Benaulim MLA further said that there were enough reasons for Faleiro to have been upset with Congress. “During the 2017 assembly polls, Faleiro, who was then the president of Congress, got 17 seats for the party. Now if he is being sidelined by the party, it’s but obvious that he will think in his own interest. That’s what I feel,” he said. Several Congress functionaries, believed to be close to Faleiro, have come out in the open pointing out to what they called humiliation meted out by the state party leadership to senior Congressmen like Faleiro. Voicing his opinion in favour of an alliance for the 2022 polls, Alemao said, “People want like-minded people to come together to defeat BJP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-decision-about-joining-tmc-alemao/articleshow/86541385.cms||---
---||World||German Social Democrats beat conservatives in vote to decide Merkel successor||BERLIN: Germany's Social Democrats narrowly won Sunday's national election, projected results showed, and claimed a "clear mandate" to lead a government for the first time since 2005 and to end 16 years of conservative-led rule under Angela Merkel. The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) were on track for 26.0% of the vote, ahead of 24.5% for Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc, projections for broadcaster ZDF showed, but both groups believed they could lead the next government. With neither major bloc commanding a majority, and both reluctant to repeat their awkward "grand coalition" of the past four years, the most likely outcome is a three-way alliance led by either the Social Democrats or Merkel's conservatives. Agreeing a new coalition could take months, and will likely involve the smaller Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP). "We are ahead in all the surveys now," the Social Democrats' chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, said in a round table discussion with other candidates after the vote. "It is an encouraging message and a clear mandate to make sure that we get a good, pragmatic government for Germany," he added after earlier addressing jubilant SPD supporters. The SPD's rise heralds a swing left for Germany and marks a remarkable comeback for the party, which has recovered some 10 points in support in just three months to improve on its 20.5% result in the 2017 national election. Scholz, 63, would become the fourth post-war SPD chancellor after Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. Finance minister in Merkel's cabinet, he is a former mayor of Hamburg. Scholz's conservative rival Armin Laschet, signalled his bloc was not ready yet to concede, though his supporters were subdued. "It hasn't always been the first-placed party that provided the chancellor," Laschet, 60, told the round table. "I want a government where every partner is involved, where everyone is visible - not one where only the chancellor gets to shine," he said in an early attempt to woo smaller parties. Schmidt ruled in the late 1970s and early 1980s in coalition with the FDP even though his Social Democrats had fewer parliamentary seats than the conservative bloc. COALITION FOR CHRISTMAS? Attention will now shift to informal discussions followed by more formal coalition negotiations, which could take months, leaving Merkel in charge in a caretaker role. Scholz and Laschet both said they would aim to strike a coalition deal before Christmas. Merkel plans to step down after the election, making the vote an era-changing event to set the future course of Europe's largest economy. She has stood large on the European stage almost since taking office in 2005 - when George W. Bush was US president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister. After a domestic-focused election campaign, Berlin's allies in Europe and beyond may have to wait for months before they can see whether the new German government is ready to engage on foreign issues to the extent they would like. A row between Washington and Paris over a deal for Australia to buy US instead of French submarines has put Germany in an awkward spot between allies, but also gives Berlin the chance to help heal relations and rethink their common stance on China. On hearing that the SPD were slightly ahead in polls, US President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington: "I'll be darned... They're solid." On economic policy, French President Emmanuel Macron is eager to forge a common European fiscal policy, which the Greens support but the CDU/CSU and FDP reject. The Greens also want "a massive expansion offensive for renewables ". "Germany will end up with a rather weak chancellor who will struggle to get behind any kind of ambitious fiscal reform at the EU level," said Naz Masraff at political risk consultancy Eurasia. Whatever coalition ends up in power, Germany's friends can at least take heart that moderate centrism has prevailed, and the populism that has taken hold in other European countries failed to break through. The projected results for ZDF showed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on track for 10.5%, worse than four years ago when they stormed into the national parliament with 12.6% of the vote, and with all mainstream groupings ruling out a coalition with the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/german-social-democrats-beat-conservatives-in-vote-to-decide-merkel-successor/articleshow/86543878.cms||---

Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the special Vespa 75th edition launch to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Italian brand that became a global fashion icon in the 1950s following the release of Audrey Hepburn-Gregory Peck starrer Roman Holiday, Piaggio India business head (two-wheelers) Sudhanshu Agrawal said the company was expecting to bounce back to pre-Covid figures and sell 80,000 units this year, similar to what it had achieved in 2019. Last year, the numbers had dropped to around 51,000 units. “The Vespa and Aprilia brands are on track to achieve sales of 80,000 units this year and are targeting 100,000 units next year. The Vespa brand will continue to contribute around 65% sales,” Agrawal told TOI. Key to achieving the numbers will be its network growth from 275 dealers in 190 cities to 400 dealers in 300 cities. A big chunk of the new dealerships will be in north India where it has a poor presence at present. While over half its sales are generated from markets in south India, north constitutes only 3-4% of its sales pie. The remaining numbers are divided nearly equally between east and west. Agrawal says the company could have targeted even higher numbers this year had the monsoon not been this heavy and colleges opened. In the Aprilia brand, college students are a bulk of customers. While 30% of Aprilia customers are women, they comprise half of Vespa customers. Of the women customers, 10% are home-makers with the rest being students and young professionals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vespa-eyes-pre-covid-sales-this-yr-targets-1l-next-yr/articleshow/86539321.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Goa||Yet another casino jetty could come up in Panaji||Panaji: A casino has sought permission from the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) to set up yet another temporary jetty in Panaji next to the Captain of Ports jetty. Three expert members of the GCZMA were appointed to carry out inspection at the spot where the jetty is proposed. The inspection was scheduled late last month, in the presence of a supervisor of the Big Daddy casino. However, the GCZMA expert members found that the supervisor of the casino was unable to provide the required details. “They were not in a position to explain the site selection and position of the proposed site as there are Captain of Ports (CoP) constructions in progress. In order to understand and get the exact position of the walkway, it is recommended to have a joint inspection along with a representative of CoP and an engineer or proper representative of Big Daddy,” the GCZMA decided at a meeting held early this month. The GCZMA decided to carry out reinspection of the proposed site of the temporary jetty through its expert members again. Minister for ports Michael Lobo has earlier said that there is a need to decongest Panaji’s arterial road, D B Marg, and therefore the offices and operations of the six offshore casinos will be shifted to the tourism department’s river cruise jetty. He had said that the CoP and the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) will work out a plan to shift the offshore casino offices. As per plans, the firms were to bear the cost of shifting their premises. As casinos have been allowed to resume operations, Panjimites are set to face congestion yet again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/yet-another-casino-jetty-could-come-up-in-panaji/articleshow/86541466.cms||---

The government has initiated a major drive to make Goa Swayampurn in which Swayampurna Mitra, a government officer, is nominated for every panchayat and municipality, who dedicatedly attends to the people to inspire them to take benefits of various schemes and facilities that will help them be self sufficient. Desired results of this movement can be seen with various examples, he said speaking after inaugurating the major outreach programme Sarkar Tumchya Dari (government at your doorstep) for Canacona at the Government Higher Secondary Hall, Canacona. He said that in the coming three months many works that are pending in the Canacona constituency will be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pandemic-led-us-to-become-self-sufficient/articleshow/86541455.cms||---
---||Business||AAI urges CIL to reconsider coal supply halt by its arms||Kolkata: The Aluminium Association of India (AAI) has urged Coal India (CIL) to reconsider the decision of stopping coal supply to some non-power sectors by a few CIL subsidiaries. In a letter to the CIL CMD, the association has said, “This has reference to the upcoming crisis situation for the entire Aluminium Sector due to the ad hoc decision for stopping/drastically curtailing the coal supplies and rakes for non-power sector (NRS) majorly the Captive Power Plants (CPPs) resulting in coal crunch situation for aluminium sector.” According to AAI, adhoc decision without any advance notice has brought down the industry to a standstill and industry has been left out with no time to devise any mitigation plan to continue sustainable operations. “Also resorting to imports at such a short notice is not feasible and also not in the spirit of the government's vision to make a Self-Reliant India,” it added. The association has pointed out that huge investments of Rs 1.2 lakh crore have been made in this sector to double the domestic production capacity to 4.1 mtpa to cater the country’s increasing aluminium demand. The industry employs one million people and developed 4000 SMEs in the downstream sector. According to AAI, aluminium is a continuous process based highly power intensive industry wherein coal accounts for 40% of Aluminium production cost. Aluminium smelting requires uninterrupted quality power supply for production which can be met only through in-house CPPs. The Indian aluminium industry has set up 9000 MW CPP capacity to meet power requirement for the Smelter and refinery operations and reduce dependency on grid. Any power outage/ failure (2 hours or more) results in freezing of molten aluminium in the pots which will lead to shutting down of plant for at least 6 months rendering heavy losses and restart expenses, and once restarted will take almost a year to get desired metal purity. AAI has demanded immediate resumption of coal supply against secured linkages for sustainable industry operations and allocation of coal dispatches through rakes in proportion of 75% (power) and 25% (non-power), as per MoC circular for Auction Linkage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aai-urges-cil-to-reconsider-coal-supply-halt-by-its-arms/articleshow/86539391.cms||---

That is not true,” said the union minister. “When I became the law minister, I told the chief justice that whenever he needed me, I would always be there in the service of judges and the judiciary,” said Rijiju. “I am happy so many judges are present here. At times, when we face difficulties and cannot get things done politically, we place judges at the forefront. When judges are at the forefront, things get done fast,” he said. “In a democracy, it is important for us to have a lively relation amongst us (the judiciary, executive and legislature),” he added.

Police identified the accused as Amitesh Harmukh of Durg, Chhattisgarh, who was in the city to take part in an induction programme. Though the woman informed a senior IAF officer about the incident, no action was taken against Amitesh. Dissatisfied with the departmental inquiry, she approached the city police. “We received a complaint from her a few days ago. We registered an FIR against the officer and arrested him,” Coimbatore police commissioner Deepak M Damor said.

The policy talks about encouraging tourists to visit villages and explore the traditional Goan houses. The yet-to-be-formed Goa tourism board will designate villages conducive for development as “tourism villages”. The applicable standards for receiving the designation of tourism village will be defined so that villages can compete for the same in a transparent manner. Moving in that direction, the Goa government recently notified the “tourist villages development scheme” under which financial support of Rs 50 lakh will be given to villages every year. The scheme aims to promote rural life, art and culture and heritage. While the government has been talking about showcasing hinterlands of the state for many years, after the tourism policy was notified a year ago, forming the scheme has been the first tangible step in that direction. Goa has a rich cultural heritage, and post-Diwali most villages have zatras, but except a few big zatras and feasts, other cultural celebrations of the state have not been showcased to the outside. However, some foreign tourists who stay put in Pernem taluka do attend zatras and feasts. The policy also talks about having ecologically sustainable and environmentally sound practices in the development of nature-based tourism. Developing high-quality facilities in protected areas to increase the number and stay-duration of high-end visitors is also something that finds mention in the policy. The major aspects of the tourism policy will see the light of day after the tourism board is constituted. The composition of the board was finalised a while ago, but an order appointing the board is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-policy-shifts-focus-to-states-culture-heritage/articleshow/86541735.cms||---

His tweet on Sunday morning set off a frenzy with Thiaga Rajan’s supporters hitting out against those who had earlier questioned his capability. Chief minister M K Stalin had asked him and commercial taxes minister P Moorthy to work on reforms concerning Tamil Nadu, he pointed out. “Looking forward to now working with friends & colleagues to improve the process for all of India,” Thiaga Rajan added. The eight-member GoM for GST System Reforms will have Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar as the convenor. Besides Thiaga Rajan, the other members include Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala as well as finance ministers from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Assam among others. The GoM of GST System Reforms will review the IT tools and interfaces available with tax officers and suggest measures to make the system more effective and efficient, including changes in business processes. It will also identify potential sources of evasion and suggest changes in business processes and IT systems to plug revenue leakage. The Group of Ministers will identify possible use of data analysis towards better compliance and revenue. It will also identify mechanism for better coordination between “Central and State tax administration” and tax administration of different states and suggest timelines for changes recommended. An order from the Union ministry for finance said the GST Council at its 45th meeting on September 17 acknowledged that IT systems have stabilized and there is a need to introduce IT-based checks and balances in the GST IT System. The council also acknowledged use of data analysis like the BIFA system of GSTN and stressed on expanding use of data analytics in increasing the efficacy and efficiency of GST administration. Hence, the council decided that a GoM be set up to guide this process forward. The council had earlier set up two GoMs – one for IT challenges and another on revenue mobilization. “There is a substantial overlap between the work of these two GoMs and that of this proposed GoM. Hence the GoM of System Reforms is being constituted subsuming the earlier GoMs on IT challenges and revenue mobilization,” the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-minister-palanivel-thiaga-rajan-nominated-to-gom-set-up-for-gst-reforms/articleshow/86544040.cms||D Govardan

In his address to mark World Day of migrants and refugees, Ferrao remembered all Goans who have migrated to other states and countries, as well as all those who have migrated to Goa. “Let us work, each in our community, to include all and help the society and our Church become more inclusive,” he said. “Let us ensure that no human being is left behind or left out..., for we are 'called to dream together, fearlessly, as a single human family, as companions on the same journey, as sons and daughters of the same earth that is our common home, sisters, brothers all'”. He said that many of those who have moved away from their birthplace, particularly the poor, face innumerable hardships, generally created by the natives of the land they have moved to. “It is in this context that I would like to say, with Pope Francis, that we can no longer think in terms of ‘them’ and ‘those’, but only ‘us’, so that we can work towards an ever-wider ‘We’. And this ‘We’ is “a clear horizon for our common journey in the world,” he said. “In the world and within the Church, the ‘we’ “is crumbling and cracking due to myopic, aggressive forms of nationalism and radical individualism,” he said. “The victims of this are those who most easily become viewed as others — those who live on the peripheries and the marginalised, including migrants and refugees. As the Pope rightly says, ‘we are all in the same boat and called to work together so that there will be no more walls that separate us, no longer others, but only a single ‘We’, encompassing all of humanity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lets-make-society-church-more-inclusive-bishop/articleshow/86541857.cms||---
---||Goa||Govt extends time for Bainguinim plant bids||Panaji: The Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) has extended the time limit for accepting bids for the solid waste management facility at Bainguinim following several queries from bidders. The last date to submit the request for qualification (RFQ) was September 14 and it has been extended to September 29. This is the second time the corporation has floated the tender to set up the state-of-the-art solid waste management plant. The fresh tender was floated as not even a single company was found eligible. Now the criteria has been modified. A senior officer said the corporation is in the process of answering queries raised by bidders at the pre-bid meet. Six bidders have shown interest in setting up the plant. The plant, estimated to cost Rs 200 crore, is expected to cater to Tiswadi taluka. It will have facilities for recycling and sorting lines, segregation, bio-methanation and composting systems. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) acquired the land at Bainguinim to set up the waste management plant, and in 2017, the land was handed over to GWMC. A public hearing was held by GWMC and the environment clearance was also obtained. The corporation had also invited a RFQ for the proposed plant. The corporation decided to undertake the project through a public-private partnership (PPP) on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis. Shripad Naik, who was then Union Ayush minister, had said that the location identified for the at was “wrong and the government should rethink over it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-extends-time-for-bainguinim-plant-bids/articleshow/86541892.cms||---

The state added 1,694 new cases and 14 deaths to the Covid-19 registry. The number of active cases continue to increase gradually in the state for the nineteenth day in a row. Since September 8, when the state had 16,190 patients, this figure has been on the rise. At present, there are 17,285 active cases in TN. This is because the recovery rate has not gone up on a par with the fresh infection count. Three weeks ago, TN was reporting roughly 1,500 new cases every day. It went beyond 1,700 this week. But throughout this time period, the daily discharge rate was around the 1,600-mark i.e., 98%. Experts, however, say this is not the start of a third wave as the test positivity rate (TPR) of all the districts is still below 2%t. On an average, more than 1.5 lakh samples are tested daily at 300 labs. Coimbatore once recorded the highest number of fresh cases (196) with a TPR of 1.8%. Thiruvarur (68) topped the state's TPR chart with 2% of the samples testing positive. In Chennai, the Covid situation seems to be stable with less than 200 people getting infected every day during the second half of this week. On Sunday, 190 tested positive. Of all the 2,087 patients undergoing treatment in the district, only less than half needed hospitalisation and remaining with mild infection were in home isolation. Greater Chennai Corporation officials attribute this to better vaccine coverage of late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/active-covid-cases-in-tamil-nadu-rise-for-19th-day-in-succession/articleshow/86544106.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Man asking for water turns out to be robber||CHENNAI: A masked man sneaked into a house in Avadi on Saturday evening and, under the pretext of seeking water, snatched an eight sovereign gold chain from a woman. Rajakumari, a 58-yearold tailor who lived at ICF Colony in Ambattur, was overseeing work on a home the family was building on a plot at Morai in Avadi when the incident occurred. Around 6pm, the workers engaged in the construction had left and Rajakumari was watering a row of plants when a man approached her and asked for a glass of water. Believing that he was genuinely thirsty, she entered the house under construction to bring him water. The man too followed her, but Rajakumari failed to notice this as she did not switch on the lights, a police officer said. Before she could lift the water jug, the man overpowered her, snatched the eight sovereign chain, worth about Rs 2.8 lakh, and escaped from the scene of crime, the officer said. Rajakumari cried out for help and tried to give chase when he pushed her down. Before any of the woman’s neighbours could arrive, the man had escaped in the dark. Based on a complaint from the woman, the Avadi Tank Factory police registered a case and have launched a hunt for the accused, who appeared to be in his late 20s, based on the identity provided by Rajakumari. His face was not visible as he had covered it using a cloth. Police suspect he had come to the place on a bike and parked it at a distance before escaping on it. They are also looking into whether the man received any input from the team of construction labourers and targeted her because they were the only ones who knew that the victim was alone. They are likely to interrogate the workers as well. “We are collecting the CCTV camera footage from the main road, to establish the identity of the man,” said an investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-man-asking-for-water-turns-out-to-be-robber/articleshow/86544118.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After Pujas, more to come under Duare Ration ambit||Kolkata: A larger population in Bengal will receive Duare Ration (doorstep delivery of ration) from October 17, immediately after the Pujas. The second phase of the scheme’s pilot run will involve 50% of ration dealers in the state. The pilot project that had kicked off on September15 involved 15% of fair price shops. Claiming the pilot run a “success”, food and supplies minister Rathin Basu said: “We will extend the ambit of pilot-run from 15% to 50% of shops under Duare Ration scheme to identify teething issues and to resolve them in the pilot run itself.” More than 10,000 fair price shops out of 20,268 in Bengal will start delivering ration on doorstep. In Kolkata, more than 450 ration dealers will take part in the project. The Duare Ration pilot project will continue till November-end so that all anomalies can be ironed out effectively, a senior officer said. From December, the food and civil supplies department aims to roll out hassle-free delivery of ration on doorstep of all 10.3 crore beneficiaries in the state. “We have already offered them a subsidy of Rs 1 lakh for purchasing a vehicle for smoother and faster delivery of ration,” Ghosh said. Ration dealers were to divide all beneficiaries under their respective jurisdiction into 16 clusters and designate a fixed day of a week of each month for distribution of foodgrain in each cluster. The plan is to have a fixed distribution day in a month from first Tuesday till fourth Friday for all 16 clusters. Dates of the month may vary but day must be kept the same for each cluster. Saturdays will exclusively be for distribution from ration shops so that people who might have been missed or might want to collect foodgrain from the shop can do so. The second half of Sunday would be reserved to distribute foodgrain in Duare Ration mode for clusters that might have been missed due to holidays or inclement weather. The entire ration for one month will be delivered to a beneficiary at one go. The department has already brought out a detailed guideline regarding execution of the pilot project for October 17 and has circulated it among the dealers. Ration dealers, however, have made an appeal to the government to exempt October from the Duare Ration scheme. “We have only 19 working days in the festive month of October. Since Duare Ration is a time-consuming affair, we fear many beneficiaries may not be reached. If it is resumed in November, dealers can do it with full vigour,” said Biswambhar Basu, general secretary, All India Fair Price Shop Dealers’ Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-pujas-more-to-come-under-duare-ration-ambit/articleshow/86541235.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Dressed in all-black clothes with black masks covering their faces, a group of youngsters held protests at Mrugavani National Park and KBR Park in a bid to urge the government to protect Hyderabad’s lung spaces. The youngsters held placards that read, ‘Hyderabad demands climate action now’, ‘Make Earth cool again’ and ‘Uproot the system, not the trees.’ “We chose to wear black outfits as a way to demonstrate how our lungs are turning black due to green spaces disappearing in the city,” said Vanita Khatter, a green warrior. The group of 25 people staged the protest outside the main gate of the park, where the Telangana government had proposed to fell 1850 trees to make way for overhead power transmission lines. Nishat Anaira, an 18-year-old activist, said, “We need to protect the trees and forests that we have, it is our only hope.” Later on Friday, a group of green activists and students gathered at People’s Plaza in Necklace Road as part of a protest organised by the Telangana unit of Fridays for Future, a global movement started by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Avanthika, a student and coordinator of Fridays For Future Telangana, said, “We want the government to know that we will be the most affected in the future and we need change right now. We need to act fast towards climate justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-activists-dress-in-all-black-clothes-to-depict-their-lungs-turning-black-due-to-lack-of-green-spaces/articleshow/86534325.cms||---

---||Kolkata||BJP poll campaign gets a touch of Bhojpuri, courtesy Manoj Tiwari||Kolkata: Residents of Bhowanipore got a surprise taste of chaste Bhojpuri on Sunday morning as actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari knocked on their doors. Sunday was the last weekend for parties to campaign ahead of the September 30 bypoll. Dressed in a sky-blue shirt and trousers, Tiwari sought votes for BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal at Ambedkar Colony, home to mostly people from Bihar and Jharkhand. The neighbourhood was abuzz with news of the Bhojpuri superstar’s visit, with many coming out on their balconies with mobile phones to record the event. Tiwari did not disappoint, singing a few lines of devotional songs from his superhit movies. “Hamra poora viswas... jo bhav se hum ail ba ni, humni ke o bhav poora hoi (the intention with which I have come will surely be fulfilled),” he said to a cheering crowd. He accompanied Tibrewal to Chetla and distributed pamphlets asking people to vote for her. While they were visiting houses, some Trinamool Congress workers started shouting slogans at the duo, telling them to go back. Tiwari, who used to work in Kolkata in the 1980s and lived in Salt Lake, raked up the outsider issue. “They are now terming us outsiders just to please a community. They want to divide us on linguistic lines,” he said. The actor-singer also went to a ‘chai pe charcha’ at Chakraberia and then to a dhaba. As he reached the Vardan market area, hawkers approached to meet and greet him. Union minister and MP from Bankura Subhas Sarkar went to ward 70 to campaign for Tibrewal. “This is going to be a tough fight and Tibrewal might pull off a surprise. It is clear that Trinamool is losing confidence. It seems from the chief minister’s speech that she is not confident of winning this time,” Sarkar said. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari said that TMC had imposed the bypoll on the people of Bhowanipore. “My club had to take the court’s permission to perform Durga Puja this time. The permission for the puja was withdrawn only because I am into opposition politics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-poll-campaign-gets-a-touch-of-bhojpuri-courtesy-manoj-tiwari/articleshow/86541232.cms||Rohit Khanna

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee alerted people about the deluge-like situation likely on Monday and Tuesday during a poll campaign on Sunday. “It might not be as gusty as Amphan or Yaas,” she said, but advised all to stay indoors for the duration of the storm. The CM sounded warnings on high rainfall and lightning and also asked CESC and KMC to be extra cautious. Bengal chief secretary H K Dwivedi held a meeting with DMs and senior officials to review cyclone preparedness. NDRF teams had been kept ready at various places to help the administration if an emergency arises, an official said. The districts of North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore, Howrah, Hooghly and Bankura have been specially alerted and fishermen asked not to sail out to sea. Additional commissioner of Kolkata Police Tanmoy Roy Choudhuri is heading the unified command centre at Lal Bazar comprising teams from CESC, PWD (Civil & Electrical), Disaster Management Group of Kolkata Police, fire, KMC and the irrigation department. Boats have been anchored tightly to the shore by river traffic. Police stations have been asked to keep a list of dilapidated buildings in their area handy. “Around 1 lakh from Gosaba block and another 50,000 from Sagar will be evacuated. People from Ghorama and Mousuni islands will also be shifted,” said Bankim Hazra, Sunderbans affairs minister.

Five persons were later allowed into the area for campaigning. The rally was being led by CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty and candidate Srijeeb Biswas when cops put up a guard rail at Harish Chatterjee Street. They told CPM workers not to enter the area near CM Mamata Banerjee’s home. Some, however, broke the barricade and tried to proceed forcefully, leading to a scuffle with police. Biswas was allegedly shoved when he tried to move forward. Chakraborty claimed that the party had permission for the rally and the plan had been announced earlier. “It is a rule of royalty in West Bengal. They have to start treating us as citizens with democratic rights. We have given a letter well in advance to the police seeking permission. Campaigning in the area is the democratic right of the candidate. We have necessary permission from the Election Commission. Why should we be stopped then?” he said.  “It clearly shows that Trinamool Congress is afraid and now they are stopping us from campaigning,” he added. Trinamool leader and minister Firhad Hakim said such attempts to enter the area near the CM’s home were an effort to catch the media’s attention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cpm-workers-clash-with-cops-as-rally-stalled/articleshow/86541463.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Prashant Kishor makes his debut on Bhowanipore voter rolls||KOLKATA: A voter of St Helen’s School in ‘159’ Bhowanipore assembly constituency whose details surfaced on social media on Saturday night may have political ramifications beyond Bengal. The voter’s name is Prashant Kishor. According to local sources, Kishor’s Kolkata address is 121 Kalighat Street, not far from chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s 30B Harish Chatterjee Street home and Abhishek Banerjee’s home on Harish Mukherjee Road. The Kalighat Street address was home to Abhishek till he shifted out to where he stays now. It still has a small hardware store named after Abhishek. Incidentally, sources claimed Kishor had applied to be a Bhowanipore voter much before Bengal assembly polls, which concluded in May. “This is not new. He had become a voter in March. He was a Bhowanipore voter when elections were held here on April 27,” said a Trinamool Congress block functionary who is part of the party’s poll team in Bhowanipore. Kishor, however, did not vote. Based on documents available on social media which haven’t been disputed till now, Kishor became a Bhowanipore voter during electoral roll revisions from January 15 to April 7. Kishor himself did not make any public statement on this. Kishor is from Bihar before he shifted his work base to Kolkata after July 2019 to help Trinamool’s Bengal election campaign. He has been part of several political campaigns after working with BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls but it is still not known whether he opted to be a voter in any place he worked. Asked about it, CM Banerjee’s chief election agent in Bhowanipore Baishwanar Chattopadhyay said: “Bhowanipore has over 2 lakh voters. It is not possible immediately to say whether Kishor is among them. But for the sake of argument, what is wrong in it? He is an Indian citizen and can choose to vote from wherever he wants. This is his right.” BJP took potshots at this, first tweeting the list of additions to Bhowanipore’s electoral rolls, with its media-in-charge Saptarshi Chowdhury asking whether Bengal’s daughter now needs an outsider to vote. But it was former Tripura and Meghalaya governor Tathagata Roy who tweeted this could be part of a “design” to send Kishor to Rajya Sabha. Trinamool has one vacant seat in Rajya Sabha after the resignation of Arpita Ghosh on September 15. BJP’s Bhowanipore candidate Priyanka Tibrewal’s chief election agent Sajal Ghosh quipped: “He isn’t an outsider any more but a local boy (ghorer chele).” Kishor, who had said he was severing ties with I-Pac after the Bengal elections, had been in Delhi and met senior opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. I-Pac is working closely with Trinamool in Bengal and Tripura campaigns, including the Bhowanipore bypoll. On September 20, Kishor along with Abhishek had met CM Banerjee and then accompanied her to a Bhowanipore temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pk-makes-his-debut-on-bhowanipore-voter-rolls/articleshow/86541141.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Voice-loss scare in Kolkata Covid survivors temporary, assure doctors||KOLKATA: Numerous Covid survivors across the city have reported a partial or complete loss in voice, which has been leaving them panicky. Doctors have said that this often happens following Covid-induced larynx infection, and assured that this was completely reversible. The condition — in which many others are suffering from hoarseness of voice, following Covid-induced lung fibrosis — and some eventually suffering a complete loss of speech for weeks, is not directly caused by Covid, but because the disease is making them susceptible to larynx infections, said experts. “Even though Covid-triggered lung fibrosis is not responsible for voice loss, some are suffering a larynx infection, which is affecting their voice. It’s leaving them choked and unable to speak but it is unlikely to cause any long-term damage,” said Raja Dhar, director of pulmonology, CMRI Hospital, adding, “Most have regained their voice in a fortnight to three weeks.” Singer-composer Bappi Lahiri had apparently lost his voice temporarily after a Covid attack last April. While Covid mostly affects the lower respiratory system, in some cases it has been playing up in the upper respiratory tract, too, pointed out Sauren Panja, intensivist, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). “Consequently, it has been triggering laryngopharyngitis, or a simultaneous inflammation of the larynx and the pharynx. The larynx corresponds to the voice box — the air released from it activates the latter — and once it struggles to expel air due to the inflammation, the voice turns slow and low. For some, it has been quite acute, resulting in almost a complete loss of speech,” he explained. This has been happening between the first and third weeks of the Covid attack and may persist for up to three months, experts said. But it hasn’t yet caused complete loss of voice in any case. “It does trigger a panic among patients and their families. It has also made the affected patients depressed, with some even requiring counselling,” Panja said. Another reason behind a sudden loss of voice post-Covid is a lung infection. “The lung capacity decreases, so speaking turns laboured and slow. At times, these patients find it difficult to speak at all, and we advise them to take breaks while speaking. It improves with time as the infection gets cured,” said Panja. This is being referred to as the “Covid-19 voice” or hoarseness, which has been very common among patients across the world, physicians said. Internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas pointed out that Covid has also been leading to an inflammation of the vocal cord muscles, causing voice change or loss. “Apart from laryngopharyngitis, this also affects the voice, often making it squeaky or hoarse. Covid medicines, including steroids, are enough to treat the inflammation; once it subsides, the voice is regained. But it has been giving scares to many,” he added. Covid, however, is not directly responsible, Dhar said. “It merely makes the lungs susceptible to infection, leading to such a condition. But the virus mostly affects the lower respiratory system, which is why the number of such patients is not big.” Others, like Panja, however, argued that loss or alteration of voice may also occur due to something called “post-infection chronic fatigue syndrome.” “General fatigue and lack of energy may also affect the voice, making it very low,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/voice-loss-scare-in-kolkata-covid-survivors-temporary-assure-docs/articleshow/86541324.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

CM Mamata Banerjee is referred to as Didi (elder sister) in Bengal and even outside. The Didi debate, which had flared up in poll-bound Bengal, has resurfaced ahead of Bhowanipore bypoll. Poll temperatures had soared after PM Narendra Modi’s reference to “Didi-o-Didi” in his election campaigns. CM Banerjee had referred to these as taunts at her. Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra had dubbed it an “insult to women”. Referring to vote-for-Priyanka Didi posters, Trinamool dubbed it copy-paste politics. “The Prime Minister used to mock our chief minister by calling her Didi-o-Didi and today we find the BJP candidate suddenly dropping her surname and calling herself Didi with photographs of Narendra Modi beside her. This is called copy-paste politics,” said Baishwanar Chattopadhyay, Banerjee’s chief election agent. “BJP has done nothing to promote their candidate and is therefore using the name the CM is addressed by across India. For us here in Bhowanipore and Bengal, Didi means Mamata Banerjee,” he added. Tibrewal said: “She is Mamata Didi, and I am Priyanka Didi. Bengal’s people started calling me Priyanka Didi when I was fighting cases for them. Didi is also a Hindi word.” She dismisses questions on whether this is an attempt to reach out to 60% Bengali-speaking voters in Bhowanipore. “When did the word Didi become Bengali or non-Bengali,” she said. “This Bengali and non-Bengali debate is a non-issue. Ultimately what matters is people’s love and support. When I fought cases, I didn’t know their surnames. Neither did they ask mine,” she added. Among Bhowanipore’s 2 lakh voters, around 40% don’t speak Bengali but most are old Kolkata residents. CM Banerjee refers to Bhowanipore as “mini-India”, repeatedly saying that both Bhowanipore and Bharat start with B. “The road from Bhowanipore will lead us to India,” she said on Sunday, speaking in Bengali, Hindi and English. Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty said Dada or Didi is used in Bengal to establish an immediate informal connection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/priyanka-didi-posters-copy-paste-politics-tmc/articleshow/86541188.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Mamata: How did Centre decide on aptness of Rome event?||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday again lashed out at the Centre, questioning how it decided that the global peace conference in Rome was “fit or unfit for her to attend”. The Centre had informed the Bengal government on Friday that Banerjee could not travel to Rome to attend the conference as the event “is not commensurate at the level of a chief minister”. The issue gained a larger hue with Subramanian Swamy also questioning the Centre on the issue. Swamy posted on Twitter: “Why was Bengal CM Mamata prevented by the Home Ministry from attending an international conference in Rome? Which law prevented her going?” He also questioned the Centre’s not-fit-for-CM reasoning and added that the Prime Minister should permit Banerjee to travel to Rome. Banerjee said: “If there is peace anywhere in the country, then it is in Bengal. And that is the reason why I was invited. But those who are jealous, they don’t allow it and say the event is not fit. Who decides what is fit and what is unfit? Several states don’t even take permission from the Centre (for foreign trips by CMs). I always seek permission because it relates to external affairs.” She was speaking at a Bhowanipore campaign rally. Banerjee further said: “How can you stop me from speaking from here? I welcome the global peace meet and thank the Italian government for organising special permission for me.” “Earlier, I wasn’t allowed to go to Chicago,” she continued. “My China visit was also cancelled. I wasn’t allowed to speak at Cambridge University, even St Stephen’s College in Delhi. How many invitations will you cancel? Keep counting your fingers.” Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee said: “BJP is making the same mistake as Congress. Congress didn’t allow Narendra Modi to go to the USA and look, they are no longer in power now and can’t stop him any more. The same thing is going to happen with BJP. They are repeating the mistake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-how-did-centre-decide-on-aptness-of-rome-event/articleshow/86541318.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chennai||Chennai: Keep pots & pans closed, dengue cases up||CHENNAI: The city has recorded close to 200 dengue cases in two months and the number is likely to go up as the dengue season in the city peaks in October-November. Data shows children below 15 years were most infected and Tondiarpet, Ambattur, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Adyar zones were dengue hotspots. Of the 100 dengue-infected in August, 38 were younger than 15 as were 51 of 96 cases reported in September. This isn’t unprecedented as the city has seen 11 dengue outbreaks in the past 20 years, said S Selvakumar, chief vector control officer. Data on dengue cases from 1999 to 2019, prepared as part of a research paper authored by the health secretary J Radhakrishnan and vector control officers of GCC, shows dengue cases usually start in July, after the summer showers, and peak in October-November. The cases begin to dip by December as the northeast monsoon rain, usually heavy, washes away eggs, larvae from breeding spots. The data also showed the highest number of cases were reported in 2001 — 736, followed by 616 in 2002 and around 500 in 2003, 2004 and 2005. There was a dip before it rose again in 2017, 2018 and 2019 when 408, 636 and 618 cases were reported. The study titled ‘Dengue in Chennai - A retrospective study’ included data only from sentinel surveillance hospitals — a network created to monitor rate of occurrence of specific diseases. Mosquito menace complaints to the corporation helpline 1913 also rose to 306 in the past two weeks from 266 in the preceding fortnight. This was despite the civic body intensifying fogging. Vector control experts said cases were fewer last year due to the lockdowns. “Aedes mosquito breeds in fresh water and a recent GCC review showed that most common sources for its larvae were water tanks, storage drums, pots and terraces,” said Selvakumar. When asked about reasons for the spike in cases, a senior official said that apart from the intermittent rain, domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) who go house-to-house were busy with vaccination drivers and other Covid work. “The city has 3,621 DBCs and each has to check at least 80 houses every day. Since they go to the same houses for Covid work, many either skip dengue checks or do not report actual data,” the official said. If it turns into an epidemic this year, it will be a double burden on the civic body which is also dealing with Covid-19. The problem is that some symptoms such as fever is common in both dengue and Covid, said Manish Narnaware, deputy commissioner, health. “People should remember that dengue usually causes severe pain in the joints and may become haemorrhagic if not treated on time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-keep-pots-pans-closed-dengue-cases-up/articleshow/86544151.cms||Komal Gautham

The New York district court delayed the tax suit to November 18, according to court documents. This follows Cairn Energy and Air India jointly asking the court to stay further proceedings in view of the government enacting a fresh law to scrap retrospective taxation in the country. The new law will result in withdrawal of the Rs 10,247-crore tax demand that the government had sought from Cairn. Sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the finance ministry is framing rules that will lead to withdrawal of the retrospective tax demand on Cairn and 16 other companies, including Vodafone Group of UK. These rules require the companies to withdraw all litigations against the government in return for being refunded any money that was collected to force the retrospective tax demand. A format for the undertaking that the companies will have to furnish committing to withdraw litigations is under finalisation and should be released in coming days, they said. Companies will have to use that format to give an undertaking, after which the money will be refunded. In all, the government has to return about Rs 8,100 crore, of which Rs 7,900 crore is due only to Cairn. Cairn has indicated that the refund, without interest and penalty, was acceptable to it — opening an avenue to settle the seven-year-old dispute with Indian authorities||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/us-court-halts-suit-allowing-cairn-to-settle-row-with-india/articleshow/86544199.cms||---

A lance naik then, Harbans Singh was with the 18 Punjab Regiment when the conflict started. Tasked with capturing vital posts in Kargil, Harbans and his brothers in arms succeeded in taking over six posts in a day, after they had climbed up a steep mountain pass and launched a surprise attack on the Pakistanis. “It was our good luck as we managed to cross the Barachil Pass at the right time,” he says. The 10 medals that have been awarded to him for contribution to the defence of the nationAccording to Harbans, who now lives in Banur and was awarded 10 medals during his military career spanning from 1962 to 1988, the Indian Army had planned a silent attack on the enemy as the other side had the advantage of its posts being at a greater height. “A lot of discussion at the senior level was held on this plan, as some seniors were not willing to risk soldiers; but, in the end, officers decided to go ahead. On December 8-9 midnight, we had dropped our luggage before crossing a chashma (watercourse) to reach Barachil Pass. In the luggage, we had food and water. We reached Barachil Pass without any ambush. This was because we came to know later, enemy soldiers were busy comforting a soldier who had fallen ill,” he adds.  Naib Subedar Harbans Singh (retd) at his village, BanurOnce they crossed the Barachil Pass, Harbans’ company waited for around four hours. “We launched a silent attack around 4.30 am to take advantage of the darkness in the dawn. Amid the war cries of ‘Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal,’ we first captured Barachil post, and then Bulbul, Hathi Matha and Trishul posts, which were also located at higher locations, and then Pani and Ghoda posts, which were downhill,” adds Harbans, who retired as a naib subedar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/midnight-mountain-pass-and-army-valour/articleshow/86540831.cms||Bharat Khanna

Saraswat, former DRDO chief, expressed reservations over the tender — which has also been challenged in Delhi high court by lobby group Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (TEMA) — through a communication sent to the telecom ministry in April, top sources told TOI. ‘BSNL should put tender on hold till changes are made’At a time when India is trying to build its capabilities in the telecommunications sector, there are no provisions in the Detailed Note for Inviting Tenders (DNIT) to facilitate/ support the development of indigenous capabilities. It appears that the eligibility criteria mentioned in the DNIT are deliberately designed to bar Indian companies from participating in the said project,” Saraswat said in a letter, which has been reviewed by TOI. “Since connectivity between the mainland and the Lakshwadeep Islands is a matter of strategic and national importance, we need to ensure that the network being developed… is robust, reliable, secure, indigenous, and cost-effective… I am of the opinion that BSNL should put this tender on hold till the necessary changes are made to promote participation by Indian companies,” Saraswat said. The 1,772km project aims to lay submarine cable between Kochi and 11 islands of Lakshadweep. The plan – announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15, 2020 -- is to provide a bandwidth of 100 GBPS in the areas, improving mobile services, and boosting e-governance and e-commerce initiatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/key-tender-designed-to-bar-indian-firms-niti-member/articleshow/86544250.cms||Pankaj Doval

The system eliminates filing multiple applications across ministries and state government departments, and also allows automatic renewal. “This is for the first time 18 states have come on board. Once you file an application with required documents, you don’t need to visit any office. The system has been designed to guide and help the applicants in a very simple manner,” said outgoing DPIIT secretary, Giridhar Aramane. These states include Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Punjab. So far, 32 ministries and Central government departments have joined the platform. The website of the single window system shows that till Sunday, the central government departments had given approvals for 542 applications. The applicants need to register for getting log-in and password. Since the system is aimed at streamlining the feeding of information, processing of applications, there is one-time capturing of information and the documents can be submitted at one place. “For every application, there is a fixed time period for processing. Since some applications may require security clearance, time periods for processing are different. This is a single online interface to identify, apply and track registration and approvals for entrepreneurs or investors,” Aramane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/single-window-system-to-boost-ease-of-doing-biz/articleshow/86544312.cms||---

---||World||Australian PM may not join climate summit: report||SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, under pressure to adopt a 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target, said in an interview published Monday that he may not join this year's landmark UN climate summit in Glasgow. The world's biggest coal exporter and still reliant on the fossil fuel for most of its electricity, Australia has not made a firm commitment on its own greenhouse gas reductions. Morrison has vowed to mine and export fossil fuels as long as there are buyers. Asked about attending the global climate crisis conference in November, Morrison told the West Australian newspaper: "We have not made any final decisions." "I mean it is another trip overseas and I have been on several this year and spent a lot of time in quarantine," he was quoted as saying. "I have to focus on things here and with Covid. Australia will be opening up around that time. There will be a lot of issues to manage and I have to manage those competing demands." The 12-day meeting in Scotland, the biggest climate conference since landmark talks in Paris in 2015, is seen as a crucial step in setting worldwide emissions targets to slow global warming. Morrison's government has suggested it will achieve net-zero carbon emissions "as soon as possible", and preferably by 2050, but has not made any commitments to do so. The Australian prime minister told the paper he was trying to bring the government and the country together on future commitments so as to provide certainty for the next 20-30 years. He has been in tough negotiations over setting a net-zero target within the conservative coalition government, an alliance of his own Liberal Party and the Nationals, who have much of their support base in rural and mining communities. Climate scientists warn extreme weather and fierce fires will become increasingly common due to manmade global warming. Environmentalists argue inaction on climate change could cost Australia's economy billions of dollars as the country suffers more intense bushfires, storms and floods. Asked if he would commit to a specific climate target in a separate interview with The Australian newspaper, the prime minister replied: "I can assure you we will have a plan." Morrison told the paper that Australia's position as the primary energy exporter in the Asia-Pacific region would change and it was important to make a transition towards a low-emission economy. The prime minister added, however, that the change had to be managed so "things keep running, things stay open, things keep getting dug out of the ground for some considerable time, you have to keep making stuff, you have to keep eating things and the world needs food".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australian-pm-may-not-join-climate-summit-report/articleshow/86544337.cms||---

Thousands of people were evacuated to safety. As the cyclone made landfall between 7.30 pm and 8.30 pm, the gales gusted to 95 kmph. Huge trees and electricity poles were uprooted, blocking roads and disrupting power supply in many areas. Thousands of people were evacuated to safety. The railways had either cancelled or changed the schedule of a few trains as a precautionary measure. The sea was rough all through the day even as heavy rains with strong gales hit several areas in north coastal Andhra and a few places in south coastal region of the state. The worst-hit district was Srikakulam. After crossing the coast, the storm lay centred over north coastal Andhra Pradesh about 160 km south-southwest of Gopalpur (Odisha) and 30 km west of Kalingapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). Gulab to weaken into deep depression today, bring moderate to heavy rainsIt is likely to move west-northwestwards and weaken into a deep depression on Monday morning. Under its impact, moderate to heavy rainfall is likely in parts of Telangana, Odisha and AP. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and assured all help. The PM said he was praying for the safety of everyone. Jagan explained the measures initiated by the government and said that special teams from SDRF and NDRF were deputed in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. Jagan directed collectors of districts along the coast to be on high alert and directed collectors to set up control rooms at every ward and village secretariat. The deceased was a fisherman, while five others in the boat managed to reach the shore after their boat capsized in the Bay of Bengal near Akkupalle in Srikakulam in the rough sea. The dead fisherman was identified as Bunga Mohan Rao, a native of Manchinillapeta village under Vajrapukottur mandal in Srikakulam. The fishermen had gone to Odisha a few days ago to purchase a boat which overturned while they were on their way back. In a separate incident, another fisherman, M Ramu, was hurt after a boat capsized in the Bay of Bengal near Chepalakamcheru village under Bhogapuram mandal in Vizianagaram. He was shifted to a government hospital and is stable. The Srikakulam district administration evacuated 1,358 people and shifted them to rehabilitation centres in parts of Vajrapukotturu mandal. About 40 rehabilitation camps have been set up. Heavy gales uprooted trees in some areas under Gara and Mandasa mandals. Electricity was affected in a few areas of Srikakulam as overhead wires snapped. Heavy rain accompanied by strong gales lashed Narasannapeta, Kaviti, Golavanipeta, Palasa in Srikakulam and a few parts under Bhogapuram mandal in Vizianagaram. Vizag city witnessed continuous rainfall on Sunday evening. There were no casualties from Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. However, standing crops were damaged in some areas of these districts. AP State Disaster Management Authority commissioner K Kanna Babu reviewed the situation with collectors and senior officials in Visakhapatnam. He said NDRF and SDRF teams were positioned in the three north coastal districts for rescue and relief operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-on-alert-many-evacuated-as-cyclone-gulab-hits-state/articleshow/86537641.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Kochi||Kerala: Child marriages prevail in plantation areas in Idukki||IDUKKI: There has been an increase in child marriages since the outbreak of Covid-19 among the Tamil communities in the plantation areas of Idukki. Data from the district child protection unit reveal that three child marriages were held and seven stopped in the district in nine months in 2021. In comparison, two child marriages were conducted and 13 were prevented in 2020. In the latest incident a case was registered against the parents of a minor girl who was married off to 24-year old youth on September 9 in Bison Valley. “In 2018, three child marriages were held and 14 stopped. Due to awareness campaigns and vigilance on the part of the officials no child marriages were reported in the district in 2019 while seven such attempts were prevented. But during the pandemic-induced lockdown the number of cases has increased,” said district child protection officer Geetha M G. “All the cases were reported among the Tamil communities in the plantation sector areas. Earlier, the Anganvadi teachers used to frequently visit each and every home and gather information. But since the outbreak of the pandemic, they have not been able to make such visits,” said the official. She said child marriages were earlier reported in tribal communities in the district. “Now, the people are aware that the cases are punishable under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso Act). However, such marriages still continue to be held among the Tamil community in the plantation sector,” the official said. Authorities said in some cases, the families send off the couple after their marriage to Tamil Nadu. “The recent marriage of the Plus XII student was fixed six months ago and the district child protection unit had prevented the marriage through an injection order. But the family violated the order and went on to conduct the marriage. We will take strict action against them to prevent such incidents,” said Geetha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-child-marriages-prevail-in-plantation-areas-in-idukki/articleshow/86544320.cms||Sandeep Thomas

"The Taliban have banned stylish hairstyles and shaving beards in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan," The The Frontier Post reported citing the Taliban's letter. The publication further stated that officials from the Ministry of Islamic Orientation, at a meeting with representatives of men's hairdressing salons in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, advised against styling hair and shaving beards. The order, distributed on social networks, also contains a request not to play music or hymns on the premises of hairdressing salons, The Frontier Post reported. Meanwhile, the Taliban is re-imposing repressive laws and retrograde policies. They are imposing laws that defined its 1996-2001 rule when they enforced their version of Islamic Sharia law. Amid reports of large-scale human rights violations by the Taliban in Afghanistan, the outfit earlier had put on public display the bodies of four people who were killed after they allegedly carried out a kidnapping in the western city of Herat. It is been over a month since the Taliban captured Kabul after an aggressive and rapid advance against Afghanistan government forces amid the withdrawal of US and NATO troops from the country. The country plunged into crisis last month after Kabul fell to the Taliban and the democratically elected government of former president Ashraf Ghani collapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-ban-barbers-from-trimming-beards-in-afghanistans-helmand-province/articleshow/86544391.cms||---

The data shows that the total number of crimes committed by juveniles in the state in 2020 was 331. The crime rate (crime incidence per one lakh population) for the same in the state, 3.5, is low as compared to the national average rate of 6.2. However, the data shows that our children are still very prone to being in conflict with the law. As per the data, 44 cases of rape were committed by juveniles in the state. There were 12 cases for assault on women with intent to outrage their modesty against juveniles and 22 cases against juveniles under the Pocso Act. Juveniles were also booked in six cases of murder, five cases of attempt to commit murder and six cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The highest number of cases in which minors were involved was looting. As many as 58 cases were taken against minors for theft and 22 for burglary. Thirty juveniles were booked by the state police for rash driving in 2020. The data also shows the educational and family background of the children who were in conflict with law. Out of the 434 juveniles, 402 were living with their parents. Twenty among them were living with guardians while 12 were homeless. In Kerala, 224 out of the 434 juveniles who were apprehended in 2020 have the education level between primary school and matriculation. As many as 166 had studied above matriculation while 24 had an education above higher secondary. Only 20 had the education level below primary school and none were illiterate, the data shows. Meanwhile, the number of crimes committed by juveniles is on a downward trend with 475 cases reported in 2018, 451 in 2019 and only 331 in 2020. Of the 434 apprehended juveniles and 327 juveniles whose cases were pending disposal at the beginning of the year, 52 were released either due to the cases getting quashed or since they were discharged by courts. Of them, 286 were sent home after advice or admonition. As many as 68 were sent to special homes or institutes and 13 were dealt with fines. Five were awarded imprisonment and 31 were discharged or acquitted. Overall 92.3% of the juveniles were found guilty and 306 cases are pending disposal, the data shows. Child welfare committee chairperson Bitty Joseph said that all children who were in conflict with the law are also children who are in need of care and protection. “Children are forced to be in conflict with the law mostly due to their living situation. Lack of effective parenting and broken families are among the reasons for this. Children are not getting enough care in families where parents have extra marital affairs. Economic factor is another reason. When both parents are struggling to make ends meet, children can face a lack of adequate care,” said Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/434-juveniles-nabbed-in-kerala-for-various-offences-in-2020/articleshow/86544284.cms||Disney Tom

During this period, all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions will be closed throughout the country, the SKM said. However, exemptions to the bandh include all emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies. SKM has assured that the bandh will be enforced in a voluntary and peaceful manner. "It was on September 27th that President Shri Ram Nath Kovind assented to and brought into force the 3 anti-farmer black laws last year. Tomorrow, there will be a total Bharat Bandh observed around the country from 6 am to 4 pm," SKM said in an official statement. In view of the protest, SKM has put out detailed guidelines and called for complete peace during the bandh. It also appealed to all citizens of the country to join the Bandh today. Speaking to ANI, SKM leader Rakesh Tikait said, "The roads will be closed, but if someone wants to go to the doctor's clinic, they can go. Ambulances, vegetable and milk vehicles will run. Apart from that, everything will be closed. All traders and shopkeepers should support the bandh. We will not go inside Delhi during the bandh. Where there are toll blocks, they will be closed. This is the movement of the common people. People should take a day off and leave the house only after 4 o'clock." Meanwhile, the Bharat Bandh garnered support from more than 500 farmer organizations, 15 trade unions, political parties, six state governments and varied sections of society. State governments of Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Punjab, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh have extended their support to the Bharat Bandh protest. So far, left parties like the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, All India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party and many other parties like Indian National Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam Party, Janata Dal (Secular), Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, SAD-Sanyukt, Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Swaraj India and others have extended their support to the Bharat Bandh. Moreover, Central Trade Unions will organise a protest rally at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi at 11 am on Monday. Several bar associations and local units of the All India Lawyers' Union have extended their support. A Kisan Mahapanchayat was held on Sunday in Panipat just a day before the Bharat Bandh. There was a 'Mashaal juloos' in Jaipur on Saturday, in addition to such torch processions in Gurgaon, Palwal and Patna. In Mysuru, a bike rally was organised. Farmers have been protesting at different sites since November 26 last year against the three enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Farmer leaders and the Centre have held several rounds of talks but the impasse remains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-unions-call-for-bharat-bandh-today/articleshow/86544459.cms||---

The drive is being organized to extend the vaccination coverage across the state. In the last three vaccination drives MP had made record vaccinations in a day— 17.62 lakh people, 24.94 lakh on August 25 and 29.22 lakh on September 17. The state also has topped in vaccination on each of these days. Till now, barring Bhopal, Indore and Betul districts that achieved 100% vaccinations, others have a coverage ranging between 70% and 84%. If this is to be extended to 100% by month end as the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan desires, the state government has a big task ahead. And, an extensive drive to reach out to those left out is the only way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-eyes-100-vaccination-with-mega-drive-4-today/articleshow/86541248.cms||---

Senior police inspector Rajendra Mokashi said the victim, Sundar Shiva Pawar, a resident of Alifnagar in Loni Kalbhor, was going towards Theur with two friends on the motorcycle around 1.30pm when the tempo, carrying medicines to Theur, overtook him and grazed the motorcycle. Pawar sped ahead of the tempo, intercepted it and confronted the driver, Aditya Sudhir Dharashivkar (23) of Hadapsar. “A heated verbal exchange ensued. Dharashivkar started kicking and punching Pawar. By the time Pawar’s friends and others could intervene, Dharashivkar had dealt serious blows which resulted in Pawar collapsing. His friends rushed him to a hospital in Loni Kalbhor, where he was declared dead on arrival,” Mokashi said. Dharashivkar tried to flee after the assault, but Pawar’s friends and passersby caught him and handed him over to the police. A case of murder was registered following a complaint by Pawar’s brother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-biker-kicked-punched-by-tempo-driver-dies/articleshow/86544499.cms||---

Five students from Karnataka figure among the top 10 and 44 from the state in the top 100 in the results announced here on Sunday. Top 10 rank-holders include Gaurav Kataria (from Rajasthan, third), two from Kota and one each from Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Some 44,111 (of them 27,479 were from outside Karnataka) candidates wrote the test on Sept 14. 1.2k from K’taka got 90-100 percentileMore than 44,000 candidates had appeared for the UG Entrance Test 2021 held by the Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental College of Karnataka (Comed-K). The results for the September 14 exam were announced on Sunday. Bengaluru's Veeresh B Patil topped the test and five students from Karnataka figure among the top10. Since the exam was conducted in two sessions, percentile scores of the candidates were considered for announcing the ranks. At least 4,660 candidates were in the 90-100 percentile bracket, and 1,244 of them were from Karnataka. Similarly, 1,193 students of 4,343 candidates who secured between the 80th and 90th percentile were from Karnataka. Topper Veeresh said, “The PU results were expected (since they were based on a formula), but that wasn’t exciting as I did not work specifically for it. This brings me immense joy.” The boy with 187th rank in JEE Mains is preparing for its Advanced exam. “I’m eyeing computer science in IIT-Delhi. I love coding. It requires a lot of analytical skills and cannot be derived from learning books,” he said. Shiva Sudhan R, from Bengaluru’s Jayanagar, stood second in the UGET results. Shiva has secured 25th rank in CET and 3,072 in JEE Mains. He is planning to get into aerospace engineering from IIT-Madras or Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. “My grandfather was working with HAL as aerospace engineer. I’ve heard stories of him from my grandmother. As a young kid, I read a lot of space magazines and have been fascinated by the cosmos,” said the boy, who received 491 on 500 in ISC. He said his strategy is to appear for as many mock tests as possible and analyse his results. Like last year, the Comed-K counseling would be conducted online and the candidates must upload the scanned copies of the documents from their login. A separate set of Counselling Process Document will be published on the website (www.comedk.org) shortly. A candidate has to pass II PU / Class 12 examination with English as one of the languages, physics and mathematics as compulsory subjects along with chemistry / biotechnology / biology / electronics / computer science to be eligible to admissions to private engineering colleges in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-pu-topper-aces-comed-k/articleshow/86544501.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Mega vaccination drive 4.0 amid fear of Madhya Pradesh missing 100% target||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had loosely set September 26, the deadline for 100% vaccination of first dose in the state, which could be extended up to September 30 for districts, which fail to achieve the target by the deadline. The decision to hold the fourth round of mega vaccination drive in the state on September 27 was ostensibly taken after it was felt that the target of 100% vaccination by September 30 could be difficult if the government relies on routine vaccination. Madhya Pradesh has topped the entire country in administering vaccines on the days when mega vaccination drives have taken place in the past. The million-dollar question that remain is whether the state will achieve the target of administering the first dose of vaccines to all the eligible persons on Monday, the day of the fourth mega vaccination drive in the state? In the presentation given at CM’s interaction with the members of the Crisis Management Groups up to ward and gram panchayat level on September 24, additional chief secretary Mohammad Suleman had said that vaccination in any of the 52 districts in the state is not less than 70% --Sidhi and Bhind is at the bottom with 74% and 72% vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mega-vac-drive-4-0-amid-fear-of-state-missing-100-target/articleshow/86541199.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Bhopal||20% in 20+ MP districts yet to get 1st shot, less than 19% in 25 districts so far||Bhopal: More than 20 districts in Madhya Pradesh are short of first dose vaccination target by 20% or more. Another 25 districts are yet too inoculate 10% to 19% of their eligible population to achieve the 100% first dose coverage for Covid-19 vaccine. The estimates are based on MP health department’s ‘vaccination strategy’ set in May which estimated doses for 5.49 crore people in the state. It leaves an estimated 78 lakh people unvaccinated in MP. Ahead of the state government’s fourth ‘mega vaccination’ drive on Monday, the health department had asked respective district collectors to present a revised estimate of eligible beneficiaries. “List of absent, resistance, dead and sick is being prepared. Our slogan ‘Ab koi bhi na chootey’ is a renewed effort to achieve 100% coverage,” said MP health immunization in charge, Dr Santosh Shukla. In effect, the health department is reviewing the list of beneficiaries and indications are the number could be far less than 78 lakh. ECI data of elector released in 2020, estimated eligible voters in the state to be 5.21 crore. The health department estimate in May was 5.49 crore. Health department could be off the mark by almost 28 lakh. Worst faring districts are Bhind, Alirajpur, Rewa and Satna, where put together almost 12 lakh people are yet to be given even their first dose of vaccine. Overall, 5.6 lakh doses of vaccination to protect against Covid-19 have been administered per day in September across Madhya Pradesh. Around 2.30 lakh doses were administered in Sunday. Total vaccination doses administered in MP stood at 6,10,96,146. First doses has been administered to 4,70,62,600 people. In Madhya Pradesh 1,40,33,546 are fully inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/20-in-20-mp-dists-yet-to-get-1st-shot-lt19-in-25-dists-so-far/articleshow/86541172.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Bengaluru||No aid to kin of 14 Covid martyrs from Karnataka private hospitals||BENGALURU: The state government has rejected applications for compensation from bereaved families of 14 doctors who succumbed to Covid-19, claiming the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojna is only for doctors involved in treating Covid-19 patients in government hospitals. The 14 doctors were involved in treating infected patients in private hospitals and the scheme offers compensation of Rs 50 lakh. The private hospitals association and Indian Medical Association have condemned the move, saying the government is discriminating between Covid-19 martyrs from government and private sectors. The state government said it processed a total of 45 applications, which were to be forwarded to the Centre, but withdrew 14 of them – all from families of doctors working in the private sector – on grounds that they were ineligible. While replying to a question in the state legislative assembly, health minister K Sudhakar said the state had received a total of 45 applications from April 1, 2020, and compensation was disbursed to families of 21 deceased doctors. Eight applications are still pending and 16 were withdrawn. The latter 16 includes applications from families of two doctors who worked in the health and family welfare department. While one from Chikkaballapur is said to have suffered from cardiac issues, another doctor from Hassan died due to brain haemorrhage, Sudhakar said. “Both doctors died while on Covid duty. It’s unfortunate that the state withdrew their applications,” said health department officials. “The stress doctors have gone through while working in Covid wards and screening patients in OPDs of government hospitals has been ignored.” Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said the government is shirking its responsibilities. “This is a gross injustice to the medical fraternity, and we will protest. In fact, the government should have pursued these cases even more vigorously,” said Dr Prasanna. Dr Madhusudhan Kariganoor, former president, IMA-Karnataka chapter, deplored the move. He revealed that the government, in early 2020, had instructed private doctors to keep clinics open. “Through Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, the government held virtual meetings with IMA members to spread awareness among doctors to keep clinics open at the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. They promised they will take care of insurance,” Dr Kariganoor revealed. “The doctors were infected while treating patients in OPDs in their clinics and nursing homes. To now differentiate based on their service in government and private facilities is ridiculous.” However, a senior health official said the state was only following the Centre’s guidelines. Health minister Sudhakar was not available for comment. ‘Injustice to my dad’The families of the 16 martyrs, however, are still in the dark. The wife of Dr Shivananda R Begde, 67, a general practitioner who ran a nursing home in Kalaburagi district and died on July 25, 2020, had filed an application but the family says they aren’t aware of the status and are waiting. Dr Abhinand Begde, Dr Shivananda Begde’s son, said taluk health officials had held meetings with his father to screen patients with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) at his clinic. He said the family had to run from pillar to post between Kalaburagi and Bengaluru to even submit the application. “The government had made it mandatory for hospitals to function and keep an eye out for SARI and ILI patients. He got infected while screening these patients. The government is now shamelessly saying families of doctors who worked in private nursing homes won’t be given compensation,” said Dr Abhinand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-aid-to-kin-of-14-covid-martyrs-from-karnataka-private-hospitals/articleshow/86544548.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The impact of the demonstrations in Karnataka, however, is expected to be minimal despite the backing of Congress and JD(S). With the economy in recovery mode after the pandemic-driven disruptions, businesses, including restaurants and hotels, have indicated they will operate as usual, while educational institutions have said they cannot afford to lose more time. SSLC supplementary examinations, in fact, are scheduled on Monday. Transport minister B Sriramulu said that the government would not suspend bus services. “The government will neither support the bandh call nor stop public transportation. We will ensure that there is security for all passengers and buses continue to ply as usual,” he added. Various transport workers’ unions, including BMTC, autos and cabs, have offered words of support for the farmers’ agitation, but stressed that they would not halt services. Home minister Araga Jnanendra said that the police department had been directed to ensure adequate security across the state. “Authorities are keeping a close watch on all sensitive locations, including Bengaluru city and the outskirts,” he said. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha has called a 10-hour bandh on Monday to mark one year of the three farm laws that were passed in Parliament. Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said: “Congress supports the demands of farmers and the peaceful bandh they have called.” Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S) announced the same, adding that he hoped the stir would be peaceful. “JD(S) will back the farmers’ cause and support the bandh. We will raise our voices in every forum for the people,” he said. Farmers’ groups are expected to organise dharnas and rallies, which could cause traffic chaos. But they may not receive a lot of public support on the ground. In Belagavi, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai requested farmers to not participate in the Bharat bandh and allow economic activities to continue. “When the state is just coming out of the lockdown and the economy is picking up pace, calling a shutdown will be detrimental to the interests of people. It will hurt the common man and even farmers. I urge them to withdraw the protest call,” he said. D Shashi Kumar, the secretary of the Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, said that they would morally support farmers’ issues, but remain open. “We have just reopened. We can’t afford to shut schools anymore,” he added. Commissioner for public instruction R Vishal said that no decision had been taken yet with regard to schools and that it would depend on the availability of transport services. Bandh organisers have said they won’t stop public transport as SSLC supplementary examinations are scheduled to begin on Monday. “The government should have postponed the exams keeping in mind the protest. However, we have decided not to disturb candidates who are appearing for the papers. Buses and vehicles used by these candidates will not be stopped,” said Badagalapura Nagendra, the president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha. The hoteliers’ association said that while establishments were sympathetic to farmers’ issues, they can’t suspend operations. “It has been decided that all hotels will remain open. Closing hotels for a day when the sector is recovering from the pandemiclinked losses will not be appropriate for hoteliers or farmers. Over 50 per cent of what farmers produce is used at hotels. If we stay closed for an entire day, farmers will also suffer losses,” said PC Rao, the president of the Bengaluru hoteliers’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/opposition-backs-farmers-bandh-call-but-stir-impact-may-be-minimal-in-karnataka/articleshow/86544595.cms||---
