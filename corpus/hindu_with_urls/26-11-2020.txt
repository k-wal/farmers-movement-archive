26 November 2020||CHENNAI /NEW DELHI,||Heavy rain as Cyclone Nivar approaches coast||Cyclone Nivar is expected to begin the landfall process that occurs before the storm actually crosses the land, by 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday. The ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ is the third one that will make landfall in India this year. Landfall is the process of a storm moving from sea to land; the actual process may take three or four hours. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) bulletin at 9.30 p.m., Cyclone Nivar is likely to blow until midnight with a wind speed of 120-130 kmph gusting up to 145 kmph. With the convective cloud bands lying over coastal Tamil Nadu, the centre of the cyclone was approaching the Tamil Nadu coast. The landfall process was expected to begin around 10.30 p.m. when the centre of the cyclone will begin to move inland. The outer bands will then be discharged subsequently. The cyclone was 55 km east southeast of Puducherry and 130 km southeast of Chennai around 9.30 p.m. Gale winds and incessant heavy rainfall lashed several areas in and around Chennai and coastal areas as the cyclone moved closer to the coast on Wednesday. It intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm by afternoon over southwest Bay of Bengal. Places in and around Chennai continued to receive heavy to very heavy rain on Wednesday. Nungambakkam received nearly 8 cm of rainfall, Ennore port 5 cm, and Meenambakkam recorded 8 cm till 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Other weather stations such as Chidambaram, Cuddalore, Aduthurai in Thanjavur district and Puducherry received around 8-10 cm rainfall till 8 p.m. According to the IMD, the cyclone may move northwestwards and cross the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram by Wednesday midnight or the early hours of Thursday with a windspeed of 120-130 kmph and sometimes gusting up to 145 kmph. Going by the automatic weather station observations, it may make landfall north of Puducherry around Kalpakkam and Marakkanam. It may make landfall similar to Cyclone Nilam in 2012. Picks up pace Meteorologists noted that severe weather events would begin four to five hours ahead of the cyclone making landfall. It has picked up pace and was moving at a speed of 14 km per hour. Meanwhile, as rain continued on Wednesday, several areas were flooded, with water entering homes and housing colonies. The Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments relocated thousands of people from low-lying areas to higher ground and ensured that relief and food were provided to all. Both governments declared a holiday for Thursday, with Tamil Nadu declaring a holiday for 16 districts that are expected to be affected. Water released Water was released from the Chembarambakkam reservoir — 1,000 cusecs at noon — and then gradually increased in proportion to the rainfall and inflows. The gradual release from Chembarambakkam was planned to ensure that the crisis that led to deaths and destruction of property during December 2015 was not repeated. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director-General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the intense rain spell helped Chennai overcome its deficit. As on Wednesday, it received 14% excess rain for the season. However, the State’s average seasonal rainfall still remains short of 25% to reach its normal of 34 cm as on Wednesday. “This cyclone may not be sufficient to wipe out the deficit of the entire State but it may help bring down number of rain-deficit districts,” he said. People told to stay in The cyclone may maintain its strength for six hours even after its landfall, and gradually weaken. Rainfall may continue on Thursday too. Districts such as Ranipet, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai may experience isolated extremely heavy rainfall on Thursday as the system passes through interior places. While gale wind with speed reaching 65-75 kmph may prevail in interior districts, winds with speed reaching up to 65 kmph may blow in districts, such as Tiruchi, Salem and Namakkal, on Thursday, he added. The Met Department has advised people to remain indoors in these districts on Thursday. Cyclone Nivar is the third one to make landfall in India this year. Earlier, the ‘extremely severe cyclone’ Amphan barrelled through West Bengal in May, followed by Cyclone Nisarg that ploughed through Maharashtra in June. Both Amphan and Nisarg caused extensive damage and were said to be responsible for at least 130 deaths. On average, the seas around India witness 3-4 cyclones that make landfall in the country. Last year was an unusually active cyclone season that saw eight systems, including the extremely severe cyclone Fani and was the strongest registered in Odisha since 1999. The Bay of Bengal ends up generating more storms than the Arabian Sea and climatologists have pointed to an increase in severe storms, particularly in the Arabian Sea, as a consequence of warming oceans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/heavy-rain-as-cyclone-nivar-approaches-coast/article33181228.ece
26 November 2020||MANGALURU,||Vented dams to be minimum 5.5 m wide||The State government has taken a conscious decision to construct vented dams with a width of not less than 5.5 m so that such dams can also act as bridges connecting remote areas, said Minister for Minor Irrigation J.C. Madhuswamy on Wednesday. He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for a Rs. 46.7-crore vented dam-cum-bridge across the Netravathi at Biliyur in Bantwal taluk. Mr. Madhuswamy said that the width of vented dams constructed earlier was small and it was found not useful as bridges for vehicles. Converting them to serve as bridges would help the local economy grow by providing connectivity between places, the Minister said and added that such dam-cum-brides would be of much use in remote areas like Biliyur. In a pacifying note to the distraught people of Dakshina Kannada who opposed the Yettinahole Water Diversion Project, Mr. Madhuswamy said that the government has decided to construct as many vented dams as possible in the coastal region to provide drinking water, irrigate land and improve the local economy. While the economies of parched districts could improve from the Yettinahole waters, a similar development is possible through vented dams in the coastal region, he said. Mr. Madhuswamy said that the GDP has drastically fallen owing to the COVID-19 situation. It is only the agriculture sector that could help boost the economy and the government was committed to providing all facilities to farmers. He congratulated Puttur MLA Sanjeev Matandur in whose constituency Biliyur falls for inviting him to inaugurate a vented dam earlier, following which the new dam was sanctioned. The Biliyur dam would be 305 m wide with 42 vents and connect Biliyur with Thekkar village of Belthangady taluk. It could store 53.79 mcft of water at a maximum height of 4 m and irrigate about 120 hectares of land besides providing drinking water to surrounding villages. Technical bids were received for the project on November 23 and the work would commence soon. It will be completed in 18 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/vented-dams-to-be-minimum-55-m-wide/article33181759.ece
26 November 2020||MANGALURU,||‘I do not want to communalise this but I’ve waited enough’||It has been over five months since 36-year-old Asiyahha, a native of Kannur and a resident of Bengaluru, started staying in Sullia waiting for her husband Ibrahim Khaleel Kattekar to accept her. She now accuses Ibrahim Kattekar’s brother and other members of his family of preventing her husband from living with her. “I have approached the police, the local religious heads, Muslim organisations and also the State Woman’s Commission. None of them has taken any steps to convince my husband of the need to live with me. I am really distraught. This is not a way a woman who has converted to Islam should be treated,” Ms. Asiyahha told reporters here on Wednesday. “I do not want to communalise this issue. I just want to reunite with my husband,” she added. Ms. Asiyahha said that her earlier name was Shanti Joobi and she belonged to a wealthy family from the Thiyya community. She was living in Bengaluru. Following her father’s death and her divorce, Ms. Asiyahha said, she came in touch with Ibrahim Kattekar through Facebook. She converted to Islam and her Nikah with Ibrahim was held in the Gandhinagar Masjid in Peenya, Bengaluru, in January 2017. After her family members came to know of her Nikah, she lost her right over her ancestral property. This, however, resulted in Ibrahim Kattekar leaving her on January 16 this year. Following her visit to Sullia the next month, Ibrahim Kattekar stayed with her for three days in Bengaluru. Ibrahim Kattekar’s family members made the couple stay for short periods in Mysuru, Kasaragod and Shivamogga, from where Ibrahim Kattekar returned to Sullia. “Since June, I am in Sullia and waiting to reunite with my husband. His family members are not allowing it to happen,” she said. “I have been issued a life threat by my husband’s family members. My family members have asked me not to use my family’s name. I am in a miserable state,” she said. She has submitted a petition to the Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police seeking custody of her husband. She has also approached the Jamat with which her husband is associated and also the Muslim Okkota and a few Muslim organisations and Muslim leaders seeking a resolution. It is her love for her husband, she said, that prevents her from registering an FIR against Ibrahim Kattekar. “I have waited enough. I want help in resolving this issue by Friday,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/i-do-not-want-to-communalise-this-but-ive-waited-enough/article33181762.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Some midterm answer scripts leave teachers stumped||Some mothers and fathers appear to have taken helicopter parenting to new heights. Teachers were stumped when they sat down to evaluate answer scripts submitted by students who sat for the midterm examinations last month. In once of the many such instances, they noticed that the handwriting in the answer scripts did not match that of the student’s, and upon further investigation, they realised that it was a parent who had answered the questions. There were also reports of cheating during the examination. Prior to the midterms, school managements had written to parents asking them to be invigilators at home and ensure that their children do not cheat. However, teachers who were also invigilating via online platforms found that many parents were helping their children by dictating the answers. In more extreme cases, the cameras were switched off while parents attempted to write the entire examination. “I got a message from the school informing me that many parents in my child’s class had written the answers, and that the marks of these students would be withheld,” said a mother of a class six student enrolled in a school in south Bengaluru. Many teachers also reported instances of parents shouting and yelling at their children even as the examination was under way, asking them to write the correct answers quickly. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said parents were trying to prompt their child. “We ask students to use two devices while writing the examination — the camera of one device needs to be switched on and they can use the other device to upload the handwritten answer papers. Our teachers immediately call out and ask parents to stop assisting the students. That is the best we can do. Parents need to understand that by helping them, their children do not benefit,” he said. Tweaking strategies Schools are trying to address this problem by using other forms of assessment. Mr. Narayan said that besides writing skills, they also evaluate students on competencies such as listening comprehension, dictation, and quiz, and also ask them to make presentations on various topics. A teacher of an international school in Yelahanka pointed out that such forms of cheating were not restricted to examinations alone. “In the past, parents have helped students with their projects, but now that they are working from home, they are trying to take over and want to complete the entire project themselves,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/some-midterm-answer-scripts-leave-teachers-stumped/article33181285.ece
26 November 2020||HUBBALLI,||Unidentified assailants stab man to death in Hubballi||A man was killed by unidentified assailants in broad daylight in Hubballi on Wednesday. According to the police, Ramesh Bhandage, a resident of Kamaripet, was stabbed by unidentified assailants when he was returning home after a haircut. A profusely bleeding Ramesh was rushed to KIMS Hospital where he died of injuries, the police said. Sources said that the deceased was a former history-sheeter but had reformed and was involved in various social activities. The police, however, said that the attack was related to a recent land dispute. The Hubballi Town Station Police have registered a case. They have recovered CCTV footage pertaining to the assailants. Woman killed A fight over a petty issue between two women resulted in the death of one at Hosur in Hubballi on Wednesday. According to the police, a quarrel broke out between neighbours Manjula Mannavaddar and Geeta during which Geeta attacked Manjula and pushed her to the ground. As Manjula fell down, her head hit a stone killing her on the spot. The Vidyanagar Police have registered a case. They have arrested the accused.  The police, however, say the attack was related to a recent land dispute||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/unidentified-assailants-stab-man-to-death-in-hubballi/article33181579.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||Chief Minister asks police to act tough against divisive forces||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said the State government had precise information about divisive forces scripting a plan to ensure postponement of GHMC elections by creating a violent atmosphere in Hyderabad, which did not permit going ahead with polls. He asked police officers to act `very tough’ against the divisive forces that were conspiring to foment communal trouble out of frustration and desperation. They were trying to gain political mileage, vitiating an atmosphere of harmony in the State. The government was aware of the conspiracies of divisive forces, Mr. Rao said at an official meeting on law and order in the State. The government was committed to protecting law and order on a priority basis. “The government will give complete freedom to police to curb anti-social forces.” he remarked. Mr. Rao said some people were hatching plots for political reasons in the context of GHMC polls. Initially, they spread false propaganda through social media. They tried to mislead public by posting morphed pictures on social media. Later, they provoked public with their speeches. Yet, the peace loving people of the city ignored the provocations and the false propaganda. There was no response from general public to the hate speeches. Those who indulged in the acts realised that attempts to win votes with money would also not work. Therefore, they got down to hatching plots to trigger communal clashes, mainly in Hyderabad. They were trying to launch extensive publicity in Hyderabad after creating trouble in Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam or any other place. Even in Hyderabad, their attempt was to create disturbances at some place and give it a communal colour. They also tried to create mischief at some religious place in the city and divide people on communal lines. Mr. Rao also said the government was committed to maintenance of peace and harmony in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the State. The tricks of anti-social elements should not be allowed at any cost. The government adopted an uncompromising stand against anti-social elements and maintenance of law and order from the beginning. That was why the State, Hyderabad in particular, was peaceful. Hyderabad had earned a reputation as a safe city and received investments in a big way. There was no need to go soft on people who compromised on peace in Hyderabad. No one, including those from ruling party, should be spared. The police should be alert to ward off any such conspiracies. The public should also be watchful, he said. He appealed to youth not to get provoked and political parties to contest elections in a democratic manner. The police officers who were present assured to be vigilant and ensure that there was not a single untoward incident. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Director-General of Police M. Mahender Reddy, Police Commissioners of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda and other senior police officers were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-asked-to-act-tough-against-divisive-forces/article33181638.ece
26 November 2020||MYSURU,||Married off in lockdown, they were trapped in flesh trade||Sujatha (name changed to protect her identity) was barely 15 when she was married off to a 32-year-old-man in May this year when the entire country was in the midst of a lockdown. Unable to live with the man who was more than double her age, Sujatha returned to her home in K.R. Pet in Mandya district only to face hostile parents. She left her house for Mysuru with the help of an acquaintance about two months ago, only to fall into a trap laid by traffickers. Sujatha was among the three young girls rescued earlier this week from flesh trade racketeers in Mysuru and Bengaluru in different operations carried out by the police with the assistance of volunteers from Odanadi Seva Samsthe, an organisation working for the rescue and rehabilitation of trafficked and sexually exploited women. Two girls were rescued from different houses in Hebbal police station limits in Mysuru and one girl was rescued from a house in Jnana Bharathi police station limits in Bengaluru. Four persons, including a woman, have been arrested and investigation is under way. Startlingly, all the three rescued girls were victims of child marriage with at least two them forced to tie the knot during the recent lockdown when there was a surge in hush-hush child marriages, said Mr. Parashu, founder of Odanadi, who is also a member of the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The helpless girls literally found themselves between the devil and the deep sea. For, when they returned to their houses, unable to lead a life with their grooms, they were not just made to feel unwelcome, but forced to earn money or leave the house, he said. The three girls were facing a hostile atmosphere in their respective homes after their return and became easy targets for flesh traders, who were on the prowl, said Stanley, who is also a co-founder of Odanadi. Two of the rescued girls, who are still minors, have been handed over to the Child Welfare Committees (CWC) of Mysuru and Mandya.  Meanwhile, officials of the Women and Child Welfare Department in Mysuru confirmed that the girl handed over to the CWC in Mysuru after the rescue operation on Sunday had been sheltered at the Government Home for Girls in the city. “Though the girl was a victim of child marriage, we are yet to ascertain if there was a hostile atmosphere at home,” an official said. Mr. Stanley made out a strong case for the police to book cases against the accused under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Juvenile Justice Act in addition to Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act and bring to book even the “customers” for sexually exploiting the victims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/married-off-in-lockdown-they-were-trapped-in-flesh-trade/article33181280.ece
26 November 2020||MYSURU,||Panchalinga Darshana to be restricted to 1,000 people a day||The famed Panchalinga Darshana to be held at Talkad in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district will be restricted to only 1,000 people per day in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was stated by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who participated in a meeting held to review the ongoing preparations for the event slated to take place from December 10 to 19 and called for keeping the event simple. The dates and years of the Panchalinga Darshana is based on astrological calculations as per the Hindu almanac and is not an annual event. The last Panchalinga Darshana was held in 2013 while sometimes there tends to be a gap of almost 12 years between the two editions. It entails darshan of the five temples dedicated to Lord Shiva – Sri Vaidyanatheshwara, Sri Maruleshwara, Mudukothore Sri Malliakarjunaswamy, Sri Pathaleshwara, and Sri Arakeshwara – on the same day. The Chief Minister stressed the importance of taking up civic works imperative for the successful completion of the Panchalinga Darshana as there was not much time left for the event. He said larger permanent infrastructure works for the comprehensive development of Talkad and surrounding areas could be taken up subsequently and need not be rushed through as the funds had already been earmarked for the same. Deputy Chief Minister Govind M. Karjol said repairs of the approach roads to Talkad and covering and asphalting the potholes would be taken up from Thursday so as to complete the work ahead of time. District in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar said the district administration had sought Rs. 2.2 crore for conducting the event but urged the Deputy Commissioner to rework the expenditure and send a fresh proposal. Meanwhile, officials, who participated in the meeting, said another round of discussions would be held on Thursday to chalk out a plan on regulating the entry of the crowd. “Whether we should have an online registration system or should the entry be on first come, first served basis will be decided soon,” the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/panchalinga-darshana-to-be-restricted-to-1000-people-a-day/article33181784.ece

SPSR Nellore district administration began evacuation of people living in the hamlets in, among other mandals, Tada, Sullurpeta, Gudur and Naidupeta. About 2,000 people living in coastal hamlets were moved to safer places in Nellore district and 4,000 were evacuated in Prakasam district, official sources said. The sea remained rough to very rough. Low-lying areas in, among other areas, Naidupeta and Venkatagiri were submerged following continuous downpour. Personnel of the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force rushed to the coastal mandals to take up relief and rescue operations. Official teams in Chittoor district rushed to various water bodies to take stock of the situation, in the likelihood of the tanks developing breaches. Thirty-two NDRF and 21 SDRF teams are on standby in Tirupati.

26 November 2020||Belagavi,||‘Get forest clearances expeditiously for Mahadayi’||Minister for Medium and Major Irrigation Ramesh Jarkiholi has directed officers to speed up the process of getting forest clearances for the Mahadayi and other irrigation projects. He has set a deadline of January to prepare fresh proposals, wherever sought for by the Forest Department. Officers, however, are sceptical about readying the documents before the end of this year. He held meetings with officials in Bengaluru and Belagavi this week to learn about issues plaguing various irrigation projects and to explore solutions to them. He told irrigation officers to sit with Forest Department officers and sort out their differences. He asked them to provide all documents that the Forest Department asks for and ensure that the approvals are ready soon. Apart from the Mahadayi, the Minister also reviewed progress on Mekedatu, Yattinahole and Gatti Basavanna irrigation projects. When an officer said that the Forest Department was asking for renewed detailed project reports of the Mahadayi valley projects, the Minister asked them to prepare and submit them before January. “We had to tell the Minister that the projects would take time as they included not only re-estimation of the monetary costs but also a fresh evaluation of the environmental costs,” an officer who was present at the meeting said. Mr. Jarkiholi asked senior engineers to accompany him during his visit to New Delhi to meet the Union Water Resources Ministry officials in January. Mr. Jarkiholi told the officers that the Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had assured him of putting approvals on a fast track by the Centre. Officers say that preparing all necessary documents and set of pleadings before January is next to impossible. For example, in the case of the Mahadayi, “we need to obtain the clearances from the Environment Ministry, before approaching the Forest Department. Environment clearances from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests will take a long time as they include environment impact assessment, public hearings and detailed explanations for answering objections raised by environment activists and neighbouring States. We are yet to compile some of the data sought for by the environment authorities as the earlier proposals were considered lapsed,” said another Irrigation Department Engineer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/get-forest-clearances-expeditiously-for-mahadayi/article33181578.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC stays HC gag order in Amaravati land scam||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed an interim direction of the Andhra Pradesh High Court to gag the media from reporting on an FIR registered on the alleged “illegal purchase” of land in Amaravati. A three-judge Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, gave four weeks to former State Additional Advocate General and first respondent Dammalapati Srinivas to file his response. Mr. Srinivas is named in the FIR. Others named include the relatives of a sitting Supreme Court judge. The FIR shows offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, criminal breach of trust and cheating under the Indian Penal Code. The allegations include abuse of official positions in the State, sharing of privileged information and causing loss to the public exchequer. The High Court passed the gag order within hours of the registration of the FIR on September 15. It stayed the investigation and barred the State from taking any coercive action against the persons named in the FIR. The order was based on a writ petition filed by Mr. Srinivas. The Jaganmohan Reddy government had appealed to the Supreme Court. The Bench issued notice and posted the appeal for hearing in the last week of January 2021. The apex court did not, however, serve notice on Mr. Reddy, who is arraigned as the fifth respondent in the State appeal, noting the High Court had not done so earlier. Meanwhile, the High Court was asked not to pass any final orders in the case. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, for the Andhra government, dismissed notions that the FIR was a product of “regime revenge”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-stays-hc-gag-order-in-amaravati-land-scam/article33181225.ece

A separate statement from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Wednesday said China “firmly oppose[s] the Indian side’s repeated use of ‘national security’ as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background”. With Tuesday’s ban, over 200 Chinese apps, many owned by some of China’s biggest Internet firms, including Alibaba and Bytedance, which once saw India as their biggest potential overseas market, are no longer accessible in India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/china-slams-indias-ban-on-43-more-apps/article33181239.ece
26 November 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||ED issues fresh summons to Pinarayi’s additional PS||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued a second summons to C.M. Raveendran, additional private secretary (PS) to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, to question him in connection with its ongoing investigation into the money laundering aspect of the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case primarily. Officials said the ED had asked Mr. Raveendran to present himself at the agency’s office in Kochi on November 27. Mr. Raveendran had pleaded inability to appear before the ED earlier on the ground that he had contracted COVID-19 and was in hospital. Indicating the probable tack of the ED’s impending investigation, an official pointed out that the agency had told the Special Court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Kochi that it was also probing the suspected “kickbacks in the various infrastructure contracts” being implemented by the State government. ED charge The ED had also deposed that M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Mr. Vijayan, and his “team in the Chief Minister’s Office” were “fully aware” of the illegal import of gold via the “diplomatic channel” of the UAE consulate. Officials said the agency considered Mr. Raveendran a “consummate CMO insider and prime mover” behind several infrastructure projects now under the agency’s “radar”. LDF slams CAG, ED The news of the summons broke against the backdrop of a Statewide mobilisation of Left Democratic Front workers against perceived attempts by Central agencies and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to wreck Kerala’s development by “unfairly targeting” the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, LIFE Mission and other mega projects such as K-FON and E-Mobility. LDF convener and CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan, who inaugurated the protests, described the ED’s actions as a political move to discredit the State government in the election year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ed-issues-fresh-summons-to-pinarayis-additional-ps/article33181661.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,||Another corporation to manage garbage in city?||An agency tasked with solid waste management (SWM) in Bengaluru may soon join the growing list of boards and corporations in the State. The government is considering setting up a new corporation for SWM in Bengaluru. The city’s civic body, meanwhile, is set to propose a corporation only for waste processing, while it is keen on retaining the functions of street sweeping and garbage collection. A dedicated parastatal agency tasked with SWM in the city has drawn opposition from civil society groups, which argue that this would only further disempower the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. This would be opposed to both letter and spirit of the 74th amendment to the Constitution, that empowers local self-governance, they say. The proposal on the new corporation comes days after the formation of corporations for the development of Maratha and Veerashaiva-Lingayat communities. These corporations have also turned a political sop to assuage legislators and other leaders. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has over the last two days nominated chairpersons to over 20 boards and corporations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/another-corporation-to-manage-garbage-in-city/article33181279.ece

The MHA has stressed that States should ensure 80% contacts of all persons found COVID-19 positive should be traced in 72 hours and their “tracking, identification, quarantine and follow up” for the next 14 days should be done strictly. The order issued on Wednesday is called ‘Guidelines for surveillance, containment and caution’, which will be effective from December 1 to 31. The MHA said that States and Union Territories (UTs), based on their assessment of the situation, may “impose local restrictions” such as “night curfew” with a view to contain the spread of COVID-19. “However, State/ UT Governments shall not impose any local lockdown (State/ District/ sub-division/City level), outside the containment zones, without prior consultation with the Central Government,” MHA order said. The MHA said that States need to enforce social distancing in offices. “In cities, where the weekly Case positivity rate is in more than 10%, States and UTs concerned shall consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures, with a view to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time, thereby ensuring social distancing,” the order said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mha-issues-fresh-covid-guidelines/article33181226.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||China slams India’s ban on apps||China on Wednesday said it “firmly opposes” India’s “use of national security as an excuse” after New Delhi’s Tuesday decision to ban 43 Chinese apps, which followed similar measures announced in June and September that barred 177 mostly Chinese apps amid continuing tensions along the border. “India should immediately correct its discriminatory approach and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation”, said Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. ‘An excuse’ A separate statement from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Wednesday said China “firmly oppose[s] the Indian side’s repeated use of ‘national security’ as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background.” With Tuesday's ban, more than 200 Chinese apps, many owned by some of China’s biggest Internet firms, including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Sina and Bytedance, which once saw India as their biggest potential overseas market, are now no longer accessible in India. Tuesday’s move listed 43 mobile apps, including Alibaba-linked apps such as AliExpress and Alipay Cashier, citing threats to national security, integrity and sovereignty of India. India blocked 59 apps in June and a further 118 in September, including Tencent’s WeChat, Bytedance’s popular TikTok app, Baidu, UC Browser, Sina Weibo and a number of gaming apps, such as PUBG and Rise of Kingdoms. Mr. Zhao said China “expresses serious concerns over India’s claims” relating to the apps. “For four times since June, India has imposed restrictions on smartphone apps with Chinese backgrounds under the pretext of national security,” he said. “These moves, in glaring violation of market principles and WTO rules, severely harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. China firmly rejects them. The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow market principles and protect the lawful rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. China-India economic and trade cooperation, by nature, is mutually beneficial”. Deadlocked talks Tuesday’s move came amid deadlocked talks to push disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with both sides yet to agree on a plan to disengage and return to status quo prior to China’s multiple transgressions starting in May. While the Chinese State-run media hasn’t reported widely on the LAC transgressions, the app ban has been covered widely in the Chinese press, with calls for repercussions targeting Indian companies. India has sought to signal clearly to China that trade and investment relations cannot continue as normal while the border situation remains tense. Delhi is of the view that Beijing has this summer violated multiple border agreements that both sides have broadly abided by for close to three decades. The Chinese government, in contrast, has in public statements repeatedly called on India to delink the border from other aspects of the relationship - a stand that officials in India say is untenable unless China returns to the status quo on the borders. “China and India are the opportunities of development to each other rather than threats,” the Chinese Embassy statement said. “Both sides should bring bilateral economic and trade relations back to the right path for mutual benefit and win-win results on the basis of dialogue and negotiation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-slams-indias-ban-on-apps/article33181452.ece
26 November 2020||ONGOLE/NELLORE,||6,000 people moved from A.P. coastal hamlets||Incessant rain lashed south coastal Andhra Pradesh under the influence of severe cyclonic storm Nivar over southwest Bay of Bengal, which intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on Wednesday. The SPSR Nellore district administration began evacuation of people living in the hamlets in, among other mandals, Tada, Sullurpeta, Gudur and Naidupeta, as rain occurred at most places and heavy to very heavy and extremely heavy rain in some places. Weathermen predicted rain at most places with isolated heavy to very heavy and extremely heavy falls in the next 24 hours. While 2,000 people have been evacuated in Nellore, 4,000 people have been moved to safer places in Prakasam district so far, official sources said. A control room was opened at the Collectorate. Motorists had a tough time travelling as many roads, especially in low-lying areas and on Nellore outskirts, were flooded with rainwater. The sea remained rough to very rough. Squally wind speed reaching 30 to 40 kmph gusting to 50 kmph along and off the coast prevailed. Gale wind speed reaching 65-75 kmph gusting to 85 kmph was very likely along and off the coastal district in the early hours of Thursday, weathermen said. Low-lying areas in, among other areas, Naidupeta and Venkatagiri towns were submerged following continuous downpour. Cautionary signal-III was hoisted at Krishnapatnam. Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu oversaw the preparedness of the staff in meeting any emergency in Kothapatnam village in Kota mandal, which witnessed steady showers since Wednesday night. Farmers were a worried lot as the downpour submerged paddy seedlings raised in the coastal mandals. Reviewing the situation with officials in Nellore, Irrigation Minister P. Anil Kumar Yadav asked the officials concerned to be fully on alert to avert breaches to tanks as also major reservoirs including Somasila and Kandaleru which had reached maximum storage capacity. Personnel of the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force rushed to the coastal mandals to oversee relief and rescue operations. Prakasam Collector Pola Bhaskar visited Ulavapadu, which is likely to bear the brunt of the cyclone in the district after landfall and asked the staff to undertake relief and rescue operations. Special officers were appointed to monitor the situation 24x7 in the 11 coastal mandals. Port warnings Local cautionary signal-III was hoisted at Machilipatnam, Nizampatnam and Vadarevu ports. Distant warning signal-II was hoisted at Visakhapatnam Port, DW-II with section signal number - IV was hoisted at Kakinada and Gangavaram ports. Official teams in Chittoor district rushed to various water bodies to take stock of the situation, in the likelihood of breaches. Thirty-two NDRF and 21 SDRF teams are on the standby in Tirupati to take up relief measures. Seventeen mandals have been identified as most vulnerable. Officials have declared holiday for schools on Wednesday and Thursday. People can dial 100 or reach Chittoor police on WhatsApp at 9440900005 for support. In Srikalahasti, police teams have been asked to evacuate people, especially the dwellers of dilapidated buildings, tin-roofed and thatched huts in the wake of sweeping gales, to safe zones. The eastern mandals of Varadaiahpalem, Nagalapuram, Satyavedu, KVB Puram and Nagari, bordering Tamil Nadu, are expected to bear the brunt of the cyclone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6000-people-moved-from-ap-coastal-hamlets/article33181168.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi/gurugram/noida,||Farmers break barriers to enter Delhi||Hundreds of farmers led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) leaders set out for Delhi from Ambala with tractors and trolleys breaking through two barriers on National Highway 44 on Wednesday, in response to a call for “Dilli Chalo” from several farmers’ groups for November 26 and 27 in protest against the three controversial farm laws. The Haryana police placed boulders and barricades on all roads across the State and sealed its border with Punjab to prevent the farmers from marching towards Delhi. The Delhi police too deployed three companies of paramilitary forces at the border with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. However, the farmers’ response from the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh remained lukewarm with the Bharatiya Kisan Union, leading the protests in west U.P., distancing itself from the march call. Dharmendra Malik, State spokesperson of the BKU, said though there is anguish among the farmers, there is no call from their organisation to move towards Delhi. Tejinder Singh Virk, president of the Terai Kisan Sangathan, said they would join the protest with at least 2,000 farmers from Uttarakhand. BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said the police used water cannons to stop them, but they broke through the barriers to reach Pipli in Kurukshetra late in the evening. Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava told The Hindu that the police tried to physically prevent the farmers from marching ahead, but they broke through barriers defying the police advice. “We don’t want to get into scuffle with them because the use of force will become inevitable,” said Mr. Yadava. He said barriers were put across the State but no fresh arrests were made on Wednesday. “The entire State is affected,” he said. As lakhs of farmers head towards Delhi, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, alliance of farmers groups leading the protest, insist that their demand is repeal of the three farm laws and the dropping of the Electricity Bill, 2020. “We want these Bills to be repealed in toto, we will not accept any minor tweaking. The farmers are coming prepared to stay regardless of any resistance,” said Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, during an online press conference. A protest rally has been planned at 11 a.m. at the Jantar Mantar whether or not farmers from other States are allowed to enter, said All-India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. Rallies are also being planned at five points on the Delhi border. The Morcha accused the BJP of using State governments to crush the movement. Apart from the barriers at the border, hundreds of farmer leaders have been detained or placed under house arrest in Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, according to Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh leader Ashutosh Kohar. Despite the leaders’ insistence that this is an all-India movement, with local agitations expected in at least 15 States, the vast bulk of farmers heading to Delhi hail from Punjab. Over 1.5 lakh farmers have been mobilised from the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-break-barriers-to-enter-delhi/article33181196.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Server snag hits nutrition portal||A massive nutrition portal developed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), which is used by the Centre as well as most States, and touted as the world’s biggest nutrition system, to record and monitor delivery of services to children and mothers across nearly seven lakh anganwadis has been down for nearly three months, several State governments have confirmed. The snag comes as a setback at a time there is a call for the need to intensify efforts to identify mothers and children in need of nutritional interventions due to rising levels of hunger and poverty. The software was developed under the Poshan Abhiyaan approved by the Cabinet in 2017 with a three-year budget of Rs. 9,000 crore, half of which was for ICT-based real-time monitoring system. While 50% of the amount is funded by the government budgetary support, the remaining 50% is a loan from the World Bank. “The ICDS-CAS server is down and we have written to the Central government to rectify it. It has been down for almost two months and we have requested for it to be rectified. But we continue to deliver dry rations to the beneficiaries,” Kavitha Ramu, ICDS chief for Tamil Nadu told The Hindu . Daily tasks POSHAN Abhiyaan’s Integrated Child Development Services Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) is an innovative web and mobile-phone based application to improve service delivery and programme management. The application facilitates anganwadi workers (AWWs) in their daily tasks, helps supervisors to assess and provide feedback to the workers and helps other programme officials to track service delivery and take informed decisions. The ICDS-CAS has three components — a mobile-based application for AWWs, a mobile-based application for supervisors and a web-based dashboard for other programme officials. It is reliably learnt that the server issue surfaced after the government insisted that the BMGF and its collaborator, U.S.-based Dimagi, host India's public data with an Indian service provider leading to issues in managing capacity to anchor such a vast data. India has total 14 lakh anganwadis and nearly 10 crore ICDS beneficiaries. A query sent to the BMGF remained unanswered till the time of going to print. “The server issue has hampered real time monitoring of services,” said an official of Gujarat. How were then they tracking activities? The official replied that the State has developed its own software modules. The source also said there were also difficulties in accessing data from the portal much before the server problem, because of which they have developed their own tools. On the ground, in Rajasthan’s Churu, at the Child Development Project Office, block co-ordinator Manju Kumar explains what this means for their activities. “No monitoring activity is possible through the CAS now. We have shifted to WhatsApp. If CAS was used to upload photos of anganwadis worker opening the centre, or while serving food to the children, we now use WhatsApp to keep an eye on these activities and share photos.” The software also helps in calculating incentives given to workers for each tasks, but in its absence these have been pending since September despite the responsibilities of anganwadi workers increasing manifold due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/server-snag-hits-nutrition-portal/article33181192.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ahmed Patel, Cong. strategist, passes away||Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, 71, died on Wednesday after a prolonged battle with complications arising out of a COVID-19 infection. He had contracted the virus more than a month-and-a-half ago, on October 1, and was treated at a private hospital at Faridabad before being shifted to Medanta Medicity in Gurugram. Popularly known as Ahmed Bhai or AP in political circles, Mr. Patel, who served as the powerful political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, was the quintessential backroom strategist during the 10-year rule of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA). He was never a part of the Manmohan Singh Cabinet yet enjoyed more power than any Cabinet Minister. Known for his loyalty to the Gandhis, Mr. Patel served as a key link not just between the Congress and its allies but also Dr. Singh’s government. His ability to reach out to corporate as well as political leaders prompted the former party chief Rahul Gandhi, who was not known to share a great relationship with Mr Patel, to bring him back as the party’s treasurer in August 2018. With the coffers of the Congress much depleted ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Patel was expected to get donations from all quarters including industry leaders. If Pranab Mukherjee was the troubleshooter for the UPA, Mr. Patel was, inevitably, the crisis manager. Buzzing with activity Late-night meetings at his 23 Mother Teresa Crescent residence or Mukherjee’s 13 Talkatora bungalow were a regular feature whenever the UPA faced a crisis. Be it the alleged 2G spectrum auction scam involving DMK leaders or the walkout by the Left parties over the India-U.S. nuclear deal in July 2008, Mr. Patel was the man that the Congress and Ms. Gandhi relied upon to “save: the UPA government. Though his name was thrown up during the cash-for-vote scandal (when the BJP alleged that cash was offered to MPs ahead of the Left-sponsored no-confidence vote against the UPA), a parliamentary panel that probed the scandal did not find anything against him. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had questioned the 71-year-old leader multiple times, as recently as July this year in a money laundering as well as a bank fraud case involving the Gujarat-based Sterling Group. Mr. Patel, however, called it as political witchhunt and vendetta. While his stature grew nationally, the Congress in Gujarat shrank over the years and many blamed his “towering presence” as the reason no local leader could grow in the State. Handpicked as a Parliamentary Secretary by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, Mr. Patel had represented the Bharuch constituency thrice (1977,1980 and 1984) as a Lok Sabha member. After his defeat in the 1989 Lok Sabha election, he entered the Rajya Sabha in 1993. His last election in August 2017 displayed his fighting side as he seemed to be up against the entire BJP, who, after nominating Amit Shah and Smriti Irani for the first two vacant Rajya Sabha seats from Gujarat, was determined to deny the third seat to the Congress nominee. He, however, scraped through the election with no votes to spare. Mr. Patel won many a difficult battle but lost the one against COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ahmed-patel-cong-strategist-passes-away/article33181201.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,||Yogi, Shah, Nadda to join BJP’s poll campaign||The State unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will unleash Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP national president J. P. Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah — in that order — from Friday till Sunday to bolster the party’s ongoing GHMC poll campaign. Road show Mr Adityanath is scheduled to address a road show and public meeting in Hyderabad and Chevella on November 27 while Mr. Nadda is set to participate in a meeting of intellectuals and a road show in Malkajgiri on November 28. The Home Minister is to participate in a road show in Secunderabad on November 29, the last day of campaign. Polling is scheduled for December 1. National OBC president K. Laxman, Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy and TS party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar told a press conference that former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will be releasing the party’s manifesto on Thursday (November 26). “It only shows how serious our party is about this election. The manifesto will only promise what we can do. The national leaders have been requested to come to further highlight the failures of the TRS government even as it makes efforts to hoodwink the people and put obstacles in our path because of the rising support,” said Mr. Laxman. The local leadership has been taking up the campaign in the right earnest with senior leaders and activists working in coordination to make up for the less time available for campaign, he said. “TRS government has advanced the poll only to ensure we do not strengthen further after our Dubbak victory. With State Election Commission playing the role of a mute spectator, it has gone for ballot boxes in pandemic time though Bihar polls were conducted successfully with Electronic Voting Machines. Voter lists have not been supplied in many areas,” Mr Laxman claimed. Mr. Kishan Reddy said if the party wins Mayor post, modernisation of stormwater drains will be taken up on war footing and completed before next monsoon to prevent flooding in twin cities. Housing for the poor will receive priority along with revamp of sewage network and laying of footpath. TRS has anyway repeated its promises and should be prepared to give a boat to each household, he mocked. “We are touching base with every voter. We promise an honest, transparent and ethical local body if elected to power as the current trends show. Women, students and youth are with us so our governance will reflect their aspirations,” he said. Mr. Kishan Reddy urged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS working president K.T.Rama Rao to desist from slandering the Central government with falsehood over sale of government utilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amit-shah-nadda-and-yogi-to-join-bjps-poll-campaign/article33181619.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC reserves order on in-service quota||The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its order on the interim question whether Tamil Nadu and Kerala should provide 50% in-service reservation for admissions to super-specialty medical courses in government colleges for the current academic year. A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao was hearing a batch of pleas filed by doctors, including postgraduate holders qualified in NEET 2020, challenging reservation of seats for in-service candidates in super-specialty courses. The Tamil Nadu government argued that there was an acute need for super-specialty qualified doctors both in the medical academia and in practice. The States argued that preparation for admission to these courses had started almost immediately following the Constitution Bench judgment on August 31. The judgment had empowered States to devise a separate channel of entry for in-service doctors. “State has the legislative competence and authority to provide for a separate source of entry for in-service candidates seeking admission to postgraduate degree/diploma courses in exercise of powers under Entry 25, List III,” the apex court had concluded in the August 31 verdict. Senior advocate P. Wilson, for caveators, submitted that the issue of in-service reservation to government doctors was already settled. “The matter is being re-agitated again and again.” Both Madras and Kerala High Courts had not intervened with the States’ move to provide in-service reservation. However, the doctors, who have challenged the quota, refer to a 1999 Constitution Bench verdict in their favour. This judgment, they said, had held that “merit, and merit alone, is the basis for admission at the super-specialty level”. One of the pleas challenged a November 7 order of the Tamil Nadu government allowing the Secretary, Selection Committee, to conduct counselling and fill 50% of the super-specialty seats in the government medical colleges with in-service candidates in the State. The appeal argued that the State order was contrary to the Postgraduate Medical Education (Amendment) Regulations of 2019, which mandated that the Directorate General of Health Services should be in charge of the admission process. “There is no concept of any reservation for admission to super-specialty medical courses,” they contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-reserves-order-on-in-service-quota/article33181164.ece

26 November 2020||Srinagar,||Delhi rattled by our decision to contest polls: Mehbooba||Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti visited a detained District Development Council (DDC) candidate in south Kashmir on Wednesday and said that the naming of National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah in the Roshni Scheme showed that Delhi was “rattled by our decision to contest polls”. “The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] is using ploys to divert attention. It uses a Deputy Commissioner to summon Dr. Abdullah and the Roshni scam is a new ploy. The BJP is feeling unnerved by the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration’s decision to join the DDC poll fray,” Ms. Mufti said. She made these remarks during her visit to Shopian’s Zainapora, where an alliance candidate was allegedly not allowed to campaign for the polls. Candidate’s campaign “The PAGD [People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration] candidate was not allowed to come out for the past 15 days for campaigning. Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and State Election Commissioner K.K. Sharma were making false claims that every candidate is allowed to go for campaigning,” the former chief minister said. Ms. Mufti said the BJP would “use grenades and guns to bag seats”. ‘Should defeat BJP’ “People should defeat the BJP this time. The Centre was of the belief that parties in Jammu and Kashmir won’t participate in the polls so that they can ensure the victory of their candidates through back-door channels,” she said. The Jammu and Kashmir administration, in a new list issued on Tuesday, named Dr. Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah as “land encroachers”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-rattled-by-our-decision-to-contest-polls-mehbooba/article33181180.ece

The list also includes the details of property owned by PDP leader Talib Choudhary, who is alleged to have encroached on 0.25 acre of government land in Channi Rama village of Bahu teshil in Jammu district. The details of the property have been included in a list that says “encroached State land (physically encroached but not shown in revenue record)- Other than Roshni”. The list published earlier, following a J&K High Court order, had mentioned the Jammu residence of former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, as having encroached on forest land owned by the government. The J&K High Court, in an order on October 9, had directed that details of “State land in unauthorised occupation” shall be disclosed on the government’s website, along with the names of the beneficiaries under the Roshni Act that was scrapped by the High Court.

26 November 2020||LUCKNOW,||‘U.P. law a ploy to pit Dalits and Muslims against each other’||The Uttar Pradesh government’s ordinance against unlawful conversions is a ploy to pit Dalits and Muslims against each other and it would create fear among the communities, Dalit rights activists in the State said on Wednesday. S.R. Darapuri, retired IPS officer and a Dalit rights activist, said the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 was indirectly targeted at Muslims, Dalits and Christians. While noting that conversion of Dalits to Christianity and Islam was not as common as before, he said the ordinance was meant to deter them from converting to the Buddhist faith. Buddhist conversion “They are killing many birds with one stone... Dalits will face the biggest hitch. The biggest adverse impact will be on the Buddhist conversion of Dalits,” said Mr. Darapuri .    Udit Raj, former MP and Congress spokesperson, who has conducted mass conversions in the past, said the ordinance was a ploy to pit Dalits against Muslims. Ram Kripal Pasi, national general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Pasi Samaj outfit, said the ordinance was a strategy of the BJP-RSS to “keep Dalits under the Hindu fold”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-law-a-ploy-to-pit-dalits-and-muslims-against-each-other/article33181178.ece
26 November 2020||KOCHI,||Swapna, Sarith in Customs custody||Swapna Suresh and P.S. Sarith, two accused in the snuggling of dollars from India to Muscat, were remanded in the custody of the Customs for five days. Though the Customs had sought the custody for seven days, C. Deepu, the judge of the Economic Offences Court, Ernakulam, noted that the prayer seemed to be slightly excessive and allowed only five days’ remand. The court noted that the source of Indian currency, the modus operandi of its accumulation and its conversion into dollars were under probe and it was highly essential to find out the key persons involved in the deal. An affidavit submitted by the Customs indicated that the officials of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram were involved in the smuggling of the dollars with the aid of high-profile persons. The Customs case is that Khaled Mohamed Ali Shoukry, former finance head of the UAE consulate, smuggled $1,90,000 to Muscat from Thiruvananthapuram with the help of Swapna and Sarith. Smuggling of foreign currency is an offence punishable under Section 135 of the Customs Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/swapna-sarith-in-customs-custody/article33181710.ece
26 November 2020||Kozhikode/ THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Jallikattu is India’s entry for Oscar awards||Malayalam film Jallikattu , directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery, has been selected as India’s official entry for the Best International Feature Film category for the 93rd Academy Awards. Jallikattu is the third Malayalam film after Guru (1997) and Adaminte Makan Abu (2011) to be chosen as the country’s official entry for the Oscars. “It is a great honour,” Lijo told The Hindu.   Jallikattu will certainly face stiff competition at the Oscars, but do not be surprised if it becomes the first Indian film to get that honour after Lagaan in 2001. Before that, Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988) had made the grade.  Jallikattu offers hope because it is the kind of films that often make the shortlist at the Oscars. It is brilliantly made, original and has a beautiful rawness that could appeal to an audience beyond Kerala and India. Based on Maoist Based on writer S. Hareesh’s acclaimed story Maoist , the film that explores the human psyche follows a buffalo that escapes the butcher’s hold when he is about to slaughter it. The beast runs helter-skelter, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Before long, the entire village, located in the wild high ranges, is out to trap the elusive buffalo. With every mile that it covers, the buffalo unravels the animosities, the violence, and the selfish interests simmering beneath in the village, which is calm on its surface. Salim Ahamed, the director of Adaminte Makan Abu , believes Jallikattu could impress the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, who shortlist the films for the Oscars. “I think Jallikattu is the best film India has entered for the Oscars for a long time. Having seen most of the Oscar winners and the nominated films in this category, I feel Jallikattu has tremendous potential,” he said. He said that Jallikatttu was rooted to the Indian culture. “You can't say that about many of the films that have been nominated in the past from India,” he said. “It is the well-made, powerful films that truly reflect the culture of a country that go on to get shortlisted.” The selection has been made by a 14-member committee of the Film Federation of India from a shortlist of 26 films.  Jallikattu was premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, garnering praise from critics. It was later screened at the Busan International Film Festival and a host of other major venues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jallikattu-is-indias-entry-for-oscar-awards/article33181166.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Navy inducts 2 drones on lease from the U.S.||The Indian Navy has inducted two MQ-9B Sea Guardian unarmed drones procured from the U.S. on lease, two defence sources said on Wednesday. “The drones are on lease for one year. All planning, execution and operations will be with the Indian Navy. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) will play a support role for maintenance as laid down in the agreement,” one defence source said. The drones arrived in India in mid-November. The recently released Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) 2020 has introduced an option for leasing military platforms. As part of its force restructuring to offset budgetary constraints, the Navy has been looking to induct more unmanned solutions, both aerial and underwater. As part of this, the requirement of additional P-8I maritime patrol aircraft has been cut down from 10 to six and was to be offset by procurement of long-endurance drones. UAV procurement A tri-service proposal to procure ten Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV) for each Service from the U.S., including armed drones, has been in the pipeline for some time but has been delayed due to budgetary considerations. Last year, the Navy asked General Atomics for details of the Sea Guardian, following which company officials made presentations on its capabilities. The Guardian, which is the maritime variant of the Predator MQ-9 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), has a maximum endurance of 40 hours and a maximum flying altitude of 40,000 feet. It has a 3600 maritime surveillance radar and an optional multimode maritime surface search radar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-inducts-2-drones-on-lease-from-the-us/article33181176.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi,||Row over J&K Net ban at House panel meet||A meeting of the Standing Committee on Information and Technology held on Wednesday turned into a battleground between the BJP and the Congress on the question of whether the committee can discuss the withdrawal of high-speed Internet in Kashmir. Sources said BJP members Nishikant Dubey, Rajyavardhan Rathore, Sanjay Seth and others insisted that any discussion on the subject would jeopardise national security. The meeting went on for nearly three hours, with the majority of the time devoted to the tug-of-war between the BJP and the opposition members on the subject. A day before the meeting, Mr. Dubey tweeted, “Again @ShashiTharoor wants to discuss national security,it’s alarming @ombirlakota . Loksabha rule 270 says , that Government may decline to produce a document on the ground that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety or interest of the State.” Previous judgment The BJP MPs demanded a vote on the subject. Committee chairperson and senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor overruled them. He said the panel had previously discussed this issue and as per the rules of business, an issue that the committee was already evaluating need not go through another round of vote.  The main question that the committee posed, as per sources, was about the status of the Internet shutdown. As per the Supreme Court judgment in the Anuradha Bhasin case, Internet services cannot be suspended indefinitely. The shutdown, the court had said, must adhere to the principles of proportionality and necessity. Following the orders, the Central government, as per a gazette notification on 10th November, amended the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to insert Rule 2A, which specifies that an Internet shutdown order can remain in operation for a maximum period of 15 days. The 15-day period for Kashmir ended on Tuesday. No concrete reply The committee members asked the Ministry of Home Affairs personnel who deposed on the status of the Internet shutdown whether it had been extended since the expiry of the 15-day period. The Ministry of Home Affairs, the sources said, did not provide any concrete replies. Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, who was to depose before the committee, had conveyed to the Chairman and Lok Sabha Speaker about his unavailability due to important meetings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/row-over-jk-net-ban-at-house-panel-meet/article33181182.ece

BKU (Charuni) spokesperson Rakesh Bains said the police used water cannons to stop them, but they broke through the barriers to reach Pipli in Kurukshetra late in the evening. Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava told The Hindu that the police tried to physically prevent the farmers from marching ahead, but they broke through barriers defying the police advice. “We don’t want to get into scuffle with them because the use of force will become inevitable,” said Mr. Yadava. He said barriers were put across the State but no fresh arrests were made on Wednesday. “The entire State is affected,” he said. As lakhs of farmers head towards Delhi, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, alliance of farmers groups leading the protest, insist that their demand is repeal of the three farm laws and the dropping of the Electricity Bill, 2020. “We want these Bills to be repealed in toto, we will not accept any minor tweaking. The farmers are coming prepared to stay regardless of any resistance,” said Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, during an online press conference. A protest rally has been planned at 11 a.m. at the Jantar Mantar whether or not farmers from other States are allowed to enter, said All-India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah. Rallies are also being planned at five points on the Delhi border. The Morcha accused the BJP of using State governments to crush the movement. Apart from the barriers at the border, hundreds of farmer leaders have been detained or placed under house arrest in Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, according to Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh leader Ashutosh Kohar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-break-barriers-in-bid-to-enter-capital/article33181449.ece

K. Sasidharan Nair, former District Judge and former Secretary, Law Department, will chair the committee. A. Vinaya Babu, a retired professor of computer science and technology, JNTUH College of Engineering, Hyderabad; and Sumesh Divakaran, professor, computer science and technology, College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram; are the other members. The report A committee headed by former Civil Aviation Secretary and Special Secretary, Information Technology, M. Madhavan Nambiar, and Gulshan Rai, former Cyber Security Coordinator, Government of India, had examined the matter and submitted a report that pointed to some procedural errors in selecting the firm. The committee had also suggested measures to strengthen the State’s Information Technology Department and improve its understanding, selection and implementation of data analytics and other high-value digital platforms. However, the government felt a detailed examination was necessary on various aspects on which the Madhavan Nambiar committee had not offered its comments. The new committee would examine whether officials who engaged the firm had observed the procedures laid down in the rules of business of the State government. The new committee will also investigate whether the officials had followed law while signing the purchase order and agreement with Sprinklr. The government also wanted the committee to examine whether the extraordinary circumstances and exigencies caused by the pandemic would justify the lapses on the part of officials intent on harnessing the power of big data analysis to predict the spread and potency of the disease and also identify vulnerable sections of the population.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-to-study-sprinklr-probe-report/article33181712.ece

The MHA said the main focus of the guidelines was to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of COVID-19, which is visible in the steady decline in number of active cases in the country. “Further, keeping in view the recent spike in new cases in few States/ UTs, ongoing festival season and onset of winter, it is emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy, focussed on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines,” it said. The list of containment zones will be notified online by District Collectors. “Only essential activities shall be allowed in the containment zones. There shall be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for supply of essential goods and services,” the order said. The MHA said that States and Union Territories may consider administrative actions, including imposition of appropriate fines, on persons not wearing face masks in public and work spaces.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||SC stays gag order in Amaravati land scam||It stayed the investigation and barred the State from taking any coercive action against the persons named in the FIR. The order was based on a writ petition filed by Mr. Srinivas. The Jaganmohan Reddy government had appealed to the Supreme Court. The Bench issued notice and posted the appeal for hearing in the last week of January 2021. The apex court did not, however, serve notice on Mr. Reddy, who is arraigned as the fifth respondent in the State appeal, noting the High Court had not done so earlier. Meanwhile, the High Court was asked not to pass any final orders in the case. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, for the Andhra government, dismissed notions that the FIR was a product of “regime revenge”. He said such arguments made by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, for Mr. Srinivas, was merely “rhetorical”. “Do they mean that a subsequent government can never investigate its predecessor’s activities? If a criminal case has been registered, the answer is simple, the case has to be investigated... The FIR is detailed. Do advocate generals get immunity no matter what crime they commit?" he said. In fact, Mr. Dhavan said, the State had made a request on March 23 to the Centre to initiate a CBI investigation into the case. The September 15 stay order looked as if the High Court was dealing with a plea for “anticipatory bail”. “How can they stay an investigation which was in its nascent stage? Malafide against the State has to be proved through material evidence... Here he [Srinivas] had merely said the police and the State were acting like the Gestapo to get the stay order from the High Court”, Mr. Dhavan submitted. He objected to the gag on the media. “An FIR is a public document”, he stated. He called the September 15 order “draconian”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-gag-order-in-amaravati-land-scam/article33181172.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||China slams India’s ban on 43 more apps||A separate statement from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Wednesday said China “firmly oppose[s] the Indian side’s repeated use of ‘national security’ as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background”. With Tuesday’s ban, over 200 Chinese apps, many owned by some of China’s biggest Internet firms, including Alibaba and Bytedance, which once saw India as their biggest potential overseas market, are no longer accessible in India. Tuesday’s move listed 43 mobile apps, including Alibaba-linked apps such as AliExpress and Alipay Cashier, citing threats to national security, integrity and sovereignty of India. India blocked 59 apps in June and a further 118 in September, including Tencent’s WeChat, Bytedance’s popular TikTok app, Baidu, UC Browser, Sina Weibo and a number of gaming apps, such as PUBG and Rise of Kingdoms. Mr. Zhao said China “expresses serious concerns over India’s claims” relating to the apps. “For four times since June, India has imposed restrictions on smartphone apps with Chinese backgrounds under the pretext of national security,” he said. “These moves, in glaring violation of market principles and WTO rules, severely harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. China firmly rejects them. The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow market principles and protect the lawful rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. China-India economic and trade cooperation, by nature, is mutually beneficial”. Deadlocked talks Tuesday’s move came amid deadlocked talks to push disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), with both sides yet to agree on a plan to disengage and return to status quo prior to China’s multiple transgressions starting in May. While the Chinese State-run media hasn’t reported widely on the LAC transgressions, the app ban has been covered widely in the Chinese press, with calls for repercussions targeting Indian companies. India has sought to signal clearly to China that trade and investment relations cannot continue as normal while the border situation remains tense.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-slams-indias-ban-on-43-more-apps/article33181173.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi,||PM to lay foundation for new Parliament building||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building in the first half of December, sources said. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project and it is expected to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction work. The redevelopment project of Central Vista — the nation’s power corridor — envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. Although the proposed date of laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building is around December 10, the final date would depend on the availability of the Prime Minister, the sources said. According to the plan, the new Parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs, will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating “paperless offices“. The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. In September, Tata Projects Limited had won the bid to construct a new parliament building at a cost of Rs. 861.90 crore. The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs. 83 lakh at that time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-to-lay-foundation-for-new-parliament-building/article33181188.ece

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing the criminal interim application filed by Nisar Ahmed Haji Sayyed Bilal, a victim and father of a man who died in the blast along with five others. Former additional solicitor general of India B.A. Desai, representing Mr. Bilal, sought permission to intervene in the case. Advocate Neela Gokhale, appearing for Mr. Purohit, opposed the application and said the plea filed by Mr. Purohit is only challenging the sanction to prosecute him and that his role in the case is restricted to him discharging his official duties as an Army officer. Therefore, Ms. Gokhale said, the intervention application should not be allowed. Mr. Desai read judgments which said that the victim had a right to intervene in all matters related to a case. The court then asked the counsel for the National Investigation Agency Sandesh Patil to explain the stage at which the trial was. The Bench then said that it would pronounce the order on whether or not the intervention would be allowed on November 27, and that the main issue of the plea filed by Mr. Purohit would be heard on December 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-to-rule-on-malegaon-victims-plea/article33181194.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi,||President and PM mourn Cong. leader||Tributes were paid by President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, who died on Wednesday morning. Mr. Kovind tweeted, “Distressed to know that veteran Congress leader Ahmed Patel is no more. An astute Parliamentarian, Shri Patel combined the skills of a strategist and the charm of a mass leader. His amiability won him friends across party lines. My condolences to his family and friends.” Mr. Modi reached out to Mr. Patel’s son Faisal Patel and family. “Saddened by the demise of Ahmed Patel Ji. He spent years in public life, serving society. Known for his sharp mind, his role in strengthening the Congress Party would always be remembered. Spoke to his son Faisal and expressed condolences,” he tweeted. Ms. Gandhi said that in his death she had lost an “irreplaceable comrade, faithful colleague and a friend.” Mr. Patel dedicated his entire life to the Congress, she noted. In a condolence message, she said, “His faithfulness and dedication, his commitment to his duty, his always being there to help, his generosity were rare qualities that distinguished him from others. I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend”. Manmohan’s tribute Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who often depended on Mr. Patel to communicate with the party and Ms. Gandhi, said his knowledge of the Congress was unmatched. “In his death, the Congress party and this country, has lost a very good leader who always thought for the betterment of the poor and downtrodden people of the society”, he wrote in a letter to Mr. Patel’s wife, Memoona Ahmed. Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who often didn’t share a cordial relationship with Mr. Patel, called him an asset. “It is a sad day. Shri Ahmed Patel was a pillar of the Congress party. He lived and breathed Congress and stood with the party through its most difficult times,” he tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/president-and-pm-mourn-cong-leader/article33181205.ece
26 November 2020||Guwahati,||NSCN (IM) slams Centre on peace talks||The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (IM) has slammed the Centre for being “ambivalent” about resolving the 23-year-old Naga political issue. The fresh attack by the extremist group was timed with the visit of General Manoj Mukund Naravane, the Chief of Army Staff, to Nagaland on issues related to peace, tranquillity and security in the State. In a statement issued late Tuesday evening, the NSCN (IM) criticised the directive of the Ministry of Home Affairs to the paramilitary Assam Rifles to intensify operations against the Naga groups. This, along with the Centre’s ambivalent attitude, has become the “boiling point of the conflict” after more than 23 years of political talks since the signing of a ceasefire agreement in 1997, the outfit said.

Mr. Rao said some people were hatching plots for political reasons in the context of GHMC polls. They tried to mislead public by posting morphed pictures on social media. Later, they provoked public with their speeches. Yet, the peace loving people of the city ignored the provocations and the false propaganda. There was no response from general public to the hate speeches. Those who indulged in the acts realised that attempts to win votes with money would also not work. Therefore, they got down to hatching plots to trigger communal clashes, mainly in Hyderabad. They were trying to launch extensive publicity in Hyderabad after creating trouble in Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam or any other place. Even in Hyderabad, their attempt was to create disturbances at some place and give it a communal colour. Mr. Rao also said the government was committed to maintenance of peace and harmony in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the State. The tricks of anti-social elements should not be allowed at any cost. The government adopted an uncompromising stand against anti-social elements and maintenance of law and order from the beginning. That was why the State, Hyderabad in particular, was peaceful. There was no need to go soft on people who compromised on peace in Hyderabad. No one, including those from ruling party, should be spared. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP M.

Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, abetted the smuggling activities in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case. It was while considering the custodial application of Mr. Sivasankar that the court pulled up the agency for its omissions in the affidavit and remand reports. “It is not discernible from the primary records why accomplices like Swapna Prabha Suresh and Sarith have chosen accused number 23, M. Sivasankar, for using his influence to clear the smuggled gold. Nothing is stated in the affidavit to the effect that under what capacity Mr. Sivasankar could successfully abet the commission of smuggling through diplomatic channel,” the court observed in its order. Crucial details The judge noted that the records placed before it did not disclose any personal or professional details of Mr. Sivasankar other than this residential address. The high official designation held by him previously and his alleged nexus with other accused have not found place in the affidavit and the remand application, the court criticised. C. Deepu, judge of the Economic Offences Court, expressed his “deep sense of dissatisfaction about the aforesaid material omissions that are not expected in a case like this.” Forensic evidence The court noted that the forensic evidence collected after retrieving the data from Mr. Sivasankar’s mobile phone persuaded the investigating officer to hold that he was involved in the smuggling operation by away of abetting the mastermind. The investigating officer has justifiable reason to arraign Mr. Sivasankar as the accused, the judge noted in his order. The mode of abatement and the quid pro quo of smuggle-deal are required to be investigated. Five-day custody An intensive probe is required to find out all stakeholders of the deal, the order said.

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||After 5 years, reservoir opens its floodgates||After nearly five years, the shutters of the Chembarambakkam reservoir were opened on Wednesday as a precautionary measure to prevent inundation, particularly in the upstream stretches. From the initial 1,000 cubic feet per second released from the reservoir at noon, the Water Resources Department (WRD) released 5,000 cusecs into the Adyar river through the 14 shutters around 6 p.m. With a steady increase in inflow to nearly 5,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) and to maintain the water level close to 21.98 ft., the Water Resources Department decided to discharge the water with flood warnings. The reservoir’s storage stood at 3,115 million cubic feet (mcft) against its capacity of 3,645 mcft. It may be recalled that Krishna water was being diverted to the waterbody until a few days ago. It received rainfall of about 10 cm till 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Officials of the WRD noted that the measure to open the floodgates ahead of time was taken to avoid any backflow in the upstream stretches or the Adyar river’s tributaries. The release would be gradually raised at 500 cusecs per hour depending on the inflow of rainwater. The WRD had increased the water release to 6,000 cusecs at 8 p.m. on Wednesday. Officials noted that the Adyar river carried a flow of 13,000 cusecs, which included flood water from other tanks and upstream. The water release will be maintained at 7,000 cusecs by night and again regulated by Thursday. “We expect the river to carry up to 20,000 cusecs by Thursday morning, given the heavy rainfall over the catchment areas due to Cyclone Nivar,” an official said. The storm surge expected due to the Cyclone Nivar may not have a major impact on the Adyar river and is not likely to lead to flooding. It would be regulated till Thursday, and the goal was to maintain the reservoir’s water level at 22 ft., which was 2 ft. below its total capacity. “Only eight lakes out of 25 waterbodies upstream of the Chembarambakkam reservoir have filled up so far. Surplus from a few tanks upstream are draining into the waterway and it may be carrying 7,000 cusecs on Wednesday. The Adyar river has been widened to carry about 70,000 cusecs safely at Saidapet, and the maximum capacity is now nearly 1 lakh cusecs,” an official said. According to Kancheepuram collector Mageswari Ravikumar, water release from Chembarambakkam reservoir was increased to nearly 9,000 cusecs of water around 10.30 p.m. corresponding to the inflow and heavy rains.  Residents need not fear flooding in the Adyar river as water release was being done in a controlled manner, taking into account flood water draining from the upstream reaches too, officials said. Flood warning was issued to low-level areas along the river and surplus courses such as Kundrathur, Sirukalathur, Tirumudivakkam, Tiruneermalai and in the city limits. The WRD also discharged water from tanks in the tail-end of the river such as Manimangalam and Nandivaram to maintain their level 2 ft. lower than capacity. An advisory of the Central Water Commission noted that the Adyar river may carry a flow of 16,000 cusecs-18,000 cusecs near Saidapet against 1 lakh cusecs in 2015 flood due to intense rains on Wednesday. The two other major reservoirs have been getting steady inflows too. Other reservoirs While the Poondi reservoir, mostly gets Krishna water as inflow, the Red Hills reservoir received an inflow of 2,500 cusecs at 6 p.m. and its water level stood at 18 ft. against a total capacity of 21.20 ft. Sources said the shutters of the Red Hills reservoir could also be opened on Thursday, but only depending on the inflow and rainfall. Initially, about 500 cusecs may be released. The water level may be maintained at 20 ft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gates-of-chembarambakkam-reservoir-opened-after-5-years/article33181391.ece

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19: Railways Ministry seeks report on purchases||The Ministry of Railways has called for a detailed report on the purchases made by Zonal Railways, Workshops, Production Units and other major railway establishments as part of the ‘India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Strengthening Project’. a joint initiative of the Central government and the World Bank under which a $1-billion loan was disbursed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The Ministry of Railways, being one of the implementing agencies of the project, was allocated a sum of Rs. 399 crore to spend across its network to strengthen health infrastructure in the fight against COVID-19 this financial year. The project was also meant to prevent, detect and respond to the threat of coronavirus and strengthen national health systems for preparedness. In a note issued to all General Managers/Chief Administrative Officers a couple of days ago, the Railway Board said only 13 of the 26 railway units had furnished the details of procurement. Among them, only three zones had shown substantial utilisation of allotted funds. While the Northern Railway had spent Rs. 44.93 crore of the Rs. 45.60 crore earmarked, the Central Railway and East Coast Railway had spent Rs. 23.99 crore and Rs. 8.74 crore respectively. The funds to combat the pandemic came with the condition of “universal eligibility” in procurements which meant that all preferential market access policies, including Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, Micro Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) Policy, certain benefits to start-ups, were not applicable in the implementation of the project to be implemented till April 2022. The Indian Railways were among the first to respond to the pandemic by converting coaches into mobile isolation/quarantine wards with bed facilities. However, the modified coaches were not put into use much with the State Governments establishing adequate Covid Care Centres in all major cities. The World Bank fund was to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure by purchasing more ventilators, oxygen cylinders, laboratory machines, Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits, face shields, hospital furniture, medical equipment, gloves, goggles and other consumables.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/covid-19-railways-ministry-seeks-report-on-purchases/article33181411.ece
26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IIT-Madras students come up with device for typing in braille||Four students from the Indian Institute of Technology - Madras have come together to develop a handy device for the visually impaired. The assistive device fits into the port of a smartphone and helps them to type, learn and read braille content. It also allows them to self-navigate through space and recognise people and objects. Four students — Sundar Raman P., Adil Mohammed K., Shivam Maheshwari and Andrea Elizabeth Biju — got together to develop the device. While Sundar is a final-year electrical engineering student, Adil and Shivam are pursuing second- and third-year engineering design. Andrea is a second-year student of aerospace engineering. The students improvised on an existing product that allows the visually impaired to read PDF files on their phone. But it is a cumbersome exercise as the reader must carry a separate device. Sundar said the aim was to leverage the smartphone’s capability, as most people carry one today. The team came up with Cube, a compact device that fits into the smartphone’s charging port or earphone jack. It has four refreshable braille cells (24 dots) on one side and a camera on the other. The camera on the device, along with the smartphone’s camera, is used to capture and process (computer vision) a wide field of view to provide the user navigation information through tactile braille cells about the proximity and nature of the obstacles. The refreshable braille cells project symbols to convey time, proximity to obstacles etc. and help in learning and typing on the smartphone in braille. Currently, the visually impaired rely on slow audio feedback to type. But Cube intends to change that, said Sundar. The device can be folded to the back of the phone using a flexible connector. Vishnu Suresh, a fourth-year student of Integrated MA in English Studies, who tried it out, said being able to type on the phone was like typing on a braille typewriter. “It has a keyboard through which we can type the way we type on a braille typewriter. It is perfect,” he said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-m-students-design-device-for-typing-in-braille/article33181409.ece

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Production units, businesses hit in Chennai||Cyclone Nivar has forced business houses, industrial estates and manufacturing units in Chennai to pause their systems and conveyor belts. Businessmen and entrepreneurs, who have their operations at locations where the cyclone will be passing, have indicated that they have learnt enough lessons from the 2015 floods and Cyclone Vardah in 2016, and have taken ample measures to ensure that the damage is minimal. At the Sriperumbudur belt, an automobile hub nicknamed the ‘Detroit of India’, most companies have asked employees not to report for work on Thursday. An employee of one of the car manufacturing firms in this belt said, “Employees were asked to go home after the first shift on Wednesday. We have now received communication not to come to work and stay safe at home.” The MSME sector, which was badly affected due to the floods in 2015, has taken measures, but units here are still worried about closing down businesses for the cyclone. “We are yet to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and a day’s closure means a huge loss for small units,” said a proprietor of an MSME unit in Guindy. “With just 80 days of work in this financial year, MSME units situated in Tamil Nadu, especially those in the industrial estates at Ambattur, Guindy, Sriperumbudur, Irunkattukottai, Oragadam, Gummidipoondi, etc., are reeling from tremendous pressure for survival. With heavy rain and winds, many units are expected to lose materials worth several crores kept in the factory and held at sites,” K.E. Raghunathan, convenor, Consortium of Indian Associations, pointed out. He added that industrial estates continue to be prone to floods and calamities. R. Selvam, secretary of the Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Association, said most of the units are closed. “We have deputed our association team to clear the waterlogging within the estate,” he added. For the IT sector, a majority of its employees are already working from home. The operations head of a leading IT firm said most employees are working from their homes, which is away from Chennai, and the impact would be minimal. “Only 15% of our workforce is in Chennai,” he added. The retail sector, which was bleeding until the festive season commenced, has also downed its shutters. Suhail Sattar, chairman, Chennai chapter, Retailers’ Association of India, said, “Most of the stores are shut today [Wednesday]...We are hoping that this blows over and we are able to get back to normal functioning. As for the impact, we are hoping that it would be limited to the loss of sale for a day or two.”  With just 80 days of work in this financial year, MSME units situated in Tamil Nadu are reeling from tremendous pressure for survivalK.E.

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Special attention paid to avoid sudden discharge of water||Keeping the experience of the 2015 floods in mind, the Public Works Department is taking no chances with regard to the discharge of flood water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir this time. The officials have taken steps to avoid sudden and heavy discharge of water from the tank. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who gave the go ahead to release the water from Chembarambakkam on Wednesday, has apparently authorised the executive engineer concerned to take steps regarding the water release depending upon the situation of inflows and rainfall pattern. Consequently the release from the reservoir was proportionately increased during the evening. “We are deliberately keeping the water level of the tank marginally below 22 ft against the full level of 24 ft. This provides us a cushion for absorbing any surge in the inflow and regulate it accordingly,” a senior official explained, adding that the department is adopting such a cautionary approach even though the Meteorological Department has not given any projection for unusually heavy rainfall on Wednesday or Thursday. The official elaborated that as soon as the cyclone crossed the coast and rainfall ceased over the tank’s catchment, the department would start building up the storage of the tank, which is one of the important sources of water supply to Chennai. The official adds that the Sayamurti Sagar in Poondi continues to receive Krishna water inflow.

A complaint in this regard was lodged by then manager P.D. Rajendra Babu of Indian Bank, Erukkanchery, with the City Police Commissioner after conducting an audit into these transactions. Based on his complaint, the special wing led by inspector Pushparaj investigated the case and arrested B. Vinodh, 33, then assistant manager of the bank, and his associate S. Nataraj, 35, who was working in a private firm. While Vinodh was the assistant manager of the bank between 2017-19, he noticed a few accounts were inoperative since the account holders were pensioners and after their natural death, their legal heirs did not turn up to activate the accounts. He activated the accounts using forged signatures and used ATM cards to draw the money from the accounts, the police said. He also diverted money to Nataraj’s account. They swindled Rs. 47.60 lakh from 18 accounts, the police said. The duo were remanded in judicial custody. The Additional Commissioner of Police P.C. Thenmozhi appealed to the public to be vigilant and pay adequate attention to bank accounts of deceased family members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/assistant-bank-manager-and-his-associate-held-for-fraud/article33181389.ece

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Electricity does not know caste difference, it can attack a Dalit and a non-Dalit with equal force: HC||Wondering how provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 can be invoked in an electrocution case, the Madras High Court has said, “Electric current does not know caste difference and it can electrocute a Dalit and a non-Dalit with equal force”. Justice P.N. Prakash said it was ‘strange’ that the Thellar police in Tiruvannamalai district had chosen to invoke the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act just because the victim happened to be a person belonging to a SC and was involved in catching rats and other rodents. Observation The judge went on to state that it was not the case of the police that the victim and the landlord had an enmity which led to the former’s death. The prosecution’s case was that the landlord had illegally electrified his property and the victim had died when he was passing through it in search of rats. The death had occurred on September 14. LandlordaArrested The police arrested the landlord, S. Elumalai, and remanded him in judicial custody on September 15. A special court for hearing cases booked under the SC/ST Act refused to grant him bail on October 9, and hence, he filed an appeal in the High Court. Compensation Holding that the interest of justice would be served if the appellant was granted bail, the judge directed him to pay an interim compensation of Rs. 25,000 to the victim’s family irrespective of any other compensation to which they would be entitled to as per law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/electricity-does-not-know-caste-difference-says-high-court/article33181412.ece

Stalin on Wednesday said Union Home Minister Amit Shah had no locus standi to criticise dynastic politics since it was rampant in the BJP. Addressing party functionaries in Tirunelveli district via video conferencing, he said when Mr. Shah talked about dynastic politics in the presence of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, he should have in mind the “desperate efforts” being made by the latter to make his son a Cabinet Minister. “Jay Shah, the son of Mr. Shah is the secretary of the BCCI. Did he get the post on merit or because of his father’s position? Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s son Pankaj Singh is also an MLA and Varun Gandhi, the son of Maneka Gandhi, is a third-time MP,” said Mr. Stalin, listing out senior BJP leaders whose children occupied posts in the party and government. He asked whether Mr. Shah was not aware of the positions enjoyed by these leaders and their children. “If Mr. Shah calls me a member of dynastic politics, I am indeed a member. I am the heir-apparent of Kalaignar (late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi). I do not want any other honour,” Mr. Stalin said. He said the name Stalin did not represent any individual, but a movement. “I am not an individual. None in the Dravidian movement are individuals. We are the inheritors of the Dravidian movement that will uproot Aryanism,” he said.  If Mr. Shah calls me a member of dynastic politics, I am indeed a member.

26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC transfers trial in case booked against policemen for thrashing advocate||Every accused, however bad, is entitled to a fair trial, the Madras High Court has said and ordered transfer of a case booked against a group of policemen for allegedly thrashing an advocate at Ulundurpet police station in Villupuram district. Justice P.N. Prakash transferred the trial to Tiruchi since one of the accused K. Palani, an Inspector, feared that he may not get justice if the trial was conducted in Villupuram where the complainant advocate Saran Raj was practising. The orders were passed on a petition preferred by the Inspector to quash the criminal case booked against him. The judge rejected the plea for quashing the case but acceded to a request made for transfer to another district in order to ensure a fair trial. It was the case of the prosecution that the Ulundurpet police had arrested the advocate in connection with another criminal case on June 30, 2015. He was produced before a judicial magistrate and was ordered to be remanded in judicial custody. However, instead of taking him to jail, the policemen reportedly took him to the police station and bet him black and blue. A First Information Report was registered against the policemen in 2015 and a charge sheet was also filed against them in 2016. Thereafter, the committal proceedings from the judicial magistrate to a Court of Sessions could not take place due to pendency of the present quash petition since 2017. Now, Justice Prakash ordered that the case should be transferred from Ulundurpet to Tiruchi within four weeks. After the transfer, it would be sufficient if the Inspector appears before the Tiruchi court only if it was essential. Nevertheless, he must execute a bond for Rs. 25,000 and undertake that an advocate nominated by him would conduct trial without adopting any dilatory tactics, the judge added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-transfers-trial-in-case-booked-against-policemen-for-thrashing-advocate/article33181575.ece
26 November 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Power disruption in Chennai||Several residential localities experienced power failure for several hours on Wednesday, when heavy rains pounded the city. Residents in several areas said they experienced intermittent power cuts ranging from two to three hours. The officials of the Tamil Nadu General and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) said the power cuts were part of precautionary steps taken to avoid any electrical accidents due to waterlogging of roads, trees falling on transformers and snapping of overhead power lines due to gusty winds. Power supply was switched off in parts of south Chennai, covering Nanganallur, Velachery, Madipakkam, Keelkattalai, Pallikaranai, Medavakkam and Tambaram. These areas are predominantly served by overhead power lines and the local EB officials went for a power shutdown from the morning. In several streets of Velachery, covering Ram Nagar, Vijaya Nagar, Balamurugan Nagar, Annai Indira Nagar and Bethel Avenue, power supply was stopped due to waterlogged roads. Also several parts of ECR and OMR, including Thoraipakkam, went without power supply. K. Ramaswamy, a resident of Maheshwari Avenue in Ullagaram-Puzhithivakkam, complained that the power supply which went off at 2 p.m. had not been restored for over four hours. A senior official of south Chennai said local officials from different sections were deputed to restore power supply even in those roads where rain water stagnated after taking necessary safety precautions. In central and north parts of the city, power supply was switched off by the electricity officials due to waterlogging and tripping of transformers. A senior official of Tangedco said power supply in some core parts of the city was cut off mainly due to waterlogging. It was disrupted in NSC Bose Road, Anna Pillai Street, Anderson Street, Edappalayam, Cooks Road and Decaster Road in Pulianthope; Sivarajapuram of Choolai section; Baraccah Road in Nammalwarpet; Divan Bashyam Street in Saidapet; and Chari street and Lotus Colony in T.

26 November 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||User fee collection turns out to be a problem, yet again||Coimbatore Corporation’s attempt to collect user fee from a few residents turned out to be a half-hearted attempt as it gave up after the latter protested. The Corporation made the attempt around Deepavali in Ramnagar, where the sanitary inspector in-charge had asked apartments to pay Rs. 100 a flat a month for waste collection. The inspector, besides asking the apartments to pay in advance for the next two months, had also told them that in January 2021, they would have to pay for the whole year. And, the inspector had also stopped collecting waste from a few apartments in the area, sources said. The sudden demand from the officer left the apartment residents scurrying for explanation. A Ramnagar resident said apartments wanted to know the nature of the fee that the Corporation demanded. For, if it was waste collection fee for bulk waste generators, no apartment in Ramnagar would fit into that category because none had more than 36 flats and crossed the 100 kg-a-day threshold limit for bulk waste generators. Second, apartments paying the fee in advance gave rise to problems like tenants refusing to pay in advance and apartment associations contacting owners of unoccupied flats to pay. Finally, when it turned out that the fee the sanitary inspector had demanded was waste collection user fee, the apartment residents continued their protest, because they wanted to know why only apartment residents and not those in houses had to pay and why only Ramnagar, said S. Natarajan, a Ramnagar resident and Swachh Bharat ambassador. Senior officials in the Corporation said though the sanitary inspector had only demanded what was permitted in law, he had acted on his own. There was no instruction from the commissioner to sanitary inspectors to resume collecting the user fee, which the Corporation had suspended a few years ago in the wake of stiff political protest. The officials further said that the Corporation had suspended the fee collection, which the Corporation Council had approved, published in gazette and committed to collect after receiving funds for solid waste management from the Central Government under the JNNURM scheme. They also said that this was not the first time that the Corporation had to give up user fee collection and thus far it had been unsuccessful in its collection. In Ramnagar, when the Corporation went ahead by suspending waste collection from apartments, the residents took up the issue with senior Corporation officials and also complained to the Coimbatore South MLA Amman K. Arjunan. With the result, the Corporation gave up demanding user fee collection, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/user-fee-collection-turns-out-to-be-a-problem-yet-again/article33181423.ece

26 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Cyclone Nivar leaves no impact on Madurai district||Though Cyclone Nivar is unlikely to have any major impact on Madurai district, the district administration is fully geared to meet any eventuality. Collector T. Anbalagan held discussion with officials of various departments and inspected the Disaster Management control room on Wednesday. With no rainfall reported in Madurai district for the past five days and a majority of the waterbodies having less than 75% storage, Madurai district faced a low threat, according to a senior official. “Initially, it was predicted that northern parts of the district along Kottampatti would have heavy rainfall. However, with the movement of the cyclone towards the north, the threat perception has come down,” the official said. The district has reported nil rainfall since November 20. Out of the 1,322 irrigation tanks belonging to the Public Works Department, only 179 tanks have water for 75% of their capacity. While 158 tanks have 50% to 75% storage, the remaining tanks have less than 25% storage. Similarly, out of the 951 minor irrigation tanks, only 2 tanks have over 75% storage while others have less than 25% storage. “This has lessened the threat of flooding,” the source added. Meanwhile, zonal teams have already inspected the 27 low-lying areas that are vulnerable to flooding. The district administration has identified old buildings and vulnerable dwellings like mud wall huts and in case of heavy rain, people would be evacuated as a precautionary measure and provided shelter in relief camps. Out of the 27 areas, 24 vulnerable areas are in the Madurai city limits. The district administration has asked the Corporation administration to take steps to ensure that the areas that have been dug up for executing work under Smart City projects are given special focus. The entire strength of firemen in all 14 fire and rescue services stations have been kept on an alert mode. “All vehicles and equipment meant to face the cyclone has been kept ready,” said District Officer (Fire and Rescue), S. Kalyanakumar. Life buoys, life jackets, ropes and inflatable boats, equipment like power saws and concrete cutters have been kept ready. Generators and pumps are available in all stations. Meanwhile, the district administration has asked officials of TANGEDCO to replace vulnerable electric posts. Corporation Commissioner, S. Visakan, said that all the stormwater drains and culverts have been cleaned to prevent blockages. “We have identified 300 spots of water stagnation. The problem and its solution for all the spots have been documented and copies are available with the Assistant Engineers to mitigate the situation at the earliest,” he said. The Madurai Corporation has a 24x7 control room. Any distress call received over 842-842-5000 would be recorded. “To avoid time delays, the phone number of the AE concerned would be shared with the caller. Similarly, the nature of complaint would be sent to the AE both in text and the recorded conversation with the caller. This will help the AE to gauge the gravity of the situation and act accordingly,” Mr. Visakan said. The complaint would be closed only after getting feedback from the complainant. Efforts have been taken to reduce the time of draining the stagnant water. Adequate number of motor pumps have been kept ready to drain water, he added.  Problem and solution for all the spots have been documented and copies are available with Assistant Engineers  S.

26 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court takes serious view of obscene content on television||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has expressed shock at the television content that is being telecast after 10 p.m., especially the medical talk shows. The court also observed that some of the advertisements there were telecast on television channels exhibited obscenity and were viewed by people of all ages. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi, who had restrained the television channels from telecasting such obscene content on November 12, in their detailed order observed that the content being telecast was in violation of the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995 and the Rules, 1994. The judges said that such content attracted Section 16 of the Act which speaks about the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act. Similarly, as per Rule 7(1) of the Cable Television Network Rules, 1994, the programmes telecast should not offend the morality, decency and religious susceptibilities of the subscribers. Further, as per Rule 7(2), the cable operators should ensure that the programmes telecast adhered to established norms. However, there are numerous television channels and obscene programmes and advertisements are telecast round-the-clock. It will definitely affect the minds of youngsters and children, the judges said. It is clear that there is no censorship for advertisements and programmes which are being telecast on the television channels, the court said and ordered notice to the Centre and the State. The Centre has to answer on the censorship of programmes telecast on television channels as contemplated under Section 5(A) of the Cinematograph Act, 1952, the judges said. The court adjourned the hearing in the public interest litigation petition filed seeking a direction to the authorities concerned to regulate the television content, till December 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-takes-serious-view-of-obscene-content-on-tv/article33181514.ece

26 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Illegal dump yard comes up||An illegal dumping yard has come up along the Madurai-Tiruchi highway behind Pandi Muneeswarar temple. Right from building debris to agricultural waste and from chicken waste to automobile scrap are being dumped along the four-way highway. What started as an isolated incident a few months back has become so organised that the garbage dumping which was for around 200 metres length along the highway has doubled in the last two months, complained a city resident C. Jawahar Ravindran. Besides, branches of various trees, plastic materials, used upholstery, including coconut pith and foams granite waste, are dumped every day. What might have started as a stealthy work of a few people throwing unwanted materials along the gorge abutting the national highways has deteriorated to dumping of all kinds of waste even during day-time in the last few weeks. This is evident from several bags of waste are left along the road. Being a “no-man’s land” as no residential area or commercial building are around, the illegal activity has never been challenged. People who come here for a walk or cycling attracted by the pollution-free atmosphere far away from the city are highly disturbed by the sight of the filth, stench and smoke, complained Mr. Jawahar. Besides the stench that often goes unnoticed by the fast moving vehicles, the increased presence of rag-pickers who set the garbage on fire is a matter of concern as thick smoke often blinds the road. Chicken waste invites lot of dogs that pull the filth on the road margins that might lead to accidents. Corporation City Health Officer, P. Kumaragurubaran, said that the issue had not come to the notice of the local body. He said that such indiscriminate dumping is illegal and should be avoided. Stating that efforts would be taken to clear the garbage, Dr. Kumaragurubaran added that Corporation employees will keep vigil at the spot and catch the violators. “We will impose fine on such people to discourage further dumping,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/illegal-dumping-yard-comes-up/article33181537.ece
26 November 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea for medical seat under 7.5 % quota dismissed||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has dismissed a petition filed by the father of a medical aspirant, who wanted his daughter to be considered eligible under the 7.5% horizontal quota for government school students. The petitioner’s daughter had studied at government schools with the exception of Class VI, which she studied at a private aided school. Pandora’s box A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the court sympathised with the petitioner’s daughter. However, if any relaxation is granted in this petition, it would open up a pandora's box and there will not be any limit, the judges said. The court was hearing the petition filed by R. Arivazhagan, who said his daughter, A. Arivika, had studied at the Panchayat Union School in Navakkollai from Class I to V. Due to family circumstances, they moved to Punnavasal, and since there was no government school there, she studied Class VI at an aided minority educational institution. Thereafter, she studied Class VII-XII at the Government Girls’ Higher Secondary school in Peravurani. It was only because there was no government high school in Punnavasal that his daughter was constrained to study at an aided institution, the petitioner said. He said his daughter should be considered for admission to medical courses under the 7.5% quota. The petitioner contended that students who studied up to Class VIII at a school of a specific category or an unaided school under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, and the remaining classes up to the higher secondary level at government schools, are accepted as students who have studied at government schools. The court said the issue cannot be taken into consideration. The student studied Class VI at an aided private school, and this would definitely bar the petitioner's daughter from claiming admission under the preferential quota for government school students, as she cannot be considered a student who had studied at government schools, the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-for-seat-under-75-horizontal-quota-dismissed/article33181516.ece

26 November 2020||SIVAGANGA,TAMIL NADU||Sivaganga farmers reap rich dividends from farm ponds||K. Kumar, a progressive farmer in Maaviduthikottai near Devakottai in Sivaganga district, has been reaping benefits from the farm pond he established less than a year ago as water for irrigation is available and water table has also improved. Visiting the farm pond here on Wednesday, Collector P. Madhusudhan Reddy said the State government had encouraged the farmers to have their own farm ponds. For this purpose, 100% subsidy was offered in the range of Rs. 60,000 to Rs. 1 lakh to the farmers if they fulfilled certain criteria. Apart from the Agriculture Engineering Department, the Horticulture and Animal Husbandry departments also offered the subsidy to eligible farmers, he told reporters. By setting up the farm ponds, whenever there was rain, the farmer can store it and utilise for his crop by pumping it out with the help of a motor pumpset. This conservation in a small area, adjacent to the cultivable lands, not only helped in recharging the water table, but made the farmer self-reliant for water for irrigation. The Collector said that apart from storage of water for irrigation, the farm ponds could also be used for fishing and a particular variety of grass could be raised along the bund of the farm pond for cattle feed. During a brief interaction with Mr. Kumar, the Collector also learnt that the yield of the crops raised in the belt had improved. He appreciated the field assistants from the Agriculture Engineering Department for having a good rapport with farmers. An official from the Agriculture Department said that this year alone 537 farm ponds had been established in the district and Devakottai block had 67. So far, 1,680 farm ponds had been created over the last three years. For a drought-prone district like Sivaganga, the concept of farm ponds had been a boon to the farmers. Offering subsidy components would encourage more farmers to establish farm ponds, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sivaganga-farmers-reap-rich-dividends-from-farm-ponds/article33181543.ece
26 November 2020||Sivakasi,TAMIL NADU||Restored ‘oorani’ brims with water||An ‘oorani’ dug up on a land measuring 82 cents that was retrieved from an encroacher in June has water to its brim, thanks to the recent rain. “It has water to its full capacity and already the new ‘oorani’ has started showing benefits,” said Athikulam Sengulam panchayat president, C. Sekar, 38. A casual enquiry about a layout of residential plots under Srivilliputtur panchayat union during a routine inspection by Sivakasi Sub-Collector C. Dinesh Kumar revealed that a portion of the layout had been encroached. “It has been under encroachment for a few generations. I have seen it as a paddy field in my childhood. But later it became part of a layout,” Mr. Sekar said. The officials found that 82 cents of land, now worth a few crores, was earlier called Kothai ‘oorani,’ though the officials had issued patta for it in 1990. “We immediately planned to restore the oorani so that it will benefit people and to prevent it from encroachers again,” the Sub-Collector said. The panchayat spent around Rs. 2 lakh to dig up the ‘oorani’ and laid a walking path on its bund. The oorani, measuring 60 metres by 55 metres with a depth of 12 feet, was restored ahead of the monsoon. Mr. Sekar said about 10 irrigation wells in a radius of over 500 metres from the ‘oorani’ were getting recharged now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restored-oorani-brims-with-water/article33181556.ece

26 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Higher educational institutions gear up for offline classes||Higher educational institutions are in the process of fixing malfunction of eletrical fixtures in classrooms and hostels, in the wake of the instruction issued by the Government to start classes for final year PG and UG students from December 2. The phased resumption of offline classes was meant to ensure that the physical distancing was maintained, according to Bharathidasan University sources. The government has not come out with any timeline for offline classes for undergraduate students in first and intermediate years, and first-year post-graduate students. There is a mixed opinion among the teaching faculty about the start of offline classes in a week's time. "In the context of apprehensions being expressed at the global level about the second wave of COVID epidemic, the government could consider pushing the date for offline classes to January next year," a senior professor of Bharathidasan University said. Another line of thought among the faculty is that the offline classes must not be delayed since most of the students were not really serious about keeping track of online classes. The teachers say they face limitations in admonishing irregular students through the online interaction mode. Vice-Chancellor of Bharathidasan University P. Manisankar said resumption of offline classes has been planned only for final year students of science courses. A decision on classes for students in the Arts programmes will be taken later, he said. As the intake for the arts and science programmes have been increased, some of the university departments had to undergo a struggle to fill the seats. The increase in intake was effective last year also, but, this time, the university administration had laid emphasis on filling all the seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/higher-educational-institutions-gear-up-for-offline-classes/article33181511.ece
26 November 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi professor wins international award for innovative research on water conservation||A botany professor from National College in Tiruchi has been awarded the ‘Best Solution Award’ at World Water Challenge 2020, a competition organised by the Ministry of Environment, South Korea, and Korean Water Forum. S. Senthil Kumar, Assistant Professor, worked on his project ‘Extraction of water from air’ for four years before presenting it at the competition. The idea of harnessing water from air-conditioners came to Mr. Senthil Kumar when he observed the water let out from a unit at the botany laboratory in his college. With water crisis becoming a regular problem due to failure of monsoons and with increasing demand as population is on the rise, a viable solution had to be found. “Water is not an unlimited resource. Our only way of conserving it is using it wisely and reusing it. Reseach over many years has showed that moisture in the air is a big source of water,” Mr. Senthil Kumar said. Although conversion of water from moisture is well-known, it is too expensive to harness. “There are several expensive air-water extractors in the market, but they consume a large amount of electricity, which is also loss of energy. An air-conditioner essentially does the same thing, except the water is let out as a waste. This water can be harnessed, purified and consumed,” he said. Climate change and increasing heat and humidity have led to increase in sale of air-conditioners. The water can be harnessed at individual homes using their own air-conditioners. To prove his theory, he first set up a collection unit for the air-conditioner at his botany lab, where he found that 12 litres of water were being wasted per day. “If one individual consumes three litres of water in a day, we can collect water for four people per day, with just one small one-tonne AC,” he said. To further his research Mr. Senthil Kumar applied to the Department of Science and Technology for a grant. With the funds, he took the help of students and studied large corporate offices. “At a corporate office in Ambattur, Chennai, where a 16-tonne AC runs for at least 10 hours a day, 120 litres of water were collected per day. The office’s drinking water requirement is 80-100 litres, which means it could fulfil their water needs with 20 litres to spare,” he said. The collected water is distilled, but can be processed to be converted to clean, drinking water. Mr. Senthil Kumar's research was one of the 86 applications submitted from 32 countries across the world. The final round involved nine participants and was evaluated by a committee. On winning the award, he was presented with Rs. 6.9 lakh and an opportunity to present his work at World Water Forum in South Africa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-professor-wins-international-award-for-innovative-research-on-water-conservation/article33181510.ece

26 November 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||‘Hold judicial inquiry into woman’s death’||Demanding judicial inquiry by a sitting judge into the alleged suicide of a 44-year-old woman in Suthamalli after police conducted a search in her house at odd hours on Tuesday, opposition parties submitted a petition to the Collector here on Wednesday. Later the representatives of Congress, Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK),Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK ) spoke to media persons. They charged the police of high-handedness. They said the woman, Sakuntala, was living with her two sons after she was separated from her husband. Visiting the house at 1 a.m. under the guise of enquiry was highly condemnable. The State government should take action against the police officers and also give Rs. 25 lakh compensation to the family members of Sakuntala. However, the police maintained that they had picked up Pradeep, 22, her son from the house for inquiry in connection with a burglary reported in Gomathi Nagar. Based on his confession, the police visited the house where he handed over the stolen goods in the presence of his mother. Later, on his confession, they took him to his uncle’s house, which was nearby, to recover a few more stolen goods. During this period, the woman had allegedly set fire to herself and suffered severe burns. After the family members raised a hue and cry, the police rushed her to the hospital where she died. Pradeep, a habitual offender, figured in a POCSO Act crime and was behind bars till recently, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hold-judicial-inquiry-into-womans-death/article33181576.ece
26 November 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Slight spurt in Tirunelveli||There is a slight increase in COVID-19 cases in the last couple of days, said doctors at Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital here on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters, the doctors said that till the second week of November, the number of patients which had fallen to a single digit, suddenly increased to 11 on November 21, 18 the next day and touched 21 on November 25. With the onset of rainy season, there should have been a slight spurt. One of the reasons could be that though people had been advised to stay indoors and venture out of home only if warranted, a majority of the people are not following the guidelines. People were not wearing face masks and ignoring physical distancing norms. Shopkeepers were also not insisting on their customers to wear face masks any more and the practice of thermal scanning to check body temperature had been discontinued in many places i9n Tirunelveli. Interestingly, recent COVID-19 cases were reported only in Tirunelveli Corporation limits and not in Ambasamudram, Manur, Palayamkottai, Pappakudi, Radhapuram, Cheranmahadevi and Kalakkad blocks, the doctors said. Collector V. Vishnu, who assumed office recently, distributed face masks to the public at an awareness programme held at Vannarpet. The public were told to keep themselves clean and adhere to the guidelines. District Revenue Officer Perumal, Dean Ravichandran, Deputy Director of Health Varadarajan and City Health Officer Suganya participated. Palayamkottai Central Prison authorities also took out a motorcycle rally to create awareness of safe practices in the COVID-19 times.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/slight-spurt-in-tirunelveli/article33181898.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Cyclone Nivar shuts down life in coastal districts||Eerie silence prevailed along the Nagapattinam-Karaikal coastline ahead of the landfall of Nivar cyclone on Wednesday. Squally weather accompanied with heavy rain and strong wind forced the people, including fishermen and traders, to remain indoors. The sea was rough all through the day. No one was allowed to venture into the sea as Number-8 cyclonic flag was raised in Nagapattinam and Karaikal ports. The streets of Karaikal looked deserted as Section 144 of CrPC was promulgated mainly to keep the people indoors due to heavy rain and gusty winds. The fishermen of Akkaraipettai in Nagapattinam and Arcottuthurai near Vedaranyam moved their boats to safety. They were all moved to neighbouring cyclone rescue centres. The police, who patrolled the coastal hamlets, made it a point to shift the fishermen to the cyclone rescue centres. Almost all people of all walks of life, including traders, merchants, fishermen and farmers, stayed indoors in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts with the State government asking them to safeguard themselves in view of the cyclone. Most of the highways including Thanjavur—Nagapattinam road looked deserted with suspension of public transport by the State government. Only a few vehicles, mainly ambulances, were seen on the roads. More than 90% of the commercial establishments remained closed. Tension among the people as well as the officials was palpable as they braced themselves again to face the fury of severe cyclonic storm within two years, after the Gaja cyclone wreaked havoc in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Thanjavur and Pudukottai district during the same period in 2018. Up to 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 45,695 people were evacuated in Nagapattinam district and were given shelter in 179 cyclone rescue centres, Nagapattinam Collector Praveen P. Nair.toldThe Hindu. “The northern parts of the district witnessed heavy rainfall along with gusty winds since afternoon. It is believed to the initial impact of cyclone landfall. No one is allowed on road. They have been asked to remain indoors. We are closely monitoring the situation,” he added. He said medical teams had been put in place in the cyclone rescue centres. They had been asked to carry out COVID-19 testing on vulnerable people. If they tested positive, they would be isolated. H.M. Jayaram, Inspector General of Police, Central Zone, toldThe Hinduthat 9,500 policemen had been mobilised for carrying out the rescue and rehabilitation work. They were put on maximum alert. A total of 205 villages and places in Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts were identified as cyclone prone areas. As a precautionary measure, the residents particularly fishermen were moved to the safer places, the senior police official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cyclone-nivar-shuts-down-life-in-coastal-districts/article33181523.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||251 shelters set up in Thanjavur||The State government’s call to people to avoid moving out of their homes during cyclonic weather appears to have evoked good public response in Thanjavur district. While State-owned and private transport buses have stayed off the roads from the afternoon of November 24, the number of personal vehicles have also thinned out in view of a public holiday declared by the government on November 25. According to representatives of traders’ associations, people have kept track of the cyclone for the past few days and stocked up on groceries and other essential items. They were also responsive well before the State government clamped down on public movement through precautionary announcements followed by their implementation by law enforcement machinery. Meanwhile, around 3,250 persons have volunteered to avail cyclone shelter and rescue centre facilities at 78 places in Thanjavur district. The district administration has set up cyclone shelter and relief centres at 251 places in the district, official sources said. Though business establishments, irrespective of their scale of operation, remained closed on Wednesday, a few tea shops, small hotels and kiosks apart from retail milk outlets functioned in urban areas even as incessant rain was reported throughout the district from Wednesday morning. Tree uprooted At Vazhapazhakadai area near Papanasam, the incessant rain accompanied by winds resulted in a five-decade-old Thoongumoonji maram ’ (rain tree or albizia saman ) getting uprooted. The tree that fell across Thanjavur-Kumbakonam Road on Wednesday morning was removed by cyclone rescue teams, and the carriageway was cleared for traffic. Trees identified as very old and weak on major carriageways and thickly populated areas were chopped down by the rescue teams as a precautionary measure. District Monitoring Officer and Director of Horticulture Department N. Subbaiyan and Collector M. Govinda Rao visited different parts of the district and guided officials deployed in relief and rescue operations. Talking to reporters during the inspection, Mr. Subbaiyan said power supply might be suspended in case of heavy rain as a precautionary measure and it would be restored immediately after the situation turned normal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/251-shelters-set-up-in-thanjavur/article33181519.ece

Gajendra Rajput (18) from Shivamogga, who was riding pillion on a motorcycle, was killed when the explosives went off after the motorcycle rammed a tractor. Rider Shivakumar, who suffered injuries, has been admitted to a hospital. Investigators say the explosives were gelatin sticks. The two were carrying low-intensity explosive sticks in the bag. Their motorcycle hit a tractor and the bag fell to the ground and the sticks exploded. The young man died on the spot, the police said. They suspected that he was going to hunt animals in the Machigad forest area. Officers from the Nandagad Police Station visited the spot. A case has been registered. Source of explosives Shivakumar, who was injured, has told the police that some farmers had requested him to scare away wild animals that raid farm land in their villages bordering the forests. However, a multi-point investigation will reveal from where they sourced the explosive sticks and whether they were occasional hunters or professional poachers, a senior police officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-killed-as-explosives-in-his-bag-go-off-in-road-accident/article33181592.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Separate agency for SWM on the cards||The State government is keen on taking away solid waste management (SWM) from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and instituting a parastatal agency for the same, along the lines of dedicated agencies for power, water, bus service, and metro service outside the ambit of the city’s civic body. However, the BBMP is all set to propose the formation of a Bengaluru Solid Waste Processing Corporation, that will be tasked with only waste processing in the city, while retaining street sweeping and garbage collection to itself. Key responsibilities “Street sweeping and garbage collection is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any civic body, which we will retain. But there is an expertise gap in managing processing plants, which we feel can be bridged with a dedicated corporation. I will be submitting a proposal for the same this week,” said BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad. However, a senior Urban Development Department official in favour of an SWM parastatal, said processing being given up would only be a half measure. “How will this processing corporation function if the civic body does not provide segregated waste? Ideally, the entire gamut of SWM operations should be brought under one parastatal agency,” he said. The government is yet to take a final call on the issue, sources said. Though a similar proposal was made a few years ago, it never gathered momentum as the garbage cess that the BBMP collected along with property tax was only a small fraction of what was spent on SWM — over Rs. 1,000 crore annually — over the last two years. However, that has changed with a new provision to impose a user fee of Rs. 200 per household as per the new SWM bylaws. This is expected to generate an annual revenue of over Rs. 700 crore, reviving the proposal. The move to create a parastatal agency has drawn the ire of urban governance activists and political parties. Even as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) termed this “wishing away of primary responsibilities”, the former leader of the Opposition in BBMP council Abdul Wajid (Congress) said, the BJP-led State government had been eating into the autonomy of the civic body and this was only the latest instance. Mathew Idiculla, a lawyer and urban policy advocate, said, “Most of the existing parastatal agencies pre-date the 74th amendment, which should have been ideally merged into the civic body, but never happened. This is a legacy problem we have. Instead of clearing this, taking away more functions from the civic body and creating more parastatal agencies will be directly contradicting the 74th amendment.” However, the proposal has garnered support from several solid waste management activists. Sandhya Narayan, member of the BBMP Technical Advisory Committee on SWM, said the processing corporation would increase the efficiency of asset management in processing and help build new capacity. Accountability Not everyone agrees though. N.S. Mukunda, founder president of Citizens Action Forum, said parastatal agencies lacked a structure of accountability. “The de-politicisation of utility services may find popular support among the middle classes, but it lacks structures of accountability and will only fail in the long run,” he said.  Taking away more functions from the civic body and creating more parastatal agencies will be directly contradicting the 74th amendment .

26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||As corporations multiply, voiceless communities continue to languish||Over the last two months, the State government has set up three corporations to develop Kadugolla, Maratha and Veerashaiva-Lingayat communities, even as pressure is mounting from other caste organisations for similar corporations. While the demand of communities that are politically more influential is being heard, those which have neither numerical strength nor political clout have remained on the fringe of development, observe experts. The Backward Classes Commission in 2010, after a series of public consultations and ethnographic study, had recommended special packages to as many as 33 small backward communities that needed the attention of the government. Mostly nomadic/semi-nomadic and concentrated in North Karnataka, the strength of these communities in many instances could be as low as 500. In cold storage “However, the report went into cold storage and successive governments did not focus on efforts to bring these communities to mainstream. Many of them still do not get caste certificates that would enable children to take up education. Some do not even have voter ID cards,” rued former commission chairperson C.S. Dwarkanath, who had submitted the report. These communities neither have political representation nor numerical strength or economic power to have a say in electoral politics. He said that the Socio Economic Survey (or caste census), the report of which is yet to be submitted to the government, could hold the key in unlocking how castes have fared and the benefits that they have received. It was only in 2019-20 that the government woke up to the issue and announced the Nomad Development Corporation, which is yet to start implementing schemes for these most backward communities. A provision of Rs. 78 crore has been made for all the nomadic and semi-nomadic communities. A look at the budgetary provisions for various other castes points to the imbalance, as those with political clout have got a bigger share of the pie. Micro communities, despite requiring separate funds and diverse schemes, are often clubbed together for allocations.  Terming these communities as “orphan castes”, which are not politically significant, P.R. Ramesh, Congress MLC, said the government should prioritise the most backward communities for development. “Unfortunately, even today members of many of these communities have not even found employment opportunities in the government, which is the failure of social justice. Even if there are schemes, they are not with long term vision,” he said, in his letter to the Chief Secretary on Monday. He also said that the creation of corporations without budgetary allocation is an attempt to take advantage of elections for votes. However, a senior Backward Classes Department official said that it was difficult to separate each of the communities to implement government schemes, but acknowledged that the creation of more corporations were “political decisions”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-corporations-multiply-voiceless-communities-continue-to-languish/article33181326.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Our members won’t sign any undertaking: TKM union||The workers’ union of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) on Wednesday said its 3,500 members will not sign the undertaking demanded by the management for them to be allowed to return to work. The car maker sought an undertaking from its protesting employees that if they are allowed to enter the factory for work, they should maintain “required productivity” and also maintain “absolute discipline”, both inside and outside the factory. “None of our members want to sign this undertaking because they feel it has no meaning especially when the lockout still continues. Even after the State government called the first lockout, introduced on November 10, a prohibition, TKM reintroduced it on November 23. This is a clear negligence of the government order,” claimed Prasanna Kumar Chekkere, president, TKM union. According to another workers’ union office-bearer, Muralidhar, “They want us to produce about 1,00,000 cars a month, instead of 80,000 now. For this, company has arbitrarily reduced the time and increased the cycle at work thereby putting workmen under pressure.” The union is also critical of the company’s VRS scheme. Meanwhile, G Shankara, associate vice-resident, human resources & services group, TKM, told The Hindu that Toyota requires a minimum workforce of 90% in each shift to continue production. However, only a small portion of them are reporting to work, and under this situation, TKM management was left with no choice but to reintroduce lockout on November 23, he claimed. “Toyota is known for its employee-friendly policies and good work practices. We just want our employees to follow basic discipline at work for their own good. We are very considerate and we treat our people as family. But unfortunately they ignore these,” he said. Toyota has 3,500 people who work in production and they are unionised. It also has 2,500 officers, supervisors, and other staff and majority of them are exposed to shop floor activities including assembly line work, under Toyota’s Genchi Genbutsu philosophy. “A few people are trying to hijack the company. As a result, our officers and supervisors, with the help of available workmen and production staff, are making cars in the last few days,” said Mr. Shankara. Some 3,460 of the production staff can start working immediately if they are willing to sign the undertaking. However, with regard to the remaining 40 people, including the union leader who was suspended initially and 39 others who were also suspended for causing “disruption” at work and violating factory discipline, they will go through a “process” before their career future at Toyota is decided. Mr. Shankara added, “A neutral body, comprising industry specialists, legal experts and HR professionals, will examine the matter and take a suitable action. The body will give all possible opportunities to our employees to prove their innocence and return to work.” Meanwhile, over 3,000 people are protesting outside the company’s factory at Bidadi demanding withdrawal of lockout and removal of these suspensions, according to the union.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/our-members-wont-sign-any-undertaking-tkm-union/article33181333.ece

The unions have demanded a waiver of loans taken by owners, sanctioning of a new loan of Rs. 1 lakh to auto drivers, and Rs. 2 lakh taxi drivers to revive their business. They have also demanded that the government step in to initiate action against private financiers who have allegedly been harassing them and charging exorbitant rates of interest. In another major demand, the State government has been asked to form a separate Board for the welfare of auto and taxi drivers. “All the unions have formed an association and called for a strike. Due to lockdown, auto and taxi drivers have suffered a lot. Without revenue, they could not repay loans and private financiers have been harassing them by seizing their vehicles. The State government is a mute spectator to these problems. We are demanding that strict action be taken against these private financiers,” said Somashekar founder of Namma Chalakara Trade Union. “We are also demanding formation of a Board for drivers so that their grievances can be addressed.

Roshan Baig, former MLA, into custody for three days, till November 28. The prime accused in the case, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, managing director and chief executive officer of the IMA Group of companies, had alleged that he had given Mr. Baig Rs. 400 crore to promote his venture and encourage people to invest in IMA using his political clout and media business. “We already have Mr. Khan in custody. We are verifying information with Mr. Baig and questioning him about the documents recovered from his house during the raid,” said a CBI official. Investigations so far have revealed that money exchanged hands on many occasions. “Mr. Khan paid Mr. Baig on many instances for his personal use and also to run a newspaper, which he reportedly used to promote IMA,” he added. Mr. Khan also allegedly confessed that he bore the election expenses that Mr. Baig incurred during the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. It was based on this information that the CBI recently raided Mr. Baig’s house and recovered property documents pertaining to the case. “We also questioned his wife who is the director of an Urdu daily owned by the family,” said a police official.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S. Vishwajith Shetty reserved the verdict on completion of arguments on behalf of the State Election Commission (SEC) and other petitioners. The SEC itself had sought a direction from the court to go ahead with the process under way to hold elections to 198 wards ignoring the increase in the number of wards to 243 as such a process violates constitutional mandate of timely holding of elections to local bodies. Amendment Earlier, it was contended on behalf of the State government that elections cannot be held ignoring the amendment made in October 2020 to the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, which increased number of wards for BBMP area. The government claimed that delay for holding elections, due by September 10, 2020, was because of the COVID-19 pandemic as a committee had began deliberation on amending law before the pandemic but process got delayed owing to lockdown. However, it was contended on behalf of the SEC that the committee was set up only after the commission filed a petition in the High Court in January this year seeking directions to government to complete process of delimitation of 198 wards as per 2011 Census and fix reservation for wards to enable the SEC to hold elections before the expiry of term of the BBMP council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-reserves-order-on-pleas-for-holding-bbmp-council-election/article33181293.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Non-profit organisations join hands to empower waste pickers||Though informal waste pickers are a crucial cog in the solid waste management wheel, they remain virtually “invisible”, and face discrimination owing to the nature of their work. With the aim to improve the lives of waste pickers in the city, eight non-profit organisations have joined forces to launch Saamuhika Shakti, a multi-year project. The project, funded by Sweden-based H&M Foundation, follows the collective impact approach. For the first three years, the foundation has committed $11 million, with scope for extending it for another three years. The core component of the project is gender equity and equitable access for women, girls, and other vulnerable groups. As per data, there are around 22,500 waste pickers, including informal waste collectors, sorters in dry waste collection centres, and scrap shops, and itinerant waste buyers. At the launch on Wednesday, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said the need of the hour was to support waste pickers’ livelihood and improve their quality of life. He stressed on the need to integrate efforts of various departments and create awareness about the many schemes that the waste pickers may benefit from, be it housing, drinking water, etc. Integrating them A panel discussion on the role of waste pickers, ways to integrate them into the formal waste picker ecosystem, and challenges of integration saw participation from BBMP’s Special Commissioner (SWM) D. Randeep, co-founder of Hasiru Dala Nalini Shekar, and Bharti Dewan from the Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives. Ms. Shekar, who was instrumental in getting the civic body to issue identity cards to waste pickers in 2011, said informal waste pickers reduce the cost of SWM. She emphasised how their skills and knowledge with respect to different waste streams are of tremendous value to the SWM ecosystem. The non-profit organisations that have come together for the Saamuhika Shakti project are BBC Media Action, CARE, Hasiru Dala, LabourNet, Save the Children, Social Alpha, WaterAid, and The/Nudge Foundation.  GFX: Six key outcomes envisaged by the project: · Higher and more stable income · Improved and safer working conditions · Ability to move to alternate professions, if they desire · Access to affordable, quality services from public and private sector · Established support systems for victims of domestic violence and substance abuse · Respect and recognition of their work from citizes, and pride in the role they play in the waste value chain||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/non-profit-organisations-join-hands-to-empower-waste-pickers/article33181297.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Priest held on charge of raping minor girl||The Devanahalli police arrested a 68-year-old priest for allegedly sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl on Tuesday evening. The accused, Venkataramanappa, a resident of Chickballapur, had temporarily moved to his daughter’s house to take over the duties of his son-in-law who is also a priest as the family had to leave the city for a short while. “The son-in-law asked the accused to perform the daily rituals at the temple until he returned,” said the police. On Tuesday evening, after he moved into their house, which is adjacent to the temple, Venkataramanappa saw the girl playing outside. “Both, CCTV camera footage and eyewitness accounts reveal that he lured her into the house promising her snacks,” said a senior police officer. Meanwhile, the mother of the girl started worrying when she did not return home. “Unable to find her anywhere, she started asking residents if they had seen her daughter. A flower vendor told the mother that he saw the girl going into the priest’s house,” the police officer added.The mother along with neighbours went to the priest’s house to find the girl crying outside. The girl narrated her ordeal even as people started gathering at the spot. As the situation started to get tense, the police arrived at the scene, and detained the accused. “The girl was taken to a hospital for a medical examination where doctors confirmed that she was raped.Based on the medical report, eyewitness accounts, and CCTV camera footage, Venkataramanappa was arrested under various sections of the POCSO Act and also under Section 376 of the IPC.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/priest-held-on-charge-of-raping-minor-girl/article33181299.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Many workers in gig economy earn less than minimum wage’||A study published by the Institute of Public Policy (IPP) of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) on jobs in platform economy or gig economy has documented below the minimum wage earning, despite working beyond eight hours a day. The study ‘Is Platform Work Decent Work? A Case of Food Delivery Workers in Karnataka’ also said that none of the workers in the sample set of the study earned their base wage. During the course of the study, which spanned over a year from March last year, the researchers spoke to workers engaged with various food delivery platforms in Karnataka. Taking into consideration the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the industry, the study said, “The employers took advantage of widespread urban unemployment to force workers to accept lower earning rates for their work.” Hence the study recommended that the government should recognise gig employees as workers and bring the sector within the ambit of labour laws and that there was a need to prescribe a minimum standard for earnings. “The situation of the gig workers during the pandemic gives lie to the myth perpetuated by industry that these workers are independent contractors. The dependent and unequal relationship is patent in the unilateral behaviour of the employers to drive down working conditions,” the study observed. Problem with incentives Workers also claimed that they were not given the incentive despite reaching targets, even if they were a minute late. Workers also lost on the incentives part if they had technical glitches and network issues, even if they were in the basements or elevators for delivery. According to the study, one of the food delivery platform did not pay incentives if workers “denied” more than one order a day and denials due to the fault of customers or the platform itself is not taken into consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-workers-in-gig-economy-earn-less-than-minimum-wage/article33181301.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ahmed Patel was a bridge between Cong. leaders and high command||Ahmed Patel, senior Congress leader and MP who died early on Wednesday, was seen in Karnataka as a politician who acted as a bridge between the Congress leaders and the high command. He was the party’s crisis manager in the State. An eight-time parliamentarian, Patel, owing to his proximity to the high command, played a crucial role in installation of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy soon after the fractured mandate in the 2018 Assembly elections. Mr. Patel, along with party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad, stitched the coalition to keep the BJP out of power for more than a year. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has given credit to Patel for his joining the Congress 14 years ago. Speaking at a media interaction at the Press Club in 2017, Mr. Siddaramaiah had said Patel brought him to the party after he quit the JD(S) in 2006. In his condolence message, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “Patel was responsible for a major decision in my political life. He was my well-wisher till the end.” Patel, being political secretary to the party president for a long time, helped the State Congress leaders in getting appointments with Sonia Gandhi. He used to communicate the State leaders’ grievances to party’s top brass. Patel was close to trouble-shooter and State Congress president D.K. Shivakumar as well. Mr. Shivakumar played a crucial role in the victory of Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections in 2017 by providing accommodation to Gujarat Congress MLAs at a private resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru. To make it difficult for Patel to win the seat, the ruling BJP had made six Congress MLAs resign from the Gujarat Assembly in August 2017. Because the Gujarat MLAs were provided shelter in Karnataka, Patel was able to win the election. It was soon after that Mr. Shivakumar faced raids by the Income Tax Department. Mr. Shivakumar expressed shock and grief over Patel’s death. In a tweet, he said: “Deeply saddened and shocked by the demise of AICC treasurer & one of the foremost leaders of the Congress party Shri Ahmed Patel. His steadfast loyalty & contribution to Congress as well as the nation was exemplary and an inspiration to us.” Patel used to guide junior politicians such as KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed on party affairs and elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ahmed-patel-was-a-bridge-between-cong-leaders-and-high-command/article33181322.ece

26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Republic TV official gets transit anticipatory bail||Questioning the conduct of Mumbai police, the High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday granted transit anticipatory bail for 20 days to Priya Mukherjee, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of M/s ARG Outlier Media Pvt. Ltd. that runs Republic TV network, Mumbai, in the ‘fake’ television rating points (TRP) case. Justice H.P Sandesh passed the order on a petition filed by Ms. Mukherjee, who had come to Bengaluru to attend to her ailing father. The court questioned the need for the Mumbai police to rush to Bengaluru after she attended questioning sessions by Mumbai police on November 17 and 18 and even after she had informed them she would be visiting Bengaluru to attend to her ailing father and would be available for questioning on November 24. While turning down the claim of Mumbai police that they apprehended that she has ‘absconded’ as she had not mentioned when she would be back, the court said that no proper answer was forthcoming from the police on why they came to Bengaluru on November 20, the need for visiting her parents’ house, and to summon her to Bannerghatta police station without stating reason in the notice. The court also did not accept the contention of Mumbai police that she could not have approached the Karnataka HC when the Bombay High Court had seized of the matter after her counsel pointed out that she had not filed petition before the Bombay HC as such a petition was filed by Arnab Goswami, Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV. Taking note of how Mumbai police acted, Justice Sandesh observed that that there is reasonable apprehension of the arrest of the petitioner and she was justified in knocking the doors of the court when her personal liberty was at stake. It was alleged in the petition that the police are after her to elicit a response from her against Mr. Goswami in the case and apprehended arrest despite she having informed them on her Bengaluru visit. The court gave her liberty to approach the appropriate legal forum on expiry of 20-days and directed Mumbai police to release her, if she is arrested, on she furnishing a bond for Rs. 2 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/republic-tv-official-gets-transit-anticipatory-bail/article33181332.ece
26 November 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mumbai police directed to give protection to Ravi Pujari||The Karnataka High Court has directed the Mumbai police to take all safety measures to protect the life of Ravi Pujari, 53, who has been accused of being an underworld operative involved in many cases of extortion and murder and was brought to India after being extradited from Senegal in February 2019. Also, the court directed the Mumbai police to bring him back to the central prison, Bengaluru, after producing him before a special court in Greater Mumbai in connection with criminal case pending against him. Justice Nataraj Rangaswamy passed the interim order on a petition by Pujari challenging the trial court’s order of granting his custody to Mumbai police for his production before the Mumbai special court. It has been contended in the petition that granting of his custody to Mumbai police violated the conditions of his extradition from the foreign country as he was supposed to be produced in the cases that were part of the list attached to the extradition order. Claiming that there is a threat to his life, the petitioner said that the trial court and the Mumbai police could have effectively used the facility of video conferencing for his production before Mumbai court instead of taking him to Mumbai especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The court has adjourned further hearing till November 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mumbai-police-directed-to-give-protection-to-ravi-pujari/article33181330.ece

Yediyurappa was on his way out. Speaking to presspersons at his residence here, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “This guarantees that Mr. Yediyurappa is going. What was the need to make appointments in such a hurry, when the government was facing severe financial difficulties due to COVID-19?” he asked. The Chief Minister made more than 20 appointments as chairpersons and directors of various government-owned boards/corporations in the last couple of days. The government has also set up a few corporations to caste groups and there is demand for more of them. Noting the financial stress faced by the government, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “The government has not released pensions to old-age, widow and physically challenged people. There is no money.

26 November 2020||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Campaign to highlight growth potential of twin cities to be launched tomorrow||Seeking answers for the delay in IT giant Infosys starting its operations from Hubballi despite the campus being ready over three years ago and to highlight the need for the government to come out with a programme for exploiting the potential of Hubballi-Dharwad, Aam Admi Party has decided to launch a campaign called Hubballi Calling. Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, Dharwad district president of AAP Santosh Naragund and district executive committee member Vikas Soppin said that while the State government had announced the new IT-BT Policy 2020-25 — Beyond Bengaluru, with focus on developing six cities, the emphasis should not be on projecting Hubballi-Dharwad just as another alternative. “Hubballi-Dharwad with over a million population has its own characteristics and if any city other than Bengaluru has the potential to become a metro, then it is Hubballi. The government should accordingly chalk out an independent programme for the twin cities,” they said. Mr. Naragund said that AAP had already written to Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for IT, BT, Science and Technology, Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood C.N. Ashwath Narayan on the need for developing Hubballi-Dharwad exploiting its potential fully rather than just as an alternative to Bengaluru. “We want the State government to consider Hubballi-Dharwad independently and consider it as a tier-1 city. Hubballi-Dharwad provides the best IT investment opportunities,” he said. Referring to the Infosys campus in Hubballi, which was ready three years ago, Mr. Vikas Soppin sought to know why the beautiful campus developed by Infosys had not become functional. “Making the Infosys campus functional will automatically trigger IT-related activities in the region. However, the reasons are not known on why the Hubballi campus has not been made functional yet. The State government should intervene to find out the reasons and extend the necessary help to make it functional,” he said. Mr. Soppin said that AAP would urge the Deputy Chief Minister to visit Hubballi to find out the problems being faced by Infosys campus in starting its operations from Hubballi. “The government should consider the issue seriously and sort it out. Then, only the objectives of Beyond Bengaluru would be fulfilled. Otherwise, it will be just end up as another slogan,” Mr. Vikas Soppin said. Hubballi Calling Mr. Soppin and Mr. Naragund said that the AAP would launch Hubballi Calling in front of the Infosys Campus in Hubballi at 11 a.m. on Friday to highlight the need for making the Infosys campus functional. IT entrepreneurs Sana Kudari, Aditya Nayak, Hassan Ali Sheikh and V.B. Maganur were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/campaign-to-highlight-growth-potential-of-twin-cities-to-be-launched-tomorrow/article33181593.ece

Assistant Professor H.B. Sushma, addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, said that a group of staff from the Education Department, including Pramod Katti, Shushma N. Jogan, along with a former faculty member Om Prakash, had targeted her and somehow wanted to oust her from the university. Dr. Sushma said that she and Mr. Katti were appointed on a contract basis and both were dealing with the Biological Science Methodology subject in the Department of Education. She said that Mr. Katti has targeted her to prevent her from completing her two-year tenure which would have given her an opportunity to qualify for permanent appointment at the university. She said that these staff members were involved in leaking the first and third semester question papers. “When I brought the fact of question paper leaks to the notice of Dean Sunita Manjanbail and coordinator Mahendra M. Navodaya and gave a written complaint about it substantiated with evidence specifying the involvement of Mr. Katti, he [Mr. Katti] provoked students to write a baseless complaint against me,” she said. Mr. Katti and Dr. Jogan are “chronic offenders of question paper leaks”. Dr. Jogan was caught red-handed when she leaked a question paper of the semester-end examination, she added. Surprisingly, she has been appointed as a permanent faculty in the Education Department of Vijayanagar Sri Krishnadevaraya University in Ballari. Dr. Sushma demanded that the Union government take appropriate action against the offenders concerned and also hold a high-level investigation to unravel the malfunctioning of administration at the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/assistant-professor-says-her-services-terminated-for-exposing-racket-in-question-paper-leak/article33181588.ece

Dinakar Babu on Wednesday directed officials from the Food and Civil Supplies Department to ensure supply of red boiled rice to beneficiaries of Anna Bhagya scheme as white boiled rice being supplied was of inferior quality. Presiding over a monthly Karnataka Development Programme meeting at the zilla panchayat in Udupi, Mr. Babu said that there were many complaints about the quality of white boiled rice from the general public. Though the government had provided boiled rice as per public demand in the coastal region, the quality of the rice was not up to the mark. Officials told the panchayat president that the rice was being procured from Andhra Pradesh as enough quantity of boiled rice from the State was not available for procurement. Mr. Babu asked the officials to write to the Food Corporation of India. Responding to Agriculture and Industries Standing Committee chairman Sumith Shetty statement that supply of banned plastic was going on unabated in the district, Mr. Babu directed the Urban Development cell officials to confiscate plastic stock from wholesale traders in the district. Taluk panchayat executive officers have to do this in the rural areas, he added. Education and Health Standing Committee chairman Prathap Hegde Marali asked officials to chalk out a plan to supply affordable cloth bags as people opt for plastic bags in view of their cheap price. Chief Executive Officer Naveen Bhat, Deputy Secretary Kiran Phadnekar, Chief Planning Officer Srinivas Rao and panchayat vice-president Sheela Shetty and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ensure-red-boiled-rice-reaches-anna-bhagya-beneficiaries/article33181771.ece

26 November 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Two arrested on charge of extorting money||The city police arrested two men from Bengaluru on the charge of extorting money and threatening a resident of Mangaluru stating that they will post his nude photographs on the Internet. The police gave the names of the arrested men as Gokul Raju (20) and Pavan L. (20). The police said that the accused had created a fake Facebook account in the name of Sakshiraj. Impersonating a female voice, the accused sent some nude photographs to the resident in KPT here. After extorting some money from the KPT resident, the accused asked him to share his nude photographs. The accused then threatened him that they share his photographs on the Internet and forced him to part with his money. When they demanded more money, the later refused. However, the accused called the KPT resident up impersonating as a senior police officer this time and threatened him.

26 November 2020||Mumbai,KARNATAKA||Key accused in Hubballi realtor’s killing held by Maharashtra ATS||Maharashtra’s Anti-Terrorism Squad has arrested from Mumbai the main accused in a shootout at Hubballi in which a real estate businessman was killed in August this year, an official said on Wednesday. The accused, identified as Golu alias Ankur Singh alias Anup Singh (24), a resident of Balrampur in Uttar Pradesh, was on the run since the incident on August 6 in which realtor Irfan Hanchnal was shot dead by three attackers in Hubballi, the ATS official said. The Juhu unit of the ATS here got a specific information about Singh’s whereabouts, following which a team led by police inspector Daya Nayak laid a trap on Tuesday evening near Andheri station and apprehended him, he said. The official said during interrogation, Singh told the ATS personnel that he had fired a bullet on the victims chest. The accused was earlier arrested by Mumbai police in 2016 for an offence. He was lodged at the city-based Arthur Road prison where he came in contact with some shooters. After getting out, Singh and his aides got a ‘supari’ (contract) to kill the real estate businessman in Hubballi, the official said. Singh’s aides were arrested by the police earlier and an offence under sections for murder and the Arms Act had been registered at Old Hubballi police station, he said. The ATS was trying to find out if the accused was involved in other crimes in Maharashtra and Karnataka, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/key-accused-in-hubballi-realtors-killing-held-by-maharashtra-ats/article33181596.ece
26 November 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Report identifies ‘glaring gaps’ in tobacco control laws||Permission for smoking in designated areas of restaurants, hotels and airports and display of advertisements of tobacco products in stores and kiosks have been identified as “glaring gaps” in the existing tobacco control laws in the country in a report by National Law School of India University (NLSIU). Even though smoking in public places and advertising of tobacco products are banned under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act (COTPA) 2003, the permission for smoking in designated areas of restaurants and airport and the prominent display of advertisements of tobacco products in stores and kiosks make the existing tobacco control laws “ineffective for regulating tobacco consumption and exposure to second-hand smoke in India,” said the report released by NLSIU’s Chair on Consumer Law and Practice on Wednesday. The report titled “Tobacco Control Law in India – Origins and Proposed Reforms” also proposes reforms that includes doing away with the allowance for smoking in designated areas to prevent “200,000 deaths, resulting from second-hand smoke” and prohibiting point-of-sale advertising and display of tobacco products, “which entice consumers.” The report recommends an increase in the minimum age of person to whom a tobacco product can be sold from the existing 18 to 21 years. In another significant recommendation, the report has sought a prohibition on the sale of single stick cigarettes and other loose tobacco products. “As this increases accessibility and affordability of tobacco products for minors, this must be prohibited,” the report said. The report, however, has claimed that plain packaging of tobacco products had proven to reduce tobacco consumption. “While India does have strict requirements for pictorial warnings on tobacco packages, measures such as plain packaging should be adopted as they have proven to reduce tobacco consumption.” Also, the report has found the existing penalties under COTPA 2003 to be insufficient. Hence, it has made out a case for enhancing the penalties. The report, apart from claiming that emission yields displayed on cigarette packets often give a misleading impression that cigarette with low emission is less harmful, also sought restrictions on the use of sugar, sweeteners and other ingredients to add colour and flavour to the product. “In addition to making tobacco products more appealing, they also reduce the irritating character of tobacco smoke, which encourages use by minors. Therefore, this must be restricted,” the report said. India has the second largest number of tobacco users – 286 million or 28.6 per cent of all adults in the country. “Of these, at least 1.2 million die every year from tobacco-related diseases,” the report claimed before adding that nearly 27% of all cancers in India are due to tobacco-usage. Though COTPA 2003 was intended as a comprehensive law on tobacco control, the report pointed out that it was adopted 15 years ago, before the coming into force of WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/report-identifies-glaring-gaps-in-tobacco-control-laws/article33181304.ece
26 November 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Mudukuthore temple reconstruction to be completed in 2 years||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa laid the foundation for the reconstruction of Sri Mallikarjunaswamy temple at Mudukuthore in T.Narsipura taluk of Mysuru district on Wednesday and announced that funds will not be a constraint for completion of any temple-related project in the State. The ancient temple at Mudukuthore is in a dilapidated state and hence a major reconstruction plan is in place and will be completed at a cost of Rs. 30 crore. The cost of the first phase of the project including the temple entrance tower and the retaining wall, and improvements to the steps leading to the temple located atop a hillock, is pegged at Rs. 15 crore. The cost of constructing the four rajagopuras and rebuilding the temple complex in stone at a cost of an additional Rs. 15 crore was supposed to be taken up in the subsequent phase. However, Mr.Yediyurappa said that funds will not be a constraint and directed the architects and the Muzrai Department to complete the entire work as a single-phase project. “I have already released Rs. 5crore for the works and an additional Rs. 10 crore will be released within a week.’’ The Chief Minister said that the State government has released Rs. 136 crore for renovation of 136 temples across the State and he wished to ensure that all pending works are completed before the end of his tenure in 2 years’ time. Schedule Meanwhile, the Muzrai Department officials said the actual work of the reconstruction will be taken up after the conclusion of the Panchalinga Darshana slated to be held from December 10 to 19. There will be no restriction on the devotees visiting the temple during the reconstruction phase though their entry may be restricted during certain crucial phase of the construction. Source said the sanctum sanctorum will be retained as it is in its present condition and the deity will not be disturbed by relocation etc though the interiors will be embellished. Situated on the banks of the Cauvery, Sri Mallikarjunaswamy and Brahmarambha temple is located atop a hillock and is 48 km from Mysuru and very close to Talakad. The origins of the temple is lost in the mist of time and Arjuna is said to have worshipped the deity here during the Mahabharatha period, as per the local belief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mudukuthore-temple-reconstruction-to-be-completed-in-2-years/article33181794.ece
26 November 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Farmers meet CM seeking higher price for tobacco||A delegation of farmers met Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa here on Wednesday and urged him to ensure that tobacco farmers received a remunerative price for their produce. The farmers led by Badagalapura Nagendra of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) and Hasiru Sene told Mr. Yediyurappa that tobacco was not fetching them the amount they had spent on its cultivation. The farmers, in a memorandum submitted to the Chief Minister, said they incurred an expenditure of about Rs. 125 to 130 on cultivation of each kg of tobacco. But, they had received an average of just Rs. 125 per kg during the auctions held last year. Though the farmers were in favour of declaring a crop holiday this year, the people’s representatives said they would stand by the farmers and encouraged them to cultivate the crop, the farmers said in a memorandum to the Chief Minister. The Tobacco Board, which had initially fixed the crop size at 99 million kg, brought it down to 88 million kg. Now, the crop yield is expected to be more than 95 million kg. So, far about 21 million kg or 25 per cent of the crop had already been auctioned at the platforms. For the remaining 75 per cent of the crop, the Chief Minister should intervene and ensure that the farmers, whose cost of cultivation was increasing year after year, received a remunerative price. The farmers have sought Rs. 225 per kg for high grade tobacco and Rs. 125 per kg for low grade tobacco and an average price of Rs. 175 per kg. The farmers have urged the Chief Minister to use his good offices to convince the traders to buy medium and low grade tobacco also. Purchase formula The farmers have sought to draw the Chief Minister’s attention to the reported purchase of 35 per cent of the tobacco produce in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh by its State government and urged the Karnataka government to also intervene in the market to ensure a remunerative price to the tobacco farmers. Ban sought A demand was also made to the Chief Minister to take steps against sale of smuggled cigarettes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-meet-cm-seeking-higher-price-for-tobacco/article33181795.ece
26 November 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Is Srinivas Prasad upset with BSY?||Is veteran politician and former Minister V. Srinivas Prasad upset with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa? Mr. Prasad appeared disgruntled with the Chief Minister when fielding queries from reporters on the impending expansion of the State Cabinet. He said Mr. Yediyurappa, who needed his support at the time of BJP government’s formation, does not have any concern for him now. “He is now enjoying the comforts of the Chief Minister’s post. I will see,” he said. Sources said Mr. Prasad was disappointed with the Chief Minister for not appointing any of his supporters to the posts of chairpersons of boards and corporations. He is believed to have confronted Mr. Yediyurappa at Suttur Mutt on Wednesday over the issue. Mr. Yediyurappa is believed to have assured Mr. Prasad that he will consider the persons recommended by him in the coming days. When Mr. Prasad’s attention was drawn to the demand for a Cabinet berth by his son-in-law and Nanjangud MLA Harshavardhan, the former Minister said it was up to the latter to justify his demand. Mr. Prasad, however, said he does not agree with the argument of insufficient representation to Old Mysore region in the Cabinet. He said even Shivamogga was part of Old Mysore region and hence Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and his Cabinet colleagues like K.S. Eshwarappa, besides S.T. Somashekar and Narayanagowda were all from Old Mysore region. Mr. Prasad also made it clear that he was not an aspirant for the post of Minister in Central Cabinet. “I never wanted to contest the elections in the first place. How the does question of a Cabinet berth for me arise?”, he said. Mr. Prasad also condoled the death of senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel whom he knew since four decades.  He is now enjoying the comforts of the Chief Minister’s post. I will see.V.

26 November 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||DC rebuts Hunsur MLA’s statements||Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, who was at the receiving end of Hunsur MLA H.P. Manjunath’s outburst on perceived violation of protocol and lack of attention to development in his constituency, has rebutted his allegations and dismissed them as baseless. In the KDP meeting held on Tuesday, the MLA remarked that he never receives any answers to the letters written to the Deputy Commissioner pertaining to development works in his constituency and added that “Mysuru already has two queens and does not need one more’’. In a letter addressed to Mr. Manjunath, Ms.Sindhuri denied having received any letter from him pertaining to the development works of Hunsur since she took charge. But the Deputy Commissioner pointed out that his applications seeking permission for change of land use in Keergalli village in Jayapura hobli and registered in his name - was being processed as per law. Giving a point-by-point rebuttal to the statements made by the MLA, Ms. Sindhuri said his statements on the perceived violation of protocol during Gajapayana by not extending him an invitation was baseless. She said that it was a government directive to keep the event simple devoid of any fanfare in view of the pandemic as decided at the Dasara High Powered Committee meeting chaired by the Chief Ministerf. Hence the event involved only a few officials and no invitation was extended to any elected representatives, said Ms. Sindhuri The Deputy Commissioner said she is preoccupied with handling the COVID-19 situation ever since she took charge and had visited Hunsur on October 1 to take stock of the situation and review development works. She reminded the MLA that they could not meet as he was ill at thee time of her visit. “The other remarks made by you at the KDP meeting diminishes all and was unfounded and any statements in the review meetings should be rooted in facts’’, said the Deputy Commissioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dc-rebuts-hunsur-mlas-statements/article33181792.ece

26 November 2020||Uralagallu (Shivamogga),KARNATAKA||Uralagallu residents ‘powerless’ for 60 years||People of Uralagallu, a village on the hilly terrain in Sagar taluk bordering Uttara Kannada, have been living with no power supply and road to reach the outer world, for nearly 60 years. Forget school, they do not have an anganwadi centre, polling booth, or primary health centre. Besides that, it has been years since a government representative visited this place. This is the plight of a village in Shivamogga district, the native place of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Uralagallu is a village of 49 families, spread over hamlets - Cheekanahalli, Salakodu, Dasanamane, Hebbanakeri, Munduvala, Melur, and Uralagallu. They grow paddy and areca in the land they own. The residents once lived in Byakodu hobli of Sagar taluk, from where they were shifted to allow Sharavathi dam to come up in 1960. The dam was constructed to generate power, but ironically, the people who were shifted have not got power supply in these years. Some households have solar power, installed because of the intervention of former Minister Kagodu Thimmappa. But, they too don’t work during heavy rain. The nearest anganwadi centre is in Kanur, about 10 km away from the village. The panchayat headquarters at Bhanukuli is about 20 km away. And the taluk headquarter Sagar is 80 km far from the place. “How can you expect us to send our children to an anganwadi so far from our place?” asked Yuvaraj, father of three, at Cheekanahalli. Almost all parents send their children to either hostels or their relatives’ places for studies. Except for a couple of boys, nobody has completed graduation. Among the girls, hardly few have studied up to SSLC. The villagers have to cross the hills taking a rough and tortuous path to reach Kanur to catch a bus. Gowramma, a resident, said that when children return to school after vacations, the parents have to drop them at Kanur to catch the only bus at 6.30 a.m. “To catch the bus, we have to get up at 3.30 a.m., get ready and walk for hours to reach before the bus arrives. If we miss the bus, there is no alternative, we have to return by walk,” she said. The bus has stopped since the lockdown over COVID-19. Neglected For several years, no elected representative, officer, or representative of the gram panchayat has visited the village. “Forget senior officers at the taluk and district centres, even officers of Bhanukuli Gram Panchayat hold ward meetings of Uralagallu village at Kanur, forcing the people to walk 10 km,” said Nagaraj, a resident of Salukodu. “On polling day, we go to Kanur to exercise our right to vote. The road is not comfortable even for two-wheelers. Many have fallen on the stretch suffering serious injuries, as the entire road becomes slippery,” said Ramachandra, a resident. This reporter had to depend on a two-wheeler of a local person to cross the stretch. The people have submitted memorandums seeking road and other benefits. But, their efforts have not yielded fruits, as the entire area, except the agriculture area, is part of Sharavati Wildlife Sanctuary. “We got a road sanctioned towards Bhatkal taluk from the village. But, the forest officials objected to it. Compared to Sagar, the taluk headquarters, we are nearer to Bhatkal taluk. Murudeshwara, a popular temple town, is about 19 km away,” said Y. Naveen, a youth in the village. The residents said they have built houses and grown areca plantations for the last 60 years, but they need road and power to lead a life with minimum comforts. “For decades, we have not seen power connection. MESCOM conducted a survey but did not proceed further citing objections from the Forest Department,” said Anand, a graduate from the village. The residents want Mr. Yediyurappa to listen to their demands and address them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uralagallu-residents-powerless-for-60-years/article33181320.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 cases down to 2 per cent in Mysuru||The case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.2 per cent in the last two weeks in Mysuru district is now close to the target of one per cent and the positivity rate (the number of cases per 100 tests) has come down to 2 per cent. The COVID-19 positivity was 20 per cent in September and the turnaround was achieved in less than two months. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Wednesday said Mysuru is performing best or among the best on all parameters of COVID-19 pandemic. This has happened because of the systematic approach and untiring efforts of all those concerned, she added. Role model With 6,000 daily tests, Mysuru is doing the highest number of tests per day after Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Also, the Mysuru District COVID-19 War Room is now a model for all and all districts had sent teams to learn and replicate the model in their respective areas with regard to pandemic management. Ms. Sindhuri said 4,208 persons had been fined for not wearing mask and flouting social distance rules, which is again highest after the enforcement by the BBMP in Bengaluru. On the advice of the government for improving contact tracing since Mysuru was reporting the highest number of cases after Bengaluru and was also identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, the district administration has ensured 100 per cent contact tracing within 36 hours. As of now, 12 contacts are being traced per patient. In Mysuru, the RT-PCR testing infrastructure has been expanded with the Department of Microbiology of the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) at the K.R. Hospital receiving an advanced COVID-19 testing facility, which is also giving faster results of the swab tests done. Within 24 hours, the results are being made available and no swabs are now being sent to Bengaluru like in the past for the tests. Testing ramped up The VRDL has been carrying out the swab tests using the RT-PCR method since March this year and it has been doing nearly 2,500-3,000 swab tests a day. So far, it has done over one lakh swab tests. The new testing system, also called the liquid handling system, was sent to the MMCRI so as to strengthen the PCR testing and give results within 24 hours. Steps were taken to ramp up PCR testing across Mysuru with about 4,000 swab tests a day since early this month following guidelines on confining COVID-19 tests under the PCR method instead of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). The Deputy Commissioner on Wednesday said the number of tests per day had been increased to 6,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-cases-down-to-2-per-cent-in-mysuru/article33181791.ece

26 November 2020||Biju GovindKozhikode,KERALA||Political stakes high for minor Muslim parties||An uphill battle awaits minor parties opposing the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) in the coming three-tier local body polls in December. The rise and decline of these parties that are known to have been propagating the cause of the Muslim community have fluctuated the fortunes of the IUML in every election. This time too they have high stakes in their pockets of influence. The Indian National League (INL), which has been inducted into the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front, is hoping to get a share of the Muslim votes in the Malabar region. The party exudes confidence of winning more seats with the amalgamation of the 25-year-old party with the National Secular Conference (NSC) led by P.T.A. Rahim, MLA. Common factor Both parties have a common factor: of building their bases after revolting against the IUML leadership. Even then, the merger that happened a year ago has not gone down well, as the NSC sticks to its own politics confined to the Koduvally-Kunnamangalam region here. The Welfare Party of India (WPI) of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, which has made local-level electoral understandings with the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), has been in the electoral race from the Lok Sabha polls of 2014. Earlier, the party had been overtly and covertly supporting the Left Democratic Front, but made a U-turn in the Lok Sabha polls of 2019. Own course Likewise, the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political arm of the Popular Front of India, and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) led by Abdul Nasir Maudany stand independently. Their alternative political approach apparently seems to have waned over the years without getting support from the conservative Muslim electorate. All these parties have confined themselves to their influential turfs. Interestingly, in the 2015 polls, the SDPI won 40 seats, including seven from municipalities and one from a Corporation. Also, nominees of the PDP got elected from eight wards while the WPI won in seven wards. Cut to the 2016 Assembly polls, none of these parties won a single seat. Nevertheless, the INL secured 0.56%, SDPI 0.61%, WPI 0.31%, and PDP 0.24% of the popular votes.

Rex Felix, NHAI assistant executive engineer, said the aim was to complete the works on the entire stretch by February-end. The prime focus was to construct a retaining wall, he said adding that the work started immediately after the district administration gave its green signal. The works had been suspended following landslips on Gap Road which destroyed nearly 200 metres of the road in addition to cultivated area on the lower side of the road. Farmers objected to the road construction claiming that the compensation offered by the contractor was not on a par with the losses. Last week, the contractor agreed to increase the compensation and the first instalment was given to the farmers. Compensation settled The District Collector gave permission to continue the works after settling the compensation issue with the farmers. It was also directed to ensure safety measures considering the soil sensitivity and rock formation on the Gap Road stretch. Earlier, a report by the Devikulam Subcollector said that unscientific road works had caused landslips and an expert team from the National Institute of Technology, Calicut ( NIT-C) had visited the area. A report by the NIT team said the works could be allowed after ensuring safety measures, including construction of retaining walls to prevent landslips. Mr. Felix said blasting works to remove the boulders that fell on the road had started. The rock would be used for constructing retaining walls. It was hoped that traffic would be allowed on the stretch in two months. Chief Wildlife Warden Sureshkumar visited the National Highway and inspected the sites where elephant ramps, canopy bridges, and medians have been proposed for animal crossings. Nearly 50 spots have been identified for facilitating animal crossings on the Poopara-Bodimettu stretch of the National Highway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/widening-works-on-gap-road-stretch-of-nh-resume/article33181715.ece

26 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Rebels may dent prospects of major fronts||A few rebel candidates contesting this time might have a support base in their divisions that could impact the prospects of major fronts. Four candidates contesting as UDF rebels could affect the front’s prospects, said an outgoing Congress councillor who asked not to be named. Both Delina Pinheiro, who is contesting from Pachalam, and Gracy Joseph, contesting from Kaloor South, have a support base that could be a threat to the front, the councillor said. “Mary Prakashan, who is contesting from Mundamveli, had also contested earlier and won by a wide margin, giving her a good chance this time as well,” he added. The councillor said Ratnamma Raju, who represented Vyttila Janatha in the 2010 council and is contesting as a rebel candidate from the same division, could have the backing of some party workers and supporters in the division. “Whether they might get a majority is debatable, but they certainly have support,” he said. Ms. Pinheiro, who was expelled from the Congress recently, is expecting a fourth term as councillor. She won from Pachalam in 2000 and 2010 and will contest again from the division this year, after representing Vaduthala West in the previous council. There were attempts to dissuade her from standing, but she filed her nomination anyway, she said. “I was told earlier that I would be fielded from the division. But when the party fielded somebody new, I decided to contest independently,” Ms. Ratnamma said. Gracy Joseph contested from Kaloor South in 2010, wresting the seat from the LDF. She contested from Kathrikadavu in 2015 and won by a margin of over 1,200 votes. The LDF, too, is not free of rebel candidates. In Panayappilly, Division 8, Jayanthi Premnath, outgoing councillor, is contesting independently. “She had won as a CPI(ML) candidate last time. A win this time outside the party fold is more uncertain,” said an outgoing LDF councillor. Another senior LDF councillor, however, said rebel candidates who had represented the divisions they were contesting from again, would definitely have support that would take at least a fraction of votes away from the LDF. He refused to name candidates who might have a good chance. Ms. Premnath had been chairperson of the Kudumbashree Area Development Society (ADS), which has enhanced her support base in the division, a large one of nearly 8,000 voters. In Division 12, Tharebhagam, Preethy K.H., the outgoing councillor who was also part of the Kudumbashree group in the area, is contesting independently. In 2015, she had contested independently and then backed the LDF in the council. K.R. Premakumar, outgoing Deputy Mayor, is the UDF candidate who contested from the division. Mr. Premakumar is contesting for the fourth time but is outside of his home turf of divisions 17 and 18, which he had represented before. Other rebel candidates are also in the fray, including IUML rebel T.K. Ashraf, who is contesting from Kalvathy. Former Mayor K.J. Sohan is contesting from Fort Kochi Veli. Five Independent candidates won in the 2010 elections, while seven Independents had secured seats in 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rebels-may-dent-prospects-of-major-fronts/article33181692.ece

They will be the second in the three-tier quality control mechanism to be put in place for the renovation of the damaged roads. A project management unit has been set up for effective management of the projects. The second tier is a third party quality check by a panel of expert faculties from the engineering colleges. This tier is a consultancy job for the colleges, including periodic inspection and collection and testing of samples in their laboratories, according to a government order. The colleges The faculty members belong to Government Engineering College, Thrissur; TKM Engineering College, Kollam; St. Thomas College of Engineering and Technology, Chengannur; Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science, Ernakulam; Amal Jyothi College of Engineering, Kanjirappally; Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, Ernakulam; SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam; Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology, Kalady; Saintgits College of Engineering, Kottayam; Sree Narayana Gokulam College of Engineering, Kolencherry; St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Pala; and Vidya Academy of Science and Technology, Thrissur.

In the first instance, the police team chased down three persons in two cars at Angamaly and seized from them 105 kg of ganja found in 50 tightly sealed packs. The arrested are Ansal, 34, of Thodupuzha, Nizar, 37, of Perumpadachira, and Chanthu, 22, of Vellathooval. The trio were on the police radar following a tip-off received by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik. Information received from them on interrogation led to the seizure of another 35kg of ganja found hidden in 17 sealed packets in a rented house at Avoli within the Ernakulan rural limits. “The accused are suspected to be wholesale dealers who had smuggled in the narcotic in the past. We have already launched a probe, and more people are suspected to be involved in the case,” Mr. Karthik said. A case has been registered invoking relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The contraband seized was reportedly being smuggled from Andhra Pradesh to Thodupuzha. “They [accused] had procured the narcotic from the tribal belt of Annavaram near Vishakhapatnam, and the rented house was being used to stock the contraband,” said M.R. Madhu Babu, DySP, Narcotic Cell. Ganja has been literally pouring into the district. The latest seizures come close on the heels of the seizure of nearly 13 kg of ganja in two incidents in the city on Tuesday alone. In one case, 2.50 kg of ganja was seized from a courier firm after it was found hidden amid rice powder and turmeric and coriander powder in a carton to be sent to Dubai. A few days ago, three youngsters were nabbed with 45 LSD stamps they had ordered online. A team led by Mr. Babu and comprising Inspectors Sony Mathai and Peter K.J; Sub Inspector Soofy T.M; Assistant Sub Inspectors Shibu Joseph, Saju Paul, Biju M.V, and Joseph P.J. and senior civil police officers Rony Augustine, Salin Kumar, K.B.

26 November 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Printing press staffer moves tribunal seeking redressal||A woman employed with the State government’s printing department has approached the Administrative Tribunal, seeking redressal after she was asked to discontinue her work-from-home (WFH) arrangement and turn up for duty, despite being a lactating mother, in contravention of a standing order issued by the Disaster Management Department exempting vulnerable categories from attending office. The woman, a resident of Kochi, attached to the printing press at Mannanthala near Thiruvananthapuram has been on WFH arrangement since September 16 considering that she was a lactating mother with an eight-month-old toddler. However, she was asked to turn up for duty by the deputy superintendent of the press through a communication issued on November 18. It said it was not possible to assign WFH and cited lockdown relaxations by the Central and State governments and asked her to immediately join duty in keeping with the printing department director’s direction.  October 14 order However, it is being cited that this was in violation of the Disaster Management Department’s order issued on October 14 exempting vulnerable categories like pregnant women, lactating mothers with children aged less than one, cancer patients, and officers undergoing organ transplant. When contacted, department sources said the order was still in force, and that no government department could issue orders contravening it. The press deputy superintendent said the communication was part of the general proceedings summoning back employees in view of the department’s added responsibilities owing to the forthcoming local body polls. Notwithstanding that the grievance, if genuine, could be favourably considered if the employee concerned gave a representation. “We are very much concerned about the well-being of our employees as reflected in the 14-day-quarantine allotted to even secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients while a seven-day-quarantine would do. However, the fact remains that the printing department has a critical role to play in the smooth conduct of the local body polls, and the technical nature of the work is such that we cannot assign work that could be done from home,” the superintendent said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/printing-press-staffer-moves-tribunal-seeking-redressal/article33181881.ece
26 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Aadhaar card misuse suspected in bid to smuggle ganja||The ganja seized from a courier firm in the city could have been sent using an unscrupulously obtained Aadhaar card, excise officials suspect. The excise enforcement and narcotic special squad had seized 2.5 kg of ganja, which was found hidden in small sachets, from a carton containing rice powder, turmeric powder and coriander powder meant for Dubai. The copy of an Aadhaar card submitted at the time of sending the parcel guided excise officials to the house of a 23-year-old youngster in Kannur. “It emerged that he has not been to Kannur for the past many months. So it was unlikely that he could have sent that parcel and whoever did it could have used the Aadhaar card without his knowledge. We are now collecting CCTV footage from the local courier firm in Kannur and its immediate neighbourhood. We have also established surveillance and are operating jointly with our counterparts in Kannur,” said a senior excise official. Since the firm did not have international service, the parcel was sent to the firm in Kochi where the 27-kg carton evoked the suspicion in the operator who alerted the officials. The parcel was meant for a shop in Dubai. Incidentally, it was the same firm from which MDMA, a narcotic substance, worth around Rs. 200 crore was seized in a similar attempt to push it through in the guise of a consignment of saris in September 2018. Wednesday’s seizure Excise officials suspect that a yet-to-be arrested Kannur resident suspected to be involved in the seizure of 140 kg of ganja from the Ernakulam rural limits on Wednesday could be linked to the seizure from the courier firm as well. Though excise officials suspect a six-member-gang to be involved in the attempted smuggling, it could be confirmed only after any arrest is made. “The ganja could have been sourced from Andhra Pradesh. Considering the limits of the excise in probing a case with international links, we would share the information with the Narcotics Control Bureau and the Central Intelligence Bureau,” the official said. Courier firms The Excise had recently established a liaison with nearly 160 courier firms in the district after it emerged that in a few recent incidents drugs were ordered online and procured through courier. “We have asked the courier firms to alert us on suspect parcels and the seizure was the result of such cooperation,” said the official.  We are collecting CCTV footage from the local courier firm in Kannur.

26 November 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Twenty20 bats for more panchayats this time||When the Twenty20, the apolitical corporate-backed charity outfit, burst on the scene at the Kizhakkambalam grama panchayat during the last local body elections, mainstream political parties were quick to write its obit. But that proved premature as the nascent outfit emerged the giant-slaying David and swept to power in the 19-member panchayat.  92 candidates Five years down the line, Twenty20 has expanded its vista and has fielded 92 candidates in the region. From being an electoral player in just Kizhakkambalam, it is now attempting to broaden its sphere of influence to four adjacent panchayats. Apart from contesting all 19 wards in Kizhakkambalam, it has fielded candidates in all 19 wards in the Mazhuvannoor grama panchayat and all 14 wards in the Aikkaranadu grama panchayat, and 11 out of 23 wards and 16 out 18 wards in the Vengola and Kunnathunadu grama panchayats. Besides, it will contest in 11 block panchayat wards and two district panchayat wards in the region. The selection of panchayats and wards has been based on a study and contiguity factor. Membership drive While refusing to be drawn into a prediction about the electoral outcome, Sabu M. Jacob, businessman and chief mentor of the Twenty20, instead, threw up statistics of the outfit’s two-month membership drive in the four new panchayats it has now fielded candidates. "About 91% of the people in Aikkaranadu, 90% in Mazhuvannoor, 89% in Kunnathunadu, and 87% people in Vengola panchayat have taken our membership so far, which is more than 84.50% of the people who are our members in Kizhakkambalam. Why would all these people take our membership if they don't want us to be part of the governance," he said. However, the outfit is not offering freebies like essential items at heavily discounted prices as being done through its food security market in Kizhakkamabalam. Unlike its maiden electoral battle when it came up with a detailed election manifesto like the other parties, the Twenty20, this time around, has chosen to go to the public with a simple one-line promise of peace, happiness, and security, which, in its assessment, automatically assures all-round development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/twenty20-bats-for-more-panchayats-this-time/article33181674.ece

On closer look, one realises that it is a candidate out to canvass votes in the local body polls, and his children are all wearing t-shirts, masks, caps stamped with their father’s election symbol and a request. George Nanatt, Left Independent from Karanakkodam Division (No.44) in the Kochi Corporation, has quadruplets, who are all young voters, and a five-year-old. “I’m a first-timer in the poll fray, and the children are posting these photos and videos on social media as well,” he says. The campaign gear is thanks to a group of people from the entertainment industry who lost their means of livelihood due to COVID-19. “What was begun as a survival project has made a lot of headway, trying out different things, with due regard for safety and value,” says Praveen Symphony, who owns an event management firm who is coordinating the venture. “We began making cotton masks to support the needy, and eventually, also support ourselves. Over time, we introduced trendy, fashionable masks, and when the elections were announced, we realised since the customary electioneering would not be happening, we could provide green, economical electioneering solutions to candidates. Hence, masks, caps, and other merchandise featuring their symbols and photos. We don’t use ink to print on them, but instead use a heat-printing transfer technology, which is eco-friendly and is economical,” says Mr. Praveen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trendy-electioneering-catching-up-in-kochi/article33181686.ece

The court made the oral observation when State Attorney K.A.Sohan sought three months to amicably settle the dispute relating to the church between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions. When a contempt petition filed against the Ernakulam Collector for not complying with the court’s directive came up for hearing, Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar orally observed that the affidavit filed by the Additional Chief Secretary, Home, was vague and did not make any commitments to implementation of the court directive. It only sought to adjourn the contempt proceedings to enable the government to find an amicable solution to the issue. Commitment The court reminded the State Attorney that the Collector had earlier appeared before the court and made a commitment to implement the directive. Besides, it had been a year since it had issued the directive. The affidavit of the Additional Chief Secretary did not say what sort of understanding was reached between the two factions at the three meetings convened by the Chief Minister. The State Attorney further submitted that the government would try to settle the dispute amicably within three months. If the dispute could not be settled, it would seek either a legal solution or muster sufficient force and peacefully implement the directive of the High Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/theres-no-directive-to-settle-church-dispute-hc/article33181749.ece

The State government in its appeal to the court said the Supreme Court had clearly held that ‘protective reservation in favour of woman’, especially in view of Article 15(3) of the Constitution, was not illegal. The finding of the single judge that woman reservation should be limited to 50% of the offices was totally incorrect. In its appeal, the SEC submitted that the entire election process had to be completed “in a compressed time frame” and any interference with the process would stall and protract the election process. Besides, as the election process was already under way, the single judge should not have passed any orders that would interfere with the process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-body-quota-hc-adjourns-hearing-to-dec-2/article33181734.ece

Left Democratic Front (LDF) nominee Lepumol is the first person from the Kani tribe to contest in a general seat with the backing of a major political front. “We are facing a lot of challenges from accessibility to lack of basic amenities. There are some glaring flaws in our system and I intend to correct them,” says the candidate. According to the LDF leadership, Ms. Lepumol was no random choice and was handpicked after a careful scrutiny. “Though very young, she is quite popular among the residents for her active involvement in addressing various issues,” says CPI(M) leader S. Jayamohan. No proper road The ward, situated a few kilometres into the forest, has no properly levelled roads and it is just one of the several issues faced by residents. “You cannot walk without falling over many broken-down mud stretches they call roads. We do not want hi-tech roads, but an ordinary concrete surface to walk on.” The place also has limited public transport facilities and Ms. Lepumol says improving that is one of her major goals. Bus service “After Class IV, all students have to go to Kulathupuzha to continue their studies. The students have been suffering for long and we had to fight for a bus service. I was a college student when we organised the agitation and I believe I can do a lot more as an elected representative.” The candidate seems to have no apprehensions about the ward repeatedly opting for the UDF in the past. “Despite being in power for a long period, they could not make any significant strides in addressing development-related issues. There are many residents who are homeless while some others have no proper sanitation facilities. During the campaign many people requested for basic civic amenities and the previous representatives could not even ensure that. Roads were sanctioned, but not built and it is the same story in every case,” Ms. Lepumol says. Most of the residents in the area are farmers and daily wage workers and Ms. Lepumol says it is for the first time in the State that a political front is fielding a tribal candidate for a general seat. “More than the electoral outcome I am happy about the fact that my candidature will ensure appropriate representation in the future. I am sure I will inspire many others to come forward,” she says.  I am happy about the fact that my candidature will ensure appropriate representation in the future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lepumol-hopes-for-a-refreshing-change/article33181720.ece

26 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Namesakes, Independents give jitters to fronts in corporation||As campaigning hots up in the city, rebels and namesake candidates are giving jitters to official nominees of political fronts in the polls to the Kozhikode Corporation council. Candidates of the main coalitions, the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the United Democratic Front (UDF), and also the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), are facing namesakes in many of the 75 divisions of the civic body. At least one-third of the total 350 candidates are contesting as Independents. Mayor post This time the post of the Mayor has been reserved for women. Namesake candidates securing votes are also likely to mar the chances of an official candidate in closely contested divisions. Congress candidate K. Karthiyayini has to face an Independent, K. Karthiyayani, in Kotulli division, where CPI(M) nominee S. Jayasree, former principal of Meenchanda Goverment Arts and Science College, is also contesting. In Paroppady, V.P. Sheeja of the LDF faces another Sheeja, an Independent. Similarly, BJP candidate P. Sabitha has a namesake, Sabitha. Here, the Congress has nominated K.C. Shobitha, a councillor who shifted from the neighbouring Malaparamba division. In Malaparamba Meanwhile, in Malaparamba, CPI(M) candidate K.P. Mammed Koya has a namesake, M.P. Mammed Koya. Here, Congress nominee K.P. Rajesh Kumar is also contesting with N.K. Rajesh and K.T. Rajesh, both Independents. Interestingly, in the general division of Karaparamba, two Udayakumars are contesting as Independents. Incumbent councillor Navya Haridas of the BJP is seeking her fortune again. LDF and UDF candidates — M.N. Praveen and K. Sathyanathan respectively — will face Praveen and A. Sathyanathan, Independents, in the Civil Station division. The BJP has fielded E. Prasanthkumar. In Chettikulam , LDF’s O.P. Shijna and UDF’s Sumati Teacher, who are locked in a direct fight, has to be cautious against Shijina, Shimna, K.P.Sufa and Sumati, all Independents along with the BJP’s Vineetha Kripesh. At Puthoor, LDF candidate nominee V.P. Manoj has to face Independent O.P. Manoj while the nightmare of Sirajudden Eranikkal of the UDF is Siraj, another Independent. Similar is the situation in Chelavoor where C.M. Jamsheer of the LDF and P. Shinoj Kumar of the UDF face K.K. Jamsheer, Shinoj and Shinoj Kumar, all Independents. In Kuthiravattom, M.C. Anilkumar of the LDF has two namesakes, M.K. Anilkumar and Anilkumar. Here, NDA candidate Bindu Udayakumar has to face another Bindu, an Independent. In Valiyanagadi, S.K.

26 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Feroke seeks a stable rule this time||In its very first term, this new municipality had to go through a political storm and shift of power mid term. Facing the local body polls once again, stability in administration is the one factor the voters of Feroke Municipality will be looking for. Having alternated between the LDF and the UDF as a grama panchayat earlier, Feroke had a delicate balance between the two fronts in its first poll as a municipality. While the LDF had 18 seats, the UDF with just 16 seats came to power with the help of Independent councillors in 2015. P. Rubeena of the IUML was the first chairperson of the municipality. But her rule lasted only for two-and-a-half years. In 2018, the LDF, through a no-confidence motion, thwarted the rule and brought the LDF-backed Independent councillor K.A. Khamaru Laila to power. “Development was lost amidst this power struggle between the two fronts in the past five years,” said P. Shijith, who was the only BJP councillor in the 38-member municipal council, adding that most of Feroke’s developmental issues still remained as the councillors were engaged in the blame game. P. Rubeena, the first chairperson, claimed that the UDF-led council solved the water crisis to a great extent through the JICA project and that it could excel in the field of waste management. She also made a claim of building houses for 600 families in the municipality. The UDF is highlighting ‘these achievements’ in its campaign this time. However, Mr. Shijith said, the water crisis still remained and there was a need for more building projects that had been put off due to shortage of funds. However, the LDF and the UDF highlight traffic issues and infrastructure development as their key poll planks. “Renovation of the bus stand, the stadium, and also building a community hall will be our priority,” Ms. Rubeena said. With a voting population of 42,998, Feroke Municipality has 123 candidates contesting in its 38 divisions. Among them are 68 men and 55 women. The post of chairperson has not been reserved this time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/feroke-seeks-a-stable-rule-this-time/article33181679.ece
26 November 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Change in political scenario gives a glimmer of hope for UDF||The changed political scenario in the State may have given an optimistic feeling for the Congress-Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) combine to take on the rainbow coalition of the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Kozhikode District Panchayat elections in December. But the ground reality is quite different with the Left parties taking no chances to lose power in the district panchayat which they have been holding on for the last three decades since the formation of the defunct District Council. In the previous polls held in 2015, the LDF edged out the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) by winning 18 seats in the 27-member council. However, in the 2010 polls, the LDF had secured only a majority and that too literally by a whisker of one seat more than the UDF. Mini Assembly polls  The elections to the District Panchayat could also be considered as mini Assembly elections in the district. However, the 27 seats do not cover the areas of the Kozhikode corporation, and Koyilandy, Vadakara, Payyoli, Mukkom, Koduvally, Ramanattukara, and Feroke, municipalities. UDF leaders believe that the anti-incumbency against the State government would electorally favour them in the council polls even though one of its partners — JD(U) which later became LJD — walked out of the coalition. Their candidates are upbeat after the victory of Congress nominees M.K. Raghavan in Kozhikode and K. Muraleedharan in Vadakara in the Lok Sabha polls held last year. They would want the political trend to continue in the district panchayat as well. However, the LDF is heavily banking on the development initiatives carried out by the three-tier local bodies in the past five years. With its well-oiled machinery, the CPI(M) has been the first to go off the blocks in campaigning as well especially against the backdrop of the setback the party suffered in the Lok Sabha polls. However, another worry for the CPI(M) is the robust presence of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance which is slowly eating into its vote share. The divisions of the Kozhikode District Panchayat are — Azhiyur, Edacheri, Nadapuram, Kuttiyadi Mokeri, Perambra, Kattipara, Balussery, Engapuzha, Kodenchery, Thiruvambady, Omassery, Chathamangalam, Pantheerankavu, Kadalundy, Kunnamangalam, Kakkodi, Madavoor, Narikunni, Nanmanda, Atholi, Uliyeri, Arikkulam, Meppayur, Payyoli Angadi, Maniyur and Chorode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/change-in-political-scenario-gives-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-udf/article33181680.ece

G. Jayapal, general secretary, KHRA, told The Hindu on Wednesday that sectoral magistrates and police officials were found to impose fine without considering the ground situation. “Recently, one of our members complained about police officials asking for fine for not wearing face masks from people who were in the course of having their food,” he claimed. Mr. Jayapal also pointed out that steps had not been taken to create awareness among people. There were customers who still refuse to give their personal details such as mobile phone numbers. Seating arrangement was another problem. “If we arrange only two chairs next to a table, some people drag one or more chairs next to it and sit there. Our members often are ambivalent about taking it up fearing loss of business. We have already suffered huge losses due to the pandemic,” Mr. Jayapal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-protocol-hotel-restaurant-owners-allege-harassment/article33181672.ece

A release said on Wednesday that the order was issued to the District Superintendent of Police, Kozhikode, and the superintendent of KMCT Medical College too had been asked to submit an explanation. The doctor accused of committing medical negligence would have to give his version of the incident. All these reports should be submitted in three weeks, commission judicial member P. Mohanadas said. In a complaint, P.R. Murali, a native of Valanchery in Malappuram district, said he had approached the hospital to remove a metal road which had been fixed to his body after an accident in 2008. However, one of the 12 screws fixed to the body was reportedly not removed in the surgery. Though the screw was subsequently removed in another surgery the next day, another wound was found in his thigh. A metal plate was fixed there. However, there was no end to his pain and another surgery was performed. Mr. Murali, a workshop mechanic, is now unable to walk. He suffered heavy losses during the floods last time after his house was damaged. Mr. Murali has now sought compensation from the hospital for the lapse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-ordered-into-alleged-medical-lapse/article33181676.ece

Dr. Renuka said that the public in the district should be on alert as the day’s positive cases crossed 200 mark. The spread of the pandemic has increased in tribal hamlets too, she said. Hence, the candidates who are engaging in house visits as part of the upcoming civic body polls should avoid direct contacts with the public, especially in tribal hamlets, Dr. Renuka said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fresh-covid-19-cases-go-up-in-kozhikode/article33181667.ece

26 November 2020||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||IUML allows a friendly fight at Perinthalmanna||The Perinthalmanna Municipality is witnessing a unique friendly fight between two women of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). Deviating from its declared policy of temporarily or permanently expelling rebel candidates, the IUML has given explicit approval for both women to fight it out in ward 5. Pattani Zareena and Pacheeri Husaina are the two independent candidates of the IUML in ward 5. Strangely, both were approved as official independent candidates of the party. “The winner will become the United Democratic Front (UDF) member,” said IUML district president Sayed Sadikali Shihab Thangal. The party, however, denied its official symbol to both candidates. When Ms. Zareena has mobile phone as her symbol, Ms. Husaina has got the symbol football. The IUML ward level committee chose Ms. Husaina as the party’s candidate, and she went ahead by accepting the deposit amount from Mr. Thangal. However, the municipal committee shot down her name and wanted Ms. Zareena to contest. When the issue reached Panakkad, the spiritual seat of the party, the leadership had no choice but to let both of them go for a friendly fight. Both women represent two party families in Perinthalmanna, where the IUML has been suffering from group rivalry for long. Both are supported by two party MLAs from the region. When Manjalamkuzhi Ali, MLA, and his followers favour one candidate, P. Abdul Hameed, MLA, and his supporters stand for the other. The IUML leadership appears to be nonchalant about losing the seat by going for a friendly fight, especially as the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is going for an all-out show in the ward. According to UDF leaders, ward 5 is a strong bastion of the IUML. “No matter Ms. Zareena or Ms. Husaina, the victory will be for the IUML,” said Mr. Thangal. Voters in the ward too have no confusion. Even hard-core IUML supporters smile at the friendly fight. “We know whom to vote for. It doesn’t matter for us,” said Mohammed Ali, a voter who refused to reveal his initials or work. But he justified the IUML leadership’s decision, saying that it was a special case. “Our party has taken action against rebels in many places. But this one is an exceptional case”. It is not the first time that such friendly fights has been allowed by the party. In the last civic body elections, the IUML’s A.Ahamed Kutty and N. Usman Madani had fought it out in Pathappiriyam ward of Edavanna panchayat. Mr. Kutty won the ballot and got the party recognition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuml-allows-friendly-fight-by-two-party-women/article33181682.ece

The meeting, convened by Sabarimala Additional District Magistrate Arun K. Vijayan and presided over by Special Officer B. Krishnakumar, expressed satisfaction at the preparations for darsan in line with the COVID-19 protocol and the functioning of various departments. Speaking on the occasion, the ADM noted that the pilgrimage season was progressing under great caution. On the occasion, he sought to allay fears over reports of a temporary employee testing positive at the Sannidhanam and said the patient and his primary contact had been transferred to a COVID first-line treatment centre. Also, steps had been initiated to quarantine those associated with them. The meeting, held late Monday, also discussed the proposals by various departments on what should be done in case of an increase in footfall. It further decided to expand the COVID-19 protocol committee. Directive to traders The employees of the temporary shops at Sabarimala have been directed to produce COVID-19 negative certificates, besides a certificate of disinfection of their shops. A decision on carrying out sanitation drives at the Sannidhanam and Valiyanadapandal at regular intervals too was made. In view of the pandemic, the daily number of pilgrims to the hill shrine has been fixed at 1,000 on weekdays and 2,000 on holidays. The proposal to raise the daily limit primarily stems from the sagging finances of the Travancore Devaswom Board, which has been in a crisis following the locking down of temples. 9,000 in first week As per estimates, around 9,000 pilgrims visited the temple during the first week of the ongoing Mandalam-Makaravilakku season, which began on November 16. The daily income during the season currently stands around Rs. 10 lakh on weekdays and Rs. 20 lakh on weekends.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-reviews-facilities-for-sabarimala-darsan/article33181714.ece

A statement from the office of the Minister for General Education on Wednesday said 50% of the teachers on a day should attend school from December 17. This is to improve academic support being provided to students and gear up for revision classes for them. The decision, taken after a meeting the Minister had with the General Education Secretary and the Director of General Education, comes close on the heels of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s announcement on Tuesday that the government would consider if it was feasible to reopen educational institutions for higher classes if COVID-19 cases continued to dip steadily. Arrangements would be made to finish digital classes for Class X by January 15 and that for Class XII by January 30. Following this, whenever conditions were favourable to allow students to return to school, practical classes and revision based on the digital classes would be held. General Education Secretary A. Shajahan said the government was targeting reopening in January subject to the situation then. . Depending on the school and classroom facilities and availability of teachers, the proportion of students to attend should be fixed in a school plan, and they should start gearing up for the examinations, be it in March or April. For public exams Director of General Education Jeevan Babu K. told The Hindu that teachers were being required to attend school in December to start work for public examinations, including registrations, and ascertain how much knowledge the students had been able to imbibe till now and provide them necessary support. However, bringing Class X and XII students together in school may not be practical because of their sheer number – they total nearly 8.5 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/class-x-xii-teachers-to-report-for-work/article33181743.ece
26 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||‘Rose’ becomes a thorn in the side of ‘lotus’||The allocation of ‘rose’ as election symbol to Independents in a number of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation wards has left the Bharatiya Janata Party fuming. BJP leaders called it a deliberate attempt to spoil its chances in the December 8 local body polls by assigning symbols resembling its own symbol, the ‘lotus’, to namesakes of BJP candidates in the municipal Corporation. The Independents have also been placed next to BJP candidates on the official candidates list that could leave voters confused, BJP leaders alleged. Sit-in staged BJP candidates in the Corporation led a sit-in outside the State Election Commission office demanding that the ‘rose’ symbol issued to Independent namesakes in the Corporation wards be withdrawn. A delegation led by BJP district president V.V. Rajesh and party State general secretaries George Kurien and P. Sudheer submitted a petition to the commission demanding that the ‘rose’ be replaced with some other symbol. Also, Independent candidates should be moved down the list on the ballot so as not to confuse voters, they said. BJP State president K. Surendran accused the CPI(M)-led State government of using the commission to sabotage the BJP’s chances in the Corporation where it had won 35 seats in 2015. Strategically placing namesakes or candidates with similar-sounding names with the rose as symbol next to the lotus was an attempt to sabotage the BJP’s chances, Mr. Surendran said. According to Mr. Rajesh, the BJP has found the rose a problem in nine wards: “We have detected this problem at Vanchiyoor, Chempazhanthi, Kazhakuttam, Powdikonam, Ambalathara, Pappanamcode, Edavacode, Kadakampally, and Cheruvaikkal. This is tantamount to cheating the voters, and robbing them of the right to free and fair elections,” he said. According to him, these are Corporation wards where the party had a strong chance of victory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rose-becomes-a-thorn-in-the-side-of-lotus/article33181885.ece

26 November 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Development of capital city tops agenda of TVM||The Thiruvananthapuram Vikasana Munnettam (TVM), a party floated by a collective of capital-based social media groups, real estate, trade and professional organisations, and residents’ associations is placing itself as the fourth political force in the city, its founders said in a press conference here on Wednesday to launch its 14 candidates for the upcoming local body polls. The party candidates will be contesting under the ‘conch shell’ symbol. Speaking to press persons, TVM president S.N. Raghuchandran Nair said development of the city was the single-point agenda of the party.  Huge response “We believe that all the other political parties have stood against the city’s development. The beginnings of our party was with regard to the issue of airport privatisation. When we have a call to the public asking those who wish to be candidates to come forward, we got a huge response. Following a screening process and an interview, we finalised our list of candidates. Our candidates have been asked to sign an agreement that they will stand with the party even after they win,” said Mr. Nair. He dismissed allegations that the party was a ‘B’ team of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or that it was funded by corporate groups such as Adani. He said that one of the party’s candidates was asked to withdraw the nomination by the members of another political party. Master plan Mr. Nair said that the first priority for its candidates, if they managed to win, was a master plan for their respective wards. “It is unfortunate that the city works on a master plan prepared decades ago. We would also make a call for a social audit of spending in the Corporation and the periodic presentation of a progress report by those in power. Projects happening in the city should be branded with the name of the city, instead of the locality. Even if we do not manage to win, we will be here to raise demands for the development of the city,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/development-of-capital-city-tops-agenda-of-tvm/article33181836.ece

District Collector Navjot Khosa has made a strong appeal to the candidates to respect the protocol and fully avoid the use of plastic in their campaigns. By resorting to eco-friendly materials for electioneering, the district can avoid the accumulation of this pile of waste, District Collector Navjot Khosa said. In all, 6,402 candidates are contesting in the elections to 1,727 local body wards in the district. Ignoring the green protocol could generate 154 tonnes of waste, including plastics, if non-biodegradable and disposable materials are used. Plastic flags and festoons alone could result in a 120-tonne pile. Plastic bottles would account for another 110 tonnes, while disposable cups, plates, plastic covers, and other products, 117 tonnes. Avoid plastic Ms. Khosa appealed to all the candidates to observe the green protocol in their campaigns. Plastic materials should be replaced with cloth and paper for making banners, boards, and posters. Plastic should be avoided completely. The Kerala High Court has ruled that the green protocol should be strictly observed during the local body elections planned in three phases in the State. The secretaries of the local bodies should ensure the proper disposal of waste materials from the polling stations after voting. Candidates and political parties should remove their campaign materials immediately after the voting ends, the Collector said. Meetings of candidates contesting in the district panchayat divisions and the Corporation wards were held at the Collectorate on Wednesday. The meetings discussed the rules to be followed by the candidates and the model code of conduct for the elections. The District Collector chaired the meeting of the district panchayat candidates. Sub Collector M.S. Madhavikutty and district supply officer Jalaja S. Rani led the meeting of candidates in the Corporation wards.  Secretaries of local bodies should ensure proper disposal of waste materials from polling stations||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/flouting-green-protocol-to-cost-city-dear/article33181886.ece

The guidelines have been so amended that by maintaining all COVID protocols strictly, close family members of the deceased can perform the very essential local as well as religious rites as required. If the family so desires, one member would be allowed inside the room where health workers are prepping the body and to symbolically sprinkle ‘holy water’ or cover the body with a cloth. However, none will be allowed to touch or hug the body . After prepping the body, close relatives will be allowed to see the deceased inside the isolation room or in the mortuary. At the burial grounds, the relatives will be allowed to see just the face of the deceased by opening the zip on the body bag. At this point also, necessary religious rituals or prayers may be performed. A maximum of 20 persons can participate in the funeral and physical distancing should be maintained. Those above 60 years, children less than 10 years or those with serious co-morbidities, including respiratory problems, should not participate in the funeral.

Mr. Surendran said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had implied that they were privy to the findings of the CAG report. Moreover, the government was readying to move the High Court against the CAG’s observation that Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) had unconstitutionally raised loans from the foreign market by issuing masala bonds without the sanction of the Central government.

Leaders of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), United Democratic Front (UDF) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) who took part in a debate organised by the Thrissur Press Club here on Tuesday expressed confidence in winning the district in the coming local body elections. While the LDF is campaigning for continuation of power, the UDF is trying to wrest the governance back. The NDA is eyeing on improving its position in various local body institutions in the district. The LDF is confident of victory, said CPI(M) district president M.M. Varghese. In the 2015 local body elections, the LDF won 66 of the 86 grama panchayats, 13 of the 16 block panchayats, 20 of the 29 district panchayat divisions, six municipalities and the city Corporation. “We expect a better performance this time,” said Mr. Varghese. “The people-friendly policies implemented by the State government are improving our confidence. People can assess the development works presented by the local body institutions in the past five years. The government has positively intervened in all sectors of people’s lives. We are seeking a vote for continuation of the development works,” he said. “The BJP and the Congress are trying to scuttle the LIFE Mission project. They thwarted the dreams of 140 homeless families in Wadakkanchery. The Thrissur city Corporation witnessed many development projects in these years. The district panchayat implemented development projects to the tune of Rs. 540 crore. The Divanji Corner overbridge, sports complex at Lalur and solar plant are some of the achievements of the LDF.” Marred with corruption Expressing confidence of victory, District Congress Committee president M.P. Vincent said all claims of the LDF were just political gimmicks. The LDF rule in the Thrissur Corporation was marred with corruption. Land mafia and project mafia were ruling the civic body. The Divanji Corner overbridge and Pattalam Road development projects, which were claimed as LDF’s achievements, were started by the UDF, he said. “We have chosen the best candidates and are confident of victory,” he added. BJP district chief K.K. Aneesh Kumar said the BJP would win power in minimum 30 local bodies in the district this time. “People are fed up with both the LDF and the UDF. They want a change. The political climate of the State is favourable to the BJP. We had six councillors in the Corporation last time. We fielded BJP State spokesperson B. Gopalakrishnan as our Mayor candidate as we are confident of capturing power in the Corporation this time. The BJP had a clear majority in many divisions in the Corporation limit in the Lok Sabha elections,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fronts-confident-of-victory-in-thrissur/article33181833.ece

Mangalam, former head of the Department of Philosophy at Sree Kerala Varma College, Thrissur, and managing trustee of Punarjani, a de-addiction centre at Poomala, died at a private hospital on Wednesday. He was 59. He was undergoing treatment for liver disease. Punarjani, which is more than a de-addiction centre, has brought back hundreds of alcoholics to life. Dr. Johns, who was an alcoholic for over 20 years, reminded the world that alcoholism is a disease and alcoholics need care and treatment. His autobiography Kudiyante Kumbasaram (Confession of an alcoholic), which graphically portrays the inner world of an alcoholic, was an eye-opener for many. Dr. Johns tasted liquor at the age of 12. By the time he entered college he was an alcoholic. He dropped out from studies for a year due to his drinking habit. However, he managed to pass BA and MA with first rank. He did odd jobs, even became a coolie, to earn money for his drinks. He earned a PhD in Gandhian philosophy and a law degree between the binges and odd jobs. He quit a two-decade-long habit with willpower, support of the family, and treatment on realising that alcoholism is a disease. The Punarjani de-addiction centre, which he founded, never locks up alcoholics. He told the world about the pain, sorrow, guilt and agony that each alcoholic goes through. The phoenix sculpture, the bird that raises from its own ashes, which stands tall in front of the Punarjani, speaks all about the resurrection of Dr. Johns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/punarjani-trustee-dead/article33181729.ece

Hence, the vendors were forced to approach private parties, take loan at high interest to run their businesses, and often fall into debts, he said. “The scheme will bring a change in the lives of small and petty vendors, as the government is relieving them from paying heavy interest. Volunteers and welfare assistants of village / ward secretariats will provide a helping hand, right from identifying the beneficiaries, taking their applications to arranging loans,” the Chief Minister said. Through the scheme, about Rs. 1,000 crore is being lent to nearly 10 lakh people. The government will be paying interest of Rs. 60 crore to Rs. 100 crore annually. The government is implementing the scheme in collaboration with the banks. The banks will credit the loan amount to the beneficiaries’ accounts in a week or 10 days. Smart ID cards The beneficiaries will also be provided with QR-based smart ID cards. If they repay the loan in the given time, the government will reimburse the interest component once in every three months directly to the beneficiaries’ accounts, making them eligible for loan again. “Vegetable vendors, fruit vendors, small shopkeepers, pushcart vendors, and traditional artisans are eligible to apply for the scheme. If any eligible person is not covered, they can apply through the volunteers. Upon verification, they will be provided loan in a month or two. Also, they can dial toll-free number 1902 to get themselves enrolled under the scheme,” Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. Ministers P. Ramachandra Reddy, K. Venkateswara Rao, Botcha Satyanarayana, A. Suresh, and Sankara Narayana, officials and bankers were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-launches-jagananna-thodu-scheme/article33181813.ece
26 November 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||New method of fixing property tax will not burden people: Botcha||Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana has said that the revised method of fixing property tax is intended to make urban local bodies financially self-sufficient, and, at the same time, will not burden the people. Addressing the media here Wednesday, Mr. Satyanarayana said the State government, after considering the suggestions of the Central government, had taken a decision to change the system of levying property tax to strengthen the urban local bodies (ULBs) and provide better services to the people. “At present, property tax is being levied on the annual rental value basis (ARV system), where three months rent is levied as tax per annum. The government has revised this method and will levy tax based on the capital value (CV) of the property,” he said, and added that the system was already being implemented in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. “The percentage of tax so fixed will be between 0.10% and 0.50% of the CV for residential buildings and between 0.2% and 2% for non-residential buildings,” he added. “We have no intention to burden the people. The G.O also states that the increased tax will not be more than 15% of the existing tax,” the Minister said. “Only Rs. 50 will be levied as property tax for houses with a plinth area less than 375 sq. ft. Property rights will be given only if taxes are paid,” he added. Water tax The Minister further said that the government decided to levy water tax between Rs. 100 and Rs. 350 per kilolitre per month for households (domestic) and between Rs. 30 and Rs. 50 per kilolitre for bulk usage (such as apartments), between Rs. 60 and Rs. 140 per kilolitre for commercial purposes and between Rs. 40 and Rs. 80 per kilolitre for industrial users. “The revised taxes are only to cover the ONM costs for supply of water but not for additional income to the municipalities,” he said. The Minster also said that the new sewerage taxes were nominal and it would not burden the people. He reiterated that the revenue generated by municipalities would be spent on the development works of the same municipality and would not be used for other works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-method-of-fixing-property-tax-will-not-burden-people-botcha/article33181811.ece

26 November 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sighting of elephant herd near villages sparks panic||Fear gripped residents in villages bordering with Tamil Nadu, in Chittoor rural and Gudipala mandals, as an elephant herd was sighted moving closer to human habitations. The herd was first sighted around 11 p.m. on Tuesday, but its movement became conspicuous after 3 a.m. on Wednesday. The herd of eleven pachyderms is believed to have two calves, which is cited to be the reason for its sluggish movement. Officials are worried over the presence of calves as they are feared to make tuskers aggressive on sighting humans. Officials from the Forest Department used tom-tom drums to alert farmers, orchard watchmen and shepherds about the possible movement of elephants in the vicinity and were advised to move to safer places. Power supply cut Power supply to agricultural connections was also snapped to avoid possible electrocution. The field staff have been deployed to chase the elephants away beyond Kotalam, the last village in Chittoor district, beyond which there is a dense forest. Forest officials The Hindu spoke to express the opinion that it could be the same herd that ransacked mango orchards in February early this year. The herd is believed to have forayed into Kuppam-Palamaner belt from Karnataka, and then ventured into Paradarami area of Tamil Nadu, only to surface again in Chittoor rural and Gudipala mandals now. Though Koundinya reserve forest on the Palamaner side has solar-powered fencing, there is no such luxury on this side. The officials are perplexed at the trespass, which happened despite the 3m deep and 3m wide trench dug along the forest border to keep the elephants away.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sighting-of-elephant-herd-near-fringe-villages-sparks-panic/article33181248.ece
26 November 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bypoll a referendum on development: GVL||The BJP has termed the ensuing by-election to Tirupati Lok Sabha seat as a referendum on development in the State, and dared the TDP and the YSRCP, which formed successive governments post-bifurcation, to come for a debate. This time, the party is keen on taking up a visual campaign to draw people’s attention to ‘ground zero’ in a bid to send its detractors into the defence mode. “Whatever has accrued to the State in the name of development is a result of the Centre’s commitment. But the two regional parties are bent on claiming credit to it,” said BJP Rajya Sabha member G.V.L. Narasimha Rao during a media interaction here on Wednesday. Citing the IIT, the IISER, the Smart City, the industrial zones and scores of rail/road projects sanctioned to the region, Mr. Rao sought to know what had the State government done to match the Centre’s efforts. Maintaining that several thousands of crores of rupees pumped in by the Centre had translated into concrete development, he said the YSRCP government could no longer try to keep the people in the dark. The TDP as well as the YSRCP governments had failed to take forward the NIMZ sanctioned to Tirupati five years ago, Mr. Rao said, while accusing the regional parties of perpetuating corruption, family rule and caste politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bypoll-a-referendum-on-development-gvl/article33181814.ece

26 November 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telugu Desam scoffs at rumours of Panabaka joining YSRCP||Former Union Minister Panabaka Lakshmi, who had contested in vain on behalf of the TDP in the 2019 general elections for the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, is jumping into the fray again for the ensuing by-election to the constituency. An announcement to this effect by party spokesperson and noted psychologist N.B. Sudhakar Reddy puts the record straight over the rumour mill spreading feelers over the likelihood of her joining the ruling YSRCP. The ruing party’s Rajya Sabha member V. Vijay Sai Reddy’s tweet that the TDP could not even find a candidate for the seat added strength to the rumours, which later turned out to be untrue. Miffed at the YSRC campaign, Dr. Sudhakar Reddy told The Hindu on Wednesday that Ms. Lakshmi would launch her campaign on Saturday after offering prayers at the temple of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala. She would also take out her maiden rally in the temple city, accompanied by the party’s State president K. Atchannaidu. “The mischievous campaign by the ruling party’s mouthpiece and social media wing is baseless. The party appears to be scared of facing the election, and hence is trying to besmirch the rival candidates,” Dr. Reddy said, and brushed aside the rumour that she was contemplating joining either the BJP or the YSRCP. ‘Will repeat 2014 feat’ The TDP is confident that it would be a repeat of the 2014 general elections, when it romped home with ease. The party had won four of the seven Assembly segments coming under the Tirupati LS constituency and secured a huge margin of 43,000 votes. However, as the Lok Sabha seat was given away to its alliance partner, the BJP, its candidate lost by 37000 votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telugu-desam-scoffs-at-rumours-of-panabaka-joining-ysrcp/article33181815.ece
26 November 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Intervention of courts unacceptable: Speaker||Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam has said there is a well-established mechanism of resolving issues between the upper and lower Houses of a bicameral legislature, and intervention of courts in it is unacceptable. The rules governing the ordinary and money Bills and the procedures of legislative business were clearly laid down. Capital Bills The courts should not encroach the legislative domain, and they were expected to see the motives behind petitions which tend to halt the progression of laws like it happened in the case of Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Bills, he observed on Wednesday. Participating in the 80th All India Presiding Officers’ Conference at Kevadia in Gujarat, Mr. Seetharam said a harmonious coordination among the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary was crucial for a vibrant democracy. “These 'three pillars of democracy' seem to have forgotten the fact that they are interdependent. While exercising their powers, they ought to be aware of their limitations.” To criticise the governments, thereby derive political mileage, opposition parties tend to create a lot of problems in the implementation of laws. In such mad pursuit of political mileage, the respect of the legislature was guillotined at times, Mr. Seetharam stated. ‘Political vendetta’ Referring to the Decentralisation and CRDA Repeal Bills, Mr. Seetharam said there was some disturbance between the AP Legislative Council and the Assembly on passing them and the moving of courts by vested interests stalled their (Bills) progression. Intervention of courts was sought in this case for the sake of political vendetta, he maintained. “The legislature is keeping silent whenever the thin barricades around it are broken often, respecting the idea of checks and balances laid in the Constitution. But, a frequent intervention of courts is certainly to be seen as an encroachment,” Mr. Seetharam asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/intervention-of-courts-unacceptable/article33181586.ece

November is observed as Lung Cancer Awareness Month. Smokers at high risk People who smoke regularly are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer, though it can affect non-smokers too. Research studies have shown that frequent contact with carcinogenic chemicals or breathing in highly polluted air may also trigger lung cancer. Dr. Sridhar said that the programme will create awareness on the harmful and deadly effects of tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/the-hindu-to-hold-cancer-awareness-camp-tomorrow/article33181250.ece
26 November 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Jagananna Thodu’ copied from Central scheme: TDP||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) spokesperson Kommareddy Pattabhi on Wednesday lashed out against the State government for making ‘false claims’ regarding the interest-free loans being given to small traders like vendors and street hawkers across the State. “The newly-launched Jagananna Thodu scheme is just a ‘Jagananna Kabja’ programme. This scheme is aimed at taking credit for the Prime Minister SVANidhi loans being given to the small traders all over the country,” Mr. Pattabhi alleged. In fact, these small loans of Rs. 10,000 were already being given in a big way in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana while Andhra Pradesh is lagging behind all these months, he alleged. Addressing a press conference, the TDP leader objected to the manner in which the State government was putting its own spin on the interest-free loan scheme in the State. “Initially, the government was asking for advance payment of 7% interest on these small loans. The same interest would be deposited back into the bank accounts at a later date,” Mr. Pattabhi alleged. The poor traders cannot depend on this government considering the shock that farmers got in the Sunna Vaddi scheme,” the TDP spokesperson alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagananna-thodu-copied-from-central-scheme-tdp/article33181251.ece

The public hearing was organised to ascertain the public opinion on the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report on the proposed project. The hearing was chaired by Joint Collector Venugopal Reddy and was attended by at least 600 people from the neighbouring villages. About 30 people including YSRCP Payakraopeta MLA Golla Babu Rao, CPI (M) State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao, CPI leader Dora Babu, former Payakraopeta MLA V. Anitha and others spoke. Almost all of them raised objection and stated that the project would create environmental problems in the region. Mr. Baburao cited environment concern and raised the issue of justified compensation to the project evacuees and employment to the locals. Mr. Narasinga Rao pointed out that the region was already facing a environment crisis from the pharma and chemical industries and the V-CPIC would add up to the woes of the locals. Compensation The fishermen pointed out that due to the pumping of effluents into the sea, the fish catch has already dwindled by over 50% and the new project would diminish it further, rendering them jobless eventually. Many leaders pointed out to the Joint Collector that about 4,422 acres of land was acquired and the compensation was paid for 2,606 acres of patta land only. The locals also demanded that job be provided by the companies who intend to set-up their industries in the region. Releasing a statement on the public hearing, V.S. Krishna of the Human Rights Forum alleged that the authorities who conducted the survey did not do it properly and in full. “The Vizag-Chennai Petro Industrial Corridor is a highly destructive enterprise as it would destroy the livelihood of thousands of families especially farmers, farm labourers, artisans and fishermen. The fishing community will lose its natural rights,” he said. Narsipatnam Sub-Collector Mourya and officers from revenue and Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board attended the public hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/petro-corridor-locals-pour-out-their-woes-at-public-hearing/article33181862.ece

26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Poll body does not spare a thought for the elderly||Aged citizens may have been prevented from arriving at the polling stations during the upcoming GHMC elections in view of the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic, but the same privilege has not been extended to the election staff. Employees aged over 60 years too have got orders from the GHMC Commissioner and Election Authority D.S. Lokesh Kumar appointing them for polling duties and asking them to attend the training sessions. Ironically, several such employees across departments have already retired and not in office to receive the orders or the show cause notices issued for absence from the training session. Even stranger is the fact that some of the employees who have been sent the orders, cannot receive them as they had already passed away, sources informed. Senior citizens, who are on contract based employment, however, could not escape the duty. “Over 60 years of age, and a diabetic, I am terrified about being exposed to hundreds of voters at the polling station, but cannot avoid it as it will attract disciplinary action,” said Sujatha (name changed), a contract employee deployed for the duty as presiding officer. Sources have informed that the paucity of time between election notification and the polling date has forced the officials to allot election duty to quite a few employees who had worked for previous elections for the Legislative Assembly in 2018. The usual procedure of approaching through the departmental heads too has been given a go-by in certain instances, and employees received orders directly from the GHMC Commissioner. The government has decided to exclude teachers from election duty this time round for reasons not specified, though the latter are largely on a hiatus due to closure of schools on account of the pandemic. Orders were issued by principal secretary, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Arvind Kumar, to all collectors, asking them to send lists of officers and staff other than teaching staff, for drafting their services for the elections. Orders went from chief secretary Somesh Kumar too, to all the department heads, asking them to send the list of officials and staff, both regular and temporary, to the GHMC Commissioner and Election Authority for polling duty. Only personnel from the General Administration department, and who are connected with collection of taxes such as those from Registration, Commercial Tax, and Prohibition & Excise, have been exempted from the duty. For deployment in over 9,101 polling stations in the city, more than 36,000 polling personnel will be required, at the rate of one presiding officer, one assistant presiding officer, and two polling officials to man each station. In addition, about 11,000 personnel will be required to be kept in 30 per cent reserve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/poll-body-does-not-spare-a-thought-for-the-elderly/article33181614.ece
26 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Our main fight is with MIM, and not BJP: KTR||Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao, who is spearheading the TRS campaign in the GHMC elections, and single-handedly taking on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that has upped the ante with emotive issues, argues that the party has not fallen into BJP’s ‘trap’ of diverting the campaign narrative from local and development aspects to religious issues. Excerpts of an interview Mr. Rama Rao gave to The Hindu on Wednesday: Is the BJP successful in luring the TRS into its own narrative on the campaign style? While local issues are our priority, the BJP is deliberately communalising the campaign repeatedly by creating Hindu-Muslim divide. So we need to respond to ensure people are not misled. By countering their allegations, our party is setting the record straight. If you want to run business in Hyderabad, if you want investments to come, if you want jobs to be generated, the fundamental thing is law and order and peace. Religious harmony cannot be compromised. It is my bounded duty as a Minister to ensure peace. We are the only party that is speaking on development and the initiatives of the government to ensure Hyderabad’s growth engine continues. Your entire focus of criticism is on BJP and not other parties? BJP’s speciality is spewing venom. Pure rhetoric and whipping up emotions is their agenda. We have seen how provocative atmosphere led to riots in New Delhi where the country’s power of seat is situated. Our main fight is with MIM and not the BJP, while Congress is nowhere in the fray. Since the BJP has been making tall claims of Central assistance to Telangana and Hyderabad, I specifically want to ask them about their contribution. While Telangana has contributed more than Rs. 2.70 lakh crore as taxes, it received less than Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. I understand the federal spirit and I am not demanding that the entire money be given back to Telangana as the Central government has certain other responsibilities. But they have not contributed anything over and above what Telangana should get as per the constitutional obligation. What is the reason for advancing the GHMC polls? Was the TRS afraid of further erosion of popularity after recent election results? In fact, we have the guts to face the elections. This is the first time elections to GHMC are being held even before its tenure is over. We could have postponed like earlier governments did if we wanted to, but we have the confidence to go to people. So where is the question of fear. Every party has a political strategy and we had our own and there is nothing wrong in it. Has your party’s efforts to weaken the Congress indirectly helped BJP to gain ground in Telangana? If people want to leave Congress, it is their decision to join the TRS. We didn’t weaken the Congress but its present status is due to its inherent weakness. If others are cashing in on it, I don’t find any fault in it. In democracy people change parties and loyalties. Parents are worried over the high fee structure in schools and they have been fighting against it. What is your party stand on it? We have appointed a committee headed by Prof. Tirupati Rao that has made certain recommendations like enhancing only 10% hike every year. But parents seem to be demanding a regulatory commission on fee issues. I will certainly take this to the notice of the Chief Minister for his intervention. People of Andhra Pradesh origin in the GHMC area overwhelmingly voted for TRS in the last elections. Are you confident of their continued support and is any specific effort being made to seek their support? As Hyderabadis, their priority will be totally different in these elections. They will be concerned about local issues like water, roads, drainage and employment. It doesn’t matter to which region they hail from or which community they belong to. I don’t think there is any exclusive effort needed to impress them upon as they are aware of city’s development under TRS rule. We are confident of getting votes on our performance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/our-main-fight-is-with-mim-not-bjp-ktr/article33181609.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||It’s mid-term appraisal for TRS||As the campaign entered top gear in GHMC elections, a look at stakes of different parties shows that all of them will have some take away of varying nature at the end. For the ruling TRS, it is virtually a mid-term appraisal on its performance since the party will have no more tests of a larger size to face until the next general elections. The elections to Warangal and Khammam municipal corporations are due in March and also to Siddipet, Atchampet, Jadcherla, Nakrekal, Paloncha, Manuguru, Mandamarri and five other municipalities on different occasions in the next three years but they hardly represent a large sample to project people’s preference. The GHMC polls are a litmus test for all parties because they are happening in the State capital where one-third of the population resided and is home to 24 of the 119 Assembly constituencies. The parties will want to wrest control of the municipal body in the city for several reasons, one of which is owing to a huge land bank of the government. The TRS will also look to win the polls to erase the memory of party’s loss in Dubbak Assembly by-polls from public mind. Like it did last time, it will want to win mayorship on its own and check the strides of BJP. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen will like to have TRS as its alliance partner remaining at its mercy in the election of the Mayor. It was precisely for this reason that an AIMIM MLA Mumtaz Ahemd Khan went overboard while targeting the TRS. The AIMIM is aware that though it is expanding in the country, it can not afford to lose its base in old city of Hyderabad which had been its springboard ever since inception. The TRS won 99 divisions and the AIMIM 42 last time but the former did not require any help to gain mayorship. The AIMIM and the BJP, on the other hand, were involved in hate speeches of late in what could be seen as attempts at communal polarisation of voters. The BJP is also trying to usurp the position of Congress as alternative to the TRS. The Congress which won only three of the 150 divisions last time will try to score more than the BJP (4 seats last time) and finds that all its rivals are on an anti-Congress platform. For the TDP which won one seat, and the Left parties that drew blank, any victory would be a boost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/its-mid-term-appraisal-for-trs/article33181644.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||COVID scare not over yet||Telangana was fortunate that COVID-19 cases did not spike even after people gathered for the recent festivals and the floods laid a trail of destruction. However, the scare is not over yet. State government officials, healthcare professionals, NGOs and several others are watching the campaigning for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections with bated breath as thousands of people are coming together for canvassing, leaving nothing to chance. And sometimes, some of them are not even wearing masks. Another factor that can compound the number of cases is the winter season, as viruses survive longer in cold temperatures. The GHMC elections will be held on December 1. Citing a second wave of COVID in other states, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday appealed to people to wear masks, avoid crowding to the extent possible and maintain other precautions. However, hundreds of workers of all political parties are clearly not maintaining the precautions during rallies. “Overcrowding during campaigning, not following COVID norms, and cold temperatures might see a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases. Why cannot there be guidelines for campaigning such as restricting the number of people, timing of the campaigning and staggering the move of people?” questioned B.R. Shamanna, professor of the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Hyderabad. He added that since people consider leaders, who participate in political rallies, to be their role models, the latter can set an example. If poll contestants do not maintain the COVID guidelines, their fans may follow suit. Government officials, who have expressed apprehensions, said that they are on the watch as more festivals are lined up in the coming months. Mujtabha Askari, trustee of Helping Hands Foundation, an NGO involved in COVID-19 management, said that the drop in temperatures, disregard to precautions by contestants and their cadre during rallies have the potential for surge. “Doctors who work for our organisation are estimating a rise in December and January,” Mr. Askari said. Also, healthcare professionals on COVID duty have stressed that more RT-PCR tests have to be conducted to detect more cases. “We should rely less on Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) and more on RT-PCR tests,” said a senior doctor. Another doctor stressed that COVID peak was recorded earlier in some northern states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/covid-19-scare-not-over-yet/article33181607.ece
26 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rajendranagar is a mix of urban, rural households||Rajendranagar, ward no. 60, is one of the biggest among the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC)’s 150 wards that will go to poll on December 1. Sprawled on the southern bank of Musi river and spilling beyond the PVNR Expressway, it is a mix of rural and urban households. Its sheer size can be gauged from where the ward stretches from TS Police Firing Range on the south to Doctors’ Colony on the banks of the Musi in the north. It stretches from WALMTARI in the west to Shivrampally in the east. Some of the most prestigious central institutions are located in the ward including NIRD, NAARM, Agriculture College, Veterinary University and National Fisheries Development Board. In this vast area are apartment complexes, row houses as well as age-old homes with courtyards and tiled roofs. The ward is reserved for SC (woman). During the 2016 GHMC elections, Korani Srilatha triumphed over her rival by securing 10,701 votes or 51.25% of the total votes polled. This year, there are 47,240 electors with 22,750 women forming a sizeable and decisive chunk for the ward that is reserved for women. “We have all the projects planned. I am promising a continuation of ongoing work,” says Srilatha during her door-to-door campaigning. Surrounded by men, the candidate is barely visible as they move from one house to another. Once the group reaches a home, Srilatha dives for the feet of the older people asking for their blessings and vote. The families radiate a sense of awe as the politician blends familiarity with respect. Congress’ Bathula Divya, who hails from a political family, has promised to solve the issues of drainage and roads. Her door-to-door campaign includes reaching out to families and applying ‘kumkum bottu’ to women and doing ‘namaskar’ to other family members. BJP has fielded Archana Jayprakash, who is also promising solving civic issues as her supporters keep up a constant chant of Bharat Mata Ki Jai. All the three candidates have kept their focus on neighbourhoods that are densely populated and have poor infrastructure. Areas like Yerrabodda, Upparpally, Budvel, and Yadavreddy Nagar with their poor urban infrastructure of sewerage lines assembled largely by residents and homes where the inner roads are not smooth are a happy hunting ground for votes. A relic of an older period are small GHMC parks, which have now been encroached by land sharks. But there are other concerns that are being raised by residents.“We didn’t get the promised Rs. 10,000 that many families got though their houses were not submerged,” says Lakshmamma, who does maggam work in Reddy Basti near Upparpally. While the Rs. 10,000 flood relief money has been distributed in many localities that were flooded, the figures for Rajendranagar were not available. And the contest remains open.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rajendranagar-is-a-mix-of-urban-rural-households/article33181612.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Akbaruddin dares govt. to remove NTR, PV samadhis from lake land||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi described the NTR Samadhi and PV Narasimha Rao Samadhi as encroachments on Hussainsagar and challenged the Telangana government to remove them. Mr Owaisi was speaking at a public meeting in Erragadda division on Tuesday night where he said that the government proceeds to demolish homes of the poor on lake lands while ignoring ‘encroachments’ in the form of Necklace Road, shops on it, and the samadhis. The Chandrayangutta legislator said that the Hussainsagar was spread over 4,700 acres, but is limited to only 700 acres. “Where did these [remaining] 4,000 acres go? They went for the Necklace Road, the shops on it, and the samadhis for that grim person Narasimha Rao, NTR, and Lumbini Park,” he said even as he challenged the government to remove the samadhis. “When we raise this issue, they will talk about Madaar Saheb Maqta. They can only see us there,” he said. Mr Owaisi claimed that Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) head office is built on a nala of the Hussainsagar and sought to know where the water body disappeared. The AIMIM floor leader also criticised Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for supporting the Narendra Modi-led Central government for its decision on demonetisation in 2016.  “Now you are saying BJP is this and that. When you supported BJP, was it not the way you are describing it now? The father and the son are saying things. Why did you support BJP during demonetisation,” he asked. ‘Vote for development’ He also criticised TRS for supporting the Goods and Services Tax. He added votes should be sought on developmental issues and not on rhetoric such as surgical strikes, even as he exuded confidence his party would soon represent the Jubilee Hills assembly constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/akbaruddin-dares-govt-to-remove-ntr-pv-samadhis/article33181631.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS raising bogey of law and order fearing defeat: BJP||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar continued his tirade against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the TRS government and challenged him to release a white paper stating that welfare schemes are being taken up here without contribution from the Central government. “You do it, then we all vote for you on Dec.1,” he said. Continuing his roadside meetings as part of the GHMC polls at Suraram on Wednesday night, the BJP chief claimed that all the schemes being taken up in Telangana are being taken up with major contribution coming from the Central government, including subsidised rice. ‘Funds misused’ “On every welfare scheme, he is putting his photo, despite the Centre making allocations. Even the funds given for COVID-19 were misused to benefit the corporate hospitals which fleeced the people. Mr. Rao did not step out of Pragati Bhavan when the city was hit by floods too,” he charged. Mr. Rao is raising the bogey of law and order problems and communal strife as he fears defeat in order to postpone the GHMC polls. ‘Dubbak stunt’ “His son Mr. K.T. Rama Rao tried the same stunt during the Dubbak bypoll campaign but people replied overwhelmingly by voting in favour of our party candidate. The result is going to get repeated here," he claimed. “The Chief Minister is hatching a conspiracy to put off the polls because of the increasing support for our party. We will not sit quiet if he takes such a step,” he said. How can the TRS, which aligned with the Majlis, accuse the BJP of being a communal party, he questioned. MIM won five seats in Bihar appealing to the minority community? What is wrong in appealing to the majority community to vote for us?, he wondered. Empty promises The TRS has been only making empty promises like two-bedroom housing for the poor even after Centre gave Rs. 3,500 crore. The government has to give an account of where the money was spent when storm water drains and sewage network is in shambles, he said. “The Chief Minister wanted to throw alms of Rs. 10,000 each and that too was stopped forging my signature and issuing a fake letter. When I challenged him to come to Bhagyalakshmi temple, he did not dare to come out. I was accused of raising an India and Pakistan issue. How can going to temple here be a Pakistan issue? The BJP will put Rs. 20,000 into the accounts of all the flood affected families if elected to power,” Mr. Sanjay said.  How can the TRS, which aligned with the Majlis, accuse the BJP of being a communal party?   Bandi Sanjay Kumar, State BJP president.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-raising-bogey-of-law-and-order-fearing-defeat-bjp/article33181636.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Scientists, too, on election duty||Central government employees, teachers, and even high ranking officials from Central government research institutions have been enlisted in considerable numbers for election duty during the upcoming GHMC polls. With teachers from State government service exempted from the job, the burden is transferred to all and sundry from the other departments. “Even principal scientists from Central research institutions have received election duty orders from the GHMC Commissioner. During earlier polls, we could seek exemption from it citing our work, but this time, there is no reply for our requests,” an institutional head revealed on condition of anonymity. As the designations for polling duty are fixed based on the pay scale, most of the Central government employees would be usually appointed as presiding officers and micro observers. While in the Assembly and Parliament elections, they reported to the Revenue Divisional Officers and Joint Collectors respectively, in GHMC polls, the reporting authority is much inferior in rank, such as MPDO/agricultural officer. Sources informed that the officials in the cadre of director and joint director too got orders designating them as presiding officer, while those in the joint secretary and additional secretary rank have been designated as polling officers. While it is by no means the first time that Central government employees are being roped in for election duty, the due procedure of seeking the list from the heads of the institutions has not been followed this time, they say. “They have taken the names from the list of employees who worked for the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, and dispatched orders for even employees who retired and who are on maternity leave. We sent a modified list, but there is no response for the same, and the employees kept getting notifications about the training camp,” shared another high ranking official. Exemption for State government teachers has not been extended to those from Central schools, who all have been conscripted for elections. “We have pre-board exams in December, and are under pressure to complete the syllabus and conduct revision classes. Election duty at this time adds to the stress,” complained a teacher from Kendriya Vidyalaya. Confusion prevails, as she has received orders to attend training for election duty at three different centres, respectively, at Hayatnagar, Ramantapur, and at Dilsukhnagar. “Further, we could not comprehend the training material as it was totally in Telugu. At the training camp, three fourth of the staff were from non-Telugu background. How are we to conduct elections?” she questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scientists-too-on-election-duty/article33181615.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||49 candidates with criminal history: FGG||Political parties have fielded as many as 49 candidates with criminal records, totalling 96 criminal cases, for the GHMC polls, a Forum for Good Governance (FGG) analysis has revealed. The FGG scrutinised affidavits that the candidates filed at the offices of the respective returning officers and drew the aforementioned inference. According to their analysis, as many as 17 candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have criminal cases against them. This is followed by the TRS with cases against 13 of its candidates, the Congress with 12, and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) with seven. Criminal cases were filed against 43 male candidates and six women candidates. The FGG also stated that in the Malkajgiri division, all the contesting candidates belonging to important political parties have criminal cases against them. In an interesting inference, the FGG pointed out that the number of candidates with criminal cases contesting the 2020 civil polls is lower than the 2016 elections. “During the 2016 elections, political parties gave tickets to 72 candidates having cases. This time it is reduced to 49, which is a good sign for decriminalisation of politics. Due to recent unprecedented floods, residents of Hyderabad have suffered heavily. To avert such a calamity in the future, there is a need for an efficient and effective GHMC. To make this possible, we have to elect honest and clean corporators,” a statement released by FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/49-candidates-with-criminal-history-fgg/article33181617.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Telangana adds 993 more COVID cases||Telangana recorded 993 COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 2,66,042. Four more patients died. While 47,593 people were tested, results of 695 are awaited. This is the highest number of daily tests this month. On other days of November, around 41,000 to 46,000 samples were examined in a day. Health Minister Eatala Rajender has earlier directed officials to conduct around 64,000 tests a day. Over 60,000 people were tested in a day from August 25 to September 11. But the numbers started to decrease gradually. The new 993 cases include 161 from GHMC limits, 93 from Medchal-Malkajgiri, 67 from Bhadradri Kothagudem and 62 from Rangareddy. No cases were recorded in Narayanpet, while two each were reported in Kumaram Bheem Asifabad and Adilabad. Of the 47,593 people who got examined, 44,148 opted government health facilities, while 3,445 got tested in private labs. From March 2 to November 24, a total of 52,48,807 samples were tested and 2,66,042 were detected with coronavirus. Out of the total cases, 10,886 were active cases, 2,53,715 have recovered, while 1,441 have died.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-adds-993-more-covid-cases/article33181646.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Smriti Irani questions TRS silence on voter ID cards for Rohingya||Union Minister for Textiles and senior BJP leader Smriti Irani claimed on Wednesday that the TRS government not taking any action against the Majlis Party leaders for helping “illegally staying Rohingya” get voter ID cards through fraudulent means is a “testimony of their corrupt collaboration”. “This unholy alliance espousing the cause of illegal immigrants for political gain is shameful. The media has already exposed the manner in which voter ID cards were obtained by the Rohingya with help of letters issued by the MIM leaders on the letterhead,” she said, at a press conference at the party office. Since law and order is a State subject, there is little that the Central government or Home Minister Amit Shah can do about the illegal stay of foreigners. The onus lay squarely with the State government, she maintained. “Why did TRS government not react as soon the news of fraudulently obtained voters cards came out? Why was no stern action taken against the Majlis leaders,” she questioned. The Union Minister observed that the families of the martyrs of the Telangana statehood are “heartbroken” at the “corrupt collaboration of convenience” between the TRS and MIM. That the government had not responded to the chargesheet released by the party on the failures in GHMC showed the “tactical silence is political acceptance of the facts.” “Are the 75,000 encroachments on water bodies which led to major floods occur without the concurrence of TRS-MIM? The government has even failed to submit a final report on the damages to the Centre though Rs. 220 crore was released as immediate relief. Mandatory vaccination programme for children under Mission Indradhanush too was ignored,” she alleged. In fact, the use of police power against the party in Dubbak earlier and in GHMC is an “indication of the loss of popular support of the ruling government”. Since TRS government lacked answers to questions on why Old City continued to be deprived of development, the leaders are raising issues of intrusion of Chinese troops. “Our soldiers are fighting for the safety and security of the country,” she said. Ms. Irani also answered questions on the ‘love jihad’ bill, saying it was only meant to prevent women from getting into any “coercive relationship”, and she does not see anything “unconstitutional” about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/irani-questions-trs-silence-on-rohingya-voter-id/article33181622.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Owaisi dares Modi to campaign in Hyd.||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday challenged the Bharatiya Janata Party to send Prime Minister Narendra Modi to campaign in the upcoming Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections. Mr. Owaisi was speaking at the Akbarbagh division where he accused the BJP of trying to damage ‘brand Hyderabad’ on account of speeches by its leaders. “Call the Prime Minister and make him campaign here. Why are you bringing these others. Bring your real face. Organise a public meeting here. What is your state in Bihar? During the 2019 election, BJP had 222 seats, and a year-and-a half later, they are reduced to 65. In what world do you live?” Mr Owaisi questioned. Describing Hyderabad as one of the growth engines of the country, Mr Owaisi alleged that the BJP is trying to compromise this only because of its opposition to the AIMIM. “The Hyderabadi public does now want a return of the 1980s and 1990s era. And MIM will never let this happen. Since the formation of Telangana, Hyderabad has not seen tension, leave alone curfew. I give credit for this to the public of Hyderabad, the police, and the AIMIM. This is why I am telling you, that this fight is to save Hyderabad and brand Hyderabad, and from the disgusting lies BJP is saying about Hyderabad,” he said. Mr Owaisi said that he had told Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao not to accept the ‘unconstitutional’ lockdown announced by the Centre since law and order is a State subject. He rued that the Chief Minister did not heed his advice. The lockdown, he said, led to loss of countless livelihoods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/owaisi-dares-modi-to-campaign-in-hyd/article33181645.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘TS emerging leader in defence, aerospace tech’||Telangana is emerging as a tech leader in defence and aerospace in the country with a focus on innovation and research, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chairman G. Satheesh Reddy said on Wednesday. Addressing CII-Telangana’s Defence Conclave, he said presence of many defence research labs in Hyderabad served as a big boost to development of defence suppliers companies in the State. A CII release said he told the conference that in many technologies such as missiles, radars and electronic warfare systems India had become self-reliant and many critical products were being manufactured in Hyderabad. The conference had ‘Revisiting Strategies for Self Reliance by Integrating India’s Defence Value Chain’ as its theme and was held on a virtual platform. Industries and IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan said Hyderabad was home to many defence and aerospace companies supplying products to globally renowned companies. There is a need for the entire spectrum to go up in the value chain through element of specialisation, invest in improved technology to reach the top level in defence manufacturing. Director – Aerospace and Defence of Ernst and Young LLP Colonel K V Kuber said while defence manufacturing has matured in Hyderabad, there is a need for more testing facilities in the State. Testing facilities need to be considered as national assets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-emerging-leader-in-defence-aerospace-tech/article33181649.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR transports automobiles to Northeast||South Central Railway (SCR) has transported automobiles like mini-trucks and commercial vehicles for the first time to Jirania Railway station in Tripura, and said to be the farthest distance covered by the zone. While just one goods train was loaded last year from Zaheerabad, 10 rakes have been loaded this year so far.

26 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Beware of insane leaders, says KTR||The city is forced to face the brunt of irresponsible rhetoric from some political parties and people should ignore them completely, TRS working president, K.T. Rama Rao said. Referring to the comments made by BJP chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar and MIM MLA Akbaruddin Owaisi leading to rise in tempers among their cadre, Mr.Rama Rao urged citizens to be cautious and ignore such provocative statements. “They have no reason to vitiate the atmosphere,” he said while addressing roadshows in Uppal and Chilukanagar. “Some leaders are stooping down for a few votes and seats. One insane leader says he will break memorials of NTR and PV Narsimha Rao and another insane leader encourages triple riding and promises to pay the challans,” he said referring to statements by Mr Owaisi and Mr Sanjay, respectively. Criticising national BJP leaders campaigning in Hyderabad for GHMC elections, he said they were welcome but it would have been much better if they had visited when the city was facing heavy rains and floods. “Since they are in the city now, they can visit Durgam Cheruvu bridge, Annapurna Centres, and Basti Dawakhanas too.” The Minister asked BJP leaders to bring Rs. 1,350 crore financial assistance for relief measures in rain-affected colonies which Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao had requested for in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Terming poll promises of BJP as funny, he said the same leaders halted Rs. 10,000 money distribution to flood-affected families while promising Rs. 25,000 for votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/beware-of-insane-leaders-ktr/article33181628.ece
26 November 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC declines to vacate stay order on data for Dharani||Telangana High Court on Wednesday declined to vacate the interim order staying collection of data with regard to non-agricultural properties in the State. A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, after hearing contentions of parties in a batch of PIL petitions on Dharani portal, extended till December 3 the order staying collection of crucial data relating to Aadhaar card, caste and family for registration of non-agricultural properties. The bench, while permitting collection of data connected to agricultural properties, raised several queries on registration of non-agricultural properties when Advocate General B.S. Prasad appealed for vacation of the stay order. It observed that the State government cannot compel a citizen to register details of private properties in Dharani portal. The bench also asked the AG about the Right to Privacy of a citizen when the latter’s crucial information like Aadhaar card and caste were being collected and uploaded online in Dharani portal. The AG informed the bench that already information pertaining to 97.58% of properties in rural areas was uploaded in Dharani portal. Nearly, 59.21 agricultural properties were recorded in village panchayats all over the State. The bench also wanted the government to assure people that the crucial data of citizens being uploaded on Dharani portal would not be breached, and all measures were taken to safeguard the same. “The petitioners are not challenging government’s intention. But they are asking for streamlining and fast-tracking of collection of data and backing of the process by legislation,” the CJ said. The pleas were posted to December 3 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-declines-to-vacate-stay-order-on-dharani/article33181647.ece
26 November 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Tagore asks BJP to probe graft charges against TRS||Stating that the BJP and the TRS were engaging in ‘Dosti in Delhi and Kushti in Hyderabad’, AICC in-charge for Telangana, Manickam Tagore has dared the BJP to order an inquiry into the alleged unlawful activities of TRS government rather than merely accusing it of rampant corruption. Mr. Tagore, who addressed a press conference along with TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, accused Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao and his associates of following unethical practices and sought an inquiry by the Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI and other Central agencies. “Why is it that any Central Minister, who comes to Hyderabad, talks only of TRS corruption when they have all the authority to order an investigation,” Mr Tagore asked. He also condemned BJP for attempting to divide society on communal lines for electoral gains. TRS, on the other hand, was distributing money to buy votes, he alleged. ‘Bandi Sanjay an outsider’ Mr. Uttam Reddy strongly condemned BJP State president Bandi Sanjay’s ‘controversial’ remarks allegedly aimed at disturbing peace and communal harmony of Hyderabad. He said Mr. Sanjay was an ‘outsider’ who knew nothing about Hyderabad or its history. “He lacks political maturity and doesn’t even understand the implications of his communal remarks. Unfortunately, such people are heading the state BJP,” he added. Later in the day, Mr. Uttam Reddy addressed road shows in Kukatpally, Moosapet and Old Bowenpally divisions and asked the people to reject ‘communal’ parties like BJP and MIM as well as ‘corrupt’ parties like TRS, and instead, vote in favour of Congress candidates. He alleged that both TRS and BJP, in connivance with the MIM, were “enacting a drama of rivalry” in view of GHMC elections. He asked Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to answer whether or not TRS supported BJP government on issues like demonetisation, GST, abolition of Planning Commission, and elections for President and Vice-President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tagore-asks-bjp-to-probe-graft-charges-against-trs/article33181626.ece

The Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) has initiated the green action plan under the Pattana Pragathi scheme at an estimated cost of Rs. 4 crore to develop the entire stretch along the NSP canal into a vast lung space within the KMC limits. Designed on the lines of a river front project, the civic body’s grand plan envisages installation of fence, construction of walking paths and open gyms on the perimeter of the irrigation canal that runs along several residential colonies including Prashanthnagar, Venugopalnagar and Ramanagutta in a phased manner. Work on the first phase of the green project is nearing completion and preparations are in full swing to throw open the facility for public on December 2 during Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s scheduled visit to the city, KMC sources said. The green action plan would help in curbing dumping of garbage, preventing encroachments and drowning incidents besides providing a vast lung space for local residents, said Khammam Commissioner Anuraag Jayanti.

26 November 2020||M. RajeevHYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Telugu Desam waging lone battle||The Telugu Desam Party Telangana State unit is fighting a lone battle to make its presence felt in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area, considered as its stronghold during the pre-bifurcation days. The party suffered a series of reverses since the past few years with several of its senior leaders migrating to other parties along with cadre and it could win only two seats, that too in Khammam district, in the previous Assembly elections when it went to polls in alliance with the Congress. At a time when questions are being raised about the survival of the party in Telangana, the party leadership sprang a surprise by fielding its candidates in 106 out of the 150 divisions that are going to polls on December 1.  Pressure factor Senior party leaders claimed that the party has to give B forms to the candidates as there was pressure on it from the aspirants and the party sees a “perceptible” change in the attitude of the people. “We have been preparing for the GHMC polls for the last one year holding meeting internally. The cadre was kept enthused with conduct of protest meetings against some of the government’s decisions,” a senior leader told The Hindu . The party was particularly hopeful of good show in LB Nagar, Kukatpally, Serilingampalli, Jubilee Hills and other constituencies on the peripheral areas. Interestingly, these are the areas where there is dominant presence of people with roots in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Party leaders said the party deliberately did not field candidates in the Old City area and focussed on few Assembly segments where “we have men and material available”. No big names The party is left with no big names which could attract large crowds and has therefore left the campaign management to the local level. A section of senior leaders have been entrusted with the responsibility of supervising the party’s affairs in these areas.   ‘Initiating a debate’ The campaign, mostly door-to-door, is focussed on the achievements that were made during the TDP rule as the party is confident that it has been able to initiate a debate among the people on which party did what for the GHMC area. “We are keeping our fingers crossed. We have ensured that no stone remains unturned from our side and we have to see how far this translates into votes?” a senior leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telugu-desam-waging-lone-battle/article33181637.ece
26 November 2020||R. AvadhaniSIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Focus on getting villages vacated under Mallannasagar||Slowly, but surely, the people of Erravalli in Kondapaka mandal have started vacating the village. However, this began with people who are already settled outside and migrated from the village long back, instead of the permanent residents of the village. This village, one among the two villages — the other being Singaram —located in Gajwel constituency represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will get submerged under Mallannasagar. As the Dubbak by-election was over, officials have been focusing on getting the villages under Mallannasagar vacated. About 20 families have left the village permanently, out of which three are locally residing. “All those who have already migrated to Hyderabad, Gajwel and other areas left their houses long back. As the government promised accommodation in double bedroom houses at Mutrajpally, they are rushing there for two reasons: grabbing the first opportunity and getting the houses allotted on the ground floor, though this is temporary accommodation,” said Shashidhar Reddy one of the oustees from the village. “We are not objecting to their vacating the village as they are trying to get benefits early and are worried if they don’t get if delayed. But we are not ready to vacate the village till benefits are extended to all the eligible. Some of the oustees are yet to get compensation and repeated appeals to the authorities have failed to yield results,” said Mr. Shashidhar Reddy. In the evening the villagers met the revenue divisional officer and submitted a representation on Wednesday. “The officials are asking us to shift temporarily to double bedroom houses at Mutrajpally and say permanent accommodation will be made later. We are not ready to shift to temporary houses. Show us permanent houses and issue us pattas. Then only we will vacate the village. Till then we are not ready to leave our native place,” said one of the villagers, on condition of anonymity, who attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/official-focus-on-getting-villages-vacated-under-mallannasagar/article33181640.ece

The exemption, however, will be depend on whether the respective airlines adhere to all the necessary COVID-19 protocols. Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar said. The exemption was granted after the government received a request from Air India, the order stated. In its revised standard operating procedures on preventive measures to check the spread of COVID-19, issued on November 23, the State government made it mandatory for all persons seeking to enter the State from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa to carry RT-PCR negative reports amid the rising number of cases in these States. “Henceforth, all on-duty cabin crew and cockpit crew of all airlines carrying valid identity cards will be exempted from RT-PCR tests at all airports in Maharashtra subject to following of necessary COVID-related protocols by the respective airlines,” the order stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cockpit-cabin-crew-exempted-from-rt-pcr-tests/article33181707.ece
26 November 2020||Mumbai,||Condolences pour in for Ahmed Patel||Politicians across party lines in Maharashtra paid tribute to Rajya Sabha member and senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel, 71, who died on Wednesday after a prolonged battle with complications of COVID-19. Patel had played a key role in the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government by ensuring that the Congress joined hands with the Shiv Sena to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party out of power. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said not only the Congress but also the MVA has lost its guide. “The Congress party has lost its Chanakya, who would stand by the party to face every challenge. He was actively involved in social work besides his political engagements. His guidance and experience helped us a lot while forming the three-party alliance, which formed the government in Maharashtra last year,” Mr. Thackeray said. His son and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said in his interaction with Patel over the past year, he found that he was accommodative, open to ideas and had different perspectives. The Maharashtra unit of the Congress paid homage to the senior leader at the party headquarters, Gandhi Bhavan. “He dedicated his entire life to the Congress party. He was firm in his positions. His priority was the party interest and he never cut communication lines with anyone. He played a key role in forming the MVA government and guiding us all,” said State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, who spent many years with Patel in national politics, said he was saddened by the news. “His contribution to Congress will always be remembered,” he said. It was the Congress delegation led by Patel which had visited Maharashtra last November to hold talks with Mr. Pawar, who played the leading role in stitching together an alliance with the Sena and the Congress, which seemed impossible on paper. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader Raj Thackeray said Patel’s greatness lay in the fact that he never used his sharp mind to settle personal grudges. “The veteran Congress leader passed away this morning. He was exceptionally astute and a sharp leader. These qualities helped him in upping his political grasp to the level of a game of chess and he made sure that his moves were matchless and he emerged victoriously. But his greatness lies in the fact that he never used his sharp mind to settle personal grudges. In fact, he remained above all this and only focussed on the betterment of his party. This made him stand out, across party lines, as an amicable leader, and he valued his relationships with all,” the MNS chief said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/condolences-pour-in-for-ahmed-patel/article33181500.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi,||RT-PCR tests in Delhi over past 3 weeks reveal 28% positivity||Around 28 out of every 100 people tested through the RT-PCR method were found to be COVID-19 positive, according to Delhi government data (between November 1-24) shared with The Hindu . The positivity (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) of 4.11 lakh RT-PCR tests done in this period is around 28.6%. But the highest overall positivity of Delhi for this period was less than 14%, as it also included results of Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). Compared to the past, more RT-PCR tests were done in the city in November following multiple orders from the High Court. The higher positivity of RT-PCR means that it is one of the reasons for the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in November. The city witnessed the highest spike in cases this month, since the outbreak of the pandemic. From November 1-24, 8.2 lakh tests were done using RAT, and the overall positivity being lesser than RT-PCR, shows that positivity of RAT was comparatively very low. RT-PCR and RAT are the two main types of tests done to detect COVID-19. RT-PCR test gives more accurate results compared to RAT. But the former’s result usually comes the next day, while RAT takes only 30 minutes to give a result. Question over accuracy In September, the High Court had asked the Delhi government to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and pointed out that the accuracy of RAT was low. Since then, the government has increased RT-PCR testing, but it is still less than the number of RAT done on a daily basis. The High Court raised the issue in an order on November 11, also. “The number of tests undertaken by the Delhi government from 19.10.2020 till date, reveals that testing through RAT is still being relied upon heavily vis-a-vis testing through RT-PCR and other similar modes. Taking a random example of the testing conducted by the Delhi government during this period would show that figures of testing through RAT has always and invariably been double the testing done through RT-PCR and similar modes, which is not understood when the situation is as critical as it is now and several asymptomatic persons are turning out to be COVID positive.” “RT-PCR has more specificity and sensitivity compared to RAT. But people being tested using RT-PCR are the ones who have more probability to have the virus and this is also one reason why the positivity is more for RT-PCR,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital. He added that the government should strengthen testing facilities so that RT-PCR testing can be done even in smaller diagnostic centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rt-pcr-tests-in-delhi-over-past-3-weeks-reveal-28-positivity/article33181497.ece

Following the meeting, the MHA had said in a statement that it was decided that house-to-house survey would be conducted in the entire Delhi. However, in a meeting on November 16, it was decided that the survey would only be conducted in “high-risk areas”, such as containment zones and busy markets, among others. During the survey, temperatures and oxygen levels of people were checked and symptomatic people were tested and isolated so that they don’t further spread the disease. As per the data, till Tuesday evening, 8,968 teams were involved in the survey and 13,53,287 of the total 13,99,779 houses in “high-risk areas” were surveyed.

He went on to donate plasma for the first time on May 28, within 10 days of recovery. “My colleague’s wife was suffering from COVID-19. She was in a serious condition and required a plasma donor. I had just recovered then. I was weak and I was a little afraid too, but then when I was battling the virus, my seniors and colleagues stood by my side. It inspired me and I went ahead with the donation,” he said. “It is my duty to serve people. So whenever there was a requirement or urgency, I went ahead with it,” Mr. Kumar added. Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal said that right from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, police personnel were not only required to maintain law and order during the lockdown but were also on their toes as frontline warriors in curbing the pandemic.  ‘High risk’ While performing their duties, officers and subordinates of Delhi Police were at high risk. Out of 6,937 infected personnel, 6,089 have recovered and 822 are yet to recover, he said, adding that 26 succumbed to the virus. “A large number of Delhi Police officers and subordinates, after recovering from COVID-19, have gone beyond the call of duty to save lives of other COVID-19 patients. They donated plasma to their colleagues, family, friends and even unknown people in Delhi and adjoining States of Uttar Pradesh. and Haryana,” said the senior police officer. According to police data, till Monday, more than 300 police personnel have donated plasma to several COVID-19 patients, who were mostly senior citizens. Donations Of the total plasma donated, 82 were for their colleagues, 107 for family members and friends, while 134 were donated to unknown people, said the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/over-300-policemen-have-donated-plasma-to-covid-19-patients/article33181480.ece

BJP leaders are playing with the lives of Delhi’s people by burning the garbage mountain. The garbage fire was not spontaneous... the BJP leaders have planned this. In the last 15 years, the BJP-ruled MCDs have gifted three huge garbage mountains to Delhi,” said AAP leader Durgesh Pathak. He said that BJP MP Gautam Gambhir and other BJP leaders have been making false claims that they had reduced the height of Ghazipur landfill. ‘I want to ask Mr. Gambhir if it is a new way to decrease the height of the Ghazipur landfill. The BJP is trying to fool the people of Delhi by putting the landfill on fire,” the AAP leader added. ‘Graft in civic bodies’ The party also attacked the BJP for alleged corruption in the municipal corporations of Delhi. “BJP-ruled South civic body could not build the Poornima Sethi Super Specialty Hospital even after 10 years but paid Rs. 4.72 crore more than the fixed cost to contractors,” AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said. Mr. Bharadwaj said that the 100-bed Poornima hospital was supposed to become fully functional by 2012, but the corporation could not build it till date. “The BJP-ruled civic body did not impose a penalty against the contractor despite the delay in construction work. However, the contractor was paid over Rs. 35 crore instead of the fixed cost of Rs. 30.96 crore,” the AAP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/fire-at-ghazipur-landfill-aap-demands-fair-investigation/article33181493.ece

The HC order had directed all undertrials to surrender in a phased manner between November 2-13. The interim stay order passed by the SC on October 29 is extended by a week. The matter will come up for hearing again on December 1. The matter was mentioned by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, who was assisted by lawyer Satya Mitra on behalf of National Forum on Prison Reforms (NFPR). The NFPR said that the HC order was against the spirit of the March 23 order passed by it and brushed aside the eight recommendations of a panel appointed by the top court. The plea said the HC order was passed by grossly misunderstanding the data presented to it and wrongly concluding that only three COVID-19 cases existed among 16,000 inmates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sc-stays-by-a-week-order-ending-bail-for-undertrials/article33181498.ece

26 November 2020||Pune,||COVID-19 cases continue to surge in Maharashtra||Maharashtra continued to witness a significant uptick in COVID-19 cases, with the State reporting 6,159 fresh cases on Wednesday to take the case tally to 17,95,959.

26 November 2020||Pune,||Pawar targets Centre’s failure to send team to assess crop damage||Hitting out at the Central government, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar on Wednesday said it has not yet sent a team to assess the massive damage caused by the retreating monsoon last month on croplands in the State. Speaking in Karad in Satara district, Mr. Pawar criticised the Centre’s apathy towards the plight of farmers. He said despite repeated requests from Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other top officials of the State, no Central team has visited the State over a month since the retreating monsoon wreaked havoc on crops. “The Centre must rise above party politics and ideology while providing much-needed help to States during natural calamities. Despite the Chief Minister, the Relief and Rehabilitation Minister, and the Chief Secretary repeatedly writing to the Centre to dispatch a team to assess crop and soil loss, nothing has been forthcoming from their end,” said Mr. Pawar, who was visiting Karad on the occasion of the death anniversary of Yashwantrao Chavan, the State’s first chief minister. In a thinly-veiled rebuke of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government, Mr. Pawar said the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government headed by Dr. Manmohan Singh would not have discriminated between States had any of them been struck by such a calamity. ‘GST dues still pending’ “When such natural disasters occurred during the UPA’s time, a Central team used to be sent promptly to that State to inspect the losses and a package would then have been immediately announced,” said Mr. Pawar, whose uncle, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was the Union Agriculture Minister in the previous UPA regime. He also said Maharashtra was yet to get Goods and Services Tax dues of Rs. 29,000 crore from the Centre. Responding to the State BJP’s repeated statements that the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress could fall anytime, Mr. Pawar said, “The BJP has to keep dangling such carrots [of the MVA’s imminent overthrow] so that its own MLAs and party workers do not fall prey to restlessness.” ‘MVA govt. won’t fall’ He added, “The Opposition has to keep saying such things in order to keep its party rank-and-file united and in order… But so long as Uddhav Thackeray, Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi stand firmly behind this front, nothing will happen to this government.” Mr. Pawar said such statements only underscored the BJP’s disappointment and frustration over their inability to form the government despite securing 105 seats in the last Assembly election.

26 November 2020||Pune,||GenePath Diagnostics wins Rs. 2.5 crore grant||The city-based GenePath Diagnostics, a next-generation diagnostics company, has won the prestigious United States–India Science and Technology Endowment Fund (USISTEF) grant of Rs. 2.5 crore to develop a cost-effective and highly sensitive mass-scale processing platform for the detection of HPV (Human Papilloma Virus), which is said to be the chief cause of cervical cancer. GenePath will develop the product over the next two years, said a statement released by the firm. The objective of the platform is to help detect pathogenic HPV strains from self-collected samples in low-resource, rural areas to help bring down mortality rates while reducing the burden on the country’s healthcare infrastructure. Dr. Nikhil Phadke, founder and chief scientific officer of GenePath Diagnostics, said, “Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer among Indian women, and one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in developing countries. The detection of HPV is widely accepted as a cervical cancer screening tool but strategies to implement it as a large-scale screening platform are limited by cost, social and healthcare barriers. To enable the widespread detection of HPV and typing for cervical cancer screening, it is necessary to have a point-of-care approach that can enhance the applicability, acceptance, and convenience of cervical cancer screening amongst the masses.” ‘Second-largest killer’ Dr. Phadke said that the virus was the second-largest killer of women from cancer, impacting 5,70,000 women globally every year with India having the most cases of any country in the world (97,000 cases and 63,000 fatalities in 2019). GenePath’s state-of-the-art clinical laboratory in Pune will be overseeing the platform design, project management, system integration and clinical validation of each component. The governments of the United States (through the State Department) and India (through the Department of Science & Technology) had jointly established the USISTEF for the promotion of activities that lead to innovation and entrepreneurship through the application of science and technology. The aim of the fund is to support and foster joint applied R&D to generate public good through the commercialisation of technology developed through sustained partnerships between U.S. and Indian researchers and entrepreneurs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/genepath-diagnostics-wins-rs-25-crore-grant/article33181505.ece

26 November 2020||Wilmington,||America is back and ready to lead the world, says Joe Biden||President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced a slate of veteran diplomats and policy-makers who will make up his national security and foreign policy team, saying: “America is back, ready to lead the world.” Mr. Biden, 78, presented his picks for Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, Homeland Security Secretary, intelligence chief, UN Ambassador and climate change envoy. “These public servants will restore America's global leadership and moral leadership,” Mr. Biden said as the six men and women stood behind him wearing face-masks. Mr. Biden said that after he is inaugurated on January 20 and Donald Trump leaves the White House, the U.S. will “once again sit at the head of the table, ready to confront our adversaries and not reject our allies”. “It is a team that reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it,” he said in a jab at President Trump’s go-it-alone ‘America First’ policies. Setbacks to Trump Mr. Biden’s remarks came after Mr. Trump suffered further setbacks in his efforts to overturn the results of the election with unsubstantiated claims of fraud. Pennsylvania and Nevada certified the November 3 election results on Tuesday, a day after the State of Michigan did so, a move which triggered the General Services Administration (GSA) to launch the transition process. As more members of his Republican Party came out demanding an end to the impasse, Mr. Trump signed off on the GSA move, effectively admitting defeat. But the President on Tuesday tweeted a picture of himself in the Oval Office with the caption “I concede NOTHING!!!!!” The 74-year-old Mr. Trump later attended a traditional Thanksgiving turkey-pardoning event at the White House. He appeared to indirectly address the election, saying: “I say America First — shouldn't go away from that.” ‘Coalition builder’ The GSA determination gives Mr. Biden access to classified information and will allow his aides to coordinate with officials on addressing the worsening coronavirus pandemic. “We're already working out meeting with the COVID team in the White House... The outreach has been sincere,” Mr. Biden told NBC in his first TV interview since winning the presidency. The slate that Mr. Biden unveiled included veterans of the Barack Obama administration and signalled a return to traditional U.S. diplomacy and multilateralism. Antony Blinken, Mr. Biden's choice for Secretary of State, said the U.S. cannot solve global problems on its own. “We need to be working with other countries.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/america-is-back-and-ready-to-lead-the-world-says-joe-biden/article33181146.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Trump challenge showed cracks in election system||As President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election have steadily disintegrated, the country appears to have escaped a doomsday scenario in the campaign’s epilogue: since November 3, there have been no tanks in the streets or widespread civil unrest, no brazen intervention by the judiciary or a partisan State legislature. Joe Biden’s obvious victory has withstood Mr. Trump’s peddling of conspiracy theories and his campaign of groundless lawsuits. In the end — and the post-election stand-off instigated by Mr. Trump and his party is truly nearing its end — the President’s attack on the election wheezed to an anti-climax. It was marked not by dangerous new political convulsions but by a letter from an obscure Trump-appointed bureaucrat, Emily Murphy of the General Services Administration, authorising the process of formally handing over the government to Mr. Biden. For now, the country appears to have avoided a ruinous breakdown of its electoral system. Next time, Americans might not be so lucky. Mr. Trump’s mission to subvert the election has exposed deep cracks in the edifice of American democracy and opened the way for future disruption. With the most amateurish of efforts, Mr. Trump managed to freeze the passage of power for most of a month. He never came close to achieving his goal: key State officials resisted his entreaties to disenfranchise huge numbers of voters, and judges all but laughed his legal team out of court. Ben Ginsberg, the most prominent Republican election lawyer of his generation, said he doubted any future candidates would attempt to replicate Mr. Trump’s precise approach, because it has been so unsuccessful. Few candidates and election lawyers, Mr. Ginsberg suggested, would regard Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell — the public faces of Mr. Trump’s litigation — as the authors of an ingenious new playbook. “If in a few months, we look back and see that this Trump strategy was just an utter failure, then it’s not likely to be copied,” Mr. Ginsberg said. “But the system was stress-tested as never before.” Vague provisions That test, he said, revealed enough vague provisions and holes in American election law to make a crisis all too plausible. He pointed in particular to the lack of uniform standards for the timely certification of elections by State authorities, and the uncertainty about whether State legislatures had the power to appoint their own electors in defiance of the popular vote. The 2020 election, he said, “should be a call for some consideration of those issues”. Yet even without precipitating a full-blown constitutional crisis, Mr. Trump has already shattered the long-standing norm that a defeated candidate should concede quickly and gracefully. He and his allies also rejected the long-standing convention that the news media should declare a winner. The next Republican candidate to lose a close election may find some voters expecting him or her to mimic Mr. Trump’s conduct, and if a Democrat were to adopt the same tactics, the GOP would have no standing to complain. Still more important, legal and political experts said, is the way Mr. Trump identified perilous pressure points within the system. Those vulnerabilities, they said, could be manipulated to destabilising effect by someone else, in a closer election.  Indeed, Mr. Trump managed to intrude on normal election procedures in several States. He summoned Michigan Republican leaders to the Oval Office as his allies floated the idea of appointing pro-Trump electors from the State, which Mr. Biden carried by more than 150,000 votes. And he inspired an onslaught from the right against Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, who declined to affirm Mr. Trump’s false claims of ballot tampering. Though Mr. Raffensperger oversaw a fair election, both of Georgia’s Republican Senators, channelling the President, called for his resignation.Ny times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-challenge-showed-cracks-in-election-system/article33181152.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Bhutan establishes formal ties with Germany||Bhutan announced on Wednesday that it had established diplomatic relations with Germany, increasing the restricted number of capitals that Thimphu has formal ties with to 53 states and the EU. The move, which was announced at an “Exchange of Verbal Notes ceremony” in Delhi by Bhutan’s Ambassador to India Major General Vetsop Namgyel and Germany’s Ambassador Walter Lindner, was described by the German Foreign Office as a “special day” and a “rare” event. “With the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two Ambassadors expressed the desire to further deepen the friendship and cooperation between the two countries,” said the Bhutanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In an article on its website, the German Federal Foreign office credited Bhutan’s current Prime Minister with the decision. “The government of Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering, in office since November 2018, has continued to cautiously open up the country — leading to the decision to establish diplomatic relations with Germany,” the release said, adding that Germany did not plan to set up an Embassy in Thimphu at present, and would conduct its relations through its Embassy in Delhi from “across the border”. Bhutan and Germany also maintain Honorary Consulates in each other’s capitals. Official sources in New Delhi said the government had “noted” the development. “We are aware that the two countries already established consular relations in July 2000. Germany is an important development partner of Bhutan. This is a further step on that path,” they said. Since 1949, when Bhutan first signed a friendship agreement with India, which kept the two countries closely engaged on all foreign policy issues, Bhutan has been historically cautious about establishing ties with other countries. First election Until 2007, when Bhutan conducted its first election, it had formal relations with just 22 countries, mostly donor countries like Japan, Australia and several Nordic countries. It also made a firm decision not to open ties with any of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, despite many requests from them and in particular from the U.S. and neighbouring China. After the election of Prime Minister Jigme Thinley in 2008, however, the Bhutanese government rapidly increased its diplomatic forays, signing agreements with 31 countries in five years, possibly with a view to winning the election for a non-permanent seat election at the UNSC in 2013-14, which it eventually lost. The ties with Germany mark the first new diplomatic agreement made by Bhutan since March 2013, when it had established ties with Oman. “Even in the absence of diplomatic relations, Germany had been supporting Bhutan’s socio-economic development since the 1970s. More significantly, Bhutan continues to receive support from the European Union of which Germany is the largest contributor to the Union’s budget. People-to-people contacts between Bhutan and Germany have also increased over the years,” the Bhutanese MFA said in its statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bhutan-establishes-formal-ties-with-germany/article33181156.ece
26 November 2020||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong leader vows to restore political order||Hong Kong’s leader vowed on Wednesday to restore order to the city’s legislature and save its political system from “chaos”, in a key policy speech at a muted gathering of almost exclusively pro-Beijing lawmakers. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s annual policy address to the Legislative Council — postponed for more than a month after she was ordered to travel to mainland China for meetings with central government officials — outlines the administration’s plans for the city. Hong Kong is ruled under a ‘One Country, Two Systems’ model that allows it to retain a degree of autonomy and some freedoms that are denied to citizens on the authoritarian mainland. But while last year saw months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, a strict new national security law imposed by Beijing in June — as well as anti-pandemic measures limiting public gatherings — have meant Hong Kong’s streets have remained largely free from unrest. “One of our urgent priorities is to restore Hong Kong’s constitutional order and political system from chaos,” Ms. Lam told the legislature, which for the first time had almost no Opposition presence after four pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified, and 15 of their colleagues resigned en masse in protest. “Hong Kong has experienced multiple blows which are unprecedented,” she added, citing the social unrest, shrinking economy, pandemic and acts that “endangered national security”. Local media captured officials nodding and apparently snoozing during the lengthy speech, while some were seen checking stock prices and playing Sudoku on their phones. Ms. Lam said her government would introduce bills to “enhance the oath-taking” by civil servants and to “enhance the electoral system”, though details were unclear.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-leader-vows-to-restore-political-order/article33181144.ece
26 November 2020||Islamabad,||Pakistan’s lonely jumbo Kaavan packs trunk for Cambodia||With music, treats and balloons, friends of Pakistan’s only Asian elephant threw a farewell party for the creature ahead of its relocation to Cambodia following years of campaigning by animal rights activists. The plight of Kaavan, an overweight, 35-year-old bull elephant, has drawn international condemnation and highlighted the woeful state of Islamabad’s zoo, where conditions are so bad that a judge in May ordered all the animals to be moved. Kaavan is set to be flown to a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia on Sunday, said Saleem Shaikh, a spokesman for Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change, following months of veterinary care and a special training regime to habituate the elephant to a huge metal crate he will travel in. Kaavan’s plight was given a boost over the years by American pop icon Cher, who publicly campaigned for the elephant’s relocation. Zoo officials have in the past denied Kaavan was kept in substandard conditions or chained, claiming instead the creature was pining for a new mate after his partner died in 2012. But Kaavan’s behaviour — including signs of distress such as continual head-bobbing — raised concerns of mental illness.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/paks-lonely-jumbo-packs-trunk-for-cambodia/article33181157.ece

In a congratulatory message, Mr. Xi told Mr. Biden that “healthy and stable” relations were “the common expectation of the international community”, according to a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. “We hope the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, will focus on cooperation, control differences and promote healthy and stable development of Chinese-U.S. relations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/xi-hopes-for-win-win-ties-with-biden/article33181142.ece
26 November 2020||Bangkok,||Thai protesters call on king to give up fortune||Thai pro-democracy protesters gathered in Bangkok on Wednesday as the police summoned 12 of their leaders to answer charges of royal defamation, the first use of the draconian law in almost three years. At least a thousand demonstrators — many brandishing the yellow toy ducks that have become a symbol of the movement — took to the streets near the headquarters of the Siam Commercial Bank to protest at the secrecy surrounding King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s wealth. The king is the major shareholder in the bank. Thailand has for months been rocked by youth-led protests demanding a new constitution, reform of the untouchable monarchy, and for Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha to resign.    Royal assets The focus of Wednesday’s protest is the secrecy surrounding the royal finances. Soon after coming to power following his father’s death in 2016, the new king took control of the Crown Property Bureau, which has assets in banks, companies and prime real estate. The bureau’s board was previously headed by the Finance Minister in an arrangement that gave a sheen of public oversight to a trust some experts estimate is worth $30-$60 billion.  On the eve of the Wednesday’s protest, 12 leaders received police orders to come for questioning over allegations of royal defamation. Thailand has one of the harshest lese-majeste laws in the world. It is routinely interpreted to include any criticism of the monarchy — including content posted or shared on social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thailand-protesters-rally-against-secrecy-over-royal-finances/article33181148.ece
26 November 2020||Islamabad,||Pakistan Cabinet for strict punishment to rapists||To combat rising cases of sexual attacks on women and children in Pakistan, the federal Cabinet has approved in-principle two anti-rape ordinances aimed at handing out exemplary punishment, including chemical castration and hanging, to rapists, according to a media report. A Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad on Tuesday, also decided to change the definition of rape, the Dawn News reported on Wednesday. The Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance, 2020, and the Pakistan Penal Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, would be finalised in a week to be promulgated, Information Minister Shibli Faraz said.  Hailing the “big decision”, Mr. Faraz said the ordinances change the basic definition of rape and suggest severe punishment for gang-rape. For the first time in the history of Pakistan, the definition of rape has been changed by incorporating “transgender” and “gang-rape” in it, the report said. The proposed laws also prohibit the controversial two-finger test performed on rape survivors. The World Health Organisation has already declared the test as unscientific, medically unnecessary and unreliable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-cabinet-for-strict-punishment-to-rapists/article33181154.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Trump plans to pardon his former NSA||President Donald Trump has told aides that he plans to pardon his former National Security Adviser (NSA) Michael Flynn and that it is one of a string of pardons he plans to issue before leaving office, a person familiar with the discussions said on Tuesday. Flynn, a retired Army Lieutenant-General, twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat during the presidential transition in late 2016 and early 2017. He was the only former White House official to plead guilty in the inquiry led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia’s election interference. In May, the Justice Department sought to withdraw its charges against Flynn. That move has since been tied up in federal court, challenged by the judge who presided over Flynn’s case, Emmet G. Sullivan. Flynn, 61, served just 24 days as the NSA before the President fired him in February 2017 for lying about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. at the time, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn changed his legal team last year and began seeking to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming he never lied to investigators and was the target in January 2017 of what his lawyers in court papers called an “ambush-interview” by FBI agents seeking to entrap him. He has since become a hero figure on the pro-Trump right, portrayed as a decorated patriot victimised by the politically motivated Russia “hoax” investigation of Mr. Trump.Ny Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-plans-to-pardon-his-former-nsa/article33181153.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Where the lotus meets two leaves||Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s high-profile visit to Chennai last week brought to an end the developing discourse on whether the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) would remain an ally of his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for the Tamil Nadu Assembly election slated for April-May next year. The AIADMK’s coordinator-Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator-Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the men who matter in the party, used Mr. Shah’s presence to declare that their party would go to the poll along with the BJP and others. In contrast to former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s approach of dumping partners once elections were over, the two leaders retained their allies even after a disastrous performance during the 2019 Lok Sabha election and faced the polls to the local bodies together later. Signs of discord Yet, on a host of issues at least in the last six months, there were visible signs of discord between the AIADMK and the BJP. The differences between the two parties were obvious on the subject of the three-language formula, the abolition of the free electricity scheme for farmers, the denial of permission for the procession of Vinayaka idols, and regarding restrictions on the BJP State president L. Murugan’s ongoing ‘Vetrivel Yatra’ covering six abodes of Lord Muruga. The AIADMK never forgets to assert its “principled opposition” to the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for undergraduate medical courses, despite the test being held in the State since 2017. Given the fact that Muslims and Christians, as per the 2011 Census, constitute 11.98% of the State’s population, the question was also raised whether the AIADMK, whose vote share went down to about 18% last year from about 40% in 2016, should ignore the minorities’ votes for the sake of its alliance with the BJP. After the Bihar Assembly election outcome, several commentators began to predict that just as the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar has become the BJP’s junior partner, the AIADMK too would meet a similar fate, should it continue its relationship. Not many in the Dravidian party have forgotten how their party’s image was hit by searches carried out by Central agencies at Fort St. George, the seat of power of the State government, or on the residences of Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, for one reason or the other, in the period immediately after Jayalalithaa’s death. There is a growing view within the AIADMK that the present government led by Mr. Palaniswami, which began its innings in February 2017 with several handicaps, regained much of its lost ground by late 2019. Now, there is “no feeling of negativity” towards the State government, which got appreciation from the Home Minister when he came here. It was another matter that in his visit to Chennai in July 2018, Mr. Shah described Tamil Nadu as one of the States “most affected by corruption.” The Palaniswami regime’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and decision of giving 7.5% horizontal quota for admission to medical courses for students of government schools have led to many senior leaders in the party entertaining the notion that the party would do well at the hustings without most of its allies including the BJP. At the same time, there are reasons for the two parties to continue their alliance. The absence of a charismatic leader of the stature of M.G. Ramachandran (MGR) or Jayalalithaa has left the party with very few options. The AIADMK is seen by its adversaries as giving back its due to the national party for enabling it to complete its term. What should not also be overlooked is its support to the BJP-led government at the Centre on crucial occasions such as the no-confidence motion in July 2018, the dilution of Article 370 in August 2019, and the adoption of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill four months later. That the national party would be in power at the Centre for three and a half more years would have been factored in by the AIADMK leadership at the time of its announcement of the alliance. Ever since the 1977 Assembly election marked the AIADMK’s emergence as one of the two principal political players of the State, the other being the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), these two parties generally contested the polls in the company of allies, major or minor. This was despite the two bagging collectively, on an average, 60% of the total votes polled in all these years. Jayalalithaa’s experiment in 2016 of fielding her party’s nominees in all the 234 Assembly seats should be considered an aberration. In Assembly elections over the last 20 years, the DMK aligned itself with the BJP once (2001) and with the Congress thrice (2006, 2011 and 2016). This time too, the situation is not going to be any different. The BJP in Tamil Nadu Notwithstanding little support from empirical data for any claim on the BJP’s growing base, there is a perception in the political and academic circles that the party is, of late, creating a “tangible impact” in the State, which has, so far, refused to provide substantial political space to religion-centric parties. This has coincided with the innings of Dr. Murugan as the BJP’s State president. That he hails from the Arunthathiyar community, which is considered more backward than many other constituents of the Scheduled Castes in the State, is also contributing positively to the party’s image. Perhaps taking cue from MGR’s formula, the BJP is aggressively positioning itself as an anti-DMK force, as reflected in Mr. Shah’s severe criticism of the DMK. This can complement the base of the AIADMK, known to be pro-religion including Hindu ritualism. Otherwise, it would not get the benefit of support from those who would prefer an anti-DMK political formation to others. Even as the BJP aims at becoming a big player in Tamil Nadu, it should not forget that apart from the symbol of ‘two leaves’ and charisma of MGR and Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK has grown over the years on the strength of welfarism, identity politics, social justice and avoidance of the politics of demonising any community. ramakrishnan.t@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/where-the-lotus-meets-two-leaves/article33181136.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Jobs, exports and the trade pacts link||India’s economy contracted by 23.9% in the first quarter of 2020-21. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Indian economy will further contract by 10% in the July-September quarter. This is technically defined as a recession by economists. India is in an economic recession for the first time in its independent history. ‘India is in a recession’ means very little to the average Indian. The headline numbers too matter little to most people. The average Indian ‘feels’ the economic despair when her older child has lost his job or when her younger one cannot find a job despite her impressive educational qualifications. She ‘sees’ the pall of gloom when many workshops in her town are closed or when trucks remain idle or when trains do not run or when restaurants do not have customers. Jobs are the first casualty Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the slowing economy in 2018-19 and 2019-20. Unemployment had reached a 45-year high. Then, in March 2020, COVID-19 struck India and a total national lockdown was announced. By one estimate, more than 2 crore people lost their jobs during the lockdown. They included all kinds of jobs — regular salaried, non-contractual, casual, daily wage, and self-employment. When jobs were lost, incomes were lost too. Millions of people found that they did not have a roof over their heads or money to feed their families. In any country, the ultimate economic test is, are there sufficient jobs, incomes and livelihoods for all in the workforce? The single biggest challenge confronting India today is jobs. When people are poor, hungry and desperate, any job will be a blessing. The job that requires hard, manual work and pays the lowest daily wage is the work provided under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. During the seven-month lockdown period, there were 11 crore people who asked for work under MGNREGA. That is 20 times more than the total number of persons employed by all the companies listed on the stock exchange. The only meaningful conversation about the economy that we ought to have is how to recover the jobs that were lost and create new well-paying jobs. Let us suppose that the government makes available Rs. 10 lakh as a loan to four companies for capital investment. The first company, a steel manufacturing company, will create one new job with this amount. The second, an automobile manufacturer, will create three new jobs. The third, a producer of leather goods, will create 70 new jobs. And the fourth, an apparel and garment maker, will create 240 new jobs including 80 for women (Economic Survey 2016-17). Where the jobs are Large numbers of good quality jobs can be created only in sectors that are labour intensive, and where India has a comparative advantage, such as apparel, leather goods, value-added agriculture and so on. These job-creating sectors depend not only on the domestic market but, significantly, on export markets. More than one-half of the leather goods and one-third of the apparel produced in India are exported to other countries. India, therefore, needs to find more export markets, nurture them, and sustain them amid intense global competition. Merchandise exports also create supporting jobs in warehousing, transport, stevedoring, container stations, shipping, ship chandling, ports and export financing. It is therefore very important to encourage and incentivise exports to be able to create many new jobs in the country. A recent research study by Arvind Subramanian and Prof. Shoumitro Chatterjee shows how exports were the most significant factor that drove the Indian economy in the ‘boom years’ of 2003-2012 (https://bit.ly/39fRNCX). Contrary to popular perception, Subramanian and Chatterjee have shown that during the period since 1995, India did exceptionally well not only in exports of services such as information technology but also in the exports of manufactured goods and other merchandise. India was the third fastest growing exporter of manufactured goods in this period with 12% annual growth, after Vietnam and China. There is irrefutable evidence that India’s new trade policy, unveiled first in 1991-92, and taken forward by every subsequent government until 2014, has paid rich economic dividends in generating jobs, incomes and consumption. Exports and agreements Unfortunately, despite the “Make in India” hype, export volumes have languished in the last six years. Merchandise goods exports were $314 billion in 2013-14 and remained stagnant for the next five years touching $313 billion in 2018-19. The reason for this (other than the disruption of export supply chains due to demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax) is the complete reversal in the direction of India’s foreign trade policy with higher tariffs, non-tariff barriers, quantitative limits, the return of licensing, border country restrictions and the appreciating value of the rupee. For nearly two decades, the countries of the world invested in a rule-based trading order. The age of trade agreements — both bilateral and multilateral — was born. There were more winners than losers because of trade agreements. Some historic trade agreements were the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR). Half-hearted and hesitant agreements like the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) failed. Whether we like it or not, the harsh truth is that exports are linked to trade agreements. The member-countries of a trade agreement promote trade among themselves with easy rules but restrict trade with non-members with hard rules. Many countries rushed to conclude bilateral agreements (free trade agreements or FTA) because they realised the benefits to members. Non-members suffered. Break down the wall It is true that FTA provisions were also misused by some countries to question the foreign investment policies and tax policies of other countries, usually recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) like India. Purely trade and commercial disputes were dragged to international arbitral tribunals on the pretext of violating FTA provisions. India decided to keep FTAs in abeyance until we could agree with our partner countries, on a model FTA that built in safeguards against abuse. Unfortunately, under the current government, that has turned into an anti-FTA policy and has further metamorphosed into an anti-free trade policy. To put it bluntly, we are just a few steps away from full protectionism that kept India a closed and struggling economy for three decades. Decades ago, Manmohan Singh, in his doctoral thesis at Oxford University, pleaded for India to shed its export pessimism. Today, we need to shed exaggerated fears of trade agreements. India cannot ‘protect’ its domestic industry with high trade barriers while aspiring for bilateral trade treaties to promote exports. This ‘have the cake and eat it too’ approach is naive and detrimental. Most manufacturing today has a long supply chain that cuts across many countries. To be able to export goods, India must import raw materials or equipment or technology from other countries in the supply chain. Hence, we must re-learn to engage with other countries and negotiate favourable trade agreements through the bilateral and multilateral routes. Otherwise, countries bound by trade agreements among themselves will shut the doors on India’s exports. Besides, it is common sense that no country will allow import of Indian goods and services unless that country is able to export its goods and services to India on reasonable and fair terms. The art of survival in a fiercely competitive world is engagement and negotiation. India’s economy is in a shambles. Exports are one of the main engines to revive economic growth and create many new jobs. Subramanian and Chatterjee estimate that India has the immediate opportunity to export goods worth $60 billion worth in labour intensive sectors which can then create lakhs of new jobs. To revive exports, India needs greater and frictionless access to global markets. Protectionism and autarky will take us back several decades. Wisdom lies in learning from the past, being smart and resilient in the present and securing our prosperity in the future. P.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Refining trade union strategies to strike a chord||Ten central trade unions (CTUs) have called for a nation-wide strike on November 26, 2020 to condemn what they consider to be the anti-people, and anti-labour economic policies of the government. This follows strikes in the coal and defence sectors protesting privatisation and the corporatisation policies of the government. It is essential to understand as to why the central trade unions have decided to go on strike today. Codes and flaws With the introduction of economic reforms concretely since 1991, employers and the global financial institutions have been lobbying for labour market and structural reforms. The reform processes gained momentum since 2015 and the National Democratic Alliance government has enacted four Labour Codes in the last two years. The details of the labour law reforms have been described and critically analysed in the columns of this daily. The Codes are based on the fundamental unproven premise that labour laws and inspection system are obstacles in attracting investment, and, hence the government must promote a cheaper and flexible labour market. The Codes do extend some labour rights such as universal minimum wage, statutory recognition of trade unions, formalisation of employment contracts, and social security to gig and platform economy workers. However, they also afford substantial flexibility to the employers in terms of easy hire and fire, freedom to hire contract labour and unregulated fixed-term-employment, etc. The Codes have also considerably redefined the concept and practice of labour inspection system by diluting it. The Codes and state retrenchment in the industrial sector and fiscal conservatism — especially in the context of higher levels of unemployment — along with stubborn inflation have created tremendous insecurity among workers. Migrant and informal workers underwent woeful experiences during the COVID-19 period, and trade unions as well as commentators perceive that the state has not provided adequate relief to workers. Crisis and reforms The central government and several State governments had chosen the COVID-19 crisis-ridden period as an “opportune time” to enact labour law reforms having far-reaching adverse consequences for labour rights and structural reforms. It is galling to note that the COVID-19 period has witnessed perhaps a maximum amount of legal and extra-legal measures issued by the state. In such a context, trade unions have six options to confront or soften these measures — viz. social dialogue, political lobbying, political confrontation through Opposition parties, legal action by approaching the judiciary, seek the International Labour Organization’s intervention, and direct industrial action. The central government, as per trade unions, did not conduct an effective and sustaining social dialogue, though it held a few symbolic parleys with them. At the State level, social dialogue institutions are largely absent or weak. The last Indian Labour Conference, a tripartite social dialogue body, was held in 2015 (https://bit.ly/39f01eT). The government has dismissed social dialogue as being ineffectual and even frustrating. The Central trade unions, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, have made numerous representations to the government on their demands and suggestions not only relating to labour market reforms but also on tackling of COVID-19 crises. Who else is better suited to advise the government than the workers’ organisations on these issues? Trade unions contend that many of their suggestions have not been incorporated in the Codes and the COVID-19 relief measures. The whole political exercise of the passage of the Farm Bills and the three Labour Codes during the COVID-19 period smacks of “un-democracy” as Parliament did not witness “healthy discussions”. The boycott by the Opposition parties ended up serving the cause of reforms, and they wittingly or otherwise became partners in the reform exercises. At any rate, the Opposition parties are waging their own battles of their relevance and incurably divided and pathetically irrelevant as a significant political force. Seeking assistance The judiciary seems to be the only source of hope in these times of “institutional corrosion”, aided and abetted by right-wing politics. Though the Supreme Court of India did not respond quickly to provide relief to migrant workers, it has struck down the Gujarat government’s amendment of the Factories Act. Unions must shed their judicio-phobia and approach it provided they have strong legal grounds to challenge reforms introduced by Central or State governments. Trade unions, out of their patriotic mindset, do not use extensively the complaints mechanism created by the International Labour Organization for fear of washing dirty linen in the global spaces; but they did seek ILO intervention recently. But the ILO’s intervention in May 2020 only provided a temporary respite to trade unions as the government did what it has been doing. So, trade unions are left with the only option — of demonstrative “industrial action” followed by sustained protest actions. It is in this context, that the central trade unions (except the BMS and its allies) have these demands (https://bit.ly/3pYZq6Q): direct cash transfer of Rs. 7,500 per month for all non-income tax-paying families; 10 kg free ration per person per month to all the needy; expansion of MGNREGA to provide 200 days of work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages; extension of employment guarantee to urban areas; withdrawal of all anti-farmer laws and anti-worker labour codes; a halt to privatisation; protection of government employment; restoration of old pension schemes, etc. The demands reflect disappointment and even hurt and anger experienced by the working class not only during the time of COVID-19 but also for events of the last three decades. The Codes are set to rule the industrial relations system for long unless the government changes. This strike, as an individual event alone, is a signal to the larger society of the concerns of workers. Hence, it is legitimate but such action alone will not change the Codes. Trade unions must explore other avenues such as seeking the ILO’s intervention, judicial action and social dialogue. There is no alternative to social dialogue in a pluralistic democracy which all the parties in the industrial relations system must make effective use of and make suitable amendments to the Codes to aid both ease of doing business and promote labour rights. This strike is a reminder of this potential, positive reconstruction of laws. K.R.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||We don’t need no EdTech control||With schools being closed for nearly eight months due to the pandemic, parents are worried about their children’s education. Some parents have seen this period as an opportunity to enrol their children in classes or courses where they can gather new skills or deepen their learning in mathematics, science and computer science. My eight-year-old daughter has asked me a lot of questions on life, death, God, bacteria, viruses, vaccines and immune systems over these months. I have spent some time looking up information in the fields of philosophy and biology to answer her questions.  New EdTech (portmanteau of education and technology) companies, which feast on the fear of parents that their children will be left out of the ‘race’, have also seen this period as an opportunity to do aggressive marketing. They claim that children will earn millions of U.S. dollars in the future if they learn with the help of these companies. But do people know what children should study at a young age? What kind of computer science education is appropriate for them? Too much, too soon It is true that computers are part of our daily lives. Children are curious to know how a few semiconductor chips are able to deliver such powerful experiences, just as they are curious about other facts of life such as how the human body works, how airplanes fly, or how governments are formed. While children broadly know how some things work, they don’t know how exactly these things work. They take age-appropriate courses to learn the finer details. That is part of learning. However, what we see with computer science is that children are being fast forwarded into learning about aspects of programming languages, data structures and algorithms. Some are even being taught to develop mobile applications, games, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions to be followed in order to solve a complex task. Algorithms are being taught to children in a more interactive, sometimes humorous, way by websites like Scratch.Mit.Edu and Code.org. There is some research to suggest that children who solve problems by breaking it down into steps become better problem solvers. However, teaching them programming syntax or programming constructs or data structures for efficiently managing data is definitely not appropriate for their age. And asking them to develop mobile apps is again going overboard because most apps require knowledge of real-world needs that children don’t have. Computer science doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Some areas like theoretical computer science, operating systems and networking are focused on improving computer systems, but a lot of the work also involves identifying new areas of application for which children need more knowledge of the world around them and how different disciplines work and interact. AI involves search and logical deductions to optimise an objective function so that computers can pretend to be intelligent. Machine learning is used when the normal rule-based systems are difficult to manage manually and we need an automated way to create these rules. Both AI and machine learning require an application domain and are not just hammers that can produce intelligence automatically. Machine learning even requires manual tagging of classes by humans and intelligence in figuring out a set of features in the domain. While it is easy to get caught up with the latest jargon, their utility and mastery also involves knowledge of new domains, knowledge of what needs automation and how that can be automated. Just because computer systems are becoming powerful doesn’t mean that children can easily jump on the bandwagon without much knowledge of the rest of the world. Back to the basics Instead, more children could learn the basics of computing and what it means to develop an algorithm to solve a task. For instance, they can learn algorithms to prepare an omelette. For the sake of satisfying their curiosity, they could learn how different parts of a computer system operate. More important, children need to know how to surf the Internet in a safe and secure environment. Children have plenty to learn in science and social studies, for which the ability to read and write is far more essential, rather than being trained as app developers and innovators. This will enable them to be more knowledgeable. Perhaps there is no better way to do this than by reading literature.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Transition troubles||After weeks of ferment in post-election politics, the U.S. appears to be limping towards a denouement that, at last, allows Democratic President-elect Joe Biden to assume administrative transition responsibilities and also announce his plans for populating his Cabinet with a series of high-profile appointments. While the 80 million Americans who voted for Mr. Biden will heave a collective sigh of relief at the break in the logjam, the weeks ahead are still fraught with potential potholes and speed breakers that could hobble the entry and early performance of the new government from January 2021. Potholes and speed breakers First, outgoing President Donald Trump has given hardly any indication that he accepts the fact that he is, indeed, outgoing, emboldened, no doubt, by the fact that he garnered nearly 10 million votes more than his tally in the 2016 election. Numerous lawsuits from the Trump team have challenged the veracity of the vote-tallying process, primarily an attack on mail-in voting adopted on a massive scale for the 2020 election owing to the pandemic. Although most of these have been knocked down in the courts, Mr. Trump has vowed to fight on and has continued to hit out on Twitter at what he calls the election “hoax.” Second, the Biden transition team is yet to discover the full extent of institutional resistance to change from the Trump paradigm to the post-Obama liberal ethos for governance, whatever that will look like. Consider the case of the General Services Administration, a federal agency whose sign off is required recognising the winner of the presidential election. Its chief, Emily Murphy, prevaricated for a time that some considered longer than necessary before issuing an “ascertainment” recognising the “apparent successful candidate” in the election. How many federal government officials who support Mr. Trump, perhaps even his conspiracy theories about Democrats stealing the 2020 election, will make their reluctance to cooperate with the Biden team known in the days ahead? How much will that dent the incoming administration’s ambitions for its first 100 days? Third, Mr. Biden needs to tread that thin line between returning the U.S. to its pre-eminent position as a leading global power, whose influence in domestic and world politics is driven by a liberal, inclusive ethos, and being a leader who does not repudiate the Trump paradigm and its focus on putting ‘America First’ entirely. Too many U.S. middle class and working-class voters have spoken eloquently over the past two elections on this subject to ignore. Too many of them have expressed dissatisfaction with the classic progressive paradigm of the Obama years to return to business as usual. Bridging the chasm It is this critical question surrounding the quality and tenor of governance under the Biden White House that will make or break the future of the American Dream. The key to the mammoth task of building a nuanced agenda that bridges the chasm between the two Americas that exists presently is the choice of leaders that Mr. Biden picks to serve in his Cabinet. Thus far the names announced include Antony Blinken, senior foreign policy specialist known to Mr. Biden for around 20 years, as prospective for Secretary of State; attorney Alejandro Mayorkas for Homeland Security chief; senior diplomat Linda Thomas-Greenfield for U.S. Ambassador to the UN; Obama-era White House official Jake Sullivan for National Security Adviser; Avril Haines, former Deputy Director of the CIA, for Director of National Intelligence; former Secretary of State John Kerry for Special Envoy on Climate Change; and possibly — but not announced yet — Michele Flournoy for Secretary of Defence. Given that this selection for the Biden Cabinet appears, prima facie, to be drawn from channels within the Democratic Party firmament and Washington nexus, it is vital that Mr. Biden strives even harder to break with past policies to build an America that speaks to the 73 million citizens who voted for his opponent. narayan@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/transition-troubles/article33181137.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Moment of reckoning||The Congress has set the ball rolling for organisational elections in a period of great uncertainty in the party. The Central Election Authority of the party hopes to have a session of the All India Congress Committee by February 2021 that will elect the Congress Working Committee and possibly a new president. The post of the president has been vacant after Rahul Gandhi resigned in the aftermath of the Lok Sabha election debacle in 2019. Sonia Gandhi filled in as interim president but the leadership vacuum has aggravated the morbidities of the party since then. In an extremely difficult political environment, the party has been drifting, aimless and rudderless. Its performance in the recent Bihar election was abysmal, made stark by the fact that Mr. Gandhi chose to go on a vacation in the midst of the campaign. Earlier it lost power in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and almost lost it in Rajasthan. The edifice that held the party together from 2004 to 2014 when it was in power at the Centre has crumbled. Even the personnel that reinforced it are moving out. With Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel out of the picture, and Manmohan Singh, A.K. Antony, and Ms. Gandhi herself old or weak, the party is staring at the unsettling end of an era. Many leaders of the party have begun to air their concerns publicly. They have not yet challenged the leadership of the Gandhi dynasty, but it is now entirely possible that they will. Dynastic leadership is never desirable, but Mr. Gandhi has added to the party’s woes by being an uneasy heir. By refusing to hold office and cede control at the same time, Mr. Gandhi has cornered the Congress into a gridlock. Organisational elections could be an occasion to breathe some life into the party. It will also be an opportunity for the party to re-examine the role of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The dynasty’s ability to function as a glue that binds conflicting personalities and thoughts has weakened along with its capacity to mobilise voters across the country. Mr. Gandhi’s lament that his hands are tied by the old guard of the party is no longer valid as an excuse for inaction. Even after an overhauling of the organisation, the Congress will have a long way to travel to get into fighting shape. At any rate, Mr. Gandhi should not hold the party hostage to his indecision. The organisational election is a moment of reckoning for the Congress and the dynasty at its helm . How the party manages its course from now on will have larger implications for national politics. It cannot allow itself to be defined merely by its opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party, and must formulate and articulate an alternative, inclusive, egalitarian vision of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/moment-of-reckoning/article33181123.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Cricket test||In a coronavirus-blighted year, Indian cricket gets into revival mode through the tour of Australia that formally commences with the first One Day International in Sydney on Friday. The recent Indian Premier League in the United Arab Emirates, was a high-profile starter that helped national icons and overseas legends shed their rust but international cricket is the real deal. India last played on March 2 at Christchurch’s Hagley Oval. On that day, the second Test against New Zealand concluded with the host winning by seven wickets to secure the series at 2-0. Since then it has been a long wait for sport to resume and while the virus lingers and the vaccine-race gifts hope, cricket is gingerly finding its feet. England hosted the West Indies and Pakistan and had limited-overs clashes against Australia, but in terms of stature, full-fledged contests featuring India and Australia have a stronger allure. Over the next eight weeks, the set of three ODIs, three Twenty20s and four Tests should frame a stirring template for the willow-game. During India’s last tour of Australia in the 2018-19 season, Virat Kohli’s men won the Test and ODI series besides drawing level in the Twenty20s. Since then much water has flowed down the Yarra and Australia is a stronger unit. Steve Smith and David Warner have returned following their ball-tampering controversy and Marnus Labuschagne is a star in the making. It is now India’s turn to deal with mighty absentees. Rohit Sharma, nursing a sore hamstring, will be missed in the limited-overs’ jousts, a realm he rules with panache. To further queer the pitch, the Mumbaikar looks doubtful for the subsequent Tests though he is in the squad. It could probably be a double-blow as India will miss Kohli in the last three Tests as the skipper will be taking paternity leave. Equally it presents an opportunity for the other talented batsmen in the Indian ranks to burnish their credentials. If in the distant past, cricketing reputations were earned in the West Indies, now Australia is the final yardstick. Sachin Tendulkar scored 100 international tons but his greatness was first revealed through a pulsating century at Perth in 1992 when he was just 18. In Rohit’s absence, K.L. Rahul will be the vice-captain in ODIs and Twenty20s and it is a chance for him to reiterate his potential while Ajinkya Rahane will helm India in the Tests once Kohli flies back. The visitors still have strong batting resources and also a menacing pace attack headlined by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. The stage is set, bio-bubbles will remain and though fans will return, stadiums will not be filled to capacity. As cricket embraces a semblance of normalcy, India taking on Australia is the perfect booster-shot. No matter which team comes up on top, fans are sure to be grateful for the cricketing action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/cricket-test/article33181124.ece

That proposal, it is perhaps needless to say, is the one which elaborates what is now known as the International Export Credits Scheme. There are practically two such schemes before the Conference, the one that of Meulen, a representative of Holland and the other that of Sir Marshall Reid who was one of our own delegates. The latter is indeed but a modification of the former so that it is necessary that we should be well acquainted with the former fully to appreciate the latter. We have not been able to set forth in full all the features of the Meulen scheme, but its essentials are summarised in Sir Marshall Reid’s scheme which we print elsewhere. The Meulen scheme proposes the constitution of an International Commission under the auspices of the League of Nations consisting of bankers and business men of international repute with power to appoint Sub-Commissions to exercise the Commission’s authority in participating countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-brussels-conference-from-an-editorial/article33181132.ece

Islamabad has rejected India’s offer of two mobile hospitals and refused to give clearance to four transport planes based in Calcutta which were loaded with relief supplies. The aircraft which are actually in the disaster area are British and American, not Pakistani. It seems that Islamabad actually turned down the request of the Governor of East Pakistan for helicopters and it is only now that Pakistan has asked for and immediately obtained our Government’s permission to fly aircraft over Indian territory to East Pakistan. Meanwhile, at Dacca the International Red Cross had to stop sending supplies because they were not being taken to the disaster area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/pakistans-failure-from-an-editorial/article33181133.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. allots Rs. 2,000-cr. for infra funding||The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the infusion of Rs. 6,000 crore as equity into a new debt platform to raise up to Rs. 1.1 lakh crore for financing infrastructure projects by 2025. Of the Rs. 6,000-crore equity to be injected by 2021-22, the Cabinet has approved Rs. 2,000 crore for disbursal this year subject to the funds being required. Stimulus measure Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the plan to provide equity capital to the debt platform sponsored by the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), as part of the last round of stimulus measures announced on November 12. “In view of the unprecedented financial situation and availability of limited fiscal space due to the prevailing COVID-19, the proposed amount may be disbursed only if there is readiness and demand for debt raising,” the government said in an official statement detailing the Cabinet’s decision. Stressing that the decision would strengthen India’s bond markets, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said that another Rs. 7,000 crore would be raised as equity for the debt platform, with the bond markets set to be tapped for Rs. 1 lakh crore. Global capital The Cabinet had asked the NIIF to take all necessary steps to use equity investments from domestic and global pension funds and sovereign wealth funds expeditiously. Ms Sitharaman had said earlier this week that several sovereign wealth funds had evinced interest in availing the tax concessions offered for them to invest in the country. “The NIIF’s infrastructure debt financing platform is expected to contribute almost Rs. 1 lakh crore in debt to the infrastructure sector over the next five years,” the government said. “This will act as a catalyst in attracting more investments into the infrastructure sector as envisaged in the National Infrastructure Pipeline,” it said, adding that this would help free up space for banks to lend to new greenfield projects. “It is expected that a well-capitalised, well-funded and well-governed NIIF debt platform can play a major role in infrastructure financing and development of bond market in India by acting as a AAA/AA-rated intermediary between the bond markets and infrastructure projects and companies,” the government observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-allots-rs-2000-cr-for-infra-funding/article33181115.ece
26 November 2020||COIMBATORE,||SIMA urges freeing viscose fibre from anti-dumping duty||The textile and clothing sector has urged the Centre to remove anti-dumping duty (ADD) on viscose fibre and address problems related to inverted duty structure in Man Made Fibre (MMF) segment for the industry to benefit from the recently announced Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Of the 50 products identified for the scheme, most of them contain viscose, said Ashwin Chandran, president, Southern India Mills’ Association (SIMA). India now has a negligible share in these items in the global market compared with Bangladesh and Vietnam. For instance, for women’s dresses made of artificial fibre, including viscose, India has 0.5% share in the global market. Share of Bangladesh is 7% and Vietnam’s 6.4%. Indian textile industry requires almost 6.34 lakh tonne of viscose fibre in FY20 and the fibre available for consumption from local capacities is 4.78 lakh tonne, he said. M. Senthil Kumar, former SIMA chairman, said since viscose fibre attracts anti-dumping duty ($0.103 to $0.512 a kg), textile industry imports viscose yarn which has only basic customs duty. Imports of viscose yarn are on the rise. Cotton, polyester, viscose and linen are the major fibres consumed in India. If the ADD on fibre is removed for viscose and linen local powerloom industry would get the yarn at a lower price.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sima-urges-freeing-viscose-fibre-from-anti-dumping-duty/article33181110.ece

26 November 2020||PARIS,||Barcelona coasts into the knockouts||Chelsea and Sevilla registered last-gasp wins to book a berth in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, while Martin Braithwaite netted a brace in Barcelona’s 4-0 victory at Dynamo Kiev as the Catalans too secured a place in the knockout rounds. Juventus joined Barcelona in qualifying from Group G but the Italian champion needed a stoppage-time header from substitute Alvaro Morata to beat Ferencvaros 2-1 in Turin and seal its progress. Albanian international Myrto Uzuni had put the Hungarians ahead before Ronaldo drilled home the equaliser before half-time. There was no Lionel Messi for Barcelona, with the Argentine rested for the trip to Ukraine, but Ronald Koeman’s side got the job done to make it four wins from four in Group G. All the goals came in the second half, with Sergino Dest opening the scoring before Danish striker Braithwaite added another and also converted a penalty to make it 3-0. Antoine Griezmann, on as a substitute, wrapped up the win on a night when young centre-back Oscar Mingueza, Brazilian midfielder Matheus Fernandes and teenage American winger Konrad de la Fuente were blooded in the Barcelona first team. Chelsea advanced from Group E after edging Rennes 2-1 in France. Olivier Giroud came off the bench to head home an injury-time winner after Serhou Guirassy had cancelled out Callum Hudson-Odoi’s breakaway opening goal. Sizeable crowd Last season’s Europa League winner Sevilla will not get to defend its trophy as it reached the last 16 of Europe’s elite competition with a 2-1 win over Krasnodar in Russia in a game played before a sizeable crowd. Ivan Rakitic’s strike had put the LaLiga side in front only for Brazilian Wanderson to equalise. However, Munir El Haddadi won it for Sevilla five minutes into added time. Sevilla and Chelsea were both on 10 points and Frank Lampard’s side goes to Spain next week, the winner securing top spot. Borussia Dortmund needs just one more point to qualify from Group F following a 3-0 win over Club Brugge as the prolific Haaland netted twice either side of a Jadon Sancho free-kick.  The results: Group E: Krasnodar 1 (Wanderson 56) lost to Sevilla 2 (Rakitic 4, El Haddadi 90+5); Rennes 1 (Guirassy 85) lost to Chelsea 2 (Hudson-Odoi 22, Giroud 90+1).   Group F: Borussia Dortmund 3 (Haaland 18 & 60, Sancho 45+1) bt Club Brugge 0; Lazio 3 (Immobile 3 & 55-pen, Parolo 22) bt Zenit St. Petersburg 1 (Dzyuba 25) .   Group G: Dynamo Kiev 0 lost to Barcelona 4 (Dest 52, Braithwaite 57 & 70-pen, Griezmann 90+2); Juventus 2 (Ronaldo 35, Morata 90+2) bt Ferencvaros 1 (Uzuni 19).   Group H: Manchester United 4 (Fernandes 7 & 19, Rashford 35-pen, James 90+2) bt Istanbul Basaksehir 1 (Turuc 75); PSG 1 (Neymar 11-pen) bt RB Leipzig 0 .

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Enjoy batting at five and keeping: Rahul||With Rohit Sharma ruled out of the limited-over leg of the Australia tour as he recovers from a hamstring injury, India will depend on K.L. Rahul in the batting department. While Rahul is familiar with batting in the top-order, he insists his position will vary depending on the format. “It will depend on the formats, what the team wants of me and what combination sits better... The last ODI series we played, I batted at No. 5 and kept wickets, so yeah that’s a role that I quite enjoyed,” Rahul said during an online media interaction on Wednesday. Rishabh Pant’s omission from the limited-over squads means Rahul, named vice-captain in Rohit’s absence, is currently the first-choice white-ball wicketkeeper, a responsibility he first undertook in January when Australia visited India. In his maiden outing as the designated ’keeper batting at No. 5, in the second ODI at Rajkot, Rahul slammed 80 off just 52 deliveries. He also hit 88 off 64 in Hamilton and 112 off 113 in Mount Maunganui on the tour of New Zealand, playing the same role. Asked if he was entrusted with the gloves, keeping in mind the two back-to-back World T20s, Rahul said, “Nothing has been conveyed to me [by the selectors]. We, as a team, aren’t thinking that far. World Cups are very important and that is the long vision for every team. “But for me, it’s about taking one game at a time, and if I keep putting up consistent performances with the bat and the gloves, it gives us the option of playing an extra bowler or a batter.” Rahul credited IPL 2020, where he led Kings XI Punjab, for helping him juggle multiple roles.  “I learnt from the IPL to stay in the moment... when I am batting, I think like a batter, assess the conditions and see how as a batter, I can win the game. “When I am ’keeping, it is important I switch on as a ’keeper and not keep thinking as a leader. That's going to be the key going ahead for me. “I share a decent understanding with Yuzi [Chahal], Jaddu [Ravindra Jadeja] and Kuldeep Yadav and will probably give them feedback about what I feel is a better length or pace to bowl. “Hopefully, I can get better at reading the game and give good feedback to the bowlers and the captain.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/enjoy-batting-at-five-and-keeping-rahul/article33181216.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Le Fondre gives Mumbai City full points||A late penalty from striker Adam le Fondre helped Mumbai City FC edge out FC Goa 1-0 at the Fatorda Stadium on Wednesday. FC Goa — down to 10 men after Redeem Tlang was sent off in the 40th minute — looked set to escape with a draw, until disaster struck. Deep into injury time, midfielder Lenny Rodrigues tried to block a header inside the box, but made contact with the ball with his outstretched hand. Le Fondre stepped up and converted with a low, hard strike. Earlier, Tlang was shown the red card for a rough tackle that caught Hernan Santana above the knee. With Tlang lunging in with his studs up, referee Rahul Kumar had no option but to take tough action. Despite being a man down, it was FC Goa which created the better chances. Skipper Edu Bedia’s powerful long-range effort forced a terrific save from MCFC goalkeeper Amrinder Singh. MCFC, meanwhile, struggled to find rhythm. With the midfield subdued, le Fondre was barely called into action. The team’s best chance came in the 74th minute, but Mandar Rao Dessai shot over the crossbar from point-blank range after receiving the ball from le Fondre. It seemed like MCFC would go a second game without scoring, until some poor play from Rodrigues, seconds before the final whistle, gave the side an escape route. The match, which saw MCFC head coach Sergio Lobera and many of his players take on their former club, was an ill-tempered affair. Six yellow cards were also shown.  The result: MCFC 1 (Adam le Fondre 90+5) bt FC Goa 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/le-fondre-gives-mumbai-city-full-points/article33181271.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Argentine’s genius was innate in his veins||A goal scored in football is the highest form of sporting high. The crowd is on its feet, the striker is in his slice of heaven, team-mates are delirious and soul-numbing grief is the shroud that chokes the rivals. Football - the calisthenics between fast legs and a ball, the art that fuses the dodge and the sprint while a sphere beats the goalkeeper - lost its heart-beat when news broke that Diego Maradona passed away at 60, back home in Argentina. Yes, there is Pele with his description of football as the beautiful game. And in that pantheon of excellence with the Brazilian legend saying the right things, Maradona, the Argentinian wizard, the Boca Juniors maestro, the hero for Napoli, walks in with a saunter, curly hair, stocky build, magic in his feet and never the politically correct word emanating from his lips. This was genius with shades of the devil, and strangely in 1986, Maradona was one with the gods. This was the fusion of extreme contrasts. Stamping his authority Great athletes impose their will on the game and Maradona was right up there. He believed that Argentina will win the World Cup at Mexico in 1986 and he backed that intuition with a footballing skill that was suffused with a magic realism that would have made Gabriel Garcia Marquez proud. Such was Maradona’s dominance — dribble, feint, sell a dummy, score a goal and then grin like a child at a candy store. If you were a sporting fan of the 1980s, this was bliss multiplied by infinity. But he wasn’t entirely clean; a ‘header’ against England in that World Cup which he owned, emerged from his hands. It was an adrenaline-laced blur, the leap, the head swivelling, a hand jutting out and a goal was scored. Back then television wasn’t all encompassing. The goal was awarded to Argentina and in the larger scheme of things, the Falkland Islands skirmish between his nation and England was ruling the airwaves. Hand of God That old aphorism swept the air – all is fair in love and war. Years later Maradona admitted that the goal was struck with his hand but in 1986, he philosophically spoke about the ‘Hand of God’, and a controversy was swept aside under the carpet of cosmic greatness, which also contained the 'goal of the century', scored in the same match, after a bewitching run that started in his own half. Maradona won that World Cup for Argentina, it was his high and equally became the cross that Lionel Messi had to bear while trying to get the Latin American nation excel at the World Cup over the last decade. Messi the FC Barcelona legend is not exactly Messi the Argentinian whiz kid. And the exploits of Maradona was too much of a legacy to carry forward. Wilting of the virtuoso Maradona, however, could not extend that 1986 spirit of zest into the subsequent World Cups. He did helm his men into the 1990 final but in the 1994 championship in the USA, ignominy wrapped him forever as he failed a drugs test. The genius had wilted, caught up in his own super-hero image. Drugs, excessive alcohol and delusion undid the great man. He turned obese, had health issues but there was still some magic in his feet. Some years back, he was in Kerala, busy promoting a jewellery brand. Having downed a few rums in his room, he was high-spirited. Along with Indian legend I.M. Vijayan at Kannur, the maestro juggled a football with his legs, took it on his chest, headed it a few times and stayed in control. Time was frozen, sporting paradise had descended on Malabar, and Maradona showed that genius was innate in his veins. But on a Wednesday night in a year lost to the coronavirus, football’s maverick-great breathed his last. The sport is poorer while searing memories remain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/argentines-genius-was-innate-in-his-veins/article33181223.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Gujrathi misses out on last-eight||Showing steady improvement with every passing day, Vidit Gujrathi stunned Peter Svidler and David Anton on the final day but fell short of a quarterfinal berth in the $100,000 Skilling Open online chess tournament on Tuesday.

26 November 2020||Chennai,||Suresh relishing his new role as CAC chairman||A calm-headed person with a no-nonsense approach, a versatile cricketer across formats, and someone with leadership qualities, S. Suresh has settled well into his new role as the chairman of the TNCA’s Cricket Administrative Committee. “It comes up with a lot of responsibilities. We have to keep in mind the Lodha recommendations,” the 47-year-old told The Hindu on Wednesday. Having led Tamil Nadu to two successive Ranji Trophy finals — in 2002-03 and 2003-04 — Suresh knows a thing or two about mounting strong campaigns. A punishing bat and a clever seamer, he has 1965 runs (ave. 29.32) and 89 wickets (ave. 25.87) in 43 first class matches and 1448 runs (ave. 31.47) and 44 scalps (economy rate 4.71) in 52 List `A’ matches. The CAC has come in for praise in picking S. Vasudevan as the senior selection panel chief. Praise for Vasudeven Suresh said, “He is a level-headed man, a fine cricketer and someone who has captained the side to Ranji Trophy triumph in 1987-88. He is the kind, without any bias, who will only look at the merits of a cricketer.” On the inclusion of T.R. Arasu in the panel, he said, “He adds value as a former wicket-keeper batsman.” Queried about Tamil Nadu not winning Ranji Trophy since 1987-88, he said, “We always had the ability. Look at the present side, you will find so many international cricketers. “But we have, for some reason, not played tight cricket in crunch situations in the big games. We either lost wickets in a cluster or leaked runs. This time we will stress on mental strength and total commitment to Tamil Nadu cricket. When things get tough, this team has to fight hard, shed every ounce of its blood on the field.” He spoke about getting along well with his CAC compatriots U.R. Radhakrishnan, “he is a chirpy character and was a brilliant batsman,”, and Sudha Shah, “She comes with useful suggestions.” Prasanna’s appointment While D. Vasu was confirmed as the coach, Suresh was not sure whether R. Prasanna’s name as the assistant coach would be announced by the TNCA or go to the apex council. Prasanna coaches a side in the TNPL. Suesh said, “The CAC is virtually involved in everything. Even for the junior selection committee we give a shortlist of names. Then we have a role in the selection of the physio and the trainer.” Suresh is the kind who relishes being in the thick of things. He is enjoying his latest role and the challenges that come with it.  This time we will stress on mental strength and total commitment to Tamil Nadu cricket||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/suresh-relishing-his-new-role-as-cac-chairman/article33181335.ece
26 November 2020||Melbourne,||Australian Open likely to be delayed||Victoria State Sports Minister said the 2021 Australian Open tennis championships here will most likely be delayed by a week or two from its scheduled start on January 18. Martin Pakula added negotiations between various levels of governments and tennis officials were close to a conclusion and that the first Grand Slam of the year was expected to go ahead. “There’s a number of potential dates on the table. I’ve seen reports that suggest that it’s likely to be delayed by a week or two. I think that’s still most likely,” Pakula said on Wednesday. Option “But it’s not the only option. As you know, the French Open was delayed by many months and Wimbledon didn’t occur at all. “I still think it’s much more likely that it will be a shorter rather than longer delay. “I don’t want to unduly repeat myself but these are very complex negotiations.” Australian Open tournament director and Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley last weekend said the final dates should be confirmed within two weeks. The Australian Open is usually held during the last two weeks of January, which coincides with the summer school holidays in Australia. Victoria was hard-hit by a second wave of COVID-19, forcing Melbourne into a lengthy lockdown, a night curfew and travel and other restrictions in the state. But it no longer has any active cases and its last deaths from the virus in the State were on Oct. 28. Quarantine arrangements Pakula didn’t comment on the players and their entourages’ quarantine arrangements amid speculation the process may be shortened to only 10 days, other than to reaffirm that they would definitely be required to quarantine. “An extremely rigorous testing regime will apply to the players both before they leave the port that they come in from and when they arrive. And then I imagine consistently through the time they’re in their (bio-secure) bubble,” Pakula said. Last week, Tennis Australia announced that all the lead-up tournaments would be relocated to Victoria State to avoid any conflicts with the differing domestic border restrictions within Australia.  I’ve seen reports that suggest that it’s likely to be delayed by a week or two. I think that’s still most likely — Martin Pakula,Victoria State Sports Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australian-open-likely-to-be-delayed/article33181276.ece
26 November 2020||MUMBAI,||‘Nothing wrong with 2019 WC squad’||Having completed his four-year tenure as a national selector — including almost 18 months when he wasn’t a part of the panel in the wake of the Lodha Committee’s recommendations — Jatin Paranjape opens up about various issues during his stint. Excerpts:  Your colleague Devang Gandhi recently admitted that omitting Ambati Rayudu for the 2019 World Cup was a mistake. Do you agree? I think we went with the best squad. The 50-over game pushes you into a corner to have a sixth bowling option because 50 overs is a lot without a sixth bowler. Maybe the batting order could have been a little bit better in crucial games but I don’t think there was anything wrong with the squad. Your last meeting in October turned into quite an affair. Can you shed some light on Rohit Sharma’s exclusion? It’s a very simple process which is followed. The BCCI physio shares an Excel sheet of the fitness status of players. Some players are available for selection, some are not. Once there’s an ‘unavailable for selection’ remark against a player, you move on to the next option. That was the prognosis on Rohit. I think he played the IPL because only two-three games remained, so one can push oneself with a few injections. Going to Australia and having to play 10 more games across formats in the next two months is a different cup of tea when you are evaluating injury status. Can the selection panel tell a contracted player to play or not play franchise cricket? They are mutually exclusive. How would you respond to the comment that you are perhaps the luckiest selector so far, since for half of your tenure, you were compensated without really working? These comments are pretty immature. You get paid but you’re not allowed to do anything else at that time and people who know me should understand that I am well-placed to do a few other things which others are perhaps not. I spent a decade at Nike, spotting talent, and the first player I signed was a guy called Virat Kohli. The fact that I played cricket had a lot to do with that chance as well, so no hard feelings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/nothing-wrong-with-2019-wc-squad/article33181214.ece
26 November 2020||PARIS,||Tricky time for Spurs, Milan, Sociedad||In an unusually crammed season, the Europa League, which resumes on Thursday with 26 group games, presents clubs fighting for domestic glory with a tricky balancing act. The English, Italian and Spanish league leaders, Tottenham, Real Sociedad and AC Milan, as well as Bundesliga high-flyer Bayer Leverkusen, have all slipped up already in Europe’s second-tier competition and cannot afford another mistake. Yet the demands of a condensed season mean their managers are walking two tightropes at once. Real Sociedad, beaten at home by Napoli on the second matchday, has lost veteran David Silva to a hamstring injury on Sunday ahead of its trip to Group F leader AZ Alkmaar. Tottenham only leads Group J on goal difference in head-to-head matches ahead of Royal Antwerp and LASK Linz. AC Milan travels to Lille seeking not only victory, which would put it top of Group H. Milan will be without talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tricky-time-for-spurs-milan-sociedad/article33181778.ece
26 November 2020||KOLKATA,||Tapan Memorial upsets East Bengal||Left-arm spinner Ramesh Prasad’s four-wicket haul and Sandipan Das’ fine 49 enabled Tapan Memorial Club to upset East Bengal by six wickets in the Bengal T20 Challenge at the Eden Gardens here on Wednesday. After restricting EB to 118 for nine, TM achieved the target comfortably. Shreevats Goswami (9) fell early to off-spinner Gaurav Chauhan. Ramesh kept it tight to claim a wicket apiece in his four overs. Abhijit Bhagat (14) and Arindam Ghosh (11) were stumped, Sayan Mondal (27 off 21, 2x6) was caught at long-off and Arnab Nandi (2) was bowled. Meanwhile, Mondal and a gritty Dipanjan Mukherjee (36 off 40, 3x4) put up EB’s highest partnership – 48 runs. EB pacer Mukesh Kumar bowled Koushik Ghosh (10) and Chauhan (0) with well-executed yorkers in his first spell of two for five. TM lost Shakir Gandhi to be at 35 for three. Sandipan (49 off 39, 4x4, 3x6) batted sensibly to gather 68 runs with captain Shahbaz Ahmed (32 off 22, 2x4, 1x6) and take TM closer to the target. His knock involved some attractive hits to the fence, primarily on the onside. Mukesh returned to have Sandipan caught behind in the 15th over, but it was too late for EB.  The scores: East Bengal 118/9 in 20 overs (Dipanjan Mukherjee 36, Ramesh Prasad 4/16, Prayas Ray Barman 2/18) lost to Tapan Memorial Club 119 for four in 16.1 overs (Sandipan Das 49, Shahbaz Ahmed 32 n.o., Mukesh Kumar 3/13).   On Tuesday: Kalighat Club 148/7 in 20 overs (Shubham Chatterjee 63, Aritra Chatterjee 3/26, Azaz Ansari 2/19) lost to Town Club 152/7 in 19.4 overs (Mohd.

26 November 2020||WELLINGTON,||De Grandhomme, Ajaz out of Windies series||New Zealand had a double blow ahead of its two-Test series against the West Indies, losing all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme and spinner Ajaz Patel to injuries. de Grandhomme has a bruising in his foot and Ajaz a torn calf muscle. All-rounders Daryl Mitchell and Mitchell Santner have been called into the squad as replacements. Mitchell made 73 on debut against England last November but hasn’t played another Test since. Santner offers the host a left-arm spin option and solid lower middle-order batting. Santner and Mitchell are also members of the New Zealand squad which will meet the visitors in three Twenty20 Internationals starting on Friday. Monitoring “Mitch and Daryl will be available for the final T20 game before linking up with the Test squad on Tuesday where we will monitor them closely to ensure they’re fit and fresh ahead of the first test,” head coach Gary Stead said. “They both proved last summer in the tests against England what they can do in our conditions with Mitch scoring a century and claiming three wickets at Bay Oval, while Daryl produced a polished half-century on debut at Seddon Park.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/de-grandhomme-ajaz-out-of-windies-series/article33181275.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Devi’s Sankalpa Shakti||Scriptures state that Srishti is the result of the Supreme Brahman’s desire to engage in creation. Out of His Sankalpa creation unfolds and He is described as the sole cause, providing the necessary material as well as the expertise to bring forth this wonderful and mysterious creation. In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, from Brahma’s account to Narada, it is the Divine Mother’s Sankalpa Shakti or Iccha Shakti that brings about Srishti, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. She is the very Brahma swaroopa and Maya swaroopa. Devi is described as the one beyond and above the Trimurtis and all Gods. Brahma continues his narration of how after Madhu and Kaitabha are slain by Vishnu, Devi appears before the Trimurtis and commands them to get ahead with their respective duties of srishti, stiti and samhara. But they find that there is no earth and only a mass of infinite waters. Nor can they see the five elements or the five tanmatras, or the gunas, etc, and they are baffled. She then smilingly guides them and they find an aerial car into which they are asked to get in. The three of them are astonished by the sights they see as they are taken to different worlds. They see the earth, and in swarga loka they recognise Surabhi, the divine cow, the yakshas, gandharvas, and even Indra and Sachi, and so on. Then, in the twinkling of an eye, the aerial car takes them to Brahmaloka. What could be more astonishing than Brahma seeing another four-faced Brahma with all his paraphernalia? So also Siva and Vishnu are perplexed all the more when they are taken to Kailasa and Vaikunta respectively. Then the car travels further and in no time they find themselves outside the abode of Devi situated in the midst of Sudha Sagara on the wonderful island called Mani Dweepa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/devis-sankalpa-shakti/article33181209.ece

26 November 2020||DUBAI,||Barclay is ICC chairman||New Zealand Cricket (NZC) head Greg Barclay was elected as the ICC’s new independent chairman on Tuesday, after he comfortably defeated Singapore’s Imran Khwaja 11-5, to succeed India’s Shashank Manohar. For Barclay, the concept of ‘Big Three’ doesn’t exist and he believes that both bilateral as well as ICC events can peacefully co-exist helping the game’s ecosystem. The ‘Big Three’ was a concept where India, Australia and England were supposed to earn the lion’s share of global body’s revenue. In the run up to the election, New Zealand’s Barclay said a perception was created that he gives importance to bilateral cricket over “everything else” but that was far from the truth. “There has been a lot of misrepresentation in the media around that. But the fact is, of course I am an advocate of bilateral cricket, it is the lifeblood of cricket in all countries...” Barclay said in a video posted on the ICC website. “Countries playing each other on a regular basis, sustained competitive relevant competition is what drives fan engagement. It is what drives the development pathways, it is a vital part of cricket. But that doesn’t mean that the world events are not as important, said the Kiwi. “I would need to say they (bilateral and global events) need to work in conjunction with each other, one can’t sit in isolation to the other. I am very conscious of the delicate ecosystem that crickets sits on.” He also warned against too much cricket. “You have leagues like the IPL and Big Bash. You have to look at the athletes’ health, safety and wealth which is paramount. “We can’t expect them to perform day in and day out through the year. Again, we have to balance out that along with fans. At end of the day, it only works if the fans want it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barclay-is-icc-chairman/article33181211.ece

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||The long dark road||A journey rife with hardships can drag one to the darkest places. Not for V Vignarajan, who, whilst making Andhaghaaram (darkness), and despite struggling to bring it to light for the past many years, never lost sight of his target — “to make a good film”. It did not matter even if it was going to be just the one, he says, over phone from Chennai. Having assisted director Radha Mohan in films such as Mozhi (2007) and Abhiyum Naanum (2008), Vignarajan set out on his own only to find that the film industry had a strange way of crippling people with ambitions; his first project, Orey Nyabagam , was shelved after more than half of it was completed. Born out of that experience was the decision to make an indie film, Andhaghaaram . “We shot a pilot and pitched it to a couple of producers. We continued filming with money that we pooled from various sources. When it was two-thirds complete, Passion Studios took an interest,” says Vignarajan. He adds: “However, it was Atlee’s entry [as presenter] that brought so much attention to this small film.” Excerpts: What is Andhaghaaram about? It is a supernatural suspense-thriller film. It is also a hyperlink subject that sees three stories colliding at crucial points. Is there an inspiration for the storyline?  This incident in my life from 10 years ago left a ‘what if’ question in my head. My friend from Kerala had told me about this man who claimed to speak with spirits using a phone. Obviously, it was false, but I thought ‘what if it was real?’ Tell us about your casting choice for the lead roles: Vinoth Kishan and Arjun Das.  Vinoth plays Selvam, a visually-challenged person. I had followed his work since Naan Mahaan Alla ; his eyes are intense. I thought it would be interesting to snatch that powerful tool [of expression] away from him, cast him in this role and then see how he pursues his character. He liked the idea. Same with Arjun, who plays a failed cricketer. I didn’t have to hold auditions, and I now know there aren’t better actors to play those roles than the two. Bagging a Netflix release gets you a bigger audience...  Yes, but I’m disappointed that I could not release the film in theatres. We planned the visual and sound effects for the big screen experience. However, gaining a Netflix release is a positive thing to happen to us in these gloomy days. How did Atlee come on board?  During the film’s edit stage, Atlee learnt of our film and he liked what he saw. After Bigil ’s release, he saw our movie’s final cut and agreed to present it. You tout the screenplay as the unique element in Andhaghaaram , but the film is still a suspense-thriller. Will there be jump scare moments?  I hate jump scares. Even when writing the film, I didn’t include jump scare situations intentionally because I didn’t want to fall for the clichés.  We have tried our best to create a unique world in the way we have lit the film, treated the sound and performances. I was particular about not affording it the treatment given to films with conventional subjects. What do you make of the long journey that it took you to bring Andhaghaaram to this point?  It is not tough to make indie films especially if you are supported by a good crew. Raising money is tough, but everything depends on how our beliefs work. What matters is that we remain committed to making a good film, the rest would fall in place easily. I am disappointed that Andhaghaaram took such a long time. However, at the end of the hardship, if we successfully endure it, we will find the path we want to tread on going forward. What have you lined up next?  I do have a few scripts, but it will be decided based on how well Andhaghaaram is received. I have plans in place whether or not the situation works to my favour. Andhaghaaram is streaming on Netflix||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-long-dark-road/article33181061.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Going live in 3,2,1...||Over the past month, Chennai’s musicians — many of whom have garnered national following — walked into closed malls and hotel spaces to perform without an audience. “I am used to Luxe Cinemas being always crowded; it was so strange, yet grand, to see it completely empty,” recalls Sharad Rao, the Chennai-born guitarist of Pune-based eight-piece band Easy Wanderlings. Sharad and Easy Wanderlings’ vocalist Pratika Gopinath, Jbabe (the solo act of The F16s’ frontman Josh Fernandes), Maalavika Manoj aka Mali, and many others performed entire sets in isolated, silent spaces, to be streamed “live” on Instagram a couple of weeks later. The series, titled Centre Stage, is an attempt by Chennai’s new music platform, Circle of Love, to turn usual Instagram Live sessions into something more slick and polished. Enter, polished studios Though the pandemic outbreak forced musicians to take to jamming online, it soon became evident that monetising was essential. And that meant streaming live from their bedrooms wouldn’t cut it any more. Easy Wanderlings’ Pratika and Sharad were back in Chennai, working on a four-track EP with the rest of the band’s members spread across Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. Live sets were far from their minds when Circle of Love co-founders Sameer Sethi and DJ Manny asked them to do one. “We weren’t really sure that we wanted to do it, but it was the first bit of work that we had got in a while, so we couldn’t say no,” says Sharad. Sameer, who has led teams handling Sunburn and the AR Rahman concert in 2019, says, “I knew the lockdown would make it difficult for everyone to cope, so I was looking at possible alternatives. We wanted to take the casual Lives and do it properly: with multiple cameras angles and edits, and paid artistes.” Circle of Love has already recorded three Live sets each at Luxe and Park Hyatt; recording studios too have woken up to this new channel of revenue. Before 2020, live gigs would be in a controlled environment, points out Aditya Srinivasan, co-founder, Offbeat Music Ventures. “How somebody consumes the music you put out is entirely left to them. This means we have to account for a whole new set of variables,” says Aditya. Started in February this year, Offbeat’s studio is a 5,500 square feet space in Chennai’s RA Puram, with 40-seater and 80-seater plug and play rooms. The studio enables artistes from different locations to stream together, and has so far hosted live concerts by bands such as Funktuation with Benny Dayal, Non Violonist Project and singers like Karthik and TM Krishna. “Each of our shows sells an average of 500 to 600 tickets, a good combination of local and international. In case of free corporate shows, we get an attendance of 4,000 to 5,000 overall, with an average of 700 people watching at one point of time,” says co-founder Vijay Nathan, adding that they have green screens to display visuals as well, “Most people are now watching these shows on TVs rather than on their phones. So good visuals matter as much as the sound.” Not all prefer the bright lights of a studio, however. In Mylapore, arts consultant Shreya Nagarajan Singh turned the ground floor of an eight-year-old home into a multipurpose arts space, Swapna. The informal vibe of the airy green balcony here has proved a hit among those doing morning recordings. Lately, Shreya has been advising clients to premiere pre-recorded shows live. “There is excitement in a Live session, but you can’t monitor the Internet connection on both sides. For pre-recorded content, you can shoot in the best natural light possible, and still stream during evenings,” she says. But Srikanth Natarajan, founder of The Chennai Scene, prefers realtime engagement. He recalls a live digital concert by rapper Hanumankind in Bengaluru. “He asked the audience to send him words in a chatbox and made freestyle raps out of them.” From August to November, Srikanth tied up with CornerHouse Studio in Kilpauk to livestream indie acts every weekend, the last one featuring Siennor. People from Dubai, cities in the US, as well as Coimbatore and Tiruchirappalli tuned in. Josh aka Jbabe also echoes the importance of audience interaction. The last time he went live, he remembers asking viewers to join and sing for him, because “I was getting saturated singing by myself. As artistes, it is our job to perform for the people. It is kind of mundane otherwise.” Listening to audiences To bring this vital element of listener feedback, artistes have taken to platforms like Gurugram-based Skillbox. What started as a professional networking space for the performing arts in 2018, Skillbox has become a widely-used ticketing and native digital streaming platform. “On Skillbox, artistes can either hold their own gigs, or be hired by clients and corporates (through legally binding contracts that assure payment),” says Anmol Kukreja, CEO. The service has a parallel chatbox for audience to respond in. They are working on enabling users to switch on their video and audio too, for comprehensive feedback. For a concert to be worth its money, the quality of the recording has to be high not just at the performers’ end, but also at the listeners’. And not all applications can stream high fidelity audio and video without compressing it. A 1080p HD video may not even load if the listener’s Internet connection is bad. “So we have adaptive bit-rates (that change according to the strength of your signal),” explains Anmol Skillbox has hosted 700 live shows so far, starting with a sold-out concert by Parekh and Singh, and moving on to the likes of Nikhil D’Souza, Pentagram, Ankur Tewari and Lifafa. Next month, Indian Ocean’s Rahul Ram will be playing. Ram says, “The tech guys (in the music space) are almost as much out of work as us [artistes] — possibly more so because they can’t just go online and sing a song — they have come up with innovative solutions.” With restrictions being eased and live concerts resuming with limited audiences, a hybrid model is the one to look out for: one that integrates a physical and a digital live gig. Says Ram, “It is like watching cricket at home on your TV. You get to watch every hit and spin, so you are actually watching better cricket. Yes you are missing out on the sheer energy of 30,000 people cheering, so both become equally valid but different experiences.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/going-live-in-321/article33181081.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Emerging from the underground||Boom boom shaka laka boom boom shak! Street Cat’s gonna knock you back!   This bicycle ad jingle from the ‘90s is, in a way, responsible for the arrival of rap in South India. Suresh Peters, the composer, felt it would be novel to use rap, a genre unfamiliar in India then. The experiment worked. Inspired by the jingle’s success, Suresh suggested using a rap song for his friend’s upcoming Tamil film album. The friend, a young film composer, found the idea exciting. They, however, decided to make the song more local. Instead of fast-paced English, they went for Madras slang. Words like ghilli , goli , manja and more made it to the song. The song was a mix of folk and rap. It was refreshingly new yet so familiar. It became a pop-culture phenomenon. Twenty-six years later, Suresh is grateful but also mildly miffed about making ‘Petta Rap’ with his composer friend, AR Rahman. “I have made music of various genres after that. But I am still mistakenly labelled as a rapper because of that one song,” he laughs. Such was the impact of ‘that one song’. Arivarasu Kalainesan (popularly known as Arivu), who is among the leading rappers in Tamil Nadu, says, “That was the first time a lot of us even heard the word ‘rap’.” Even a decade ago, rap in South India was rare. It was mostly confined to the fringes except for occasional appearances in films. Rahman, Suresh, Apache Indian, Blaaze among others familiarised the genre. But independent artists were sparse and largely invisible. Then sometime around the beginning of the previous decade, a slow-yet-steady emergence of such artistes, powered by YouTube and social media, began. Now, rap has become a part of mainstream music. A rythm of cultures Rap in South India has come untethered from its (bicycle) commercial beginnings and, through various artists, taken numerous forms. Though we are talking about the genre’s evolution in one part of the country, it is difficult and probably unfair to create labels such as ‘South Indian rap’, for it does not exist. The artists come from diverse backgrounds, they tell different stories and have distinct styles. Eboshi and Contra of the band Cartel Madras call their style the ‘Goonda Rap’. The sisters come from a mix of cultures — they are half-Malayalis, born in Chennai and raised in Canada. They are also among the few brown queer rappers. “We want our music to come at you with a rush of all the things that have gone into who we are. So when you hear Cartel Madras, you might hear a hint of Ilaiyaraaja’s synth mixed in with 808s [a type of electronic percussion sample]. You might see the rhetoric of [late political activist] Arrikad Varghese mixed in with a nod to rapper MF Doom. You might feel like you’re in Chinatown in Toronto, or somewhere in Chennai in the late 90s,” they say, via email from Canada, about their music. Meanwhile, in Kerala, there is Vedan (which means hunter in Malayalam), for whom rap is a tool to talk about social issues. He grew up in a colony close to the Thrissur railway station, where people struggled for necessities. “I didn’t want to be a rap artist. I just needed a medium to express these issues and I found rap,” he says. Voices of change Vedan is not alone. There are many young rappers whose works brazenly question the status quo. Arivu, who is a big inspiration for Vedan, is one of them. Arivu’s Tamil rap song ‘Sanda Seivom’ (Let’s Fight), for instance, criticised the Government’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. An ardent follower of Ambedkar and Periyar, most of Arivu’s independent works deal with socio-political issues such as caste oppression, religious discrimination, and gender inequality. “Rap, originally, was a music of the oppressed. People in the African-American community used it to express their pain and protest. I, too, use the form to talk about socially relevant issues,” says Arivu, “So, even when I write songs for a commercial film, I try to go beyond the usual hero-worship elements and write about the connection the hero has with his society.” Telugu rapper Streetviolater’s works evoke a sense of helpless anger. His latest song, ‘Maranam’ (which means death in Telugu), is a condemnation of corrupt governments, media, education system among others. Like Vedan, Streetviolater also never wanted to be a rapper. “I was part of a rock band. But then, I realised that I had a lot of things to say as an individual. So, I started rapping,” he says. People in the music industry say that the following for hip hop music has increased exponentially over the last decade. “Hip-hop has been one of the biggest breakout genres in the country, especially after the release of Gully Boy . Hip-hop is coming of age and will grow into being a thriving genre in the country,” says Spotify’s Padmanabhan NS, the Artists & Label Partnerships Head, India. “While Punjabi and Hindi hip hop still dominate the desi hip hop landscape, there is definitely a burgeoning scene in the South,” says a spokesperson from JioSaavn. Streaming platforms such as Spotify and JioSaavn have been hotbeds for upcoming hip hop artists. With these avenues, it is now easier than before to start an independent music career; sustaining it is, however, a challenge. Kannada rapper Alok Babu R (popularly known as All OK), for instance, started his independent music career before the days of digital streaming. “Forget hip hop, there wasn’t an independent music scene in Kannada then. But we hung on, slowly got noticed. From zero views on YouTube [when we started], we got over a million for each song,” he says. Blaaze has a word of advice for young rappers. “It’s a cycle. You need to hit the mainstream for the world to take notice, then have an already established fan base or audience for your independent work to get recognised,” he says. Blaaze’s independent tracks ‘In My Fathers Words’ and ‘Ban The Crooked Police’ fetched him opportunities to work with Rahman in films. The popularity in films in turn earned him more appreciation for his independent works. “It’s more about creating,” he says, “Whether it’s in films or independently, the process is what you must love and that’s why longevity succeeds.”  I didn’t want to be a rap artist. I just needed a medium to express these issues and I found rap Vedan Rapper from Kerala||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/emerging-from-the-underground/article33181095.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||An edible comfort blan ket||Biryani Macha In2020, therapy comes in unexpected guises. As we batten down the hatches, in anticipation of cyclone Nivar howling past, perhaps it is apt that Chennai turns to its favourite therapy:biryani. Started in late August 2020, Biryani Macha has already served over a lakhbiryanis. Run by Chef Koushik S, the cloud kitchen has a deliberately concise menu. There are two kinds ofbiryani: Ambur style, made with basmati rice and cooked dum-style on a wood fire. And their just-introduced Panai Olai biryani, a fragrant, coconut-milk-based version made with short-grained seeraga samba rice. “When it comes tobiryani,I like to eat a good quantity,” chuckles Chef Koushik, explaining why he decided to launch this cloud kitchen in a city seething withbiryani-speciality restaurants. “Our version is made home style on a wood fire, and we keep it simple, using good ingredients… The rice is from farms in Erode. Coconut milk is an amazing tenderiser. And the meat is cooked in stock: we use no water at all.” Thebiryani, wrapped and delivered in banana leaves and nestled in a palm leaf box, is rich with flavour. “The panai olai , or palm leaf, is a traditional South Indian packing material,” says Chef Koushik, adding “It reminds me ofbiryaniI ate as a child: the leaf also imparts a certain flavour.” And unlike thebiryanisnobs, for whom vegetarian biryani is an oxymoron or a pulao (you know who you are), Kaushik is just as excited about his meatless versions. “We do an Ambur biryani with vegetable stock,” he says. “We also just launched a mushroom panai olai version, which is delicious.”  Call Biryani Macha on 9952000984.   Honey Box The pandemic triggered a rash of sourdough. Stuck at home with little to do besides wash our hands and sanitise the door knobs, bread making became the sport of choice all over the world. And, it quickly became evident that while bread can be a comforting hobby, it can also be infuriatingly complex. Enter the Honey Box. Positioned as India’s first DIY (do-it-yourself) bread making kit, the product was launched this week by Chef Shereen Perez. Formerly with the ITC Grand Chola, where she worked on luxurious Fabelle chocolates, Shereen has spent much of this year formulating four kits: Artisan Crunchy, Multigrain, Focaccia and Pizza. Starting at Rs. 130, each is neatly packed with her proprietary blend of bread flour, along with little packets of pre-measured pink Himalayan salt and yeast. There are also parchment sheets, and a detailed list of instructions. The result is warm, satisfying and promises to fill your kitchen with the scent of victory. “I realised that it is a challenge to formulate the right flour,” says Shereen, explaining the technique behind each blend. “For the multigrain loaf, I add flax seeds, bran, malted barley, oat flakes… Then, I teach people how to knead, because it’s very different from how we make chappatis,” she adds. While bread making is fairly scientific, once you learn the rules, she promises it gets much easier. “For beginners, it is important to first understand how the dough feels, and how it should look.” She adds with a laugh, “Then you can start adding olives, rosemary, basil… I have a client who put bacon on focaccia as well.”  HoneyBox kits are available at JK Cheese N more, Amma Naana and Tryst Gourmet.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Let there be light||The sun throws mellow afternoon light through the windows. Dancing keyholes of lancet-shaped leaves outside form patterns on the tiled floor. Like an abstract painting. Like Chennai-based photographer Madhavan Palanisamy’s pictures. The 44-year-old award winning lensman has, in most of his projects, shot images that reflect the real world but cloaked them in a veneer of the fantastical and imaginative. His latest The Reflector, created over two days in October, is a tribute to the lightmen of Chennai. “They are cupids of light, agents of the moon, human boom-rods. They can climb any mountain top or tree or anything to reflect the light. A jovial bunch, they run around shouting instructions to their fellow-agents and responding ‘ready-sir!’ to the DOP or the photographer. These men are super-heroes in their own right. The Reflector is their story,” says Madhavan over phone. Coimbatore-born Madhavan won Lensculture’s B&W Series award in 2019 (Lensculture is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching resources for discovering contemporary photography talent around the world) for his work Appa and Other Animals, a tribute to the time spent with his late father, the famous writer and literary critic Kovai Gnani. Madhavan’s work that choreographs portraiture and documentary aims to create an empathetic link between viewer and subject, a reflection of his own journey with detours through a degree in Biochemistry and work in advertising before he found his calling in photography. He has since metamorphosed into portraiture, photographing celebrities, sustainable fashion and human stories. “The pandemic restricted travel and commercial jobs but also gave artists time to dwell on certain aspects of life that are often hijacked by conventional work. The award pushed me to work on telling more stories of ordinary folk,” he says. Which is how Madhavan came to tell the tale of the lightmen, who are among the silent sentinels of the film, television and photography industries, going about sets and studios lugging lights and strobes with an earnestness that ensures productivity. “They know how to shape the light and the mood, but with the industry shut down due to the pandemic, a lot of these men were without jobs, income or food. Even now, as the industry opens up slowly, they are unable to find a sustainable living. The jobs are high-risk, but most of them are not part of any union which makes it more difficult for them to find work. The Reflector is a part-docu, part-fantasy story about these men who use their dinner plates to reflect the light and bring attention to their condition,” he adds. Madhavan shot the series on film using a Rolleicord TLR camera, a 60-year-old antique for the square pictures, and a more modern Contax G2 for the horizontal pictures. He rounded up old faithfuls — some like Ramesh Kumar, a darkroom printer and photographer had taught him in his early years. Some like “well-known lightmen Mohan and Mohaideen, fondly called bhai had brought their team for the shoot. Suresh, who runs the studio Setfire, Pandian and Vasu who work there, and Amal, a freelance assistant, were also part of the project”. The 20 people who featured were shot at abandoned sets, on sand heaps and atop sliding boards and staircases. Some had crowns and wings superimposed on them. Others had billboards for faces. But the one object that linked them was a dinner plate — that shone like the sun, the moon’s reflection in a puddle, a beam of light from a lighthouse, and as the ardour of a man who knows he holds the light to illumine a good picture. The pictures shot in black-and-white were processed by Karthik Thorali at Madras Atelier. The result is a surreal, palpable portrait of a community — obscure yet recognisable, familiar yet enigmatic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/let-there-be-light/article33181088.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Season of hope||K Eswari narrows her eyes as the afternoon sun beats down on her. She is grateful for every ray of sunlight — the rain last week did not make life any easier for her fellow potters — but it does make her head spin. She spends all morning cleaning clay that trucks ferry from the water beds of nearby Kanuvai and Thadagam to Udayar Veedhi, a colony of potters in Coimbatore’s Kavundampalayam. She picks stones and dirt off the clay, and lays it out to dry. It is crucial work — it forms the base for the lamps and pots her husband and other families will shape. The colony, that consists of 50 families of traditional clay potters, has houses built around three kilns located in a depression. Only 15 families continue the craft, while the rest have taken to other means of living. The two months leading to the Tamil month of Karthigai are among their busiest time of the year. Luckily for them, after the lockdowns, people are now venturing out with caution. The colony is therefore limping back to normalcy. Orders from their agents have started coming in full swing, much like the previous years. “The past couple of months have been good for us,” says D Saraswathy, kneading clay that she soaked overnight in water. “Orders have started coming and we’ve been busy.” She will not forget the initial days of the pandemic, however. Neither will A Shekar. “It was a difficult time,” he says, shaping small pots on a wet grinder that has been fashioned into an electric potter’s wheel. With no way to transport clay, they had no work. But they did enjoy some perks. “In all these years of living in this colony, that was when we had the time to sit together and talk,” says Shekar. “We played carrom outside our houses, spoke about the good old times, got a chance to rest our hands. The lockdown also had its benefits.” Now though, the men and women of the colony are back on their feet. Lamps, still damp, are laid to dry on wooden planks; clay in various stages: some dry and some wet blobs, sit at their designated spots in the sun; finished lamps, brown and sturdy, stand in straight lines awaiting the agent who will transport them to sellers. “Uncle, they’re setting up the kiln,” hollers a boy at Shekar. The 40-year-old wipes his hands in a clay-stained cloth and says, “I’m coming.” He switches off the radio playing on his mobile phone that kept him company as he worked and prepares to leave. “The past few months taught us many lessons. For one, we learned to respect the clay we work with. We have started treating it like food; not a morsel is to be wasted,” he says. Even now, clay is not easy to come by — an issue the inhabitants of the colony have raised with the District Collector. “In the past, we would ride all the way to the water bodies on bullock carts to collect the clay ourselves; now though, there are several rules in place, making sourcing quite a task,” explains Shekar. But life goes on; the potters have learned to work with limited resources. “There is always demand,” says Shekar, adding, “People use our products right from birth up to death.” He is talking about clay utensils, water pots, lamps, stoves, and customised pots people of some beliefs use during funeral rituals. Saraswathy, meanwhile, has worked her way through most of the clay. She will now stomp on it until it turns smooth, from where the men will take over. In two day’s time, the clay will turn into lamps, and will travel to households in Coimbatore and nearby cities, to be lit with oil on the eve of Deepam. “My family did end up in debts because of Corona,” she says, wiping her face with her sari. “But we are now on our way out of them; there’s hope.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/season-of-hope/article33181099.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Along with the gods||If you live in Chennai, you have probably seen temple cars ( thaer ) at the Kapaleeswarar temple, Mylapore, or at the Parthasarathy temple, Triplicane. However, not many people have had the opportunity to take a closer look and understand the aesthetics and architecture of these magnificent wooden chariots. Held recently, DakshinaChitra’s A Seminar on Temple Cars threw light on the topic, offering interesting perspectives from sthapathis (artists who build the temple cars) and researchers. The heritage museum on East Coast Road re-opened on November 9 after eight months of being shut to the public. The seminar included a documentary film by DakshinaChitra’s coordinator Gita Hudson. Titled Thiru Ter , Gita’s film provides insight on the highly-skilled artisan community who make the temple cars, featuring interviews with Sthapathi K Rajamani and his son from Thiruvanthigam, a temple town near Panruti in Cuddalore district. Gita says that the film was inspired by Sushil Pani’s book, Devaratham , which is a compilation of 20 years’ research into temple cars of Tamil Nadu. There are as many as 900 temple cars in the State. Sthapathi Rajamani, a fifth generation sculptor who specialises in building temple cars, explains: “A well-made temple car will last for 300 to 400 years. There is an architectural connection or similarity between a temple gopuram (tower) and the temple car,” adding, “Knowledge of a car’s composition, construction, dimensions, design and shape is based on ancient texts or theAagamas; the measurements have to be precise.” Historian Pradeep Chakravarthy and A Chellaperumal, Professor, Department of Anthropology, Pondicherry University, shared brief notes on the cultural significance of temple car events (thaer thiruvizha) — unique to South Indian states — especially to Tamil Nadu. “There is a heightened communal feeling as it is a joyous event when the entire community comes together,” says Pradeep. Rajamani, whose grandfather built the temple car for the Tirumala Tirupati Balaji temple in 1947, remarks that sculptors exhibit their architectural knowledge in their creations. “Can you believe that hydraulic breaks were in place in the temple car built for a Vaishnava temple in Villianur 100 years ago?” he asks. His son, R Rangachari, says that Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) have provided technical support by designing steel wheels and hydraulic breaks for Tamil Nadu’s temple cars for over four decades. “The wheels have to balance the heavy structure (that weights almost 300 to 400 tonnes) and also move the chariot safely, which is why brakes are essential,” he says, adding, “The car is built in such a way that the lower-most tier is heavy and is made of teak wood, and as it goes up, it is made with lighter wood. This ensures stability when the chariot moves.” For their part, the sthapathis admit that they are willing to impart knowledge of their craft to youngsters who seek it. “We restrict ourselves to designing temple cars and its renovation, as we prefer to adhere to the ethics and integrity of this devotional art,” says Rangachari, re-emphasising the significance of his craft.  For tickets: www.dakshinachitra.net , or contact 27472603. DakshinaChitra is closed on Tuesdays.   Back in business There have been more than 600 people who have visited DakshinaChitra Heritage Museum since it reopened. Deborah Thyagarajan, the museum’s founder and director, says they have planned a series of events that will be held in the forthcoming weeks to encourage more people to visit. “The public seem to be comfortable and confident about visiting the museum as it is open air and is located on a 10-acre land.

As is the case with every field, architecture and design thinking are also undergoing a perceivable shift, thanks to the pandemic. But Delhi-based design platform India Design Forum (IDF) intends to go beyond that, to discuss what defines architecture going forward, with its series titled IDF Debates: Building Blocks, spread over the coming four weeks. Though architecture is the prime focus of this particular series, India Design Forum which was conceptualised in 2012, is a global platform that addresses design thinking in general, “And, when I say design thinking, it incorporates architecture, industrial design, culture, innovation, technology and art.

With fewer projects and more time in hand, architects are reevaluating their own practices, expectations and coping mechanisms. From challenges in dealing with the attitude of clients to larger questions of what mechanisms a society should implement during a pandemic, everything is on the table for discussion. “Spaces really define how we live, think and feel. They define how happy we are. And today, these living spaces need to be revisited,” says Rajshree.

26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Take a stroll with iguanas||The American green iguana bobs its head as it crawls on the branch of a small tree. A little worrying for the group assembled in front of it, because head bobbing is usually an indication of the animal being upset or aggressive. Nevertheless, one of them offers a leaf of spinach to the animal, which it gleefully accepts. Within minutes, the bobbing stops, and the iguana ambles into a small water pool to say hello to its neighbour, a star tortoise. All this action is playing out at the recently-inaugurated Walk Through Iguana Garden at Chennai Snake Park, Guindy. The park, which usually draws crowds of 4.5 lakh visitors annually, reopened two weeks ago, after eight months of closure due to the pandemic. Since then, it has seen a steady stream of visitors; about 80 people visited the iguana section last Sunday. One of its recent key attractions is the special iguana garden — visitors can stroll through it and admire the five adult iguanas from close proximity. If they are lucky, they also get to feed greens to the herbivorous species of lizards, usually found in the wild in Central and South America. The idea was conceptualised by S Paulraj, chairman, Chennai Snake Park Trust, after he visited a few European zoos. “Children there are not only made aware of the importance that animals play in our ecosystem but also taught to shower love. We wanted to do something similar here,” he says. While that was not obviously possible with their core possessions — pythons and snakes — Paulraj and team wondered if they could implement it with the iguanas, which have been in the Park since 2017. “They are lovable, attractive pets and generally do not cause harm,” he says. So, during the months they were closed, the team made the garden a reality. Today, five three-year-old iguanas rub shoulders with star tortoises in a simulated environment, complete with rocks, boulders and some water pools. Visitors, at close quarters, can observe features like the iguana’s ‘third eye’ on the head that helps it detect light and movement. “For reasons of safety, we let in only limited numbers of visitors at a time, do not let them touch the animals and ensure that they are accompanied by a guide,” says Paulraj. Iguanas are vegetarian, feeding mostly on greens and fruits. On some days, they dine on a salad comprising an assortment of vegetables including cabbage, carrots and radish. “When visitors feed them, they develop a bond, and their fear of animals can be overcome,” says Paulraj, adding “If the iguanas are in a good mood, you can even take a selfie with them!”   Visit the iguanas on all days except Tuesdays from 9 am to 5.30pm at Chennai Snake Park, Guindy    INTO THE WILD It is the first zoo in the country to house the spitting cobra, which is said to use the venom to defend itself by spitting it on the eyes of its enemy. There are 24 gharials , a critically-endangered species, in the park that need funds for maintenance and rearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/take-a-stroll-with-iguanas/article33181083.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Going live in 3,2,1...||Over the past month, Chennai’s musicians — many of whom have garnered a national following — walked into closed malls and hotel spaces to perform without an audience. “I am used to Luxe Cinemas being always crowded; it was so strange, yet grand, to see it completely empty,” recalls Sharad Rao, the Chennai-born guitarist of Pune-based eight-piece band Easy Wanderlings. Sharad and Easy Wanderlings’ vocalist Pratika Gopinath, Jbabe (the solo act of The F16s’ frontman Josh Fernandes), Maalavika Manoj aka Mali, and many others performed entire sets in isolated, silent spaces, to be streamed “live” on Instagram a couple of weeks later. The series, titled Centre Stage, is an attempt by Chennai’s new music platform, Circle of Love, to turn usual Instagram Live sessions into something more slick and polished. Enter, polished studios Though the pandemic outbreak forced musicians to take to jamming online, it soon became evident that monetising was essential. And that meant streaming live from their bedrooms wouldn’t cut it any more. Easy Wanderlings’ Pratika and Sharad were back in Chennai, working on a four-track EP with the rest of the band’s members spread across Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. Live sets were far from their minds when Circle of Love co-founders Sameer Sethi and DJ Manny asked them to do one. “We weren’t really sure that we wanted to do it, but it was the first bit of work that we had got in a while, so we couldn’t say no,” says Sharad. Sameer, who has led teams handling Sunburn and the AR Rahman concert in 2019, says, “I knew the lockdown would make it difficult for everyone to cope, so I was looking at possible alternatives. We wanted to take the casual Lives and do it properly: with multiple cameras angles and edits, and paid artistes.” Circle of Love has already recorded three Live sets each at Luxe and Park Hyatt; recording studios too have woken up to this new channel of revenue. Before 2020, live gigs would be in a controlled environment, points out Aditya Srinivasan, co-founder, Offbeat Music Ventures. “How somebody consumes the music you put out is entirely left to them. This means we have to account for a whole new set of variables,” says Aditya. Started in February this year, Offbeat’s studio is a 5,500 square feet space in Chennai’s RA Puram, with 40-seater and 80-seater plug and play rooms. The studio enables artistes from different locations to stream together, and has so far hosted live concerts by bands such as Funktuation with Benny Dayal, Non Violonist Project and singers like Karthik and TM Krishna. “Each of our shows sells an average of 500 to 600 tickets, a good combination of local and international. In case of free corporate shows, we get an attendance of 4,000 to 5,000 overall, with an average of 700 people watching at one point of time,” says co-founder Vijay Nathan, adding that they have green screens to display visuals as well, “Most people are now watching these shows on TVs rather than on their phones. So good visuals matter as much as the sound.” Not all prefer the bright lights of a studio, however. In Mylapore, Chennai, arts consultant Shreya Nagarajan Singh turned the ground floor of an eight-year-old home into a multipurpose arts space, Swapna. The informal vibe of the airy green balcony here has proved a hit among those doing morning recordings. Lately, Shreya has been advising clients to premiere pre-recorded shows live. “There is excitement in a Live session, but you can’t monitor the Internet connection on both sides. For pre-recorded content, you can shoot in the best natural light possible, and still stream during evenings,” she says. But Srikanth Natarajan, founder of The Chennai Scene, prefers realtime engagement. He recalls a live digital concert by rapper Hanumankind in Bengaluru. “He asked the audience to send him words in a chatbox and made freestyle raps out of them.” From August to November, Srikanth tied up with CornerHouse Studio in Kilpauk to livestream indie acts every weekend, the last one featuring Siennor. People from Dubai, cities in the US, as well as Coimbatore and Tiruchirappalli tuned in. Josh aka Jbabe also echoes the importance of audience interaction. The last time he went live, he remembers asking viewers to join and sing for him, because “I was getting saturated singing by myself. As artistes, it is our job to perform for the people. It is kind of mundane otherwise.” Listening to audiences To bring this vital element of listener feedback, artistes have taken to platforms like Gurugram-based Skillbox. What started as a professional networking space for the performing arts in 2018, Skillbox has become a widely-used ticketing and native digital streaming platform. “On Skillbox, artistes can either hold their own gigs, or be hired by clients and corporates (through legally binding contracts that assure payment),” says Anmol Kukreja, CEO. The service has a parallel chatbox for audience to respond in. They are working on enabling users to switch on their video and audio too, for comprehensive feedback. For a concert to be worth its money, the quality of the recording has to be high not just at the performers’ end, but also at the listeners’. And not all applications can stream high fidelity audio and video without compressing it. A 1080p HD video may not even load if the listener’s Internet connection is bad. “So we have adaptive bit-rates (that change according to the strength of your signal),” explains Anmol Skillbox has hosted 700 live shows so far, starting with a sold-out concert by Parekh and Singh, and moving on to the likes of Nikhil D’Souza, Pentagram, Ankur Tewari and Lifafa. Next month, Indian Ocean’s Rahul Ram will be playing. Ram says, “The tech guys (in the music space) are almost as much out of work as us [artistes] — possibly more so because they can’t just go online and sing a song — they have come up with innovative solutions.” With restrictions being eased and live concerts resuming with limited audiences, a hybrid model is the one to look out for: one that integrates a physical and a digital live gig. Says Ram, “It is like watching cricket at home on your TV. You get to watch every hit and spin, so you are actually watching better cricket. Yes you are missing out on the sheer energy of 30,000 people cheering, so both become equally valid but different experiences.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/going-live-in-321/article33181443.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Emerging from the underground||Boom boom shaka laka boom boom shak! Street Cat’s gonna knock you back!   This bicycle ad jingle from the ‘90s is, in a way, responsible for the arrival of rap in South India. Suresh Peters, the composer, felt it would be novel to use rap, a genre unfamiliar in India then. The experiment worked. Inspired by the jingle’s success, Suresh suggested using a rap song for his friend’s upcoming Tamil film album. The friend, a young film composer, found the idea exciting. They, however, decided to make the song more local. Instead of fast-paced English, they went for Madras slang. Words like ghilli , goli , manja and more made it to the song. The song was a mix of folk and rap. It was refreshingly new yet so familiar. It became a pop-culture phenomenon. Twenty-six years later, Suresh is grateful but also mildly miffed about making ‘Petta Rap’ with his composer friend, AR Rahman. “I have made music of various genres after that. But I am still mistakenly labelled as a rapper because of that one song,” he laughs. Such was the impact of ‘that one song’. Arivarasu Kalainesan (popularly known as Arivu), who is among the leading rappers in Tamil Nadu, says, “That was the first time a lot of us even heard the word ‘rap’.” Even a decade ago, rap in South India was rare. It was mostly confined to the fringes except for occasional appearances in films. Rahman, Suresh, Apache Indian, Blaaze among others familiarised the genre. But independent artists were sparse and largely invisible. Then sometime around the beginning of the previous decade, a slow-yet-steady emergence of such artistes, powered by YouTube and social media, began. Now, rap has become a part of mainstream music. A rythm of cultures Rap in South India has come untethered from its (bicycle) commercial beginnings and, through various artists, taken numerous forms. Though we are talking about the genre’s evolution in one part of the country, it is difficult and probably unfair to create labels such as ‘South Indian rap’, for it does not exist. The artists come from diverse backgrounds, they tell different stories and have distinct styles. Eboshi and Contra of the band Cartel Madras call their style the ‘Goonda Rap’. The sisters come from a mix of cultures — they are half-Malayalis, born in Chennai and raised in Canada. They are also among the few brown queer rappers. “We want our music to come at you with a rush of all the things that have gone into who we are. So when you hear Cartel Madras, you might hear a hint of Ilaiyaraaja’s synth mixed in with 808s [a type of electronic percussion sample]. You might see the rhetoric of [late political activist] Arrikad Varghese mixed in with a nod to rapper MF Doom. You might feel like you’re in Chinatown in Toronto, or somewhere in Chennai in the late ‘90s,” they say, via email from Canada, about their music. Meanwhile, in Kerala, there is Vedan (which means hunter in Malayalam), for whom rap is a tool to talk about social issues. He grew up in a colony close to the Thrissur railway station, where people struggled for necessities. “I didn’t want to be a rap artist. I just needed a medium to express these issues and I found rap,” he says. Voices of change Vedan is not alone. There are many young rappers whose works brazenly question the status quo. Arivu, who is a big inspiration for Vedan, is one of them. Arivu’s Tamil rap song ‘Sanda Seivom’ (Let’s Fight), for instance, criticised the Government’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. A follower of Ambedkar and Periyar, most of Arivu’s independent works deal with socio-political issues such as caste oppression, religious discrimination, gender inequality. “Rap was a music of the oppressed. People in the African-American community used it to express their pain and protest. I, too, use the form to talk about socially relevant issues,” says Arivu, “So, even when I write songs for a commercial film, I try to go beyond the usual hero-worship elements and write about the connection the hero has with society.” Telugu rapper Streetviolater’s works evoke a sense of helpless anger. His latest song, ‘Maranam’ (which means death in Telugu), is a condemnation of corrupt governments, media, education system among others. Like Vedan, Streetviolater also never wanted to be a rapper. “I was part of a rock band. But then, I realised that I had a lot of things to say as an individual. So, I started rapping,” he says. People in the music industry say that the following for hip hop music has increased exponentially over the last decade. “Hip-hop has been one of the biggest breakout genres in the country, especially after the release of Gully Boy . Hip-hop is coming of age and will grow into being a thriving genre in the country,” says Spotify’s Padmanabhan NS, the Artists & Label Partnerships Head, India. “While Punjabi and Hindi hip hop still dominate the desi hip hop landscape, there is definitely a burgeoning scene in the South,” says a spokesperson from JioSaavn. Streaming platforms such as Spotify and JioSaavn have been hotbeds for upcoming hip hop artists. With these avenues, it is now easier than before to start an independent music career; sustaining it is, however, a challenge. Kannada rapper Alok Babu R (popularly known as All OK), for instance, started his independent music career before the days of digital streaming. “Forget hip hop, there wasn’t an independent music scene in Kannada then. But we hung on, slowly got noticed. From zero views on YouTube [when we started], we got over a million for each song,” he says. Blaaze has a word of advice for young rappers. “It’s a cycle. You need to hit the mainstream for the world to take notice, then have an already established fan base or audience for your independent work to get recognised,” he says. Blaaze’s independent tracks ‘In My Fathers Words’ and ‘Ban The Crooked Police’ fetched him opportunities to work with Rahman in films. The popularity in films in turn earned him more appreciation for his independent works. “It’s more about creating,” he says, “Whether it’s in films or independently, the process is what you must love and that’s why longevity succeeds.”  I didn’t want to be a rap artist. I just needed a medium to express these issues and I found rap Vedan Rapper from Kerala||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/emerging-from-the-underground/article33181439.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Let there be light||The sun throws mellow afternoon light through the windows. Dancing keyholes of lancet-shaped leaves outside form patterns on the tiled floor. Like an abstract painting. Like Chennai-based photographer Madhavan Palanisamy’s pictures. The 44-year-old award winning lensman has, in most of his projects, shot images that reflect the real world but cloaked them in a veneer of the fantastical and imaginative. His latest, The Reflector, created over two days in October, is a tribute to the lightmen of Chennai. “They are cupids of light, agents of the moon, human boom-rods. They can climb any mountain top or tree or anything to reflect the light. A jovial bunch, they run around shouting instructions to their fellow-agents and responding ‘ready-sir!’ to the DOP or the photographer. These men are super-heroes in their own right. The Reflector is their story,” says Madhavan over phone. Coimbatore-born Madhavan won Lensculture’s B&W Series award in 2019 (Lensculture is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching resources for discovering contemporary photography talent around the world) for his work Appa and Other Animals, a tribute to the time spent with his late father, the famous writer and literary critic Kovai Gnani. Madhavan’s work that choreographs portraiture and documentary aims to create an empathetic link between viewer and subject, a reflection of his own journey with detours through a degree in Biochemistry and work in advertising before he found his calling in photography. He has since metamorphosed into portraiture, photographing celebrities, sustainable fashion and human stories. “The pandemic restricted travel and commercial jobs but also gave artists time to dwell on certain aspects of life that are often hijacked by conventional work. The award pushed me to work on telling more stories of ordinary folk,” he says. Which is how Madhavan came to tell the tale of the lightmen, who are among the silent sentinels of the film, television and photography industries, going about sets and studios lugging lights and strobes with an earnestness that ensures productivity. “They know how to shape the light and the mood, but with the industry shut down due to the pandemic, a lot of these men were without jobs, income or food. Even now, as the industry opens up slowly, they are unable to find a sustainable living. The jobs are high-risk, but most of them are not part of any union which makes it more difficult for them to find work. The Reflector is a part-docu, part-fantasy story about these men who use their dinner plates to reflect the light and bring attention to their condition,” he adds. Madhavan shot the series on film using a Rolleicord TLR camera, a 60-year-old antique for the square pictures, and a more modern Contax G2 for the horizontal pictures. He rounded up old faithfuls — some like Ramesh Kumar, a darkroom printer and photographer had taught him in his early years. Some like “well-known lightmen Mohan and Mohaideen, fondly called bhai had brought their team for the shoot. Suresh, who runs the studio Setfire, Pandian and Vasu who work there, and Amal, a freelance assistant, were also part of the project”. The 20 people who featured were shot at abandoned sets, on sand heaps and atop sliding boards and staircases. Some had crowns and wings superimposed on them. Others had billboards for faces. But the one object that linked them was a dinner plate — that shone like the sun, the moon’s reflection in a puddle, a beam of light from a lighthouse, and as the ardour of a man who knows he holds the light to illumine a good picture. The pictures shot in black-and-white were processed by Karthik Thorali at Madras Atelier. The result is a surreal, palpable portrait of a community — obscure yet recognisable, familiar yet enigmatic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/let-there-be-light/article33181700.ece
26 November 2020||November 26 2020 00:00 IST,||Season of hope||K Eswari narrows her eyes as the afternoon sun beats down on her. She is grateful for every ray of sunlight — the rain last week did not make life any easier for her fellow potters — but it does make her head spin. She spends all morning cleaning clay that trucks ferry from the water beds of nearby Kanuvai and Thadagam to Udayar Veedhi, a colony of potters in Coimbatore’s Kavundampalayam. She picks stones and dirt off the clay, and lays it out to dry. It is crucial work — it forms the base for the lamps and pots her husband and other families will shape. The colony that consists of 50 families of traditional clay potters, has houses built around three kilns located in a depression. Only 15 families continue the craft, while the rest have taken to other means of living. The two months leading to the Tamil month of Karthigai are among their busiest time of the year. Luckily for them, after the lockdowns, people are now venturing out with caution. The colony is therefore limping back to normalcy. Orders from their agents have started coming in full swing, much like the previous years. “The past couple of months have been good for us,” says D Saraswathy, kneading clay that she soaked overnight in water. “Orders have started coming and we’ve been busy.” She will not forget the initial days of the pandemic, however. Neither will A Shekar. “It was a difficult time,” he says, shaping small pots on a wet grinder that has been fashioned into an electric potter’s wheel. With no way to transport clay, they had no work. But they did enjoy some perks. “In all these years of living in this colony, that was when we had the time to sit together and talk,” says Shekar. “We played carrom outside our houses, spoke about the good old times, got a chance to rest our hands. The lockdown also had its benefits.” Now though, the men and women of the colony are back on their feet. Lamps, still damp, are laid to dry on wooden planks; clay in various stages: some dry and some wet blobs, sit at their designated spots in the sun; finished lamps, brown and sturdy, stand in straight lines awaiting the agent who will transport them to sellers. “Uncle, they’re setting up the kiln,” hollers a boy at Shekar. The 40-year-old wipes his hands in a clay-stained cloth and says, “I’m coming.” He switches off the radio playing on his mobile phone that kept him company as he worked and prepares to leave. “The past few months taught us many lessons. For one, we learned to respect the clay we work with. We have started treating it like food; not a morsel is to be wasted,” he says. Even now, clay is not easy to come by — an issue the inhabitants of the colony have raised with the District Collector. “In the past, we would ride all the way to the water bodies on bullock carts to collect the clay ourselves; now though, there are several rules in place, making sourcing quite a task,” explains Shekar. But life goes on; the potters have learned to work with limited resources. “There is always demand,” says Shekar, adding, “People use our products right from birth up to death.” He is talking about clay utensils, water pots, lamps, stoves, and customised pots people of some beliefs use during funeral rituals. Saraswathy, meanwhile, has worked her way through most of the clay. She will now stomp on it until it turns smooth, from where the men will take over. In two day’s time, the clay will turn into lamps, and will travel to households in Coimbatore and nearby cities, to be lit with oil on the eve of Deepam. “My family did end up in debts because of corona,” she says, wiping her face with her sari. “But we are now on our way out of them; there’s hope.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/season-of-hope/article33181440.ece

26 November 2020||New Delhi,||Calm winds push Delhi’s AQI to ‘severe’ category||The air quality of Delhi and Noida deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category, while Gurugram almost touched the ‘very poor’ category, as per Central Pollution Control Board data on Wednesday. The air quality deteriorated mainly due to calm surface winds, which do not aid in dispersion of pollutants. “Winds are forecast to pick up and improve ventilation by Thursday and Delhi’s Air Quality Index is likely to stay in the lower end of ‘very poor’ category on November 27-28,” said monitoring agency SAFAR. The 24-hour average AQI of Delhi was 413 on Wednesday, up from 379 on Tuesday. The values for Gurugram and Noida were 299 and 414, respectively. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5 level in Delhi was estimated to be 2% on Wednesday. The number of fire counts in neighbouring States was 63, as per SAFAR. Earlier in the day, the BJP alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government was making a false claim that it distributed Pusa bio-decomposer to farmers to curb stubble burning, inviting a strong retort from the ruling party. “What can be a bigger lie than this? The bio-decomposer solution was sprayed on 2,000 acres of land across Delhi,” said Environment Minister Gopal Rai. He added that BJP leaders were not helping reduce air pollution “and are only interested in telling lies to the people”. “No BJP leader is seen participating in any campaign to reduce air pollution, they are just playing blame game and doing politics,” Mr. Rai said, adding that BJP leader Vijay Goel protested against the ‘Red Light On Gaadi Off’ campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/calm-winds-push-delhis-aqi-to-severe-category/article33181469.ece

The curbs, which will be reviewed on December 15, will allow all hotels, restaurants and marriage venues to remain open till 9.30 p.m. Night curfew will remain in force from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., announced the Chief Minister. Giving details of the new restrictions after a high-level State COVID-19 review meeting, an official statement said fine for not following guidelines shall be hiked from the present Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000. Mr. Singh has asked Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to work with departments concerned to encourage more private hospitals to earmark beds for COVID-19 care, it said. The Chief Minister has also directed the Health and Medical Education departments to make emergency appointments of specialists, super-specialists, nurses and paramedics to further augment the manpower which was recently strengthened with the recruitment of 249 specialist doctors and 407 medical officers.  Super spreaders On the testing front, Mr. Singh stressed the need to fully utilise the 25,500 daily RT-PCR testing capacity, and directed targeted and regular testing of potential super spreaders, including government officials.

Bhagwant Mann, MP and Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Punjab chief, said sealing of State borders by Haryana government was a blatant violation of the right to protest guaranteed by the Constitution. Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, Rajya Sabha MP and president of Shiromani Akali Dal (Democratic) accused the Haryana government of creating obstruction in the farmers’ stir and denying the democratic rights of farmers to protest.  ‘Undemocratic move’ “Sealing of the borders by Haryana police was unfortunate and had made it clear that the BJP-led government in Haryana was trying to stop the peaceful agitation of the farmers at the behest of the Centre government,” he said. Mr. Dhindsa also termed the detaining of farmer union leaders by the Haryana police as undemocratic. “Farmers have gathered on the border areas as we are not being allowed to enter Haryana, which is unfortunate and condemnable. We are opposing Centre’s farm laws.. If the Haryana government does not allow us to go we will sit on protest for at least a week on the border areas itself,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartaiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda). Sikh radical group Dal Khalsa chief Harpal Singh Cheema joined the farmers march to Delhi, stating people of Punjab were prepared for a long fight in case the Union government doesn’t concede to farmers’ rightful demand and repeal all three farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/parties-flay-haryana-govt-move-to-disrupt-farmers-movement/article33181460.ece
26 November 2020||NEW DELHI,||Overcast sky raises minimum temperature||It was an overcast day in the Capital on Wednesday with the maximum temperature settling at 24.4 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal for the season. The minimum temperature, however, rose to settle at 10.4 degrees Celsius, one notch colder than normal — after staying in single digits for a week. The overcast sky and high level of pollution brought down visibility as smog engulfed the national capital. The India Meteorological Department has forecast light rain drizzle on Thursday, but clear sky thereafter. The minimum temperature is likely to fall again by Friday to settle at around 7 degrees Celsius. According to data from the Met department, October and November have been colder this year due to the absence of cloud cover and rainfall. The city has received only 0.6 mm of rainfall since October 1, which is a 98% deficit for the season. The normal for the season is 30.5 mm. The presence of clouds brought down the minimum temperature in the city on Wednesday, which provided some relief from the cold wave that had been going on for three days with the temperatures staying five degrees below normal. The minimum temperature this month has been above normal only on one day when the city received light rain after Deepavali on November 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/overcast-sky-raises-minimum-temperature/article33181473.ece
26 November 2020||Ghaziabad,||Newborn found inside gunny bag||A newborn girl was found stuffed inside two gunny bags in Meerut on Monday. Rescued by locals, doctors said the infant was stable and was responding to treatment. An FIR has been registered against unidentified persons under sections 307 and 317 of IPC by Meerut Police. Sateesh Kumar, Station officer, Partapur police station, said he sent a PCR van after a call was received on 112 than an infant has been found in the garbage pile near Kailash Dairy in Shatabadi Nagar. “When we reached the spot the locals present said when they heard the cries of an infant, they reached the spot and found her packed inside two gunny bags. We took the infant to Pyarelal Hospital,” he said. The FIR says it seems the relatives of the child left her on the pile of the garbage.  ‘Child was lucky’ Senior paediatrician Dr. Amar Singh said the infant was only a few hours old and when she reached the hospital she was suffering from hypothermia and severe respiratory stress. “We put her in the warmer machine and provided supplemental oxygen. I would say the child was lucky. Helped reached her just at the right time. Now her vitals are stable. Oxygen support has been removed and we are trying to feed her. She seems to be on the path of recovery but still, she needs to be under clinical observation for some more time.’’ Mr. Kumar said they are getting calls for adoption after the video of the child went viral but due process would be followed. Lokesh Chaudhary, a resident of Delhi, who informed the police said, he was going to meet a relative when he saw a crowd of people near Kailash Dairy. “People had taken the newlyborn out of cement bags but they were reluctant in taking her to the hospital or calling the police. They seemed more interested in making videos. I offered to take her to the hospital but when nobody agreed, I dialled 112, he said. Rachit Kumar, who lent his jacket to the infant and helped her reach the hospital, said, “The way some people took her out of the bags was highly insensitive. She could have died.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/newborn-found-inside-gunny-bag/article33181458.ece

26 November 2020||Lucknow,||Prominent Shia scholar Kalbe Sadiq passes away||Prominent Shia preacher and scholar Maulana Kalbe Sadiq died late on Tuesday after prolonged illness. At 83, he was perhaps the tallest and most reputable Shia cleric in Uttar Pradesh and its capital Lucknow. Sadiq breathed his last at 10 p.m., said his son Kalbe Sibtain Noori. Sadiq was admitted to the ICU of a private hospital on November 17. “He was very unwell. His condition was deteriorating over the past three days,” said his son. In a health bulletin issued hours before his death, Era’s Lucknow Medical College said Sadiq was suffering from colorectal cancer with metastasis with severe pneumonia, UTI and septic shock with acute kidney shutdown and paralytic ileus. An educationist and Islamic scholar in his own right, Sadiq was also the vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board. His nephew and Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad said Sadiq’s death was a big loss not only for the family but also for Shias, Muslims in general and the nation. “It is an unbearable loss,” Maulana Jawad said in a statement issued from Jammu and Kashmir. Support to protest Despite his ill health, in perhaps in one of his last public appearances, Sadiq offered his support to the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act earlier this year. In January, he visited the Hussainabad Clocktower protest site in old Lucknow and expressed solidarity with the women who had assembled there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/prominent-shia-scholar-kalbe-sadiq-passes-away/article33181462.ece
26 November 2020||New Delhi,||HC seeks police reply on Tahir Hussain’s bail plea||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought response of the city police on bail plea of former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, who was arrested for his alleged role in the north-east Delhi riots. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait asked the investigating officer of the case to file a status report on Mr. Hussain’s plea while posting the case for further hearing on December 11. On October 22, a trial court here had denied bail to Mr. Hussain in three different FIRs related to the riots, noting that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration. Threatening witnesses The trial court had said that the public witnesses in the cases against Mr. Hussain are residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, the possibility of him threatening or intimidating them cannot be ruled out. Mr. Hussain has been in judicial custody since March 16. He had argued that there is no evidence by way of even a single video footage or CCTV footage to prove that he had participated in the riots or caused damage to any property. “Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant [Hussain], he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub/centre point for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi,” the trial court had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-seeks-police-reply-on-tahir-hussains-bail-plea/article33181464.ece

A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar noted that as per the status report filed by the police, “she was born in 2000, and therefore, even on the date when she went missing, she was a major”. The woman told the Bench that she went with the man of her own free will and accord and that she has married him. Police escort The Bench directed that she may be permitted to reside with the man. “We direct the police authorities to escort her to the residence of [the man],” the court ordered. “The police authorities shall also counsel the petitioner [sister and parents of the woman] not to take law into their hands or threaten either [her or the man],” the court cautioned. The court’s decision came while hearing habeas corpus petition filed by the woman’s sister claiming that she had gone missing or illegally detained. The plea said the woman went missing on September 12 and the family suspected the man behind it.

26 November 2020||New Delhi,||‘Mechanism of issuing challans faulty’||A petition filed before the Delhi High Court has claimed that the mechanism of issuing challans under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act of 2019 was “arbitrary and faulty” and needs to be rectified using better technology. Challans were being issued without proper and reliable technology in place and there was need for “standardisation of the technology used for monitoring traffic violations”, the plea by advocate Sonali Karwasra said. It said that there have been instances where hefty fines have been issued due to faulty equipment and then the penalties had to be revoked. She cited the instance of the alleged bulk recall of more than 1.57 lakh challans issued by the traffic department for overspeeding on NH-24 between August and October 10, 2019. The government “has not put the information regarding the technology being installed to monitor traffic violations,” the plea stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/mechanism-of-issuing-challans-faulty/article33181465.ece
