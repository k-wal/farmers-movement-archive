22 October 2020||New Delhi,||ICMR nod for low-cost COVID-19 testing device||A new COVID-19 diagnostic method, using a low-cost portable unit developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) after testing with patient samples showed an accuracy level slightly lower than the gold standard RT-PCR method at a fraction of the cost. The machine cost less than Rs. 5,000 to make and the test kits would each cost about Rs. 500, IIT-Kharagpur researchers told journalists on Wednesday. Once the viral RNA was extracted, the testing process takes about one hour. The IIT was in discussion with commercial manufacturers and start-ups, and hoped that the government would also subsidise the cost of test kits, they said. Comparable to RT-PCR In parallel testing with 200 samples containing a wide range of viral loads, IIT-Kharagpur’s COVIRAP method correctly detected 108 out of the 115 positive samples identified by an RT-PCR machine, and 83 out of 85 negative samples, meaning that it has a 94% sensitivity and 98% specificity in comparison to RT-PCR. “Initially, we were very sceptical, but we were delighted when it worked. The assays are comparable [to RT-PCR],” ICMR virologist Mamta Chawla Sarkar told journalists on Wednesday. “This assay holds the capability of detecting extremely low levels of viral loads that any other method based on similar principles of testing... In practice, this means that very early stages of infection can be detected, thereby isolating the patient and arresting the uncontrolled spread of infection in the community via asymptomatic patients,” she noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/icmr-nod-for-low-cost-portable-covid-19-test/article32913542.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Rajasthan to oppose new farm laws||Rajasthan is set to become the second Congress-ruled State after Punjab to formally reject the Centre’s farm Acts. A special session of the Assembly will be convened soon to discuss the impact of the new laws on farmers. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday said an Amendment Bill would be brought in the Assembly to nullify the Central laws, and a resolution adopted against the Centre’s stand on the issue of farmers’ welfare. The Council of Ministers took the decision to call the Assembly session at its meeting held here. “The Congress stands resolutely with our annadata s (food providers) and will continue to oppose the anti-farmer laws passed by the NDA government,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. The Council of Ministers laid emphasis on a mandatory provision for procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support prices (MSP). It observed that the removal of ceiling on the stock of farm commodities in normal circumstances under the Essential Commodities Act after the implementation of the new laws would lead to price rise and an increase in black marketing and hoarding. The meeting also deliberated on the restoration of powers for settlement of disputes in crop procurement by the civil courts. The State government had last month issued an order extending the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act, 1961, to the entire State in order to regulate private entities buying produce directly from the farmers. In another tweet, Mr. Gehlot lashed out at BJP president J.P. Nadda over his remarks on the imple- mentation of the Citizenship Amendment Act. Mr. Gehlot said the BJP’s insistence on implementing CAA had led to communal tension. “Now, when the corona situation is still very serious...it is time to overcome the crises the nation is facing unitedly and not disrupt peace and communal harmony,” Mr. Gehlot said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rajasthan-to-oppose-new-farm-laws/article32913540.ece
22 October 2020||Aralagodu (Shivamogga),||Families in Malnad villages reel under back-to-back heavy rain, landslips||Every time dark clouds gather overhead, people of Aralagodu Panchayat in Sagar taluk begin to worry. For, they have not yet come to terms with landslips and the destruction caused by heavy rain this August. Houses were damaged and entire areca plantations disappeared as heavy rain lashed the region for three days from August 4. Things have been particularly bad for two families of Nandodi village. The State government had sanctioned houses for the families of Sripada and Mahabalagiri as their houses were damaged during heavy rain in August 2019. The two families were sanctioned Rs. 5 lakh each. But during the rain this August, the houses that were being built were also damaged. Both the families had got Rs. 3.5 lakh each and spent it. However, as the structures developed cracks following landslips, the gram panchayat asked them to stop construction. Prasanna Bhat, son of Mr. Sripada, one of the beneficiaries, told The Hindu , “The old house constructed by my parents 30 years ago was damaged, and now the new one being constructed also developed cracks.” His family has shifted to Sagar. Similarly, Mr. Mahabalagiri’s family has shifted to Kargal village. Following landslips in the village, the district administration issued notices to 15 households nearby and asked the residents to shift. Offer refused Land was identified for rehabilitation at Kargal. But, the residents refused to shift citing that they could not travel from 12 km to look after areca plantations.“The administration identified the only land available for rehabilitation, but people refused to move there, and gave in writing that they would stay here only,” said R. Praveen Kumar, Panchayat Development Officer of Aralagodu. However, though they are reluctant to leave the place the families are worried about their safety. Instances of landslips have been reported whenever it rains in the area. Areca plantation, spread over two acres, was displaced completely at Arodi village in August. Not even one areca tree survived. Somashekhar, owner of the land that was displaced, said he has no alternative land to grow areca. The landslip has taken away the plantation that earned him about Rs. 2 lakh a year. “I don’t know how the government will compensate my loss. The plantation is over 50 years old. Even if I am allotted an alternative land, it will take years to develop a plantation,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/families-in-malnad-villages-reel-under-back-to-back-heavy-rain-landslips/article32913855.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,||Courts must presume innocence, says HC||“It is legitimate for the police, given the kind of training imparted to them, to distrust and suspect everyone but courts must always start with a presumption that all persons are honest and innocent,” the Madras High Court has said. Justice P.N. Prakash made the observation while quashing a First Information Report (FIR) booked against a 35-year-old clinical psychologist by the Greater Chennai police for having possessed both Indian and Swiss passports ever since he was a child. The FIR had been booked in 2018 at the insistence of a Deputy Passport Officer who accused the petitioner of having made a false declaration in 2006, when the psychologist was a 19-year-old, that he did not possess citizenship of any other country. However, on inquiry, the judge found that the petitioner had actually grown up in an orphanage in Chennai. According to his birth certificate, he was born on May 11, 1985. He was given in adoption to a childless couple in January 1986. His adopted father was an Indian national and mother a Swiss national. He grew up with his father, a nationalised bank employee, who had obtained an Indian passport for him when he was less than 10-months-old and continued to renew it periodically. Simultaneously, his mother had obtained a Swiss passport for him when he was a four-year-old and she, too, continued to renew it periodically. The petitioner had never used his Swiss passport to travel to any country during his childhood and even after. As a 19-year-old in 2006, he got his Indian passport renewed after giving an undertaking that he did not hold any foreign citizenship. He was reportedly not aware of the Swiss passport, he claimed, and Justice Prakash found no reason to disbelieve him. The judge pointed out that the entire issue of dual passports came to light only when the petitioner voluntarily wanted to surrender his Indian passport in 2016 in order to obtain an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. It was only after that a police complaint was lodged against him. Holding that the petitioner did not appear to have committed any offence, the judge said the question of prosecution would not have arisen if he had gone to Switzerland with his Swiss passport and surrendered his expired Indian passport at the Embassy there.

22 October 2020||KOLLAM,||COVID triggers mental health issues among elderly||More than six months into the pandemic, the COVID-19-induced social isolation has triggered a spate of mental health issues in the elderly. Helplines opened by the Social Justice Department receive hundreds of calls a day from senior citizen who are grappling with mood disorders and depression as their whole worlds have been turned upside down. From loneliness and lack of social interaction to missing grandchildren and weekly church service, the older adults find it very difficult to cope with the new post-pandemic routine. Lack digital literacy Moreover, many of them lack digital literacy and are dependent on others for a broader array of services. "We receive around 200 incoming calls from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and we reach out to more than 1,500 persons a day. There are elderly people who get in touch with us when they get anxiety attacks and several persons break down during the calls. Based on their issue, we forward the calls to counsellors. Though the call centre service was started for two months, it may be extended depending on the situation," says Alan Antony, an official coordinating the calls. Team of volunteers In each district, a team of volunteers and counsellors keep a tab on all elderly based on the data provided by the department. They mainly focus on persons who live alone or whose children fail to provide for them. "A majority of them had been going out on a regular basis before the pandemic and missing social life has been very hard on some. They feel very suffocated and most of them complain about insomnia, palpitations and excessive nervousness," says Smitha S, psychologist.  There are also some persons who are worried about falling sick or contracting the virus. "A neighbour testing positive or the death of a peer will generate fear and psychological trauma in them." Call centre number The department has circulated the call centre number through media and instructed ASHA workers and anganwadi teachers to connect all elderly persons with the facility. According to volunteers, there are calls that continue for hours as the elderly persons find it very comforting to talk to someone. But there is also some who have no access to phones, the only link to the world outside. Domestic abuse "If the parents don't have phones, we call up the children and arrange a convenient time. Based on a set of questions, our volunteers decide what kind of service they need and if they need regular follow-ups. There are also persons who face domestic abuse from their children and caregivers. We have been able to sort a couple of such issues with the help of police," says Alan, who adds that they would be able to attend more calls if not for some recurring server issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-triggers-mental-health-issues-among-elderly/article32913725.ece
22 October 2020||Belagavi,||The boys who have made Bidar proud||Mohammad Arbaaz Ahmed was in eighth standard when his father suffered a paralytic stroke. He remembers his brothers carrying their father Mohammad Saleemoddin to hospitals in Basava Kalyan and Bidar. Doctors said that it may be a result of an accident or injury in the past. They began a series of treatments, but little came of it. He lost his job and was barely mobile. His wife started working as a house help to keep the hearth warm. Saleemoddin was a lorry driver handling goods vehicles between Mumbai and Hyderabad. He worked overtime to feed his large family and send his children to school. But the illness affected the family badly. This, however, did not deter the children from succeeding in school. His eldest son got into an engineering college, another got into medicine and the third became a dentist. Arbaaz, who has obtained the 85th rank in the NEET all India rankings and the third rank in the State, says that his brothers who succeed in the face of adversity, inspired him. “My parents also supported me. Four years ago my father suffered a stroke and became bed-ridden for months. But he never asked me to quit studying or take up a job. He nudged me to keep studying so that I could become a doctor and help a lot of people,” Arbaaz told The Hindu . He says he is likely to be accepted into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. The studious youth, however, does not want to stop at MBBS. “I want to complete my post-graduation and then, take up research to create low- cost treatment for the poor,’’ he said. Arbaaz scored 97 % in PU and 92 % in SSLC exams. He joined the Bidar-based Shaheen PU College. The college admitted Arbaaz free, just as it had admitted his two brothers. “This year, we have admitted 300 students free, against our intake of 1500,” said Abdul Quadeer, secretary of Shaheen PU College that has produced NEET toppers Karthik Reddy and Arbaaz. Karthik Reddy’s father Rama Reddy is a professor of mechanical engineering in Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College in Bidar. His mother Kalpana is a government primary school teacher. “My elder brother is an engineer. He is a student of M.Tech. But I was not sure of what to do after PU. I got interested in medicine after discussing with my friends at the college,’’ he said. He was a day boarder who chose a semi residential model which meant he went to college at 7 in the morning only to return home at 9 p.m.. He says that he spent the lockdown period solving past question papers. The college staff came home to give the papers and collect the answer sheets every day. “We kept in touch with our teachers via phone and video conference calls,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/the-boys-who-have-made-bidar-proud/article32913668.ece
22 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab farmers lift blockade for goods trains till November 5||Members of as many as 30 farmer unions on Wednesday announced that movement of goods trains will be allowed amid the ongoing ‘rail roko’ agitation against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws. The decision was taken after the unions held a meeting here. “We have decided to let goods trains go till November 5. The decision has been taken in the wake of shortage of fertilizers and other agriculture-related inputs, besides the festival season,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda). Chief Minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the decision, saying it was in the interest of the State’s economy and its revival. He said the farmers had shown their love and concern for the people of Punjab with this move, as it will allow the State to get its much-needed coal supplies. He pointed out that the State had been facing a total power shutdown as a result of coal shortage. Capt. Amarinder said the easing of the blockade will help the State replenish its critically low urea supplies, thus catering to the urgent need of the farming community for fertilisers. Spat over Bills A spat broke out between the ruling Congress and the Opposition, including the Aam Aadmi Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal, on Wednesday over the three amendm-ents Bills relating to agriculture sector that were ‘unanimously’ passed by the State Assembly on Tuesday. The Akali Dal said the Bills have thrown the farmers of the State “completely back at [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s mercy”. AAP termed them parallel to the three Central agriculture legislations, which were not enough to safeguard the interests of the farmers. Capt. Amarinder accused both AAP and Akali Dal of adopting “double standards” on the Bills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/punjab-farmers-lift-blockade-for-goods-trains-till-november-5/article32914137.ece
22 October 2020||Mumbai,||Eknath Khadse to join NCP, blames Fadnavis||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and one of the tallest OBC leaders in the State, Eknath Khadse, on Wednesday resigned from the party, and said that he would be joining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Friday. Blaming former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for his humiliation within the party as well as in public life, Mr. Khadse (68) said that he had no complaints against the rest of the BJP leadership. “I was harassed by cases, including those of outraging the modesty of a woman and land grabbing. I have come out clean in every case. But the trauma I had suffered for four years was tremendous. Mr. Fadnavis destroyed my life,” Mr. Khadse, who was number two in the 2014 State Cabinet, said. The veteran BJP leader belongs to the first generation of ‘bahujan’ BJP leaders of late Gopinath Munde and late Pandurang Fundkar who did the ground work in 80s and 90s to expand the party. Mr. Khadse said that he would not have thought of quitting the party which he had helped grow in Maharashtra for 40 years. “I feel sad about quitting the party but I am left with no choice. I am certain that until Mr. Fadnavis is with the BJP, I will not get justice within. Therefore, I have decided to part ways,” he said. After being denied the CM’s post in 2014 by the BJP’s Central leadership, Mr. Khadse was always painted as a sulking figure who had to work under Mr. Fadnavis, a junior to him within the party ranks. He had openly said that the BJP should have chosen a ‘bahujan’ face as Maharashtra CM instead of Mr. Fadnavis. “I knew the party discipline and how the government worked. If Mr. Fadnavis was the CM, then I had to work under him and I was doing so. But it seemed he always felt threatened by my presence. I was spied upon, complaints were filed against me, inquiries were set up, and I was asked to resign,” he said. Mr. Khadse’s decision comes after months of speculation and despite efforts by the BJP State leadership to stop him from switching sides. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, “We tried our best to stop him. We hoped that he would not quit, despite being angry on certain issues. We tried to solve them. We wish him to do good work in his new party.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/eknath-khadse-to-join-ncp-blames-fadnavis/article32914246.ece

Yediyurappa, while refraining from making announcement on relief in the light of code of conduct ahead of bypolls, assured after an aerial survey of flood-hit areas in Raichur, Yadgir and Kalaburagi districts on Wednesday that compensation will be given as per NDRF norms. “We need another four-five days to get a clear picture about the damage caused by floods. As many as 14 taluks are affected in four districts and more than 43,000 people have been shifted to safer places. As many as 247 villages on river banks have been identified as sensitive and people in 117 of them have been partially shifted,” he said. “Over 5,000 people have been rescued by NDRF, SDRF, Fire and Emergency Services personnel teams. And, 233 relief centres have been opened and 38,000 people are taking shelter in them. I have told the officials to ensure proper supply of food and medical services to the people who have taken shelter in relief centres. Compensation for flood victims would be given as per NDRF norms,” he said. He was speaking to mediapersons at the Kalaburagi Airport after holding a meeting of Deputy Commissioners and other senior officers of the flood-hit districts. “The Model Code of Conduct is in force for elections and I won’t make any announcements. I have conducted an aerial survey and seen that there is drinking water problem in Kalaburagi city and rural areas and drinking water is being supplied through tankers. I have directed the officials to ensure that there was no drinking water problem,” said the Chief Minister. “Officials have told me that power supply was disrupted as electricity poles have fallen due to rain. The repair work is on and the power supply would be restored shortly. I have also directed the officials to take up road repair works wherever roads suffered damage in the rain and floods. I have told them to take stringent precautions to prevent the outbreak of any disease,” Mr. Yediyurappa said. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan, Karnataka Disaster Management Authority Commissioner Manoj Rajan and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-says-relief-for-flood-hit-people-will-be-given-as-per-ndrf-norms/article32913672.ece

22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Air pollution now biggest health risk in India, says report||Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases and neonatal diseases in India in 2019, according to the State of Global Air 2020 by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute. Overall, air pollution was now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, the report noted. Outdoor and household particulate matter pollution also contributed to the deaths of more than 1,16,000 Indian infants in their first month of life last year. More than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking. For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth. India faced the highest per capita pollution exposure — or 83.2 μg/cubic metre — in the world, followed by Nepal at 83.1 μg/cubic metre and Niger at 80.1, according to the report which sources its data from publicly available sources. Countries with the least population exposure are below 8 micrograms (μg) per cubic metre.  Marginal decline The government has claimed that average pollution levels in India are declining over the past three years but these have been marginal, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains which see extremely high particulate matter pollution especially during winter. After a decline in pollution due to the nationwide lockdown in late March and the months-long process of reopening, pollution levels are again rising and air quality has dipped to ‘very poor’ category in several cities. COVID-19, a disease for which people with heart and lung disease are particularly at risk of infection and death, has claimed more than 1,10,000 lives in India. Although the full links between air pollution and COVID-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease, creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia could worsen the effects of COVID-19. “This newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,” said HEI president Dan Greenbaum in a statement. “Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the deaths of these youngest infants.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/air-pollution-now-biggest-health-risk-in-india-says-report/article32914134.ece
22 October 2020||Kolkata,||Calcutta HC modifies its order but pandals out of bounds for visitors||The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday made minor modifications to its order passed on Monday by allowing a higher number of organisers to enter the Durga Puja pandals but said that they would remain no entry zones for visitors. A Division Bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee was hearing a review petition filed by Forum of Durgotsav, a group of Durga Puja clubs. The Bench said that dhakis (traditional drummers ) may be permitted, not within the pandal area, but in the no entry zone outside the pandal. Dhakis will have to wear masks and maintain social distancing, the HC said. For smaller Durga Puja pandals whose area is less than 300 square meters, instead of 15 organisers, the chart prepared by the respective puja committee can include 30 names and for bigger pandals, the chart can have 60 names. The number stated in the order on Monday was 15 for smaller pandals and 25 for bigger ones. The Bench said that charts with the name of organisers or locals who would be allowed inside the pandals should be hung up by 8 a.m. every day and all of them should not be present at a time. For bigger pandals, 45 people can be present inside and for smaller ones, 25 people are allowed at one time. The HC granted no other relief that will have the effect of diluting its earlier order including allowing sindur khela (a ritual practised by women on Vijaydashmi before the immersion of idols). The Bench had on Monday declared all community Durga Puja pandals in West Bengal as no entry zones and said that visitors would not be allowed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/calcutta-hc-modifies-its-order-but-pandals-out-of-bounds-for-visitors/article32913763.ece

22 October 2020||Belagavi,||Valmiki associations, students begin protest||Associations of the Valmiki community, students and government employees began protests on Wednesday demanding increased reservation quota and other benefits for members of the community. In Belagavi, Vijayapura and Baglkot, members of the Valmiki Brigade and Madakari Nayaka Sene took out rallies and submitted memorandum copies with their demands. In Belagavi, Siddaraya Shigihalli, president of the Karnataka State Government Valmiki ST Community Employees Federation, asked the government to implement the Nagmohan Das committee report that recommends a larger reservation quota for ST groups. He said that several undeserving communities had been included in the ST list by politicians over the years and that they were cornering benefits meant for the real beneficiaries. The Union government accepted the State’s demand for including four tribes to the State-specific ST list in 2019, taking the total number of tribal groups in the Karnataka list to 54. Meanwhile, Sri Prasannanandapuri Swami of Walmiki Gurupeetha set a deadline of October 30 for the State government to issue a notification accepting all of their demands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/valmiki-associations-students-begin-protest/article32913674.ece
22 October 2020||MANGALURU,||Fillip to proposal to shift office of SP to Puttur||The long-pending demand for shifting the office of the Superintendent of Police, Dakshina Kannada, outside Mangaluru has gained momentum with Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary reportedly agreeing to a proposal from Puttur MLA Sanjeeva Matandoor to relocate the office to Puttur. Talking to reporters in Puttur on Tuesday, Mr. Matandoor said that in the interest of maintaining law and order in the region, the State government has agreed to redrawing the jurisdiction of Mangaluru Police Commissionerate to include the areas coming under four Assembly constituencies of the district that are located along the coastline. The five taluks coming under the remaining four Assembly constituencies are proposed to come under the Dakshina Kannada police jurisdiction. Mr. Matandoor said that Mr. Bommai and Mr. Poojary have agreed to re-structuring the jurisdiction and for shifting the office of the Superintendent of Police from Mangaluru to Puttur, which will be convenient for the police to have good contact with people of the district.  “As an MLA from Puttur, I will take all the necessary steps to realise this long-pending demand,” he said. The land for building the quarters for the Superintendent of Police and a ground for the District Armed Reserve have been identified. “I will have further discussions with Mr. Bommai and Mr. Poojary on the issue shortly,” he added. The proposal to shift the office of the Superintendent of Police from Mangaluru has been pending since the setting up of the Mangaluru Police Commissionerate 10 years ago. The proposal gained strength following the unrest after the murder of RSS activist Sharath Madiwala in 2017. A senior police official, who has knowledge of these developments, told The Hindu that the proposal is not just about shifting the office of the Superintendent of Police but it involves the inclusion of new areas into the Dakshina Kannada police jurisdiction. “There are a host of other issues, including the one related to operation of the District Crime Intelligence Bureau, which are being looked into,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fillip-to-proposal-to-shift-office-of-sp-to-puttur/article32914220.ece
22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Govt. drops decision to cut salary||The State government has finally given up its decision to deduct one month’s salary of government employees and teachers to overcome the financial crisis induced by COVID-19 pandemic. A Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday decided to merge the six-days’ salary deducted for five months from April to August this year in the Provident Fund (PF) on April 1, 2021. The government will give interest as per PF rules for the amount being merged, but will allow withdrawal of the same amount only after June 1, 2021. For pensioners and those who do not have a PF account, the deducted salary (20% of the monthly salary) will be given in equal instalments from June 1, 2021. The State which needs Rs. 2,500 crore to pay the monthly salary of employees cannot afford another Rs. 2,500 crore and hence the decision to merge the deducted salary in the PF account, a communication from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said. The decision comes in the wake of the directive of the CPI(M) State secretariat to Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in view of the forthcoming elections to the local bodies, and the announcement of the pro-United Democratic Front (UDF)unions that they would seek legal measures and resort to agitation if the government went ahead with the salary cut.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-drops-decision-to-cut-salary/article32913726.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao has asked senior officials to take steps to guard against the danger of tanks in Hyderabad breaching in view of continuous rains and flooding of localities in the last few days. Mr. Rao said rains of this kind were never witnessed in Hyderabad in the last hundred years and that it had led to a massive flooding in localities. The flooding in localities and overflow of water from tanks outside resulted in tanks in the city receiving massive inflows. In this context, he reminded that the Met department had warned of more rains. Therefore, the official machinery should be geared up to protect the tanks as the water was still flowing. Steps should be taken to ensure that the likely danger of tanks breaching or their bunds making way was averted. People living in nearby areas should be alerted and shifted to safer places, the Chief Minister instructed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/kcr-calls-for-steps-against-breach-of-tanks/article32914176.ece

22 October 2020||Tiruchi,||Woman Dalit panchayat president observes fast||The panchayat president of Perugamani in Andanallur block observed fast on Wednesday alleging that the vice-president of the panchayat and other officials were discriminating against her. A Scheduled Caste woman, A. Kirthika Arunkumar, alleged that some officials were not cooperative. She said that three officials, including a ward member and the vice-president, had made false allegations against her. ‘They claimed that I was involved in some corrupt activities. This is false and is being done so that I will be removed from my post,’ she said. She claimed that the three officials have been boycotting meetings and programmes ever since she was elected. ‘They do not even enter a room if I am in it. They refuse to sign documents too,’ she said. She tolerated the ‘caste discrimination’ ever since she had been elected panchayat president but decided to raise a complaint after allegations were made, she said. ‘I have raised a complaint with the Block Development Officer several times, but in vain. I decided to draw attention to their atrocities after at least five complaints,’ Ms. Arunkumar said. She withdrew the hunger strike after the Block Development Officer V. Nirmala intervened and assured to address her complaints. ‘I have called for a meeting of all ward members and officials and will enquire about the panchayat president’s claims.

22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,||185 tanks in Hyderabad overflowing after rain||Principal Irrigation Secretary Rajat Kumar has said that all the 185 tanks in Hyderabad have surplused and overflowing following heavy rains over the past week. On the directions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Kumar held a meeting with irrigation officials and constituted 15 teams to monitor the situation at tanks round the clock and inform higher officials. By special powers, the Zonal Commissioners of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation were authorised to sanction works up to Rs. 2 crore for immediate repairs to tanks. Earlier, they could sanction works not exceeding Rs. 20 lakh. The sanctions will be given on the basis of inspection reports of the teams to be headed by Superintending or Executive Engineers. Speaking to reporters along with Engineer-in-Chief of Irrigation C. Muralidhar, he said except three tanks -- Pallechuruvu at Rajendranagar, Appacheruvu at Gaganpahad and Gurram Cheruvu at Balapur -- which suffered major breaches, none of the remaining 182 tanks were a concern. The repairs to three tanks were carried out within twelve hours. There were minor damages to 53 tanks. The unprecedented rains resulted in 60 to 70 cm of rainfall within a week from October 14 while the average annual rainfall of the city was 80 cm. The chief amounts of rainfall were recorded on October 14 (32 cm). October 17 (10 cm) and October 18 (19 cm). Reassuring citizens that the situation was not out of hands, the senior bureaucrat said 50% of de-watering was already completed. He admitted to problems of inundation in low lying areas where people were evacuated with boats of tourism department. He did not spell out the number of deaths nor encroachments of tanks as the police looked into casualties while encroachments were a subject matter of courts and sub-judice to discuss. However, he said all the tanks in the State were mutated to irrigation department. The government was in possession of records about encroachments. Irrigation officials were instructed to reduce the weir of tanks and release water to avoid breaches. The Irrigation department had requested government to release Rs. 10 crore for immediate repairs and another Rs. 40 crore for permanent measures. He appealed to people not to take selfies near tanks as they were standing on the edge of a danger. Three youths were washed away in this manner at Pallecheruvu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/185-tanks-in-hyderabad-overflowing-after-rain/article32913479.ece
22 October 2020||Paliganj,||When politics is an end in itself||For voters of Bihar, issues such as unemployment and corruption have taken the back seat, with the debates revolving around personalities: can Chief Minister Nitish Kumar retain his chair; will the BJP have a Chief Minister of its own for the first time in the State; and whether Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan can make or mar the prospects of Mr. Kumar? In Paliganj, Arwal and Sasaram, most voters across age and caste lines appeared more interested in discussing these political scenarios. “Forget about unemployment or mass migration in search of livelihood... these have been going on for years and years and will continue, irrespective of which party comes to power. But we are more interested in knowing whether Mr. Kumar will again be the Chief Minister or Chirag Paswan could be a spoiler for him,” Chandra Prakash Singh of Dawath village in Rohtas said, sitting on a platform with several middle-aged men on the premises of a temple. At the Karakat market, Pankaj Kushwaha, Rajendra Kumar and Shiv Shankar Singh were heading for their village on a motorbike, all without masks and helmets. Asked if they were not afraid of catching the coronavirus, Mr. Shiv Shankar said, “Do you see anyone here in the market wearing a mask or a helmet? This is normal, and if you wear these two things, people will stare at you.” Politicians sans masks “Even campaigning politicians do not wear masks,” Mr. Kushwaha said and went on to ask, “Okay, you are from the press. So please tell me if Nitish Kumar will remain Chief Minister or will go… will Chirag be able to do something or is he just creating a bubble?” Rajendra Kumar, in a white kurta-pyjama , smiled and turned away. He is a supporter of Mr. Nitish Kumar, the others said. At the Bikramganj block office too, people were engaged in an animated discussion on whether the BJP would have its own Chief Minister now. “I think, the BJP this time will get no fewer than 100 seats and have its own Chief Minister,” Ravi Shankar Singh said at a tea shop. “Not 100, but around 90,” Janardan Yadav added. The debate then turned to Tejashwi Yadav and the RJD-led grand alliance. “The RJD will get 70 to 75 seats, but the Congress will not get to even double digits,” Mr. Janardan Yadav said. Political analyst Ajay Kumar told The Hindu , “Bihar is said to be one of most politically aware States where people love to argue and discuss politics for hours and hours. But sometimes, they keep mum and throw only a smile when one asks them about their voting preference. We call them chupka [silent] voters.” About 100 km away, at Sakri, Madanpur Dhawa and Chakia villages of Arwal district, people seemed less interested in discussing issues such as rampant crime, farmers’ woes or the pandemic. They showed interest only in discussing how many seats the JD(U) would win. “Nitish Kumar’s party would win around 50 seats or, it can go even below 30,” said Anshuman Sharma, a postgraduate in political science from Magadh University. Asked why he thought so, Mr. Sharma said, “This time, he is being caught off-guard by none other than his alliance partner, the BJP. Don’t you see his body language these days while he addresses public meetings? He looks tired and defeated.” On the question of unemployment, he said, “It is an issue but we’ve lost hope from Mr. Kumar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP can do something.” Had Mr. Modi fulfilled his promise of giving a Rs. 1.25 lakh crore economic package to Bihar yet?’ “Not yet, but having its own Chief Minister, the party may think about it positively,” said Mr. Sharma’s friend Rajesh Chandrabhushan. “Yes, the Bihar election this time veers around Nitish Kumar — will he be Chief Minister again, will he not?” Mr. Kumar, the political analyst, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/when-politics-is-an-end-in-itself/article32913503.ece
22 October 2020||New Delhi,||J&K district council polls soon||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the adoption of the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, which was amended and notified by the Union Home Ministry on October 17. The amendment paves the way for the creation of District Development Councils (DDCs), whose members will be directly elected by the people. “The move will help establish all the three tiers of grassroots-level democracy in the Union Territory (UT) like in other parts of the country,” said Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar. Three-tier system “The three-tier system was not there in Kashmir before. They did not have the opportunity to elect their local representatives. This step redeems the promise made by the Prime Minister in Kashmir, and the Home Minister in Parliament. Now there will be early elections, and the power to manage local bodies will go to the people. Locally elected representatives will be able to do district and block level planning, and implement welfare schemes,” Mr. Javadekar noted. With the amendment, the DDCs will have jurisdiction over the entire district, excluding those areas designated as municipalities or municipal corporations. Political parties in J&K have expressed concern that the amendment will limit the MLAs’ role. The Assembly was dissolved in November 2018. Last year, the special status of the former State under Article 370 was revoked, and it was bifurcated into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the latter without an Assembly. Currently, J&K has been under the administrative control of the Lieutenant-Governor. The order issued after the amendment says, “Every district will be divided into 14 territorial constituencies to elect members of the body. The DDC shall consist of the directly elected members from territorial constituencies in the district, members of the Legislative Assembly representing a part or whole of the district whose constituencies lie within the district and the Chairperson of all Block Development Councils of the district.” Right to vote “All DDC members, whether or not elected by direct election from the territorial constituencies in the district, shall have the right to vote in the meeting of the District Development Council,” reads the amendment. “But the MLAs will have no voting rights in the case of election or removal of the chairman and vice-chairman. Only the directly elected members shall have the right to vote,” the amendment adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-district-council-polls-soon/article32913515.ece
22 October 2020||NALANDA,||Nitish puts his faith in women voters for a win||Quite separate from caste arithmetic and loyalties, if there is one constituency that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has courted, it’s been that of women. So much so that his controversial decision to impose prohibition in the State in 2015 was also guided by the opinions expressed by his female support base. This section has remained loyal to Mr. Kumar since 2010, and has also seen a steadily increasing voting percentage in successive elections: from 54.85% in the 2005 election to 59.92% in the 2015 polls, to nearly 60% again in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Male polling rates increased from 51% in 2005 to 54% in 2015. Women comprise 47% of the electorate of the State, and 24% of these voters are in the 18-29 age bracket. This increase in women’s voting and much of it coming Mr. Kumar’s way has been one of the main reasons for his success. In most of his public meetings, Mr. Kumar brings up his government’s focus on reservations for women in government jobs and panchayat posts as well as welfare programmes like Jeevika. He hopes that programmes like Jeevika, a skills and livelihood-based self-help group (SHG) project, will help him sail the choppy political waters he finds himself in currently. The programme has enrolled 60 lakh households so far, extending credit to women who had very little access to it in the rural countryside. Premsudha, a Jeevika member from a villa near Gaya, had a difficult domestic situation with a husband who had barely any income. “On top of it, my father felt that my husband’s family had mislead him as to his economic situation and wanted me to come away. I said that I was already married and would like to stay with my husband,” she said. In 2011, five years after she was married, Ms. Premsudha’s mother-in-law asked her to join an SHG with a contribution of Rs. 10 per week. “In 2012, I became a committee mobiliser, a ‘beat mitra’ and after that a micro enterprise consultant. I have availed loans upto Rs. 3,25,000 and bought a kirana shop for my husband,” she said. Micro enterprises In Mr. Kumar’s home ground of Nalanda, support for him among women is strong. In Kul-Fatehpur panchayat in Nalanda, Lakhia Devi, says that she has availed an SHG loan to buy cattle and start a small dairy business. “I took a small loan for ‘pashu palan’ (animal husbandry),” she says. Sushila Devi, who availed Rs. 75,000 as loan under Jeevika to add a couple of rooms to her house admits that while the welfare measures and reservations in jobs are moves that she is grateful for, the poor implementation of prohibition, with its spawning of bootlegging enterprises and local administrative collusion is not so good. “ Yeh prashaasan ko theek se karna thaa (The administration should have looked into it properly),” she says. The complaint is not a vehement one as it was a demand from women voters that led to prohibition, but the dissatisfaction could be the reason why Mr. Kumar hasn’t been selling prohibition as an achievement in his campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nitish-puts-his-faith-in-women-voters-for-a-win/article32913499.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Bihar needs an alternative voice’||President of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Asaduddin Owaisi says the people of Bihar need an alternative, explaining the reasons for allying with the Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The AIMIM is contesting 18 seats in the 243-member Assembly.  What is the AIMIM’s vision for Bihar? We started our political journey five years ago. When we contested six Assembly seats, we lost deposit in five of them. We have been consistently demanding justice for the most backward region of our country, the Seemanchal region. It should be granted special status. Bihar right now requires an alternative political voice that is different from JD(U)-BJP-RJD-Congress combination. Because during 15 years of Nitish Kumar or 15 years of the RJD, nothing has happened in terms of real development. In every parameter, Bihar is still behind the rest of the country. During the COVID crisis, the highest unemployment rate of nearly 46% was in Bihar compared to the national average of 26%. What was the compulsion to contest with such a disparate group of parties, like the BSP that has had a contrasting stand from you on all critical issues or Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP that decided belatedly to exit the grand alliance? Initially, we started our journey alone. Then we had an alliance with Mr. Devendra Prasad Yadav’s Samajwadi Janata Party. Later on, there was a lot of discussion to be part of a larger alliance, so that a consolidated fight can be given to the RJD and Nitish Kumar. As far as Mr. Kushwaha is concerned, questions were not asked till he was with the RJD or the BJP. Questions are raised only when someone allies with us. The meeting point for all of us is to form an alternative political platform. You are always referred to as a ‘nuisance factor’ in Indian politics, be it in Maharashtra, now Bihar and at some point you would be contesting West Bengal elections too... Well, if I am a nuisance to Congress, BJP, RJD and JD(U) then that means I am doing something good. All these nomenclatures — vote katua or nuisance — don’t matter to me. It only shows that we are becoming stronger on the ground. Last Assembly elections, the mahagatbandhan contested on only one issue, that is, ‘we will stop the BJP’. Nitish Kumar had gone to the extent of saying that he will work for ‘Sangh-mukt Bharat’. Lalu Prasad had said, ‘We will stop Mohan Bhagwat [RSS chief]’. All these three parties are to be blamed for the BJP being in power today in the State. The fault of deceiving and lying to the people of Bihar lies with them. Why should the Bihari Muslim vote for you instead of the RJD, Congress or the JD(U) who are already an established political force in the State? We are not an exclusive Muslim party. I, Asaduddin Owaisi, am not a Muslim leader. I don’t want to be a Muslim leader; that is not my ambition or objective of my political journey. Voters of Bihar should exercise their vote in our favour because the RJD and the Congress have utterly failed in stopping the BJP juggernaut. Five years ago they took your vote and now BJP is back in power. They were unable to put up a fight during the parliamentary elections in Bihar and because of them, the NDA won 39 Parliament seats. And another example of why you must vote AIMIM is the Kisanganj parliamentary seat. Our candidate Akhtrul Iman got 3 lakh votes, the JD(U) got 3.25 lakh votes and the present Congress MP got 3.5 lakh votes. Had we not contested, even that seat would have been lost. People have seen this game by so-called secular parties, who are interested in taking their votes, but they don’t have enough votes to stop or defeat the BJP. What happened to the RJD in the Lok Sabha election, how come even Lalu Prasad’s family members lost the parliamentary elections? So your sole electoral promise is to stall the BJP? We have always been opposing the BJP, continue to oppose the BJP.  During 15 years of Nitish Kumar or 15 years of the RJD, nothing has happened in terms of real development||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bihar-needs-an-alternative-voice/article32913501.ece
22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||High levels of daily recoveries continue||India registered 702 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, with 82% of them reported from 10 States and Union Territories. Maharashtra, with 213 deaths, reported the largest number of fatalities, followed by Karnataka (66), West Bengal (61), Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh 50 each and Delhi 41, said a release issued by the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday. India sustained its trend of maintaining the active cases below the 7.5 lakh mark for the second successive day, it stated. Over 10 lakh tests “With a high number of patients recovering every day, India’s steady trend of posting high levels of daily recoveries also continues. Recoveries numbering 61,775 have been registered in the last 24 hours, whereas the new confirmed cases are only 53,289. This is when 10,83,608 tests have been conducted in the last 24 hours in the country,” the release said. The total recovery figure now is 67,95,103. Data released by the Ministry said the higher number of single day recoveries had resulted in continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which was fast approaching 89% (88.81%). Seventy-seven per cent of the new recovered cases were observed to be concentrated in 10 States/UTs. Karnataka outnumbered Maharashtra, with the number being 8,500. Maharashtra and Kerala both contributed more than 7,000, said the release. India also reported 53,289 new cases in the last 24 hours. Seventy-eight per cent of this was concentrated in 10 States/UT. Maharashtra contributed more than 8,000 and both Karnataka and Kerala over 6,000. ‘Reduce fatality rate’ “The Centre has advised the States/UTs to aim at bringing down the case fatality rate to below 1%. Presently, 14 States/UTs are reporting it at less than 1%,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/high-levels-of-daily-recoveries-continue/article32913506.ece
22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||In festival cheer, 30 lakh Central staff to get bonus||The Central government will disburse bonus worth Rs. 3,737 crore to more than 30 lakh non-gazetted government employees within a week’s time in a bid to bolster spending as the festival season gets under way. The decision was taken by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told presspersons after its meeting. The decision to put cash in employees’ pockets on the eve of the festival season will boost demand and address a major concern of the middle class, Mr. Javadekar said. The money would be paid into bank accounts via direct benefit transfers, and payment would be completed before Vijaya Dashami, he added. Overall, almost 17 lakh non-gazetted employees of commercial establishments, such as the Railways, India Post, defence production, the Employees Provident Fund Office and the Employees State Insurance Corporation, will get productivity-linked bonuses totalling Rs. 2,791 crore for 2019-20. Ad hoc or non-performance-linked bonuses will be given to 13.7 lakh non-gazetted employees, totalling Rs. 946 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-festival-cheer-30-lakh-central-staff-to-get-bonus/article32913511.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,||‘Infodemic management a serious challenge’||Managing the “infodemic” has been a serious challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organization (WHO), on Wednesday. Virtually delivering the 15th JRD Tata Memorial Oration, organised by the Population Foundation of India (PFI) coinciding with its 50th foundation day, she said that even a commonsensical thing to do such as wearing masks has become a polarised debate due to the “infodemic”. Defining “infodemic” as having too much information, including false or misleading information, particularly on social media, she said that it led to confusion, risk-taking and ultimately mistrust towards governments and the public health response. She said that the WHO has been working with technology companies to address this challenge by directing the public to credible sources of information, taking down false and misleading information from online platforms, and developing chatbots in different languages that the public could use for accessing information. Dr. Swaminathan, however, stressed that tackling this was not a straightforward business as it was linked to people’s belief and behaviour. Pointing out the “shared appointments” initiative tried by Aravind Eye Hospital in Puducherry, in which more than one patient with similar problems are provided a consultation at the same time, she said that combining this with telemedicine could bring in a paradigm change. Highlighting that telemedicine was increasingly being used during COVID-19, she said that shared consultations could provide benefits such as learning from others, higher follow-up rates, and higher compliance to medication. She said that COVID-19 had exposed existing social inequities and the importance of investing in public and primary health infrastructure. “We see examples of countries where investments in primary healthcare over the past decade or two have paid off,” she said. She also emphasised the differential impact of the pandemic on women and children, and stressed on the need for governments to focus more on them. Poonam Muttreja, executive director, Population Foundation of India, highlighted the achievements of PFI in the past 50 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/infodemic-management-a-serious-challenge/article32913519.ece
22 October 2020||Washington DC,||Group of Senators backs Australia’s inclusion||A bipartisan group of Senators has written to India’s Ambassador to the United States Taranjit Singh Sandhu backing India’s decision to invite Australia to the annual Malabar naval exercise. The letter also asks India to join the Blue Dot Network — a U.S.-led collaboration with Australia and Japan that supports private-sector led infrastructure financing opportunities in response to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The letter says strengthening the Quad — the group comprising India, the U.S., Australia and Japan — has become especially important in the face of China’s “rising military and economic assertiveness”. “We write in strong support of India’s decision to formally invite Australia to participate in the annual Exercise Malabar, which was made following the recent 2+2 ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue [the Quad] in Tokyo,” the Senators wrote. India’s invitation to Australia to join this year’s exercise comes three years after Canberra had asked to join the programme. The Senators’ letter called Australia a “uniquely capable and stalwart partner,” saying its addition to the Malabar exercise would provide increased interoperability, strengthen threat assessment abilities and enhance “the maritime roles and missions of the four naval powers”. “However, of equal importance is the symbolic nature of Australia’s inclusion in Malabar, marking the first time that the United States, India, Japan and Australia will engage collectively at the military level since the formation of the Quad and the Quad-plus-Singapore naval exercises held in September 2007,” the Senators wrote. “In the face of China’s rising military and economic assertiveness, strengthening of the Quad has become increasingly important. From the South China Sea to the Himalayas, Beijing continues to use methods of intimidation and territorial aggression to test the resolve of regional actors,” the letter says. Signatories include co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus John Cornyn (Republican, Texas) and Mark Warner (Democrat, Virgina). The list also includes David Perdue of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/group-of-senators-backs-australias-inclusion/article32913523.ece
22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Welfare fund board soon for MGNREGS workers in Kerala||The State government is planning to promulgate an Ordinance for a welfare fund board for Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers. A first such initiative by a State, this would provide them with pension, medical assistance, educational assistance for their children and other benefits. The welfare fund has been under the government's consideration for the past few months, but with the prevailing COVID-19 situation the Bill could not be presented in the Assembly. Now, the plan is to promulgate an Ordinance to get the scheme started.  Pension benefits The benefits will be for workers who have completed the age of 60 and have paid contributions for not fewer than five years. For those who have paid the contributions for not fewer than 10 years, their families will get the benefits in case of the beneficiary's death. The workers who have completed the age of 60 will be entitled to pension, even though they are allowed to work until the age of 75. The fund also provides medical assistance, educational assistance for children, funds for marriage and also family benefits. The workers will have to pay a nominal monthly amount of around Rs. 50 as contribution. The detailed rules are being framed. Curbs may go "We have 20 lakh active workers under the MGNREGS and they all stand to benefit. In addition, there are around 2 lakh workers in the Ayyankali Employment Guarantee Scheme who can also join in this welfare fund. Those who take part as stop-gap arrangements will not be considered," said a source in the Local Self- Government Department. The government is also planning to remove the pandemic-time restrictions regarding the maximum age of workers permitted to take part in MGNREGS works. After the pandemic began, the maximum age of workers was reduced from 75 to 65 as per an order from the Home Ministry. "Although we have had several phases of unlocking restrictions, there have not been any mention about this particular one from the Centre. Due to this, many are unable to get work. About one lakh people would be benefited if these restrictions are removed. The State government is considering relaxation of the restriction considering this fact," said the source.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/welfare-fund-board-soon-for-mgnregs-workers-in-kerala/article32913485.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Caste fault lines re-emerge amidst political ferment||The recent demands of the Kuruba and Valmiki communities for a better share in reservation, with the former seeking inclusion under ST and the latter demanding hike in reservation within ST, has again stirred the caste cauldron in Karnataka. Adding to the mix is the demand by the Panchamasali sect of Lingayats to be moved to 2A category under OBC. These developments come amidst political ferment, with questions being repeatedly raised about the longevity of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s leadership and a fiercely fought bypoll. A section reads it as a “backlash” against the political narrative of the State coming to be dominated by ‘upper’ castes (Vokkaliga and Lingayat) after a spell of Ahinda politics under Siddaramaiah. There is a renewed demand to accept the socio-economic survey (popularly known as caste census) report, which is said to show the count of the two major communities as being lesser than what is currently believed.  Mr. Yediyurappa, a Lingayat leader, reportedly sees these demands as “orchestrated” attempts from within the BJP to topple him. “The reservation matrix is like a beehive and Mr. Yediyurappa definitely doesn’t have the political capital to meddle with it. Fulfilling any of these demands would only mean reconstituting the matrix, an exercise that will leave none happy,” a leader close to him argued, seeing it as an attempt to “precipitate a political crisis”. Senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa, who in the run-up to the 2018 Assembly polls raised a banner of revolt against Mr. Yediyurappa with the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade, is leading the Kurubas’ demand for ST tag. The participation of a few RSS functionaries at related meetings has raised eyebrows. Though Mr. Siddaramaiah participated in the October 18 meeting, he is reportedly concerned over the “forces behind the movement” and has stuck to his demand for caste census report to be adopted by the government, sources close to the leader said. “I am not here to only talk of Kurubas. I am of the opinion that all communities with tribal characteristics must be given ST status,” he said after the meeting. At the same meeting, Mr. Eshwarappa assured that the State government will accept the caste census report. Sources close to the Chief Minister said he was not consulted by the Minister on the matter and termed the assurance as “mischievous”. A senior BJP leader perceived to be close to the RSS and the high command said the recent re-emergence of Mr. Eshwarappa as an OBC leader was a challenge to Mr. Yediyurappa. These developments also work as a counter to the prevalent argument that if there is a change of leadership, Mr. Yediyurappa has to be replaced by a Lingayat only. “The BJP may also be looking at cultivating a constituency beyond Lingayats,” said a leader. Mahasabha’s stand Meanwhile, sources in the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha said caste census in its present form “deliberately undercounts Lingayats”, as it counts subsects under various heads, some not attributed to the community. “We want all from Veerashaiva-Lingayat subsects to be counted together. We will challenge the report legally, if need be,” a senior functionary said. The mahasabha on its part, said it was not looking at an alternate leadership to Mr. Yediyurappa for now. It had recently anointed the Chief Minister’s daughter Aruna Udaykumar as the president of its women’s wing. However, the entire community is not backing the Chief Minister either. Panchamasalis, a Lingayat subsect upset over lack of representation in the Cabinet, has raised a banner of dissidence demanding a better share in the reservation. BJP MLA Basavaraj Yatnal, who has repeatedly questioned Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership, belongs to this sect. “Unlike before, the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community is not entirely behind Mr. Yediyurappa. There are fault lines and this is being exploited by sections within the BJP to topple him,” a source close to the Chief Minister said.

22 October 2020||Kozhikode,||Small units’ Ayurvedic drugs may have harmful metals||Ayurveda ‘arishtam’ made by a small manufacturer and available at a neighbourhood store may contain metals harmful to your health. It is better to be careful before gulping it down as an immune booster to contain COVID-19. For, the State government does not have a mechanism to regulate the sale of herbal raw materials that are used to make Ayurvedic medicines. According to officials in the Drugs Control Department, anyone with a licence issued by the local body can set up a store to sell them. Officials cannot check the premises or the quality of the herbs. Truckloads of medicinal plants are coming from other States as well. N. Vimala, former Deputy Drugs Controller in charge of Ayurveda, told The Hindu on Wednesday that herbal roots that are essential components in certain arishtams were found to have high content of metals such as lead and mercury. “Because of severe air and soil pollution, these roots could be contaminated. The manufacturers are supposed to wash them thoroughly and then dry them before use. However, only the big players in the Ayurveda industry bother to do so,” she pointed out. It is mandatory for manufacturers who have Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate to have in-house labs to ensure the quality of raw materials and final products. “But the equipment for heavy metal analysis are costly and smaller firms may not be able to afford them. So they outsource it to other places and the quality is compromised,” Dr. Vimala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/small-units-ayurvedic-drugs-may-have-harmful-metals/article32913798.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,||‘Singapore will reach out on travel bubble’||Singapore is looking at ways of rebuilding air travel in a way that is safe for travellers and residents, and the relevant agencies in Singapore will reach out to authorities for discussions on a proposal of the Indian government for a travel bubble with Singapore, High Commissioner of Singapore to India Simon Wong said. “India is an important partner for Singapore and the strong air connectivity between our countries prior to the pandemic had been critical to driving the flow of trade and investment, and people-to-people exchanges,” Mr. Wong told The Hindu in an interview. ‘Feel safe’ The High Commissioner thanked the Indian government for its support in helping repatriate around 400 Singapore citizens on two flights during the pandemic. He said around 50-60 Singaporeans are still in India as they feel safe here and want to continue their work in India. Mr. Wong said that despite the restrictions during COVID-19, Singapore investments are still coming in to India, although it has slowed down a little bit. “For example, in the last one year, between August of last year (2019) to August of this year (2020), we have about close to US$2 billion worth of investments,” he said. The High Commissioner, who was in Chennai for a series of meetings, also met Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday. He said that the government in Tamil Nadu was very serious about working with foreign investors, and Singapore was happy to be a part of this, economically. “I think the Chief Minister is looking at a forward-looking plan to transform the economy of [the regions] surrounding Chennai and, of course, Tamil Nadu. Singapore wants to be part of this process,” he said. Mr. Wong said that in the past one year, between August 2019 and 2020, Singapore companies had invested close to $500 million in Tamil Nadu. He added that between 2018 and now, Singapore companies had invested about $1 billion in Tamil Nadu. Historical links “I think because of historical links, many of our forefathers come from Tamil Nadu and speak Tamil. So, Chennai, Tamil Nadu in general, is a go-to destination for our investments. That is also the main reason why, despite COVID-19, we are making a trip from Delhi to Chennai. This is my first stop. And I feel that we need to, despite the health risks, we want to signal to the Tamil Nadu government that we take our partners very, very seriously. And we will also want to signal to our Singaporean investments that this is the preferred State to put their money in,” the envoy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/singapore-will-reach-out-on-travel-bubble-with-india/article32913476.ece
22 October 2020||Hyderabad,||A mountain of trash by the Musi riverside in Hyderabad||“This cannot be removed by sweeping with a broom,” say Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s sanitation workers as they await the big machines to clean the trash lining the road. On the northern bank of River Musi before the Purana Pul, garbage covers the bent trees, sidewalks, electric supply lines, temples built inside the river and washing stands of the washermen. The garbage ranges from furniture, electrical wires, used tyres, plastic waste, clothes and building waste. Where there is no garbage, there is sludge and muck. Environmental damage Away from the human tragedy wrecked by the rain over the past 10 days is the environmental destruction which has not yet been calculated. “We stay up there. The waste has been dumped on the road which is lower than the colony’s level,” says Latha, a resident of Sanjeev Nagar, who washes clothes in the river. “It is inevitable there will be an outbreak of diseases if the waste is not moved quickly and processed. The biological waste can get into the water system and lead to diseases,” says K. Sujata Rao, former Union Health Secretary when informed about the waste that has been dumped by the river. Multiple sewage channels in the city dump unprocessed waste into the river. According to the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, there are 23 sewage treatment plants on the Musi. The pollution control body pegged the cost of construction and maintenance of additional sewage treatment plants required to process the water flowing in the river over a 10-year period at Rs. 15,884 crore. Currently, only 43% of water flowing into the river undergoes some form of waste treatment. ‘No worry if processed’ “Whatever garbage that has been dumped in the river and in its catchment area must have been washed ashore. The river is dry most of the time and the waste must have accumulated there. If it is processed at designated sites, there should be no problem,” says V. Srinivas Chary of Centre of Excellence in Urban Development at Administrative Staff College of India. Till Tuesday evening, the civic body said it has removed 8,293 tonnes of monsoon waste in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-mountain-of-trash-by-the-riverside/article32914175.ece

22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Integrated facility for sea rescue operations||Sea Rescue and Disaster Management Coordination and Information Centres (SRDMCIC) are to be established in the State for timely forecasting of disasters, to alert the agencies concerned to be prepared for quick search and rescue operations, and to coordinate with State and Central agencies. A master control room and three regional control rooms will be set up and they will receive and collect information related to weather forecast, cyclone, tsunami warning, oceanic formations such as potential fishing zones, and wind and wave alert from various agencies. These facilities will take up the task of interpreting the data and translate them into local languages and undertake awareness programmes and preparedness activities between various line agencies. Coordination The control rooms will coordinate the actual search and rescue operations being carried out by various agencies. Timely feedback to the administrators in the State and Centre will be forwarded. Gathering of pre- and post-disaster information and compilation of the data for future planning and improvement will be carried out. They will also have to carry out mock drills and training to create awareness and prepare a community-based disaster management plan. The master control rooms will gather information from the three regional control rooms and coordinate the operations. With the working group that met on September 19 clearing the proposal, the government has given the administrative sanction for the Ports and Fisheries Department to go ahead with the project estimated to cost Rs. 68.2 lakh. Official sources said the master control room will be set up at a cost of Rs. 22.90 lakh and the three regional control rooms, at Rs. 45.30 lakh. The manpower required for the centres will be through redeployment of personnel and procurement through government e-marketing platform.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/integrated-facility-for-sea-rescue-operations/article32913801.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,||Bengaluru bears the brunt of heavy showers||South and southeast Bengaluru bore the brunt of heavy rainfall on Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning resulting in inundation in several areas. Kengeri, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Lakkasandra, V.V. Puram and Gottigere received over 100 mm of rain. A portion of a retaining wall built along a stormwater drain (SWD) in Gurudatta Layout near Hosakerehalli collapsed. “Fortunately, no casualties were reported, and other surrounding structures were not affected,” said a BBMP official. As a precautionary measure, eight families residing in two housing complexes near the site will be shifted to a service apartment until repair of the wall is completed. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad visited the spot on Wednesday along with senior officials. According to Mr. Prasad, the wall was built over 20 years ago, during the time of the then City Municipal Council (CMC). “This part of the city received over 125 mm of rain on Tuesday. The BWSSB is working on underground drainage near the spot. These factors resulted in increased water flow that led to soil erosion. We have already begun rebuilding the retaining wall, which will take a month to be completed,” he said. He added that of the 800 km of SWD network in the city, 400 km of retaining walls along the drains have already been either built or rebuilt. Work on the remaining portions is under way. Encroachments The area of the collapse is a revenue site. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said that over 1,100 buildings that had encroached on SWDs have already been cleared. “Clearance of over 700 more buildings is pending. There is a stay on the clearance drive till November from a court due to the pandemic. We will clear the encroachments soon,” he said. He added that measures to increase the carrying capacity of SWDs in the city would be taken up seriously. “We will ensure that more recharge pits are built and regular desilting of SWDs,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengaluru-bears-the-brunt-of-heavy-showers/article32913477.ece
22 October 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||CPI cagey about Mani group’s inclusion in LDF||The Communist Party of India (CPI) refused to declare openly on Wednesday whether it would welcome the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the Left Democratic Front (LDF) fold. CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran, who chaired a crucial meeting of the party’s State executive here, said an announcement about the future of Mr. Mani on the eve of the LDF conclave would be extremely untimely. “The CPI has not welcomed Mr. Mani outright. It has attempted to weigh the changes Mr. Mani’s shift in allegiance to the LDF has brought about on the political field. The CPI would state its case at the LDF meeting on Thursday. The party has a positive approach to all issues. It would not let go of an opportunity to weaken the opposition UDF,” Mr. Rajendran added. Mani untested Mr. Rajendran said the CPI was under no impression that Mr. Mani’s possible inclusion in the front would “abruptly reverse the course of the Meenachal river.” Mr. Mani’s purported strength in Central Travancore remained untested in the changed situation. Local body polls The CPI was singularly focussed on steering the LDF to victory in the local body elections in December. Assembly polls would come only later. He refused to state whether Mr. Mani’s likely inclusion in the LDF was subject to any timetable. The CPI felt that Mr. Mani’s abandonment of the UDF had weakened the Opposition considerably. The party saw no rationale for opposing Mr. Mani. The Kerala Congress (M) leader has declared his support for the pro-farmer policies of the LDF. He has unconditionally accepted the LDF’s political programme, Mr. Rajendran said. The CPI has always balanced its ideological moorings with the practicalities of realpolitik. It has done so without compromising its values, he said. Flays Congress The Congress has abandoned its secular position and lurched to the right. It has aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party to discredit the government, Mr. Rajendran said. At the same time, the Congress has opened secret parleys with the Welfare Party of India and Jamaat-e-Islami to disadvantage the LDF in the election year. Mr. Mani’s desertion of the UDF has offered the LDF an opportunity for undermining the cabal, he added.  The party has a positive approach to all issues. It will not let go of an opportunity to weaken the UDF.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||ICMR nod for low-cost COVID-19 testing device||Unlike the RT-PCR machine, which could cost up to Rs. 25 lakh, and needed to be operated by a molecular biologist, the COVIRAP machine cost the IIT researchers only Rs. 5,000 to make and could be manufactured at even lower cost if economies of scale were applied by commercial manufacturers, said lead researcher and IIT professor Suman Chakraborty. “The COVIRAP method requires very little equipment, and is ideal for use in rural areas with limited facilities. The portable unit can even be placed on a table in a field, without the need for an air-conditioned laboratory. It can be operated by rural youth with minimal training,” said Dr. Chakraborty. However, the viral RNA would still have to be extracted in a lab. The machine employed an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, which did away with need for a thermocycler, he said. Once the sample was processed in the machine after being mixed with solutions developed by the IIT team, treated paper strips — similar to the pregnancy strips — are dipped into it, and the emergence of coloured lines will depict the presence of the virus. A mobile app has been developed to analyse the strips placed in a hand-held unit, in order to minimise human error. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification employs an approach similar to one in RT-PCR and has its advantages and disadvantages. Other laboratories, including those of the CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) and the Department of Science and Technology have designed devices based on this approach but none yet have been cleared by the ICMR and reached the stage of commercial manufacturing. FELUDA test FELUDA, a kit developed by the CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology), also is a ‘paper strip based test’ but employs a gene editing technology called CRISPR-cas9. Like COVIRAP, it too claims to deliver results in an hour — as compared with 3 to 4 hours in an RT-PCR— but are ultimately laboratory based tests and depend on skilled personnel to extract the nucleic acid RNA from a nasopharyengal sample prior to the actual testing. FELUDA, cleared by the Drug Controller General of India and the ICMR, has been licensed to Tata Sons and is expected to be commercially available later this month. The COVIRAP method could be used to diagnose diseases such as influenza, malaria, dengue and tuberculosis, Dr. Chakraborty said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/icmr-nod-for-low-cost-portable-covid-19-test/article32913487.ece

Both sides are preparing to hold another round of senior military commander talks, which is likely to happen later this week. An official source said both sides were working out the dates for the eighth round of Corps Commander talks. The last round of talks was held on October 12 at Chushul and a joint statement issued later said both sides held “a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of India-China border areas”. However, there has been no movement on disengagement and de-escalation so far.   The Indian Army said the soldier, identified as Corporal Wang Ya Long, had been provided medical assistance, including oxygen, food and warm clothes as protection from the harsh climatic conditions.   “India’s move is a goodwill gesture ahead of the eighth round of talks,” Sun Shihai, an expert at the South Asia Research Center of Sichuan University, told the Global Times .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chinese-soldier-held-in-ladakh-released/article32913489.ece
22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||EC takes note of laxity in following COVID-19 rules||The Election Commission on Wednesday reiterated its guidelines for campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic after finding that political parties and candidates had been lax in maintaining crowd discipline during campaigns. With campaigning for the Bihar Assembly elections and bypolls across States under way, the EC wrote to all recognised national and State parties to reiterate it’s earlier advisory to parties regarding social distancing, wearing of masks and other prevention measures. “Instances of such public meetings have come to notice of the Commission, where large number of crowds have assembled in utter violation of social distancing and the political leaders/campaigners are addressing the gathering without wearing masks in complete disregard of the guidelines/instructions. By doing so, the political parties and candidates are not only flouting the guidelines of the Commission with impunity, but exposing themselves as well as the public attending the rallies/meetings to the danger of infection during the pandemic,” the EC said. The EC said it had “taken a serious view of the laxity” and penal action could be taken against those who violate norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ec-takes-note-of-laxity-in-following-covid-19-rules/article32913497.ece

22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||India-Germany flights resume after 3 weeks||After a three-week impasse between India and Germany that led to the suspension of flights between the two countries, the Government of India on Wednesday announced the resumption of services. “In continuance to the existing Air Bubble arrangement between India and Germany, the flight operations of @airindiain and @lufthansa between the two countries have recommenced. Please plan your travels accordingly,” the Civil Aviation Ministry tweeted. According to a senior DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) official, both Lufthansa and Air India will run 10 flights each a week. This agreement is for two months. The disagreement between the two sides was primarily due to the fewer number of flights allowed to Air India (three or four weekly) compared with those allowed to Lufthansa (20 weekly). Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said Lufthansa was using the air bubble agreement to ferry “sixth freedom rights” passengers, or passengers destined to travel beyond Germany.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-germany-flights-resume-after-3-weeks/article32913517.ece
22 October 2020||New Delhi,||Roll back festival train fare hike, says Congress||The Congress claimed on Wednesday that Indian Railways was charging 25% to 30% higher fares on special trains being deployed during the festival season. Addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh demanded an immediate rollback and criticised the government for effecting a hike during the corona pandemic. “The hike is more for sleeper than second AC... For example, the cost of a train journey from Patna to Delhi in sleeper is Rs. 510, but in the festival special trains, it is costing Rs. 650,” Mr. Vallabh said. “There is no reason to increase the fares in current times” The Congress said though the move to deploy additional trains during festival season was a welcome move, the government should not have burdened the common man with an increased fare. “With millions of people having lost jobs in the last few months, the government instead of providing festival stimulus has decided to further pull the common man down,” Mr. Vallabh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/roll-back-festival-train-fare-hike-says-congress/article32913521.ece

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Licences suspended for not wearing helmets||The Transport Department on Wednesday started cracking down on people for not wearing helmets while driving two-wheelers, as well as riding pillion, by imposing fines and suspending driving licences (DLs). RTOs in the city checked motorists at 11 places, including Hudson Circle, Tin Factory, Kanakapura Road and Goraguntepalya. Cases were booked against 360 riders whose DLs were suspended. They had to pay a fine of Rs. 500. Last Friday, RTOs were instructed to suspend driving licenses for not wearing helmets for a period of three months. Risk of losing DL Joint Commissioner (Bengaluru) Halaswamy said, “On Wednesday, our officials booked cases against violators at various locations. Field officials have impounded DLs. Those who could not produce the original DL were issued notices and asked to surrender the original document at the RTO. When the DL gets suspended for not wearing headgear, the rider will be prohibited from riding two-wheelers. If he or she is found riding bikes during the suspension period, RTOs can even cancel their DL.” He added that a DL could be suspended for a minimum period of 3 months, but RTOs can decide on extending the punishment depending on the gravity of the case. The department's new drive has not gone down well with motorists. “To reduce accidents, the government must keep roads in good condition and make them pothole-free. No one is made accountable for the poor condition of our roads. Instead, the authorities are only keen on filing cases,” said Nagaraj M., a motorist. Riding without helmet accounts for the maximum number of cases among road traffic violations. This year, till September, the city traffic police had booked cases against 12.51 lakh riders and 20.72 lakh pillion riders for not wearing a helmet. A traffic police officer said that in the coming days, they will also refer cases for suspension of DL to the RTOs concerned. At present, the first offence of not wearing a helmet invites a Rs. 500 fine and Rs. 1,000 for the second offence.  No one is made accountable for the poor condition of our roads.

Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, had actively participated in various activities with Swapna Suresh and others who are accused of committing various offences, including the one under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of Mr. Sivasankar, the ED sought permission of the court to hand over the materials so far collected against Mr. Sivasankar in a sealed cover to the court. In a statement filed in the court, the ED said that it might require the custodial interrogation of Mr. Sivasankar at an appropriate stage depending upon the investigation. The statement was filed in response to an anticipatory bail petition filed by Mr. Sivasankar. The court will consider the case on October 23. Joint locker The statement said that Mr. Sivasankar had deposed before the ED that he had instructed his chartered accountant Venugopal Iyer to help Swapna to manage her finances. Mr. Sivasankar asked him to open a joint locker with Swapna and they later opened it. Mr. Venugopal had further revealed that Mr. Sivasankar and Swapna reached his office one day with a bag full of money worth Rs. 30 lakh. Mr. Venugopal was hesitant to handle such a huge amount of cash. However, Swapna had tried to convince him that the cash came from genuine sources and had asked him to keep the amount in the locker. WhatsApp messages between Mr. Sivasankar and Mr. Venugopal had revealed that the latter had informed Mr. Sivasankar regarding the deposits and withdrawal from the bank locker of Swapna. When Mr. Sivasankar was confronted with these facts during questioning, he had remained evasive and had stated that he never directed Mr. Venugopal to open a bank locker in the name of Swapna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sivasankar-was-aware-of-all-activities-of-swapna-says-ed/article32913846.ece

Tangedco, having issued strict instructions to the officials, has also fixed November 7 as the deadline for completing the works. A senior Tangedco official, sharing details of the works, said that special teams, including field staff from sub-divisional (assistant executive engineer) offices, would be formed for identifying, executing and finally monitoring the safety works at all section (assistant /junior engineer) offices. The safety works will involve closing open pillar/junction boxes, cutting tree branches that could cause damage to distribution transformers and the overhead cable network, covering exposed power lines above the ground by taking them underground as per standard norms, installing new poles in place of damaged ones and replacing old and worn out overhead cables, wherever necessary. The senior official said that in instructions issued by the chief engineer of the north and south regions, it was clearly mentioned that poles where electricity supply was served through overhead cable networks should be replaced. This included areas like Vyasarpadi, Ponneri, Ambattur, Avadi, Tondiarpet, Madipakkam, Pallikaranai, Selaiyur and Tambaram. Furthermore, officials in the ranks of superintending engineers/executive engineers will have to follow up and ensure that the monsoon preparedness projects are completed and in case of delay in their execution, make sure that punitive action is taken against the erring officials.

22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Not all procedures followed by police need statutory backing’||A procedure or practice followed by the police need not be jettisoned on the ground of not being backed by a statute if it had been in vogue for a long time and if it does not violate any law, the Madras High Court has said. Justice P.N. Prakash said this while rejecting the argument of an accused that the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) does not permit investigating agencies to file alteration memos before courts for clubbing two cases into one. “That there is no provision in Cr.P.C., for filing alteration memo is indeed true but it is a procedure adopted by the investigating agencies from time immemorial in Tamil Nadu and it had fossilized into an accepted practice,” the judge said. He pointed out that when a person gets attacked brutally, the police register a First Information Report (FIR) under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code and forward the document to the jurisdictional judicial magistrate. An intimation However, if the injured dies subsequently, the case would get altered to Section 302 (murder) of IPC and an alteration memo would be forwarded to the magistrate. Such a memo would not amount to amending the FIR because the latter could not be amended after registration. “Filing of an alteration memo is an intimation to the court that the investigating officer is now investigating a case of murder and not attempt to murder. It is merely an information provided to the court about the route taken by the investigating agency. “It does not require the formal nod of any court because investigation completely falls within the domain of the investigating agency, of course to be generally monitored by the court concerned and nothing beyond that,” Justice Prakash added. As far as the present case before the court was concerned, he said the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had reportedly received a call from a courier firm in Tiruppur on June 25, 2019 complaining about the suspicious nature of a consignment bound for Saudi Arabia. The NCB sleuths seized the package from the courier office and found that the consignor was the petitioner R. Westly of Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district and the consignee was Basimah Hadi Alyami at Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia. On opening the package, they found that it contained 500 Tramadol tablets, a pain killer that had been declared as a psychotropic substance on April 26, 2018 and brought under the ambit of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act of 1985. On June 26, 2019, the sleuths seized another consignment of 500 tablets sent by the petitioner to Mishal Yousu in Saudi Arabia. Though two separate cases were registered regarding the seizures, an alteration memo was filed to club them together. A special court for NDPS Act cases in Coimbatore accepted the alteration memo and hence the present criminal revision case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/not-all-procedures-followed-by-police-need-statutory-backing/article32913610.ece

So it is highly likely that the hybrid on-line and off-line MICE will become the future standard,” he said in his inaugural address at the webinar on ‘Future of MICE Travel Post COVID’, with a focus on South Korea, organised by Korea Tourism and The Hindu . Korea and India could closely cooperate to create a new digital framework in the MICE industry by combining Korea’s strengths in the hardware and product research and development with India’s strengths in the software and IT solutions, Mr. Kwon said. This kind of synergy effects had already been proved in the Samsung R&D centre and LG Software in Bengaluru, and it should be extended to other areas and companies, he said. Mr. Kwon also noted that India would have more Korean investments and become the regional and global manufacturing hub for the Korean companies, in line with India’s ‘Make in India and Make for the World’ policy. Suresh Chukkapalli, Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Korea, Telangana, and Chairman Emeritus, Phoenix Group, said India and Korea had many things in common in terms of culture and Korea was one of the safest countries and of late, filmmakers were encouraged to go and shoot in Korea. Sandeep Dutta, Marketing Manager, Korea Tourism Organization, said Korea had a world-class infrastructure and one of the fastest internet connections. An encouragement At a panel discussion, Aikta Tyagi, vice-president, Special Events and Facilities, Amway India Enterprises, said the company used the MICE as a tool to incentivise its distributors. Ashok Jaiswar, Group Head, Marketing B2C and B2B, Greaves Cotton Limited, said MICE was used to motivate and encourage the company’s retail and front-line teams. Shefali Khalsa, Head, Brand and Corporate Communication, SBI General Insurance, said the exhibitions component of the MICE had been worst affected by the lockdown to curb COVID-19. However, the MICE industry would bounce back with the coming of the festival season.  I don’t think that non-personal MICE can totally replace the face-to-face MICE industry.

22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai’s real estate market sees signs of recovery||Following relaxations in lockdown restrictions, the residential market in Chennai, that had witnessed a slump due to the pandemic, is now slowly showing signs of recovery. Real estate firms are even queuing up new launches. Estimates provided by real estate firm Knight Frank shows that city-based developers managed to sell over 3,085 new properties between July and September, when compared to 4,240 during the same period last year. The analysis done by Knight Frank pointed out that with developers innovating on their marketing prowess to include financial benefits, discount and easy payment options to attract buyers during the lockdown, sales have seen an uptick in the third quarter of 2020, over the preceding quarter. ‘Demand for housing’ “The lockdown caused a pent-up demand for housing. Homebuyers who were fence-sitting before COVID-19 are back in the market to take advantage of the reduction in interest rates on home loans and the availability of ready-to-move-in properties,” said Sanjay Chugh, city head (Chennai), ANAROCK Property Consultants. “Residential properties [apartments/plotted land] priced at Rs. 25 lakh-Rs. 75 lakh are witnessing maximum traction from homebuyers in suburban areas. The work-from-home [WFH] option has changed preferences towards larger apartments in the suburbs. Homebuyers are willing to travel a little further to buy a larger home to accommodate dedicated working space within their houses,” he added. Padam Dugar, vice-chairman and managing director of Dugar Housing Limited and president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI)-Chennai Chapter, said the post-pandemic home has become a necessity rather than an investment. “Lower home-loan interests have as helped sales in the city. It will get a better boost if the Tamil Nadu government comes out with some incentives, by reducing the stamp duty,” said Prakash Challa, chairman and managing director of SSPDL. Chennai’s residential real estate market also witnessed an increase in new launches, from 182 units in the second quarter of 2020 to 1,487 in the third, according to data provided by JLL Research (the comparison pertains only to the last two quarters, since the current crisis has no parallel, and has infused uncertainty that has not been witnessed in the past decades). The western suburbs (Porur, Ambattur and Padi) accounted for nearly 80% of the new launches during the quarter. JLL’s data showed that residential real estate witnessed pent-up demand, translating into sales, and 1,570 units were sold during Q3 2020. Sales were concentrated in the southern (Padur, Navalur, Perumbakkam and Kilkattalai) and western suburbs, which contributed over 80% to the quarter. Maximum sales traction was witnessed in the affordable and lower-mid segments. Subsequently, enquiries for larger-sized homes from a certain section of prospective buyers also increased, as preferences shifted towards homes with more open spaces and study rooms. Sales outpace launches “There has been a marginal decline in unsold inventory during the quarter, as sales outpaced new launches. While quoted residential prices remain stagnant, developers are offering various financial schemes, low booking amounts and other freebies to attract homebuyers,” said Siva Krishnan, managing director, Chennai, JLL India. Two real estate developers said they had managed to sell properties after relaxations in lockdown norms, but consumers were on a bargaining spree. One of them said he had to dole out lucrative incentives to ensure that the consumer picked his space. “Enquires are coming in, and demand is picking up at slowly,” he added. Most developers said with work-from-home options, consumers now wanted better spaces of their own.  The work-from-home option has changed preferences towards larger apartments in the suburbs. Homebuyers are willing to travel a little further to buy a larger home to accommodate a dedicated workspace within their houses Sanjay Chugh City head (Chennai), ANAROCK Property Consultants||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennais-real-estate-market-sees-signs-of-recovery/article32913587.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man undergoes liver and kidney transplant at Chennai hospital||A 35-year-old man from Delhi recently underwent a liver and kidney transplant at a Chennai hospital. The patient will be returning home shortly. Nitin Mittal, weighing 130 kg, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. He was registered at a hospital in Delhi for liver transplant and was undergoing treatment. During this time, his kidney function deteriorated and he was put on dialysis. He visited Gleneagles Global Health City, in Chennai, and consulted Joy Varghese, director of hepatology and transplant hepatology. Mr. Mittal’s wife wanted to donate a kidney and he was registered for cadaver liver transplant. When tests revealed that she was pregnant, the doctors put Mr. Mittal on medication and sent him back to Delhi. However, his condition began to deteriorate. His blood count fell to below five (normally it should be between 12 and 17). His kidney disease caused further complications. Within a year, he had undergone over 40 blood transfusions. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Delhi and his cardiac function was 30% lower than normal. He lost consciousness. The family became apprehensive and contacted the GGHC liver team for a second opinion. On their advice, he was transported by air ambulance to Chennai, nearly two months ago. Investigations at GGHC revealed that he had fungal growth in blood. He was admitted to the specialised liver ICU, for a fortnight, and put on round-the-clock dialysis for 3-4 days. His sister then came forward to donate a portion of her liver. “The transplant surgery took 14 hours. The patient was discharged on the 16th day after surgery,” Dr. Varghese said. “A dedicated team of critical-care specialists and nurses made sure the patient, and both the donors, remained safe from COVID-19,” said Selvakumar Malleeswaran, head of liver ICU. “We faced a big challenge in performing dialysis for the patient, who had such low BP, and had to perform continuous renal replacement therapy before and during the surgery,” said K. Muruganandham, senior consultant, urology and renal transplantation surgeon. Keyhole surgery The kidney was retrieved through a keyhole surgery. “The kidney started producing urine immediately after implantation. The positivity of the donors and the recipient aided in their quick and smooth recovery,” said P. Muthukumar, senior consultant, nephrology and renal transplant physician. Mr. Mittal will be on immuno-suppresants and will be periodically evaluated, the doctors said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-undergoes-liver-and-kidney-transplant-at-chennai-hospital/article32913588.ece

Ramadoss on Wednesday welcomed the decision taken by the Centre to extend the validity of the certificate given by the National Council of Teacher Education to candidates who pass the Teachers Eligibility Test and the Central Teachers Eligibility Test for lifetime. He urged the State government to create vacancies by considering the student and teacher ratio at the school level instead of at the State level and fill the positions with candidates still waiting for jobs.  In a statement, he said, “Validity of the certificate used to be seven years. When the tests were introduced, around 90% of the candidates who were certified got jobs. But since 2013, the vacancies were not filled properly and less number of appointments were made.” “With the validity of the certificates expiring this year, this is a welcome move,” he said. 80,000 yet to get jobs According to him, around 80,000 candidates are waiting to be appointed. “The Tamil Nadu government should fill the vacancies with those who have been waiting for years now,” he said.

22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Manora fort in Thanjavur gets a facelift||It stands as a symbol of the Thanjavur Maratha Kings’ loyalty to the British Empire. King Serfoji constructed a tower known as Manora Fort at Sarabendrarajanpattinam, 24 km from Pattukottai, in Thanjavur district to commemorate the British victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1814. As part of its effort to protect the historical monuments, the Department of Archaeology has carried out conservation works on the tower, the fort and the moat around it. “It is one of the 12 projects funded by the Asian Development Bank. The Chief Minister has already inaugurated three monuments and another seven will be inaugurated soon,” Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Minister K. Pandiarajan said. The 75-foot hexagonal structure has eight layers, and is surrounded by a moat and a fort. It also functioned as a lighthouse. A stone tablet in the fort says in Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and English that “it was constructed by Maharaja, a friend and ally of the British, to commemorate triumphs of British Arms and downfall of Bonaparte”. Manora is derived from the word minaret. It is also called ‘Jayasthampam’. The total cost of the restoration project is Rs. 2.3 crore. “We think that only Rajasthan is the State of forts. But Tamil Nadu also has a lot of forts, and it is our duty to secure a place for these forts in tourist guides. We are planning to publish a cultural text similar to the texts published by Rajasthan and Delhi,” Mr. Pandiarajan told The Hindu . K. Olimalik, assistant executive engineer of the Department of Archaeology, said the restoration work included a special coating on the walls to prevent erosion caused by the salty winds of the sea. “We have erected fencing, and given it a face-lift by creating a lawn around the structure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/manora-fort-in-thanjavur-gets-a-facelift/article32914304.ece

22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Diabetics in low income countries at higher risk of mortality: study||Lack of access to medication could be a reason for a higher risk of mortality in low income countries, an international study has found. The study, which looked at population across 21 countries, found that the risk of death due to diabetes is higher in low income countries than in high income countries. It compared people with diabetes and those without diabetes, in low, middle and high income countries and found that the overall mortality rate is three times higher among those with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes. The rate doubles when the risk of mortality among persons with diabetes in a low income country is compared to persons without diabetes in high income countries. “Primarily rates of cardiovascular events like heart attack are about three times higher in those with diabetes across all countries,” explains Anjana Ranjit Mohan, lead author and vice-president of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. “The overall mortality is higher in low income countries. In the lower income countries, the background mortality is higher among those with diabetes and non-diabetes. The mortality rate among those with diabetes is manifold higher here when compared to those in higher income countries,” she says. The study, Contrasting Associations Between Diabetes and Cardiovascular Mortality Rates in Low-, Middle-, and High-Income Countries: Cohort Study Data From 143,567 Individuals in 21 Countries in the PURE Study (Anjana et al), was published in the journal Diabetes Care . The researchers looked at the access to healthcare and medication across the countries. Dr. Anjana says, “We looked at the categories of anti-diabetes drugs, anti-hypertensives, statins and aspirins. In high income countries, about 60% of people are taking their medication correctly but only 20% in low income countries take their medication. This could be one of the reasons that the event rate is higher and the death rate is higher.” The researchers also felt individuals in low income countries were not prescribed drugs at optimal dose or at optimal time, which they termed “therapeutic inertia”. Access to finance This non-availability of medicines could be related to access to finance, as in low income countries most patients pay out of pocket for medicines. It could also be due to patient or providers’ belief regarding the safety and efficacy of the medicines prescribed. The researchers said individuals with self-reported diabetes had “higher hazards of mortality” when compared to those with newly diagnosed diabetes. They made a case for more widespread screening of the population so that risk factors are identified early and treated appropriately.  The rate doubles when the risk of mortality among persons with diabetes in a low income country is compared to persons without diabetes in high income countries||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/diabetics-in-low-income-countries-at-higher-risk-of-mortality-study/article32913592.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Encroachments pose hurdles to water flow||Areas in the western parts of the city are facing the threat of waterlogging this northeast monsoon. While steps are being taken to improve waterways and waterbodies, breaches in bunds of channels and encroachments have been hindering flood mitigation work. The Korattur surplus course plays a pivotal role in carrying floodwater from the Korattur lake to the waterbody in Retteri. The surplus course drains into an 11-acre Thangal eri at Kathirvedu and then again travels as a floodwater channel to join Retteri. J. Rammohan, a resident of Kathirvedu, said the lake acts as a buffer between the two major waterbodies. However, encroachments have resurfaced, blocking the lake’s inlet. This will lead to waterlogging in the neighbouring areas during monsoon. Moreover, residents noted that a portion of the bund and the outlet of the waterbody had been blocked to form a road to create a short route to the neighbouring streets. Similarly, the bund of the Red Hills lake’s surplus course was also recently breached, near Thandalkazhani, for a stretch of 50 m by encroachers. It travels for 15 km and joins the sea near the Ennore creek. However, it is proving to be a challenge for the Department to tackle the encroachments resurfacing on the waterbodies and waterways. Sources in the WRD said that complaints had been lodged with the Puzhal police against the encroachers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/encroachments-pose-hurdles-to-water-flow/article32914108.ece

22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Hike in onion prices due to hoarding’||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday alleged that hoarding had resulted in the hike in onion prices. In a statement in Chennai, he said even if the AIADMK government procured onion and sold it for cheaper rates in the open market, it was not clear whether it would be available to all. “The price of onion has increased to Rs. 130 per kg and it will increase manifold as the newly-enacted farm laws will allow hoarding,” the DMK leader charged. On war-footing Mr. Stalin said at least now the AIADMK government should realise the situation and not allow the implementation of the farm laws in Tamil Nadu. “The government should take steps on a war-footing and procure onion for sale in the open market,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hike-in-onion-prices-due-to-hoarding-says-stalin/article32913665.ece
22 October 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin urges Governor to give assent to medical bill||DMK president M.K Stalin on Wednesday urged Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to give assent to the Bill seeking to implement 7.5% horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in medical college admissions. In a letter to the Governor, he said the government school students could benefit from the reservation this academic year itself, only if the assent for 7.5% horizontal reservation Bill, passed by the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, was given immediately. He reiterated that the DMK had been demanding the scrapping of NEET, “which acts as a hindrance for rural and urban poor students to pursue their medical studies and to realise their dream of becoming doctors”. Mr. Stalin pointed out that the Bill was adopted in the Assembly based on the recommendations of Justice Kalaiyarasan to provide the reservation to government school students who had scored qualifying marks in the NEET. G.O. enough: VCK Meanwhile, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan too urged the government to pass a G.O. instead of waiting for the Governor to sign off on the Bill. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan argued that a law needs to be passed only if ‘reservation is going to be introduced for a category’. “The state government is within its powers to make an allocation for sub-reservation within the pre-existing reservation. Not only that, no special legislation has to be passed in these circumstances, and it can be achieved through a Government Order alone,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan recalled how the DMK government in 1977 constituted a high-level committee to look into rural students’ representation in education, and following the recommendations of the committee, implemented 15% reservation for rural students in engineering and medical seats through a G.O. “The subsequent AIADMK government under the leadership of Selvi Jayalalithaa increased the rural students reservation to 25%. That was also done through a G.O.,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said that though the orders were challenged, and subsequently struck down by the High Court of Madras, the court did not rule at any point that the State government does not have the power to issue G.Os. “While striking down these orders, the court only held that the State failed to show cause that students from rural areas were at a disadvantaged position compared to their urban counterparts. It also held that the government failed to justify the discrimination,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-assent-to-medical-quota-bill-stalin/article32913608.ece

Alagiri on Wednesday urged the State government to convene a special session of the Assembly and pass a Bill to bypass the Union government’s three farm laws, taking its cue from Punjab and Rajasthan. No powers “The Centre does not have any power to frame laws on subjects like agriculture, which are on the State List of the Constitution. This is against federalism. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has said he is also thinking of moving the courts on the issue. Rajasthan, too, is taking the same direction,” he said. Mr. Alagiri said the AIADMK had the opportunity to repent for its mistake of blindly supporting the Union government on the laws and “ betraying the State’s farmers”. “If the government does not pass a Bill against the laws, the AIADMK will have to bear the blame for the injustice meted out to Tamil Nadu’s farmers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pass-bill-against-farm-laws-alagiri-tells-tn-govt/article32913589.ece

22 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Traders seek reoccupation of Then Vadal Street||The Then Vadal Street that the Coimbatore Corporation cleared of encroachments has once again become the focus point with two groups attempting reoccupation. The Corporation, following a court order, had removed 85 makeshift vegetable vendors who had encroached upon the Street, which is next to the T.K. Market, in June this year. It also removed the barricades on eastern and western side of the Street to widen the road width. The Corporation did not stop with that, though. It provided two alternative vending places for the evicted traders but they were reluctant to move to either of the place – the first was a two-wheeler parking lot west of the Market and the second was in Ukkadam. Now, a section of the evicted traders had approached the Corporation saying that they would like to temporarily reoccupy the Then Vadal Street – till Deepavali – so that they could earn some money during the festive season. Sources in the Corporation said the traders had also met the powers that be and claimed that they had political patronage. Opposed to the demand, another section of traders said if at all the Corporation were to permit the traders, then they too should have a fair share of the road space and demanded that their members be given 50% of the space. Attempts thwarted As the claim and counter-claim gained communal angle, the Corporation informed the Coimbatore City Police, which, the Corporation sources said, thwarted attempts by traders to reoccupy the Street on Tuesday and Wednesday. The sources said the civic body was yet to take a decision on allowing the traders to set shop on the Street.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-seek-reoccupation-of-then-vadal-street/article32914122.ece

22 October 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||‘Corporation had little to show to NGT committee on progress in waste management’||The State Level Monitoring Committee of National Green Tribunal for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu has asked the Coimbatore Corporation to speed up the steps it had promised to take to decentralise solid waste management. Committee Chairman Justice (retd.) P. Jyothimani briefly reviewed on Tuesday the progress the Corporation had made since the last meeting in January this year. After taking stock of the current situation, he told the Corporation officials to speed up the construction of micro compost centres and widen the coverage of door-to-door collection of segregated waste. He cautioned the Corporation officials that he would not be lenient on the issue at the next meeting of the committee, sources privy to the development said. The sources further said that since the last meeting, the Corporation had very little to show in terms of progress, partly due to COVID-19 pandemic control work. But even otherwise, the Corporation that could have completed the micro compost centres work did not show progress on that front too. The Corporation could have easily extended the door-to-door collection of segregated waste to all the 100 wards as the COVID-19 lockdown provided an excellent opportunity for the civic body, they said. Collecting waste that was not segregated led to open dumping at the Vellalore yard. Expressing concern over this, the Chairman told the Corporation that this practice should be stopped, the sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-had-little-to-show-to-ngt-committee-on-progress-in-waste-management/article32914124.ece

Headmistress Ayyammal (55) and her husband Thangavelu (56), a retired employee of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, were arrested and remanded on Wednesday. The headmistress was arrested as she was allegedly aware of the sexual assault, which took place before the lockdown, and warned the girl against disclosing it to anyone, said the police. According to the police, the girl did not show interest in attending the online classes and wanted to get admitted to another school. As the girl repeatedly demanded for a change of school, the parents called on the headmistress to seek a transfer certificate. However, she told them that the shifting was unwanted. As the girl continued to insist on a change of school, the parents asked her for the reason and she disclosed to them the ordeal she had been through. She told her parents that Thangavelu, who used to spend time at the school when he comes to drop and pick his wife, sexually assaulted her in an isolated place on the school premises in March, said the police. Though the girl reported the incident to the headmistress, she scolded her and threatened her into not disclosing it to anyone, the police said. Based on the girl’s disclosure, the parents lodged a complaint with the All Women Police Station, Pollachi, which led to the arrest of the headmistress and her husband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hm-husband-held-on-charges-of-sexual-assault-on-student/article32913642.ece

Located one km. away from Talamalai – Dhimbam forest road, the settlement is nested inside the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) where 20 families comprising 90 members were residing. “We were using kerosene lamps during night hours in all these years”, said Almadhan (72), the senior most person in the settlement, who first saw electric bulbs lighted up in the settlement when automatic solar lighting systems were installed in 2018. But the system helps in lighting only two bulbs in each house and all electronic gadgets like television and radios were lying idle, he added. The panchayat had in 2003-04 constructed the tank and a motor room at a cost of Rs. 10 lakh. However, in the absence of power connection to the settlement, the tank and the motor room, remain unused. People said that they had deposited money for electricity connection in 2003, but later, the electricity board had returned their money claiming that the forest department had refused permission for installing electric poles and giving power connection,” said K. Raman of the settlement. A hand-pump helps them to draw water and fulfil their needs, which people say is inadequate. The hamlet has no anganwadi centre and children are directly admitted to the school-cum-hostel at Talamalai which is located five km away. “We have to walk for one km. to reach the bus stop and board the bus to Talamalai which is difficult for the children”, said K. Ramesh, who wanted a tar-topped road, anganwadi centre and power connection to the village. Recently, Tangedco officials had submitted a proposal to the forest department for installing electric poles from Talamalai to the settlement while the details for giving house service connections are yet to be submitted. Sources in the Forest Department said that if the required land for the project is less than one hectare, District Forest Officer, Hasanur Division, can give permission, while if it is more than one hectare, permission has to be obtained from the National Tiger Conservation Authority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/motor-room-at-tribal-settlement-lying-in-disuse-for-17-years-without-power/article32913656.ece

22 October 2020||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||Gang strikes on highway, takes away mobile phones worth Rs. 15 crore||Mobile phones being transported in a container were stolen, and the drivers of the vehicle were attacked at Melumalai in Shoolagiri in the early hours of Wednesday. The Mi mobile phones, said to be worth Rs. 15 crore, were stolen by gang suspected to be from Madhya Pradesh that had carried out similar attacks elsewhere. The consignment that originated from Sriperampudur Industrial Estate was crossing Shoolagiri here, when the truck was reportedly stopped on the highway at about 2 a.m. The drivers, Arun (26) and Kumar (29), were attacked and tied up by the gang. The consignment that included 15 cartons of 960 mobile phones each and a few more mobile phones were shifted to another vehicle. The gang fled the spot with the consignment. The drivers found help from the highway patrol, who alerted the district police. Totally, 14,500 mobile phones are suspected to have been stolen, though the police are still awaiting a formal complaint from the company as of Wednesday evening. The container vehicle that belonged to DHL courier was retrieved from the spot. Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar told The Hindu that the truck was stopped by the gang that was believed to have followed the consignment from the point of origin. “The same modus operandi was followed in Nellore, Chittoor, Guntur and Warangal districts of Andhra Pradesh, where a gang would follow the vehicle and intercept it at a desolate spot. We are yet to receive a complaint from the company, and we have the accounts of the drivers. The courier company’s vehicle is, however, intact,” Mr.Gangadhar said. Earlier, Deputy Inspector General of Police Pradip Kumar and Mr. Gangadhar visited the spot. Truck jacking incidents have occurred on the same stretch of the highway earlier. In 2015, a consignment carrying aluminium worth several crores was stolen and the driver was brutally murdered, sparking an inter-State strike by truckers demanding protection. Following the incident, truckers were issued an advisory to park only at designated lay-by along the highway, and not at desolate spots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gang-strikes-on-highway-takes-away-mobile-phones-worth-rs-15-cr/article32913639.ece

22 October 2020||KALLAKURICHI,TAMIL NADU||Kallakurichi police introduce dedicated beat system in 562 villages||As part of their community outreach initiative, Kallakurichi district police have introduced a dedicated beat system in over 500 villages across the district to ensure visible policing and improve police-public interface. Over 500 policemen have been exclusively drafted for this initiative that has been executed in all the 562 mother villages and hamlets coming under three police-sub divisions in the district. According to Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque, the interface will be used for sharing information, public grievances and serious issues. The police personnel were given a briefing about the initiative and the tasks were assigned to them, he said. Cops in the rank of Grade I constables to Special Sub-Inspectors of Police would visit the designated villages twice a week and build contacts by interacting with the village heads, village administrative officers and other prominent persons to assess non-policing issues and undercurrent tension, which if left unattended could trigger a potential law and order problem”, he said. The personnel will record any untoward incident and forward it to the officers concerned for immediate action. Gathering information The beat staff will also share their mobile numbers in the respective villages and gather information on social issues, revenue problems and previous law and order issues. A detailed profile of the villages would be maintained by every beat staff. The cops would also bring major issues that could later snowball into law and order problems to the immediate notice of the Inspectors of Police under whose jurisdiction the station is located. “This will be part of the policing system and will not only help the Department in addressing issues immediately but will also help nipping any potential problem in the bud. This system has now helped us in improving policing and defusing tension. We could prevent a caste flare up at Thirunavalur at midnight recently”, Mr. Haque added. The Inspectors of Police in the respective police stations will compile the reports containing the information shared by personnel at the end of every week and forward potential problematic issues to the attention of the Deputy Superintendents of Police. The DSPs will analyse all the reports and forward major issues that could be brought to the notice of the SP and the District Collector. Grievances relating to revenue department and civic issues including road facilities will also be brought to the notice of the administration. This initiative has not only helped in bringing down crimes per se but has also improved public satisfaction of the Department and helped us, Mr. Haque added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kallakurichi-police-introduce-dedicated-beat-system-in-562-villages/article32914296.ece

22 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Shifting of bus shelter constructed on Melur Road can ease traffic congestion||Traffic congestion on Melur Road opposite State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) depot in K.K. Nagar is a common sight. It is more pronounced during peak hours and whenever an SETC bus attempts to set out from the depot to go to MGR Bus Stand at Mattuthavani. The long-sized buses find it difficult to take a sharp left turn on to Melur Road on the narrow stretch of road. And they often block the entire Madurai-Melur lane and also come dangerously close to the opposite lane. The location of the bus shelter on Mattuthavani-K.K Nagar lane opposite to the SETC depot adds to the congestion. “This is the narrowest portion of the long road. That is why the median put up all along the road has not be erected on this stretch. But the halting of buses entering the city at this stop often leads to traffic jam,” said S. Jeyakaran, 58, manager of a private hospital in the vicinity. The attempt by vehicles, especially two-wheelers, to take a U-turn after refueling at a petrol pump near Central Vegetable Market and vehicles coming out of the vegetable market to proceed towards Melur add to the chaotic situation, Mr. Jeyakaran added. Share autos stopping haphazardly at the bus stop results in buses halting in the middle of the road, which chokes vehicular movement at the spot. Besides, those who alight from the buses often meet with accidents when they attempt to cross the road from behind the stationary buses. “Traffic police had long ago objected to the location of the bus stop,” an official in Madurai City Traffic wing said. When this proposal to erect the bus shelter was mooted in 2016-17, traffic police had disapproved of the move citing fatal road accidents on the stretch. “The officials then suggested shifting of the bus shelter a few metres ahead near Kaliamman temple at Mattuthavani,” the police officer said. That stretch along Melur Road is part of the wider portion of the road. Besides, there is lot of vacant space on the left side of the road. At present, a couple of vulcanising centres are functioning there. Even parking of large trucks and buses do not pose obstacles to the free movement of vehicles. “If the bus shelter is shifted there, a huge bus bay could be created for safe halting of vehicles,” he added. Agreeing with the police official, Mr. Jeyakaran says since there is no opening of the median at the spot, people would not attempt to cross the road near the proposed bus stop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shifting-of-bus-shelter-constructed-on-melur-road-can-ease-traffic-congestion/article32914215.ece
22 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||CRPF recruitment centres likely in T.N., Puducherry||The office of the Directorate-General, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), has said recruitment centres in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for the written examination for paramedical staff recruitment would be designated, if required, on scrutiny of applications. Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan had sought at least one centre each in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry because out of the nine recruitment centres designated there were none for the State and the Union Territory. Region-wise Responding to his memorandum, Manoj Dhyani, Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Recruitment), CRPF, said the designated recruitment centres had been selected region-wise on the basis of previous recruitments and anticipated receipt of applications. “Scrutiny of applications for the recruitment of paramedical staff-2020 is under way. After completion of the process, more recruitment centres may be designated, if required,” he said. Welcoming the open-minded approach of the CRPF, Mr. Venkatesan expressed the hope that the centres would be set up in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. He said recruitment centres should be announced at the stage of submission of applications itself. Lack of centres Lack of centres would have discouraged many job aspirants from applying for the recruitment. The CRPF should announce new centres and extend the last date for submission of applications, he said. The demand should be accepted, given the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crpf-recruitment-centres-likely-in-tamil-nadu-puducherry/article32913663.ece

22 October 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Appoint legal adviser in every district to assist Education Dept.: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has suggested that the State government appoint a qualified legal advisor in every district to provide proper assistance to educational authorities. It has pointed out to a number of cases related to the Education Department being filed before the Madras High Court and its Madurai Bench. A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the Revenue Department has a personal assistant (legal) to assist the Collector. Every Commissioner of Police is provided with a legal advisor. Similarly, every District Chief Educational Officer should have a legal officer to advise them. It is appropriate to have a legal advisor so that proper counsel can be obtained before the educational authorities pass any order. Due to lack of proper legal advice, many a time wrong orders are being passed by the authorities and the interest of the department is affected, the court said. The court was hearing a petition filed by educational authorities to condone the delay of 543 days in filing a writ appeal preferred against a single judge order. Considering the issue involved in the writ appeal, the court said it was constrained to condone the delay and officials responsible for the delay should be taken to task. No proper explanation was given by the department for the huge delay, except mentiong various dates. The lethargic attitude of the authorities cannot put the department as well as the State’s interest in jeopardy. The officials are expected to act swiftly, especially when it affects the State’s interest, the judges said. In many cases, fearing action under contempt of court, officials file appeals before the High Court, which will definitely cause loss to the state exchequer and also affect the government’s interest. Some kind of responsibility should be fixed on the officials. The court suo motu impleaded the Secretary to the School Education Department and the Director of Elementary Education as respondents in the case. It directed the respondents to take a decision in this regard and file a report to the court. The case was adjourned to October 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/appoint-legal-advisor-in-every-district-to-assist-education-department-hc/article32914216.ece

Jeyaseelan informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. The project was being carried out under his direct supervision, he submitted. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by K. Selva Kumar of Thoothukudi who complained that close to 300 trees were felled by the Corporation. He sought a direction to restrain it from cutting down roadside trees under the guise of infrastructure development. Nod for 260 trees During the course of the hearing, the Corporation Commissioner submitted that permission was obtained for cutting down 260 trees in three places and the uprooted trees were being replanted wherever possible. Miyawaki forests were being set up and for one tree that was being cut, 10 saplings would be planted and maintained, he said. Taking note of the fact that permission was obtained for cutting trees and they were being done so as per the conditions laid down, a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the allegations levelled in the petition were not substantiated. The High Court recorded the undertaking of the Corporation Commissioner and dismissed the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/miyawaki-forest-being-set-up-says-official/article32914372.ece
22 October 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Former judge’s remarks flayed||Well-known lawyers and activists Sudha Ramalingam and Henri Tiphagne have condemned former Madras High Court judge Justice C.S. Karnan for his disparaging remarks against former and present Supreme Court and High Court judges. In a video, which is now being widely circulated, they said Justice Karnan was heard passing vulgar and derogatory remarks against not only judges but also their spouses, other women subordinate officials and judicial staff. This act of the former judge was highly condemnable, and to allow this kind of mischievousness and perversity was against human ethos that they as citizens wished to always uphold irrespective of gender, religion or caste. “We are governed by the rule of law and judges are no exception,” a joint statement said. If he had genuine allegations against other judges, he could have used other avenues available in law, they added. The advocates urged the National and State Commissions for Women to suo motu take up the matter with urgency and seriousness to ensure that the act did not go unpunished and served as a deterrent to others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-judges-remarks-flayed/article32913603.ece

22 October 2020||P. SudhakarTIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Bridge collapse: civic body faces disciplinary action||The Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman has directed the Director of Town Panchayats to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Thirukkurunkudi town panchayat officials for failing to ensure proper design and construction of a two-year-old bridge that collapsed in November 2017. The 32.48 metre-long bridge with a vent height of 4.45 metres was constructed in September 2015 with funding of Rs. 40 lakh from NABARD. It is situated on Nambithalaivanpattayam – Avaranthalai Road across the Nambiyar. The bridge collapsed on November 30, 2017. Though the local body put the blame on increased discharge of water from Kodumudiyar dam following heavy rain in catchment areas triggered by Cyclone Ockhi, the public alleged that inferior construction and poor design of the vents led to the collapse of the bridge which was used by over 4,000 people from five villages. Though the duration of the construction was six months, the contractor completed it within three months and 10 days, raising doubts that improper curing should have been one of the reasons for the collapse. MDMK’s charge Demanding a comprehensive probe, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a demonstration at Thirukkurunkudi and sought action against the officials who compromised on quality of construction and design of the bridge. MDMK’s Tirunelveli rural district secretary T.M. Rajendran filed a complaint with the Ombudsman and sought action against the officials and probe by experts. Meanwhile, R. Sekar of Vanniyankudiyiruppu also filed a complaint with the Ombudsman saying Rs. 15 lakh allocated by the panchayat for the construction of a parapet on this bridge had been misappropriated without constructing it. When a technical committee from Anna University inspected the collapsed bridge, it identified various design flaws uch as improper location of piers that caused excess lateral thrust on one of the piers, inadequate design of scour depth and scour protection measures. The technical committee also raised doubts over quality of concrete and improper curing. The Thirukkurunkudi town panchayat, while maintaining that the sudden discharge of 19,000 cusecs of water from Kodumudiyar dam on that day led to the collapse of the bridge, did not submit any substantial evidence to prove it. The petitioner refuted this claim saying Cyclone Ockhi that ravaged neighbouring Kanniyakumari district had spared Tirunelveli district. Accepting the petitioner’s averments based on evidences submitted by him and the experts’ technical report, the Ombudsman, headed by former civil servant S. Ayyar, directed the Director of Town Panchayats to take disciplinary action against all the officials concerned. Now, Rs. 96 lakh has been allotted for construction of a new bridge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bridge-collapse-civic-body-faces-disciplinary-action/article32913622.ece

22 October 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||L-G appoints retired IFS officer as State Election Commissioner for U.T.||In what could turn out to be another flashpoint in the power struggle between the titular head and elected government in Puducherry, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi has appointed retired IFS officer Roy P. Thomas as the next State Election Commissioner of the Union Territory. In a notification, Under- Secretary to the government Giddi Balarm, on Wednesday said, the “Lt. Governor of Puducherry is pleased to appoint Roy P. Thomas IFS (retired) as the State Election Commissioner for the Union Territory.” The appointment would be for a period of three years with effect from the date he would take charge or till he attained the age of 68, whichever is earlier, the order said. The appointment of the SEC has been caught in a controversy since last year when the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution giving the power to the Cabinet to appoint a SEC for the Union Territory. The Chief Minister had then appointed former bureaucrat T. M. Balakrishnan as the SEC. However, Ms. Bedi issued an order annulling the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan. Subsequently, the Local Administration Department floated an advertisement as per the advice of Ms. Bedi inviting application for the post of State Election Commissioner. However, after the advertisement appeared, the Chief Minister issued a standing order declaring the directive of Ms. Bedi annulling the appointment of T. M Balakrishnan as “null and void” and “illegal.”  The appointment has been caught in a controversy since last year when the Assembly passed a resolution giving the power to the Cabinet to appoint a SEC for the Union Territory||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/l-g-appoints-retired-ifs-officer-as-state-election-commissioner-for-ut/article32914301.ece

CITU district secretary M. Karunamoorthy said their demands to put an end to purse seine fishing, to step up surveillance on mechanised boats which indulged in fishing close to the sea shore in violation of had not been addressed by officials of the Fisheries department.

Wholesalers at Leigh Bazaar said that the arrival of onion-laden trucks has dropped in the past one week leading to a hike in the price.

Esakkiammal, 48, of Kadanganeri under Ooththumalai police station limits was living with her two sons Mari Selvam, 29, and mentally ill Manirathnam alias Manikandan, 27, after her husband abandoned the family several years ago. When Esakkiammal was sleeping in her house on Wednesday afternoon, Manirathnam smashed her head with a grinder stone and she died on the spot. Minutes later, Manirathnam allegedly poured kerosene on his body and immolated himself. When a burning Manirathnam was screaming in pain, the neighbours rushed in and doused the flame. On seeing the body of Esakkiammal, the neighbours alerted the Ooththumalai police who sent the body to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for post-mortem, and Manirathnam for treatment.

22 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Water seepage continues at anicut||Farmers are worried over the continued water seepage from the Aachampatti Ayyanar Anicut in Budalur taluk despite some repairs carried out at the structure. The anicut built across a jungle stream is located at a short distance of around 15 km from the Grand Anicut and could hold water in about 200 acre spread if properly maintained. This year, rejuvenation of the water holding area and repair of shutters were taken up at a cost of around Rs. 50 lakhs under the ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme. Meanwhile, heavy rain lashed the catchment areas of the anicut at Gandharvakottai taluk in Pudukottai district during the first week of this month. Huge quantity of rainwater flowed into the anicut area only to get drained within two days as the shutters of this water body were not closed in view of the ongoing work, lamented villagers. On hearing the news, the Communist Party of India cadre led by party’s union secretary, R.Ramachandran visited the spot and staged a demonstration. Subsequently, officials from the Public Works Department, Aginiyaru division, assured them that the shutters would be closed properly. However, rainwater that accumulated in the anicut water holding area due to heavy precipitation in Thachankuruchi, Manganur and other hamlets in Gandharvakottai taluk for the past two days continued to drain from the water body through a gap in one of the shutters, claimed a Aachampatti CPI unit office-bearer, R.R.Mugil on Wednesday. Repeated requests from the locals and farmers to bring maintenance of the anicut under the Lower Cauvery Basin control has failed to evoke favourable response, he said and pointed out that it takes more time for officials from the Agniyaru division office, located at around 80 km away from the village, to reach the spot in case of any emergency. The water body served as the main source not only for agricultural operations in this region but also as a reliable source for recharging ground water table, he added. Meanwhile, a section of farmers in Vanniyampatti hamlet in Sengipatti Village Panchayat in Budalur block had cleared an encroachment on the water inlet channel of Panchanoorani lake with support from the cadre of the CPI and the CPM on Wednesday. The issue of encroachment was brought to the notice of the officials well in advance but no stone was turned to get the water inlet channel cleared of the encroachment. Though the region received good precipitation in the last few days, the lake remained empty. The farmers supported by the Communist cadres cleared the encroachment on the inlet channel to ensure the flow of rain water into the lake, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/water-seepage-continues-at-anicut/article32913600.ece
22 October 2020||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Entire harvested paddy will be procured||Food Minister R.Kamaraj has announced that the entire quantity of ‘kuruvai’ paddy harvested in delta districts will be procured. Talking to reporters at Thennamanadu in Orathanadu block on Wednesday, he said that private traders seem to have refrained from purchasing paddy from the farmers this ‘kuruvai’ season. So, flow of grains to the direct purchase centres in the delta districts recorded a steep increase compared to previous seasons. As of October 21, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation had procured 65 lakh bags of paddy from the farmers which is the highest in terms of procurement during the first month of procurement season which commences from October 1 every year. Around 40,000 acres out of 3.45 lakh acres of ‘kuruvai’ paddy cultivated in the delta district this season was yet to get harvested. Stating that all the paddy brought to the DPCs irrespective of the moisture content would be procured from farmers, he said that if needed additional DPCs would be opened in areas such as Thennamanadu where flow of grains was high. MSP When his attention was brought to the accusation from the opposition parties that ‘fair and reasonable’ minimum support price for paddy was not offered, he said that in 2010 when the main opposition party was at the helm of affairs both in the State and Centre the MSP offered to paddy was Rs. 1,100 per quintal. But now the MSP for paddy is Rs. 1950 per quintal, he said. Similarly, the present AIADMK government alone had allowed the corporation to hike the number of paddy bags to be procured in a day to 1000 bags from 800 bags in order to alleviate the sufferings of the farmers, he added. Earlier, the minister inspected the procurement process at the DPC in Thalikottai, Mannarugudi taluk in Tiruvarur district where he said that a letter had been written to the Union government seeking further relaxation in moisture content. However, every grain harvested by the farmers would be procured, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/entire-harvested-paddy-will-be-procured/article32913598.ece
22 October 2020||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||High drama at Vilathikulam as DMK, AIADMK cadre hoist flags||High drama prevailed near Vilathikulam bus stand on Wednesday evening after a group of AIADMK cadre tried to hoist their party flag without getting police permission. Former AIADMK MLA of Vilathikulam G.V. Markandeyan, who recently joined the DMK, submitted a petition to Vilathikulam police three days ago seeking permission for hoisting the party flag in front of the bus stand. ‘Must follow rules’ While giving permission to Mr. Markandeyan, the police made it clear that the DMK cadre, while gathering for flag hoisting, should not disrupt vehicular traffic and should wear masks besides ensuring physical distancing. The police also told him that public address system should not be used. Against this, backdrop, the AIADMK cadre also sought permission from the police on Wednesday morning to hoist the party flag near the bus stand but the police denied permission. However, the ruling party cadre said Vilathikulam MLA Chinnappan and the cadre would hoist the flag even without getting police permission. Police deployed  As trouble was brewing since morning, around 200 police personnel were deployed near Vilaathikulam bus stand on Tuesday evening itself. After Thoothukudi MLA Geetha Jeevan hoisted the DMK flag around 5 p.m., Mr. Chinnappan came in procession along with the AIADMK cadre on Soorankudi Road towards the spot where the DMK cadre had already assembled. When the police stopped them, the AIADMK cadre led by Mr. Chinnappan picked up a heated argument with the police. The situation compelled the police to use mild force to disperse them. After the DMK cadre left the spot, Mr. Chinnappan and the ruling party cadre staged road roko in front of the bus stand and the agitation was withdrawn a few minutes later after DIG, Tirunelveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu, held talks. Mr. Chinnappan left the spot after hoisting the AIADMK flag.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-drama-at-vilathikulam-as-dmk-aiadmk-cadre-hoist-flags/article32913595.ece
22 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvarur to Karaikudi broad gauge line lies in disuse||It was more than a year-and-a-half ago that the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi stretch was converted into broad gauge. Any wonder that the prolonged delay in resumption of regular train services on the 150-km section via Thiruthuraipoondi, Pattukottai, Peravurani and Aranthangi has caused huge disappointment to rail travellers. The demand for resumption of rail services has resurfaced yet again with the Pattukottai Taluk Railway Passengers’ Welfare Association seeking re-introduction of train services on the stretch that covers parts of Tiruvarur, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Sivaganga districts. Its president N. Jayaraman and secretary V. Viveganantham have sent a memorandum to the Minister of Railways. A copy of the memorandum has been sent to Tamil Maanila Congress president and Rajya Sabha member G.K. Vasan. The demand has been brought to the notice of the railway administration. The memorandum says the Tiruvarur-Pattukottai-Karaikudi is one of the oldest railway lines. It was taken up for gauge conversion more than six years ago. Passenger train services on Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section were completely stopped during 2012 to enable conversion of the stretch. The Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, authorised the section for operation of passenger and freight trains in March 2018. A year later, the CRS inspected the remaining stretch from Tiruvarur to Pattukottai via Thiruthuraipoondi and accorded statutory clearance in April 2019. The Tiruchi Railway Division initially operated Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) specials with minimum coaches on Tiruvarur- Karaikudi-Tiruvarur stretch by deploying mobile gatekeepers on board due to non-deployment of regular gatekeepers at over 70 manned gates falling along the lengthy stretch. However, the DEMU trains hardly found any patronage due to the lengthy duration of the journey. This was because the train stopped ahead of every manned gate and the mobile gatekeeper alighted from the train to close the gate for the train to pass through. The train would stop again for the mobile gatekeeper to board the coach. The exercise took a long time and the time taken by the DEMU trains to reach the destination was nearly six hours, which did not go down well with regular commuters. Further the DEMU trains did not have toilets. They were suspended and the stretch has not seen any passenger service since the lockdown was announced. “Introduction of rail services has been delayed in this section after completion of gauge conversion due to non-deployment of gatekeepers and other staff,” says Mr. Jayaraman. “The east coast delta area is being neglected without any rail service to Chennai. Elders, women, traders, agriculturists and fishermen are the most affected due to lack of train facility to Chennai for the past 14 years,” he said. Mr. Jayaraman and a few other office-bearers of the association have raised the issue with SR General Manager John Thomas during his visit to Tiruchi junction in December last. The association has urged the Railway Minister to reintroduce an overnight daily express train between Chennai and Karaikudi via Tiruvarur, Pattukottai and operation of passenger trains between Mayiladuthurai and Karaikudi on the route.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvarur-to-karaikudi-broad-gauge-line-lies-in-disuse/article32913573.ece
22 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||New courses sans teachers put college principals in a quandary||Government arts and science colleges find themselves in an unenviable situation this year after starting new courses without teachers. The government had sanctioned several new courses for the government colleges. For instance, B.A. programmes in Psychology and Journalism and Mass Communication have been started in the Government Arts College at Tiruverumbur without appointment of requisite faculty, sources said. The heads of government colleges are hopeful that the State Government will take cognisance of their difficulties and appoint teachers for the newly-sanctioned programmes. Since the plan for recruitment of over 1,000 Assistant Professors has not made progress, the government, sources said, contemplates appointing guest lecturers in large numbers to fill the vacant posts. Though guest lecturers are paid only Rs. 15,000 per month, there is still heavy demand for the posts. However, the college heads who had the authority to appoint guest faculty some years back have been pushed into a helpless situation in recent years. The Principals no longer have a say in appointing guest lecturers. The appointments are understood to be made at a higher level in an opaque manner and thrust on the college heads. According to a senior professor, the aspirants for the post of guest lecturers seem to be swayed by the thought that they would stand a good chance to be absorbed in time scale at a later point of time. "The fact that the Teachers Recruitment Board alone has the power to fill the faculty posts in regular scale has not dawned on the new aspirants for the post of guest lecturers," the professor said. There are only a few teachers on regular scale in almost every department. The guest lecturers, in fact, are the backbone for the hassle-free functioning of government arts and science colleges, senior teachers acknowledge. It was after much persuasion that applicants were convinced to seek admission for the newly-sanctioned courses. Absence of even guest lecturers for the newly-started programmes would be a grave injustice for the students, the college heads say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-courses-sans-teachers-put-college-principals-in-a-quandary/article32913602.ece
22 October 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Heritage enthusiasts disappointed||While the creation of new administrative circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Tiruchi has warmed the cockles of the historians and conservationists, heritage enthusiasts from Perambalur district are a disappointed lot as their district has now been brought under the Chennai Circle. With the bifurcation of the Chennai Circle, Tiruchi has got 162 monuments and sites in about 20 districts under its jurisdiction. Most of the important monuments in the State are under Tiruchi Circle. Perambalur district, despite being just about 50 km away from Tiruchi, has been brought under the Chennai Circle. “It was a great pleasure to see the formation of a new circle in Tiruchi. But it is shocking that Perambalur has been annexed to the Chennai Circle,” observed Ramesh Karuppaiah, a heritage enthusiast of the district. The famous Ranjankudi Fort in the Perambalur district is maintained by ASI, he pointed. “We were hoping that the creation of the Tiruchi Circle will lead to the improvement of Ranjankudi Fort, Valikandapuram Shiva Temple, Samskan Mosque and Karai in the Perambalur area,” he said. Pointing out that Perambalur district and Ariyalur district were once part of the integrated Tiruchi district, Mr.Karuppaiah contended that just as Ariyalur, Perambalur too should be retained under the Tiruchi Circle of the ASI. “We will be happy if our plea is considered and a change is made,” he added. Activists also point out that Ranjankudi Fort, a 17th-century fortress located about 22 km north of Perambalur, could be developed as a picnic or tourist spot. The ASI, a few years ago, had executed some development works at the fort. The State Tourism Department is also said to be looking at improving amenities at the site and they were expecting a further push to tap the tourism potential of the area with the creation of the new circle. A senior ASI official said that Perambalur district may have been included under Chennai Circle to maintain a healthy ratio of the number of protected monuments/sites under each circle. However, it was a policy decision taken by the ASI headquarters and any decision of change in jurisdictional areas could be taken only in New Delhi, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heritage-enthusiasts-disappointed/article32913614.ece

Sengottaiyan said on Wednesday. ‘We are expecting a positive development shortly,’ he told media persons when asked to comment on why the Governor had not granted assent to the Bill yet. Enrolment in government schools had gone up by more than four lakh this year owing to the development of academic infrastructure in schools, he said. He cited the admission of two government school students in B.Tech. programmes of National Institution of Technology - Tiruchi as proof of good education. The School Education Department plans to establish over 7,200 smart classrooms in government schools before this year-end, he said earlier while addressing a function organised to hand over certificates for two-year extension of recognition to private schools in Tiruchi and surrounding districts. The government had decided to issue certificates for extension of recognition with two-year validity, instead of one year, to private schools to save them from hassles, he said. The validity of the certificates will be extended to three years if a petition in the Supreme Court on the issue was withdrawn. The Minister handed over certificates to managements of 525 schools in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, in the presence of Ministers Vellamandi N. Natarajan and S. Valarmathi. Tiruchi Collector S. Sivarasu presided over the function.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nod-for-75-quota-likely/article32913581.ece

In deference to the directions of the Central Government, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are in the process of collecting feedback from parents on conducting regular classes for levels IX to XII. ‘Of course, we are ready to conduct classes. But then, the parents have the say on this matter. By and large, parents seem to be reconciled to the outcome of the online classes, and are not prepared to take the risk of sending their wards to the schools,’ the principal of a Kendriya Vidyalaya said. The KVs had completed half-yearly examinations earlier this month, and the short week-long vacation has also begun. Multiple choice questions were asked for the online examination of one-hour duration for each subject, he said. As for the private CBSE schools, the standing instructions of the State Government have to be followed. Private school managements are wary of starting regular classes after what they perceive as the ‘risky experimentation’ by Andhra Pradesh government to open schools. The move had turned counter-productive, leading to further spread of the pandemic, school principals say. Since the CBSE schools had started the online classes early on, they have been able to complete close to 80% of the portions, after factoring in the 25 % cut in contents this year due to the pandemic. ‘Nevertheless, we cover the portions deleted for this academic year also, keeping in mind the need to keep the students fully prepared for competitive examinations for entry into professional courses,’ said C.J. Chacko, principal, Samad Senior Secondary School. Following the Central Government’s plan for re-opening of schools, the Anna Science Centre - Planetarium in Tiruchi had held an awareness programme for teachers and parents on Tuesday. The programme titled ‘Meet your Medical Expert’ programme was conducted to allay apprehensions in the minds of parents, its Project Director R. Ahilan said. Interacting online with parents and school teachers, M.A. Aleem, former vice-principal, K.A.P.Viswanatham Government Medical College Hospital, Tiruchi, said students must desist from sharing pencils, pens or erasers, as an extreme precaution to prevent the spread of the pandemic. Vaccine is the only hope, and till it comes the practice of wearing masks, washing hands frequently and maintaining physical distance must be assiduously followed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbse-schools-in-tiruchi-not-in-a-hurry-to-reopen/article32913615.ece

22 October 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Fine slapped on farmer for illegal felling of trees||Forest department has slapped a fine of Rs. 5,000 on a farmer for cutting trees on his land close to the reserve forest area without obtaining mandatory permission. Sources in the Forest department told The Hindu that farmer Perumal Muthu, who had his land just a km away from the boundary of reserve forests in the Kozhunthumaamalai beat near Govindaperi, approached the forest department for getting the mandatory permission for felling 106 teak trees, each aged about 14 years. As per norms, the grower should get permission from the forest department for cutting trees if the land is situated 5 km from the forest boundary. Since the permission had to be given by officials at highest level, the delay irked both the farmer and the prospective buyers of timbers, who decided to go ahead with the cutting of trees with the cooperation of a few lower level forest personnel. Emboldened by the lower level personnel’s advice to pay the fine for cutting the trees without the permission, the contractor felled the trees recently and cut them into pieces for easy transport. While 50 trees are yet to be transported from the spot, other timbers had already reached the designated destinations, the sources added. Meanwhile, a team of senior officials, on getting information about illegal felling of trees, visited the spot and slapped a fine of Rs. 5,000 on Perumal Muthu. ‘Only poles, not logs’ “Felling of 36 trees was confirmed and the fine was imposed on the farmer for cutting the trees without permission. The cut trees were just poles and not huge logs and hence only Rs. 5,000 was imposed,” said Deputy Director (in charge), Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve’s Kalakkad division.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fine-slapped-on-farmer-for-illegal-felling-of-trees/article32913596.ece

Sathyagopal, Chairman and Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Water Resources Conservation and Rivers Restoration Corporation, on Wednesday asked the Tiruvannamalai administration to take steps to attract more water birds to the Vengikkal lake. He inspected the lake and the science park set up near the waterbody at a cost of Rs. 3 crore on 50,000 square feet of land. “I have given some suggestions to Collector K.S. Kandasamy to attract more water birds to the lake, including creation of mounds,” Mr. Sathyagopal said. In other districts too, the Collectors could set up parks near waterbodies, and they would be useful to the public. Mr. Sathyagopal said the science park would be useful to children. “Whatever we studied in textbooks is found in the form of models in this park. I have not seen anything like this in other parts of the State.” An official from the Tiruvannamalai administration said the park had equipment for schoolchildren to learn about mechanical engineering, light, sound, heat, physics, biology and astronomy. An amphitheatre had also been built to conduct workshops and seminars, he said. The park has been developed by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj. “We have also set up a food court. We wanted to open it up fully for the public, but the plan was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/take-steps-to-attract-more-water-birds-to-vengikkal-lake/article32914378.ece

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Traders expect onion price to drop||With big onions imported from Egypt by private traders reaching several markets in the country on Wednesday, this was reflected in the local wholesale price. In Coimbatore markets, big onion that was sold at Rs. 90 a kg (wholesale) on Tuesday dropped to Rs. 80 a kg by Wednesday evening. The prices may decline to Rs. 70 a kg on Thursday. However, the real impact on domestic prices will be known in a week, depending on the consumer off-take of the imported onion, say traders. A wholesale trader from the city said traders were less likely to hoard onion now as the varieties that currently come to markets could not be stocked for many days. “The damage is high for the onion varieties that are currently sold in the market. Rains in onion producing States and COVID-19 induced crisis leading to less cultivation are said to be the reasons for the price hike,” said the trader. Members of the All India Democratic Women's Association in Coimbatore staged a protest on Wednesday, demanding that the Central and State governments bring down the prices.  They took out a march holding a hardboard stuffed with onions, to make it resemble a portrait, and they also placed wreaths before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-expect-onion-price-to-drop/article32914118.ece

22 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Jolle criticises Yatnal, says there will be no leadership change||District in-charge and Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle criticised BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal for saying that the party was planning to replace Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa with a leader from North Karnataka. She said that Mr. Yediyurappa would complete his remaining term of three years in office and there would be no change. He is managing COVID-19 very well and providing calamity relief in a commendable manner, she added. Mr. Yediyurappa, who was supposed to hold a meeting of officers in Alamatti, cancelled his visit citing bad weather. He flew over some flood-affected areas along the Bhima river in Vijayapura district before conducting an aerial survey over Kalaburagi district. About Mr. Yatnal’s concern that the Chief Minister had withdrawn Rs. 125 crore released to city corporations, she said that the funds were likely to be restored as the issue was being discussed at the highest level of the government. She said that the State Cabinet would discuss flood relief and related issues at its next meeting. She said that she would ask her Cabinet colleagues to urge the Union government to declare the floods as a national emergency. That would enable the Centre to provide additional funds to the State, she said. She said that a committee of senior officers would look into the allegations that Irrigation Department officers had committed an error by which additional water was released from the Sonna barrage on the Bhima river, causing floods in the command areas. On the face of it, it looks as if there has been a mistake. A technical committee will decide it and find out which officers are responsible for lapses, if any, she said. She said that the government would form a committee to see that irrigation officers from Karnataka and Maharashtra worked in coordination over water discharge and other issues in the Bhima river basin, on the lines of the committee for the Krishna basin. According to her, 28 villages on the banks of the Bhima were affected and the initial estimate of loss has been put at Rs. 625 crore. A detailed survey will finalise the loss, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jolle-criticises-yatnal-says-there-will-be-no-leadership-change/article32913683.ece
22 October 2020||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Belagavi sees significant political developments as parties prepare to fight DCC Bank polls||Preparations by various parties for the elections to the District Central Co-operative Bank in Belagavi have led to significant political developments. The State Cooperative Election Authority has announced that the filing of nomination papers, and voting, if necessary, will be held on November 6. The 16-member financial institution mostly had BJP leaders heading it in the recent years. Current president of the DCC Bank Ramesh Katti, younger brother of the former Minister Umesh Katti has been occupying office for 17 years, while his political rival and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi has served as cooperative president for five years. In 2015, Mr. Ramesh Katti defeated Mr. Savadi by a single vote when he polled nine votes against Mr. Savadi's eight. It was suspected that the lone government nominee favoured Mr. Ramesh Katti. That the two belonged to the same party did not seem to matter. Interesting allies This time around, Mr. Savadi has two interesting allies — the Jolle couple from Nippani and the Sangh Parivar. MP from Chikkodi Anna Saheb Jolle has been a long-standing director of the bank. His wife and Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle is a national-level office-bearer of the Sangh Parivar-affiliate Sahakara Bharati, a federation of co-operative societies. Senior RSS functionaries held a meeting with DCC Bank aspirants in the house of RSS leader Arvind Rao Deshpande in Athani twice this month. Cracks exposed District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi exposed cracks in the party when he said that he would abide by the decisions taken by his brother and BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi and Mr. Umesh Katti in relation to issues involving the bank. Another meeting is scheduled on Wednesday. It was interpreted as if he would not side with the Savadi and Jolle group. Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi is said to enjoy the confidence of all his brothers, including Congress leader Satish Jarkiholi. In the Congress camp, Channaraj Hattiholi, brother of MLA Lakshmi Hebbalkar, seems anxious to contest. The MLA, however, has denied it. DCC Bank polls have garnered interest as local politics in Belagavi tends to have repercussions at the State level. Two years earlier, the choice of candidates for the Belagavi Taluk Rural Development Bank led to a bitter battle between Ms. Lakshmi Hebbalkar and the Jarkiholi brothers that shook State politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/belagavi-sees-significant-political-developments-as-parties-prepare-to-fight-dcc-bank-polls/article32913679.ece

22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Plasma therapy: Hospitals ask for replacement donors||Last week, the family of a 74-year-old critical COVID-19 patient had to scout for a suitable plasma donor as the plasma bank that had a stock matching the patient’s blood group asked for a replacement donor. This was even as the patient’s condition was deteriorating and the family was making one last-ditch effort with plasma therapy. Amidst the debate over its effectiveness, the demand is actually increasing for convalescent plasma therapy, which is the use of antibody-rich blood plasma from a recently recovered patient to boost a critical person’s immune system. However, as not all recovered patients can donate, it is hard for the distressed families to find a suitable donor during the crisis. On the other hand, doctors say that a poor response from recovered patients has made it inevitable for hospitals to demand for replacement.  Most private hospital blood banks authorised to take up plasma therapy in the city admitted that they were asking for replacement donors as it was “essential to keep the chain going.” While some hospitals give the patient a week’s time to get the donor, some others ask for immediate replacement. “Although over 6.5 lakh patients have recovered, not even 0.5% of them have come forward to donate. Most recovered persons are either not willing to donate or feel it is unsafe for them to go out to a hospital to donate. Also, most are worried that their immunity level might reduce after the donation, which is a misconception,” said U.S. Vishal Rao, who heads the State-supported HCG plasma bank. “Although we have given out 900 units so far, we have had only 500 plasma warriors who came forward to donate. Ideally patients can donate plasma every two weeks. While we need 200 ml for each therapy, we usually draw around 450 ml. The demand-supply gap is growing and unless there is replacement, we cannot keep the chain going. While we ask for immediate replacement, we do not hold the treatment of the patient if plasma is available,” said Dr. Rao. C. Shivaram, Consultant and Head of Transfusion Medicine at Manipal Hospitals. “We request the families of patients who undergo the therapy in our hospital to get a replacement donor within a week. Although we have been creating awareness about the need to donate, hardly 25% of our donations are through replacements. The rest are through healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and technicians,” he went on to add. Safe to donate Pointing out that an adult donor has three litres of plasma in him, Dr. Shivram said, “Out of this only 200 ml is expected to be enough to treat a patient. Whether one donates or not these antibody levels will go down in about three to four months. The good thing, however, is that the memory cells in the immune system that, when exposed to an invading pathogen, replicate and remain in the lymph nodes searching for the same antigen, resulting in a more efficient and rapid response to any subsequent attack,” he explained adding that it is safe to donate if the person has a good antibody level.  Although over 6.5 lakh patients have recovered, not even 0.5% of them have come forward to donate plasma.

22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Large spatial variability in pollutant concentration: Study||An 11-month-long mobile monitoring of various particulate air pollutants over a fixed 150-km road stretch in the city, comprising major, arterial and residential roads, found large spatial variability along the study route for all pollutant concentrations. While urban and peri-urban residential neighbourhoods recorded the lowest PM2.5, BC (black carbon) and UPF (ultrafine particles) concentration, major roads recorded the highest concentration. Within the neighbourhoods surveyed, concentrations varied with the road type. The study was conducted by the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) with ILK Labs, University of Washington and University of Texas. It is said to be one of the first large-scale mobile-monitoring studies in India comprising over a million data points. The report, titled ‘Mobile-Monitoring Campaign for Air Pollution Studies in Bengaluru’, stated that the research team completed a total of 27 repeat measurements over the study route to construct a long-term mean pollution map. The study route was divided into four parts, and each part was covered in one measurement day, which spanned almost four hours, from about 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., capturing the rush-hour peak. On-road measurement of air pollutants – BC, PM2.5 and UFPs – were performed in four parts of Bengaluru. The mobile-monitoring route included the central business district (CBD), a residential urban neighbourhood (Malleswaram), a peri-urban neighbourhood (Kannuru), and an urban-rural transect. “Kannuru is a peri-urban location used by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for land filling. It is approximately 18 km from the CBD and characterised by less traffic. The area has a quarry due to which heavy-duty trucks ply here. The CBD includes M.G. Road and major roads around Cubbon Park and Vidhan Soudha. The study route reflects variations in the traffic volume, traffic density, driving speeds, and street configurations,” stated the report. Sreekanth Vakacherla from CSTEP, one of the contributors to the study, told The Hindu that they also covered all seasons to understand on-road pollution. The monitoring campaign started in May 2019 and continued up to the first week of March 2020. There were around 110 measurement days covering all seasons. “By studying on-road pollution, we wanted to measure pollution levels that the commuter will get exposed to as we are moving closer to the source of pollution and components such as BC are detrimental to health,” he said. Their monitoring platform was a car fuelled by CNG (compressed natural gas), which is low-emitting but not completely emission-free. Researchers found that each pollutant peaked in different regions along the study route. “Irrespective of the road classification and season, on-road PM2.5 levels were higher than ambient,” the report said. In Bengaluru, garbage/waste burning also contributes to observed on-road BC, in addition to diesel emissions. Advocating for mobile monitoring in the country, the researchers said, “Air-quality monitoring forms a critical component of various stages of air-quality management. India has nearly 200 monitoring stations (operational during 2010-16). However, the country needs about 40,003 stationary monitors to capture the spatial and temporal variability of air quality,” it said. “One way of avoiding pollution would be to avoid such roads. But it may not be feasible. We tried to see how many hospitals and schools are there along such roads, and there are many and they house more vulnerable people. In the future, it is advisable for them to not be located on such roads,” Dr. Sreekanth added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/large-spatial-variability-in-pollutant-concentration-study/article32914088.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Guidelines sought following plaints of eye problems||After media reports of children complaining of eye problems due to online classes, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Wednesday directed the Commissioner of Department of Public Instruction (DPI) to immediately issue a detailed circular listing measures that can be taken to curtail the problem and formulate guidelines. “It is being reported in the media that students have been facing eye-related problems as a result of online classes being held across the State. Hence, it is directed to issue a detailed circular on modalities of conducting online classes based on the expert committee report,” the letter by the Education Minister stated. In its report submitted in the first week of July, the expert committee had recommended an age-appropriate approach for students attending online classes. V.P. Niranjan Aradhya, educationist and member of the Committee, told The Hindu that a robust mechanism needs to be in place for follow up on the implementation of the report. It was submitted to the government after consulting and deliberating with various stakeholders including doctors. “The overall well-being of students should be accorded utmost priority. In the report, we have also said that after a particular time, the functioning of the system should be revived. It has been three months since we submitted the report and there will be scope for improvement based on experiences,” he said,  Frequency of classes The committee report had specified the frequency of classes that could be held every week and had recommended that schools could conduct alternative-day classes for students up to Class 2, while five-days-a-week classes were allowed for Class 3 and above. Two days of the week should be strictly non-screen time. A few parents that The Hindu spoke to said that schools needed to chart out a way to improve ‘offline classes’. “My son’s school is conducting online classes continuously and it’s a strain on his eyes,” said a mother of a Class 7 student enrolled in a private school in Bengaluru. Other activities The parents of a teenage boy said their son was experiencing dry eyes or a burning sensation after sitting for online classes continuously. They also admitted that after classes, their son watched TV or played games on his phone as he cannot engage in team sports. “This adds to the problem,” said his father. Many expressed hope that the guidelines will address this problem. “But the government should also monitor schools and ensure that rules are being followed,” said the parents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/guidelines-sought-following-plaints-of-eye-problems/article32913715.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||IMA case: HC unhappy over advocates sharing login credentials with litigants||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over conduct of certain advocates of sharing login ID and password for the videoconference (VC) hearing session, on the petitions related to I Monetary Advisory (IMA) group of companies. With a large number of litigants logging in, the VC link was automatically disconnected during the course of hearing due to user-overload. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi told the advocates that technical team had informed that link was disconnected as a large number of litigants/private individuals had logged in to VC hearing session, login credentials for which were shared only with the advocates concerned. “Who shared the link with the litigants? Link was disconnected as a large number of litigants logged into VC hearing. If litigants want to watch proceedings, they can remain present in the offices of the advocates. They can’t join VC hearing in this manner. This kind of indiscipline cannot be tolerated...,” Chief Justice told the advocates, who had joined the VC hearing for the IMA case in the afternoon session of the court. The Bench later requested the advocates, representing petitioners in IMA case, not to share login ID and password with the litigant while indicating the litigants can be allowed to watch proceedings in the offices of the advocates. Serious view Meanwhile, the Bench said that it would view very seriously if the State government failed to release by November 3 the non-salary grant for the office of the Competent Authority, appointed as per the provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, for the IMA cases. The grant is required to release amount for purchase of office equipment/stationery, outsourcing of vehicles for officers and payments towards forensic audit, videography, valuers, etc. “The State government cannot neglect the competent authority appointed as per the law,” the Bench made it clear. The Bench also directed the government to make payment of Rs. 12 lakh to the Central Bureau of Investigation towards expenses incurred to procure hardware gadgets for storing of data related to IMA cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ima-case-hc-unhappy-over-advocates-sharing-login-credentials-with-litigants/article32913700.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State’s daily test positivity rate falls to 5.42%||For the first time after the lockdown was eased in June, the State’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) fell to 5.42% on Wednesday. The TPR, which stood at an average of 7.7% in the last seven days, has been dipping since then. From 6.41% on Tuesday, the daily TPR further fell to 5.42% on Wednesday. The State’s cumulative TPR is currently 11.25%. TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. While cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is for those tested on a particular day. According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. The World Health Organisation recommends that the daily positivity rate be below 5% for at least two weeks before relaxing public health measures. From 6.76% on June 27, the State’s daily TPR saw a drastic jump to 11.2% in over a month’s time (on July 29). TPR hovered between 11% and 18% for a long time before it reduced to 13% in September. Then it further reduced in October and stood at 9.53% on October 11. From then onwards, the TPR has been on a decline consistently. Attributing this to the high number of tests being conducted in the State, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar tweeted that the State has so far conducted 69,52,835 tests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/states-daily-test-positivity-rate-falls-to-542/article32913692.ece
22 October 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on plea challenging constitutionality of law to protect rights of transgender persons||The High Court of Karnataka has ordered issue of notice to the Union government in a PIL petition questioning constitutional validity of a series of provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order on the petition filed by Ondede, a public charitable trust working extensively with the transgender community in the State and others. Various sections The petitioners have termed the Sections 4,5,6,7, 12(3), 18(a) and 18(d) of the Act as violative of the fundamental rights of the equity before law, the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex or place of birth, the equality of opportunity in matters of public employment, and the protection of life and personal liberty guaranteed respectively under the Articles, 14,15, 16 and 21 of the Constitution. Pointing out that as per the Section 4, a transgender person shall have a right to be recognised only as ‘transgender’ and not as male, female, or other, the petition has claimed that this compulsion to only identify as ‘transgender’ violates one’s right to gender identify under the Article 21.  Self-determination The Sections 5, 6 and 7, prescribing process for consideration of application for certificate of identity after considering medical and psychological documents are violation of the apex court’s judgement, in the case of National Legal Services Authority vs Union of India, which had held that gender self-determination cannot be based on medical reassignment or any other procedure, the petitioners have contended. On minors The petitioners have also claimed that Section 12 does not make any distinction in treatment between minors and adult transgender persons when they get rejected by their family as they can be assigned to a rehabilitation or to their homes by the orders of a court without giving any third alternative of their own choice if the transgender is not a minor person. Abuse of transgenders Section 18 of the Act, which prescribes maximum punishment up to two years in cases of certain offences like physical or sexual abuse of a transgender person, is discriminatory in nature, petitioners have claimed while pointing out that the Indian Penal Code prescribes severe punishment of seven years and above in cases of similar offences against women.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-plea-challenging-constitutionality-of-law-to-protect-rights-of-transgender-persons/article32913719.ece

Yediyurappa’s tenure as Chief Minister is set to end soon, party State president Nalin Kumar Kateel clarified that there was no question of changing leadership and warned that action would be initiated against indiscipline. “Mr. Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister for the next three years,” Mr. Kateel said in a tweet on Wednesday. He also declared: “We will go to the next poll under his leadership.” However, questions have been raised on the why it took more than a day for the him to respond to Mr. Yatnal’s remarks that embarrassed Mr. Yediyurappa in the run-up to the byelections and the biennial elections to the Legislative Council. Also, Mr. Kateel did not take the name of Mr. Yatnal during the reference to disciplinary action. Eshwarappa supports Meanwhile, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa came out strongly in support of the Chief Minister and launched a straight attack on Mr. Yatnal and said he should be dismissed from the party without issuing a prior notice. “Mr. Yatnal made a foolish statement. He is repeatedly issuing such statements and we will not value them. I appeal to our party State president to dismiss him from the party. There shouldn’t be any indiscipline in the party and we will take action against him,” Mr. Eshwarappa told media persons in Koppal. “We recently held the BJP Legislature Party meeting and Mr. Yatnal participated in it. The Chief Minister asked all the MLAs to bring problems of their constituencies to his notice. But Mr. Yatnal was quiet in the meeting and later began making statements that the Chief Minister would soon be replaced. His statements might have made the Congress happy,” he said, asserting that “nobody can topple the present government”.

Party members, activists from various organisations, workers and farmers stood carrying the party flag on either side of the 5-km stretch from Belkota to Ambalga village, where the last rites were performed on government land. Manpade was the State vice-president of the Karnataka Pranth Raita Sangha. He dedicated his life to fighting for the rights of farmers and workers in the organised and unorganised sectors in the Kalyana Karnataka region.

22 October 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘State govt. showing stepmotherly attitude towards Kalyana Karnataka region’||Accusing the BJP-led State government of deliberately delaying carrying out an aerial survey of flood-ravaged districts in Kalyana Karnataka region, KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre and Jewargi MLA Ajay Singh charged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa with adopting a “stepmotherly approach” towards the region. Addressing a press conference at the District Congress Committee office in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, Mr. Khandre and Mr. Singh demanded that Mr. Yediyurappa, who is slated to conduct an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts on Wednesday, should give enough time to access the damage caused by heavy rain and floods in Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Bidar districts of Kalyana Karnataka region, and hold a review meeting with local representatives and discuss tackling the fury of floods. Despite the government’s claims that there has been enough preparedness to handle floods, people in the grassroots level are battling even for basic necessities. “Nearly all districts of North Karnataka are reeling under floods and struggling on various fronts. Due to incessant rainfall, heavy floods and the spread of coronavirus, people are distressed and angry with the government,” he added. Mr. Khandre urged Mr. Yediyurappa to lead a delegation from the State to the Centre to seek immediate flood relief assistance. Besides, the State government should release financial assistance to flood-affected districts on its own accord, he added. Mr. Singh said that the condition was worse in Jewargi and Afzalpur taluks. In the last five days, there is no electricity in many villages as electricity poles have been washed away in the floodwaters. “The State government’s decision to conduct an aerial survey will not serve any purpose,” he said and added that Mr. Yediyurappa should visit villages and speak to the flood victims to understand the actual situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-showing-stepmotherly-attitude-towards-kalyana-karnataka-region/article32913698.ece
22 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Mangalore University shelves plan for digital evaluation of answer scripts||Mangalore University which had earlier planned for taking up digital evaluation of nearly 2.50 lakh answer scripts of its final semester examinations of 2019-20 has shelved the move. Now, it is going ahead with the process as per the conventional method, according to Registrar (Evaluation) of the university P.L. Dharma. If the evaluation of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations, which got over on October 6, has begun, the answer scripts of undergraduate examinations, completed on October 19, will be evaluated from October 27. More than 50,000 students had appeared for the examinations, he told The Hindu . Mr. Dharma said that the digital evaluation plan has been shelved mainly due to two reasons. The teachers indicated that as all eligible evaluators are not familiar with the new move, there could be delay in completing evaluation thus, leading to delay in the announcement of results. Secondly, last month’s floods in Udupi and heavy rain in Kodagu have created issues in uninterrupted internet connectivity and power supply to digital evaluation centres identified in Udupi and Kodagu districts. In addition, the government’s approval for the new move was awaited. Hence, the plan was dropped. He said that the evaluation of the papers of undergraduate examinations will go on briskly at three centres in Dakshina Kannada and one centre each in Udupi and Kodagu districts for five days from October 27 to October 31. In the earlier years, the evaluation of undergraduate examination papers scheduled only at a centralised centre in Mangaluru took about 13 days to complete. As there will be five evaluation centres this year the evaluation will be completed early. About 48,000 students have appeared for the undergraduate examinations, he said. The papers will be evaluated at the University College, Canara College, Government First Grade College in Mangaluru, MGM College in Udupi and at FMKM College in Madikeri, he said. “We will ensure that the answer scripts reached all the three centres much in advance to enable teachers to begin the evaluation without any delay,” he said and added that the results will be announced at the earliest to enable students to join the post-graduate courses for 2020-21 by November 15. He said that 50 % of the answer scripts of post-graduate examinations have been evaluated now. Mr. Dharma said that the answer scripts of 60 students who wrote the undergraduate and post-graduate papers in the examination centres of the university in Bhutan, Manipur, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshadweep Islands and in Dharwad have reached the university. The examinations had been conducted there as a one-time measure due to the COVID-19 situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mangalore-university-shelves-plan-for-digital-evaluation-of-answer-scripts/article32914234.ece

22 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Involve religious leaders in work to stop falling female child sex ratio’||Work to arrest falling female child sex ratio in Dakshina Kannada will succeed if religious leaders are involved in the programme, said Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty here on Tuesday. Speaking at the “Beti Bachavo Beti Padavo” programme, Dr. Shetty said that it was sad that female child sex ratio in the district, which is known for its literacy, continues to be poor. For every 1,000 male children, the number of female children stood at 931 in 2019-20. It was at 950 in the previous year. Dakshina Kannada, Yadgir, Haveri and Gadag are among those districts where female child sex ratio is poor in the State. Dr. Shetty said that religious leaders should come forward and work with the government in creating a favourable environment for girls. These leaders should sensitise people about the place girls have in society. Respecting women should become a norm in society. “We should act fast and stop this downward trend of female child sex ratio,” he said. Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat president Meenakshi Shantigodu also spoke. Mayor Diwakar participated. The Department of Women and Child Welfare organised the programme. As many as 17 girls who have scored good marks in the SSLC examination were felicitated. Headmasters of government schools that have recorded 100 % pass in the SSLC examination and a headmaster of a girl-child friendly school were felicitated. Panchayat Development Officers from five panchayats each from Mangaluru, Belthangady, Sullia, Puttur and Belthangady taluks that have good girl child sex ratio were honoured.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/involve-religious-leaders-in-work-to-stop-falling-female-child-sex-ratio/article32914226.ece
22 October 2020||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Government decides to open new pension accounts in post offices||Taking advantage of doorstep delivery of service, the State government has decided to have new pension accounts in post offices, said Mangaluru Tahsildar Guruprasad here on Tuesday. Answering a question about pensions during the general meeting of Mangaluru Taluk Panchayat, Mr. Guruprasad said that services at post offices have improved. A host of services, including correction of name in Aadhaar card, were now available at the post office. People are getting services on their doorsteps. Accounts at the post office can be operated online. “The new pension accounts will now be opened at post offices, instead of in banks,” he said. Following the merger of Vijaya Bank with the Bank of Baroda and of Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, Mr. Guruprasad said, there has been change in account numbers of pension accounts in the Syndicate Bank and Vijaya Bank. “Not all account holders have obtained their new passbook and intimated the authorities of the change. This has resulted in pension not getting deposited,” he said. Action has been taken to collect all such accounts and give it to the Lead Bank Manager who will then ensure changes are carried out. Some panchayats, including Kotekar and Jokatte, have taken the initiative to contact the affected pension holders and approach the bank for carrying out the changes. Mr. Guruprasad said that the Revenue Department will hold a Pension Adalat from November first week at the panchayat level. To another question, Mr. Guruprasad said that the district administration has earmarked 184 acres of land in Mangaluru taluk for allocation to people without houses. Land where construction has not been taken up are being taken back. Where buildings are constructed in an unauthorised manner, such buildings are not demolished but instead, acquired for use as hostels, government quarters or other purposes of the government. As many as 18 such buildings have been acquired in Kotekar, he said. Taluk Panchayat president Mohammed Monu, panchayat vice-president Poornima Poojary and Executive Officer N.G.

22 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Tourist footfall remains poor||Gumbaz, the mausoleum of 18th century rulers of Mysore Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and Daria Daulat Bagh, also known as Tipu’s Summer Palace, in Srirangapatna near here used to draw a large number of tourists during Dasara festivities every year. But, the tourist attractions are wearing a deserted look this year. The number of tourists visiting the destinations had been reduced to a trickle after the lockdown was eased more than four months ago. Though the tourist arrival had picked up marginally during the last two months, the numbers were nowhere close to the pre-lockdown days. According to sources at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Srirangapatna, the Daria Daulat Bagh would receive between 1,000 to 1,500 visitors every day during weekdays and between 2,000 to 2,500 visitors during weekends before the lockdown. The numbers have now come down to just 100 to 150 a day. “We used to get visitors from different parts of India and even abroad before lockdown. Now, most of the visitors are either from Bengaluru or Mysuru”, the source told The Hindu . Also, the entry ticket, which used to be Rs. 25 when purchased from the counter, is now available for only Rs. 20 online. Visitors to Daria Daulat Bagh have to purchase the tickets only online now. Gumbaz too had witnessed a drastic fall in the number of visitors. Though entry is not ticketed, the revenues earned through collection of fee for parking of vehicles and safekeeping of footwear had taken a serious hit. An ASI-protected monument, Gumbaz is managed by Tipu Sultan Wakf Estate. The accountant at the Estate claimed that the salaries of employees is borne from the revenue earned through fees collected for parking and safekeeping of footwear. The poor footfall has also hit hard the locals offering horse rides to tourists and owners of shops selling souvenirs and a variety of other items. Even the restaurants that were catering to the tourists in the town had been hit hard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourist-footfall-remains-poor/article32913874.ece
22 October 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Meeting next week on State’s readiness over vaccine: Sudhakar||Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar on Wednesday said a crucial meeting has been convened in Bengaluru next week to discuss the steps to be taken for the delivery, distribution and administration in anticipation of development of a COVID-19 vaccine next year. Experts from various fields, including eminent doctors, scientists, and others, have been invited to attend the meeting to discuss the preparations to be made by the State ahead of the arrival of the vaccine, he added. Dr. Sudhakar said the State needs to gear up with the logistical support to meet the vaccine requirements, giving priority for the frontline workers who had been combating the pandemic. Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation and the steps taken here in view of Dasara finale this week, Dr. Sudhakar said the pandemic curve is flattening in the State with the positivity rate falling to 5.5 per cent in the last 10 days. In Karnataka, 1.08 lakh tests had been done in the past 10 days, he said, adding that the ramping of tests had helped to contain the fresh infections. He claimed that the pandemic was under control in the State when compared to other States since some States had reported 14 per cent positivity rate whereas it is 5.5 per cent in the State. “Initially, it looked that the State was reporting more cases. However, despite this, the State managed to control the deaths with early detection and treatment of the infected.” With regard to the Dasara finale here, he said the turnout of visitors to Mysuru was not as anticipated since there has been no alarming rise in the footfall. “I had discussions with the Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar and I was told the tourist sites had been witnessing fewer footfall despite the festive season. I think the public are also taking precautions with restrained approaches.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/meeting-next-week-on-states-readiness-over-vaccine-sudhakar/article32913876.ece
22 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Row over naming of circle||Mysuru City Corporation’s decision to name a circle after late Congress corporator Ananthu has sparked a row with Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and Mayor Tasneem crossing swords over the issue. After the MCC Council, at its meeting earlier this month, resolved to name the circle situated near Lalitha Mahal-T .Narispur Road junction after Ananthu, Mr. Simha shot off a letter to MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde terming the resolution “illegal” on the grounds that the circle was situated on National Highway 766 that does not fall under the civic body’s purview. He contended that City Corporations, City Municipal Councils or Town Municipalities do not have jurisdiction to name a circle that fell under the purview of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and asked the MCC Commissioner to immediately drop the move. But, Mayor Tasneem, responding to the MP’s demand, said that Mr. Simha himself had approached the MCC twice with recommendations to name the circle after a late doctor. “Didn’t he know that the circle was part of the NHAI when he himself had approached the MCC with a recommendation to name the circle after the late doctor?”, the Mayor questioned. Support Late Ananthu’s wife Ashwini Ananthu, who is now a corporator representing ward number number 37 in MCC, contended that the resolution to name the circle after her late husband was moved after recommendations were received from not only former corporator of the area Mahadevamma, but also several others including office-bearers of Siddhartha Sports Club and Ganapathi temple. She said Mr. Simha too had made a recommendation to name the circle after late Dr. Satish Rai. But, after a discussion in the council, a resolution was adopted to name the circle after Mr. Ananthu with the support of members of both Congress and JD(S), she said while pointing out that Mr. Ananthu had died while he was member of the MCC. Reacting to Mr. Simha’s letter, Ms. Ashwini Ananthu said the MP’s letter had questioned the authority of the MCC, which had adopted a resolution in favour naming the circle after Mr. Ananthu. “Does it mean that the MCC’s resolution and the Mayor’s ruling have no authority?”, she asked. Mr. Simha, in his letter, has also said that the MCC, by adopting the resolution, had thrown to the winds the convention of naming circles after eminent persons, freedom fighters and achievers in memory of their sacrifices to the country. Also, before naming a circle, the MCC should follow the guidelines issued by the Department of Municipal Administration, Mr .Simha said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/row-over-naming-of-circle/article32913869.ece

Hemantha Kumar on Wednesday said 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion students and youth across the globe had been affected by the closure of schools, colleges and universities over the COVID-19 pandemic. Presiding over the inaugural function of Rashtriya Uchhathar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)-funded videoconference hall, refresher course in commerce and release of online adaption of the book “Purana Nama Chudamani” at the UGC-Human Resource Development Centre at the University of Mysore, he said most governments in the world have temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the spread of the pandemic. The nationwide closures of educational institutions had affected 72 per cent of the world’s student population. He said the challenges for commerce and management educators post-COVID-19 are multifold as any changes in the economic order of the world directly impacts business, commerce and trade. And the business educators must revisit their approach in order to be in tune with the growing uncertainties, technological shifts in teaching and learning process and social shifts in the student population. In the new normal situation post-COVID-19, the ongoing crisis is forcing business educators to critically question their syllabi. “The reliance on one global market, economic rationality and standardised approach to organisational governance and accountability leaves us vulnerable.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-13-billion-students-hit-vc/article32913865.ece

22 October 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Early expansion of airport sought||Stakeholders seeking additional air connectivity from Mysuru to other cities in Karnataka and the neighbouring States have averred that it was imperative to spur investment in the city and expedite industrial development of the region. But for long-haul flights to operate to and from Mysuru, the extension of the runway was necessary and though the project has received clearance from the Director General of Civil Aviation, it was yet to commence. The meeting convened by Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) on Tuesday, was addressed by the Mysuru Airport Director Manjunath who said the originating air passenger traffic potential from Mysuru was high and this was the key question posed to him by airlines keen to include the city in their flight path. He said the air service to Mangaluru by Alliance Air and which will commence in due course was preceded by a series of meetings the focus of which was on passenger potential. Referring to the underpass which was imperative to extend the runway, he said the concept was not novel and such runways existed in different parts of the world. Apart from Mysuru’s tourism potential, the city was known for yoga, education and adventure sports and this could be harnessed to drive more traffic to the city apart from the potential for new industries.  Sudhakar Shetty, past president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), said upgrading the airport would not only benefit the city but foster development and growth in Mandya, Kodagu, and Chamarajanagar districts as well. He urged the authorities to expedite the land acquisition process to commence the underpass works at the earliest. This was followed by an interaction with participants most of whom complained of frequent cancellation of flights operating under UDAN. They said passengers lacked confidence about regular flights due to frequent changes in timings and cancellations as a result of which many preferred to fly from Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/early-expansion-of-airport-sought/article32913866.ece

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, President of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene Badagalpura Nagendra said the Centre should declare the flood situation in north Karnataka as a national calamity and amend the guidelines of National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) for distribution of relief to the victims. He pointed out that different parts of the State had been ravaged by floods during the last three years, but both the State government and the Centre had turned a blind eye to the suffering of the people, who had not only lost their home and hearth, but also standing crops. He said the government should amend the NDRF guidelines, which only seek to give out small amounts as dole, and scientifically reimburse the entire amount lost by the farmers suffering crop losses; reconstruct the houses lost by the people in the floods; and waive the entire outstanding loan of the farmers whose crops had been lost in the rain fury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farmers-condemn-govts-neglect/article32913867.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||MoU signed to integrate metro, rail stations at Yeshwantpur||After a delay of over six years, the authorities have taken initial steps to integrate Yeshwantpur metro station with the railway station. The metro station, part of the Green Line, was opened for commercial operations in 2014, but was not linked to the railway station. For years, passengers and activists have been questioning the inordinate delay in integration of the two stations. On Wednesday, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL), in a press release, said that it has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Bengaluru division of South Western Railway (SWR) to provide multi-transit integration facilities. An 82-metre-long foot-over-bridge (FoB1) will be built to connect the railway station with the concourse of the metro station. The authorities will also build a second 230-metre-long FoB branching out from FoB1 to provide connectivity between the eastern and western sides of the railway station and metro station. This FoB will also help passengers reach island platforms of the railways.

Velu Nayakar, have been booked on charges of assault and criminal intimidation after they allegedly attacked the Congress workers during the poll campaign at R.R. Nagar Assembly constituency on Wednesday. Former MP and Congress leader R. Dhruvanarayana told the media that supporters of Mr. Munirathna attacked party workers when they were conducting a door-to-door campaign in booth numbers 108, 109 and 110 of the constituency ahead of the bypolls. Mr. Nayakar along with other party workers allegedly snatched a voters’ list from the Congress workers and tore it up. They opposed the checking of names of voters in the list and objected to the campaign, Mr. Dhruvanarayana and Former Minister H.M. Revanna said. The Congress demanded the immediate arrest of Mr. Nayakar and others who attacked the party workers and appealed to the police to maintain peace in the constituency. They demanded police protection for party workers.  The Congress workers gathered outside the Nandi Layout police station demanding the arrest of those involved. D.K. Suresh (Congress), Bengaluru Rural MP, filed a complaint with the police demanding immediate action failing which he threatened to continue the dharna in front of the station. In his complaint, he said due to the attack by Mr. Nayakar and other BJP supporters, two Congress party workers, including a woman, sustained injuries. “Everyone has the right to campaign and seek votes, but the BJP is preventing the Congress from campaigning,” he told the media, and alleged that the BJP is creating bogus voter IDs and dropping the names of many people from the new lists.  Councillor denies Refuting the allegations, Mr. Nayakar alleged that Congress workers were resorting to unethical practices and offering money. “We objected to this and even brought it to the notice of the Congress leaders, but in vain,” he said. He denied allegations of the attack. “The police are witness to the argument between both party workers,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/munirathnas-supporters-booked-for-attack-on-congress-workers/article32913707.ece

Nagar, the Janata Dal (Secular) leaders targeted the BJP vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra, who is staying at Sira to campaign for party candidate Rajesh Gowda. At a party rally in Sira on Wednesday, which also saw JD(S) candidate Ammajamma, who had earlier been infected with COVID-19, making an appearance, the JD(S) party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said their candidate was up against the financially-stronger BJP candidate. While the two leaders did not take the name of Mr. Vijayendra, the son of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, they said that Sira was different from K.R. Pete in Mandya, where the BJP wrested the seat from JD(S). “The Chief Minister’s son has come here. What is his relationship with Sira? Instead of spending money here to woo voters, he can spend the money on the flood-affected people in North Karnataka,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said. Earlier, Mr. Gowda, referring to Mr. Vijayendra, said “the BJP youth leader” had said that he would “finish off JD(S)” like in K.R. Pet. “However, Sira is different from K.R. Pet,” he said. Denied ticket Tumakuru Rural legislator Gowrishankar claimed that the “crorepathi” BJP candidate had approached the JD(S) for ticket but had been denied it as the party had decided to field the family member of the late legislator.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sira-is-different-from-kr-pet-deve-gowda/article32913712.ece

From 6.76% on June 27, the State’s daily TPR saw a drastic jump to 11.2% in over a month’s time (on July 29). TPR hovered between 11% and 18% for a long time before it reduced to 13% in September. Then it further reduced in October and stood at 9.53% on October 11. From then onwards, the TPR has been on a decline consistently.

This festival is being conducted by Sahaja Samruddha in association with ASHA-Kisan Swaraj, Bharat Beej Swaraj Manch and Save Our Rice Campaign. Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha said almost 10 months of the year has been lost due to the pandemic and the lockdown and no seminar or conference could be held all these days. But as more and more people are shifting to the virtual mode and are working online, it was thought fit to harness this medium and bring together all the stakeholders.  Though the 2-day festival will seek to share knowledge, it could even share seed resources subsequently. The organisers said seed savers from different States will participate and the focus will be on traditional seed diversity of rice, millets, vegetables etc. The keynote address will be delivered by Kuldeep Singh, Director of National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources. There will also be a live demonstration of cooking traditional culinary delights using the seeds. Resource persons include scientists and seed conservationists from across the country who will share information and speak on topics such as rescuing India’s rice diversity from extinction, black rice of Manipur, cultivating rice diversity, and popularising millets besides covering topics such as diet, diversity and immunity. For registration and online participation contact Deepak on 9986623073.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/virtual-seed-biodiversity-festival/article32913871.ece

Halli and K.G. Halli, on Tuesday arrested Syed Sethu, 34, an autorickshaw driver. According to officials, Sethu had been absconding since August 11, and was arrested when he returned to his house. He is the second person to be arrested in connection with the violence, which was sparked off by a derogatory post against Islam byNaveen Kumar, nephew of Pulikeshinagar MLA Akhanda Sreenivasa Murthy. In September, the NIA had arrested Syed Sadiq Ali, 44, a recovery agent of a private bank, for his alleged involvement in the attack on K.G. Halli police station. Officials suspect Sadiq of being in touch with many accused who were part of the conspiracy to create a law and order problem on a large scale. As part of the probe, the investigation agency had questioned former mayor Sampath Raj and former Pulakeshinagar councillor Abdul Rakhib Zakir, both of whom have been named in the chargesheet filed by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) police, which is also probing the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dj-halli-violence-autorickshaw-driver-held/article32914089.ece

22 October 2020||IDUKKI,KERALA||Exemptions likely in ban on tree-felling||The issue of permission for felling eucalyptus at Vattavada, Kanthallur, and Kottakambur villages may find a solution with District Collector H. Dinesan forming a team of revenue, forest, and survey officials to mark the areas for giving exemption from a blanket ban on tree-felling imposed in Devikulam taluk. The ban was imposed as per a report submitted by the then Principal Secretary, Land Revenue, Nivedita P. Haran in 2015. Water depletion A large area of Vattavada, the main cool-season vegetable cultivating village, was under eucalyptus cultivation and the government last year gave permission to fell trees on private land after submitting an application with proper documents to the village offices. Eucalyptus cultivation resulted in depletion of groundwater and reduced the area of vegetable cultivation at Vattavada and Kanthallur. Livelihood affected The blanket ban on cutting trees had affected the livelihood of people and efforts to bring back the area under vegetable cultivation. A major issue was that farmers did not get the benefit as only a few of them had title deed or documents to apply for the permission to cut eucalyptus. A recent meeting took note of the issue and it was decided to form a special team for land verification. The Collector had also asked village officers to give immediate permission for felling eucalyptus on land with proper documents. Forest dept. worried The Forest Department had objected to the move to lift the ban fearing that trees on forestland would also be felled under the cover of felling eucalyptus on private land. A forest official said Vattavada and Kanthallur were surrounded by forests and trees there would be felled if permission was given to cut eucalyptus on private land. A revenue official said as a large number of farmers at Vattavada did not have land documents, they did not benefit from the ban relaxation. Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan said the survey would be conducted in a time frame to identify those who would benefit from the exemption.

22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||MGU gears up to conduct exams||Mahatma Gandhi University has renewed efforts to hold semester exams in the traditional pen-and-paper mode amidst the pandemic crisis. With the publication of the notification for second semester undergraduate and postgraduate exams, the authorities are hoping that the exams could be conducted as per physical distancing norms and other protocol prescribed by the health authorities. A standard operating procedure is likely to be published for the conduct of the exams in November. The entry and exit of students will be arranged without overcrowding of candidates. Minimising rush Wherever possible, rush will be minimised by permitting students to leave the campus in a phased manner. The use of masks and sanitisers will be made compulsory for invigilators and students. There will be facilities for washing hands at the entrance and exit points in each college. Students will have to sanitise their hands before entering exam halls. The seating arrangement will ensure the minimum distance prescribed by the government. The authorities are hopeful that the exams can be conducted in November as regular classes remain suspended in view of the COVID-19 situation. An assessment of the turnout for each exam showed that physical distancing norms could be adhered to as there would be no other students on the campus, except those who appear for the semester exams. Major challenge The major challenge is to provide hostel facility to students coming from outside districts. If college managements do not get permission from the government to reopen hostels, the varsity will propose identifying budget hotels and accommodation for such students. Facilities near colleges The students may have to confirm the bookings, but the college authorities will be told to provide information on available facilities nearby the college. The varsity authorities said that such facilities would be able to offer discount to students as a majority of the hotels and lodges have little occupancy in view of the pandemic situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mgu-gears-up-to-conduct-exams/article32913811.ece
22 October 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Brother of COVID-19 victim files medical negligence complaint||After the brother of a deceased COVID-19 patient from Aluva filed a complaint with the Kalamassery police alleging medical negligence, a police inquiry has begun. The police said that the complaint was of a similar nature to that filed two days ago by the family of C. K. Haris, another deceased patient from Palluruthy, and a simultaneous inquiry would be conducted in both cases. Haris, who died of COVID-19 in July, was named in an audio clip sent out by the nursing officer at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery. The officer had suggested in the clip that Haris had died because the staff had failed to place his ventilator tube properly. Meanwhile, a junior doctor, Dr. Najma Salim, who told a section of the media on Tuesday that the issues raised in the audio clip were likely to be true, has filed a complaint with the Kalamassery police. A few social media handles had wrongly alleged that she was part of the Kerala Students’ Union, and had portrayed her in poor light, she wrote in her complaint. She was also afraid of an attack against her on the basis of such posts on social media, she wrote. Dr. Najma Salim said that she had previously alerted her superiors verbally to the fact that ventilator tubes and oxygen masks were sometimes not placed properly. Questions around the deaths of three patients have been raised so far and she had known all three patients though she was not around when they died, she said. In Haris’s case, a doctor on duty then had told her about the circumstances of his death, she said. “In the case of the two other patients, there were lapses, but I did not say that the negligence led to their deaths. They died a while after such lapses were noticed,” she said. Despite repeating that she was not part of a political party, allegations continued to do the rounds on social media prompting a police complaint, she said. The police said that the complaint had been forwarded to the cyber cell for further action. Nisthar K.A., who has filed a complaint alleging negligence in the death of his brother, Byhakki, who died of COVID-19 in July said, “The junior doctor’s statements made us question the circumstances around his death and we decided to proceed with filing a complaint,” he said. C.K. Sainabi, Haris’s sister, said that the family had been told that his condition was getting better a week after he was admitted. He was not in a critical condition when he was admitted to the hospital. The news of his sudden death had come as a shock and they were not told that he had died of a cardiac arrest, she said. While the family had complained to the hospital Superintendent soon after his death, they had received no response. Haris had not complained to them of any lack of medical attention, but negligence towards the end might have cost him his life, she said. Rights panel order The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Secretary of the Health Department and the Principal of the Government Medical College Hospital to conduct an inquiry and submit a report on the allegations that there were lapses in the treatment of COVID-19 patients at the hospital. SHRC Chairman Antony Dominic has asked for the reports to be filed in three weeks. In its directive, the commission pointed out that the allegations were serious and that the audio clip had been brought to its notice. ‘Image tarnished’ The allegations had tarnished the reputation of the medical college and damaged the morale of the health workers at the institution, said a statement issued by the Ernakulam unit of the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA). The hospital has been working relentlessly to fight the pandemic over the past nine months. While the KGMCTA supported an inquiry into the matter, the public and media organisations must refrain from engaging with the reactions that would damage the image of the hospital, their statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brother-of-covid-19-victim-files-medical-negligence-complaint/article32914207.ece
22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||SOP issued for management of COVID-19 victims’ bodies||The Department of Local Self Government has published the standard operating procedure for proper management of the bodies of COVID-19 victims. The guidelines were issued following the confusion among the local bodies concerned and the relatives of the dead over the performance of the last rites. The standard operating procedure has been formulated based on the guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on the management of the bodies of the victims and the precautions to be followed by the relatives and the municipal workers handling the bodies. The local bodies will have to ensure safe handling, transportation and cremation of the body, if the relatives are not willing to receive the body. The ambulance used for shifting the body should be cleaned with one per cent sodium hypochlorite under the supervision of the health staff. The family members can view the body after it has been prepared for burial in accordance with their customs and traditions. The body should not be taken out for bathing/viewing or placing in a mobile freezer. Those involved in placing the body in the grave or on the funeral pyre should wear PPE kits as per the health protocol. The post-funeral ceremonies should be postponed as much as possible until the end of the pandemic. It is not compulsory that the belongings of the dead must be burnt or disposed of. However, it should be handled with gloves and cleaned with a detergent followed by disinfection with a solution of at least 70% ethanol or 0.1% (1000 ppm) bleach. The clothing and other fabric belonging to the victims should be machine washed with warm water at 60-90 degree Celsius and laundry detergent. The hospital authorities should intimate the municipal authorities through the station house officer concerned on the last rites of the dead, if family members or relatives fail to get in touch with them or remain reluctant to receive the body within 12 hours after the death of the patient. The local bodies have to make all arrangements to cremate/bury the bodies as per the protocols in such cases, the guidelines said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sop-issued-for-management-of-covid-19-victims-bodies/article32914209.ece
22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Paucity of funds likely to hit Rs. 25.9-crore Kuzhikandam creek rejuvenation project||The remediation of the contaminated Kuzhikandam Thodu in Eloor is likely to be delayed for want of funds. Kuzhikandam Thodu, a 1.5-km-narrow creek, figures among the 12 priority hazardous waste-contaminated areas spread across the country as per a study by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The remediation work was taken up under the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) project initiated by the Ministry with the support of the State Pollution Control Board. The estimated cost of the remediation project is about Rs. 25.9 crore. The fund available now is only Rs. 11.79 crore. With the Centre shelving the NCEF project, the funding gap of Rs. 10.36 crore has to be met to implement the project as per the detailed project report. The government had earlier decided that 60% of the total estimate had to be shared between the polluting industries based on ‘polluter pays principle’ and the State government while the Centre would provide the remaining 40%. As per official records, Hindustan Insecticides Ltd (HIL) has to bear the remediation cost of Rs. 3.59 crore for soil and sediment at the area designated as ‘A1’ in the project document while the share of Merchem Ltd. was Rs. 1.41 crore. FACT, Udyogamandal, and Indian Rare Earths Ltd. had remitted their share of Rs. 1.25 crore each for remediation of surface and groundwater. The State Pollution Control Board is yet to receive the share from Merchem while HIL had paid Rs. 1.24 crore of its share of Rs. 3.59 crore. The Environment Department has asked the board to bring clarity before giving technical sanction for the first phase of the work. It has directed that the location of the effluent treatment plant for the remediation project has to be finalised. The board, which had proposed setting up the plant on nearly 75 cents of HIL, should execute an agreement with the company for setting up the plant. KITCO, which had prepared the estimate for the plant, has to submit a time schedule for the remediation of the three areas identified by the board. The board has to submit a report on other possible sources of fund that could be used for completing the project as the available fund would be sufficient only for remediation of the ‘A1’ site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/paucity-of-funds-likely-to-hit-rs-259-crore-kuzhikandam-creek-rejuvenation-project/article32914201.ece
22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Print me a cookie, please! How KAU is exploring food of the future||A packet of 3D-printed cookies with a dash of cardamom and pepper or cinnamon and cloves looks closer to reality than ever before as the Kerala Agricultural University’s business incubation centre firmly explores 3D food printing using a combination of locally available ingredients. The incubation centre was looking at several combinations for the 3D food printing project, said head of the centre K.P. Sudheer on Wednesday. Vice Chancellor R. Chandra Babu said the incubation centre was leading the efforts to build an economy founded on local produce. “Vocal for Local is the motto as we help farmers and entrepreneurs with identifying potential produce, processing, value addition, branding and marketing,” he said. Among emerging trends, experts say, 3D food printing will revolutionise the way we eat. Automatic food tellers and instant chapatis look primitive before food printers, churning out, layer by layer, the ‘masala dosa’ of one’s imagination with the choicest of colours, flavour, shape and nutrition. C. Anandharamakrishnan,  director of the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, cited reports that said 3D printing could achieve a market volume of around $30 billion by 2022. He told The Hindu on Wednesday that the institute had, over the past two years, identified and optimised printing and post-processing conditions for a range of food materials and food/agro materials. “We now work on various aspects of technology scale-up and other allied fields, popularising the technology across the country,” he said. Established in 2014, the KAU agri business incubation centre is backed by the World Bank, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Kerala and Union governments as part of the National Agricultural Higher Education Project and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation. Innovations The centre has been engaged in developing new techniques, hand-holding entrepreneurs and funding them through various government schemes. Its successes include the development of a technique for vacuum frying chips, which ensures product quality as well as enables reuse of the frying medium up to sixty times against the conventional single use. The centre has developed a sensor-based fruit sorter, a machine to slice through jackfruit, a vegetable and fruit slicer-cum-dicer and a fruit and vegetable blancher. Other innovations include a bee wax-based solution in bran oil as a healthy coating substitute for conventional products. The vacuum impregnation method to preserve fruits as well as a technology to make pulp, jam and ice-cream from fruits have been developed at the centre. A method to produce powder from banana stems, which has great medicinal qualities, is a major breakthrough. The centre has developed a technique to produce gluten-free pasta from medicinal quality rice varieties like Njavara and Raktasaali as well as rice flakes; a mini parboiling machine that can easily be handled by women; retort pouches for long-term storage of food items; and a method for preparing ready-to-eat snacks from dried elephant foot yam and moringa combination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/print-me-a-cookie-please-how-kau-is-exploring-food-of-the-future/article32914203.ece

22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||High Court acquits RSS workers in murder case||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has set aside the Palakkad Additional Sessions Court verdict convicting and awarding life imprisonment to five RSS workers in connection with the murder of two CPI(M) workers. The prosecution case was that the accused had hatched a criminal conspiracy at a BJP office near the Nilampathi bridge at Kadukkamkunnam and murdered CPI(M) workers Gopalakrishnan and Raveendran in 2007. Two other accused had earlier been acquitted of the charges by the sessions court. The acquitted are Manikandan, Kuttayi, Murukadas, Udesh, and Gireesh. The Bench, while acquitting the five RSS workers, observed that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that the police had shown undue haste to register the FIR. The investigation was shaky. If at all nobody had witnessed the incident the investigating agency should have taken pains and put in an effort to investigate the case on circumstantial evidence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-acquits-rss-workers-in-murder-case/article32914288.ece

22 October 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Kerala firm rolls out RT-PCR test kits||A Kerala-based company, TCM Ltd, has rolled out on a commercial scale ‘Covi-DetecT’, its brand of RT-PCR test kits based on technology developed by IIT Delhi. TCM Ltd, which was a chemical company until recently, was among the six firms chosen by IIT Delhi to commercialise its technology. Announcing the development, Joseph Varghese, Managing Director of TCM Ltd, said that the company’s unit at Kinfra Biotechnology and Industrial Zone in Kochi has reached a capacity for 100 kits translating into 10,000 tests daily, which will be further augmented in a week’s time to roll out 500 kits (50,000 tests) per day. He said that at present, Kerala is entirely dependent on supply of test kits from other States and it takes anywhere between 48 to 72 hours, sometimes even more time, for the kits to reach the State through a dry-ice packed journey. “In such cases, chances of quality deterioration are comparatively higher as against our capability to deliver the Kerala-made kits within 4 to 5 hours anywhere across the State. COVID 19 (RT-PCR) test kits are to be kept under minus 20° Celsius at all times and any variation will affect quality. Also, local labs are not required to stock the test kits in big quantities now, as they are made in their vicinity. There will be price advantages too,” he said. “We are ready to sell Covi-DetecT to the government at near-cost prices and join the bandwagon to fight the dreaded disease,” he said. Manju Abraham, Chief Scientific Officer of TCM Healthcare Pvt Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of TCM Ltd, said the RT-PCR assay developed by IIT-Delhi is by far the surest method available in India as it identifies the presence of the virus by analysing the RNA coding for spike glycoprotein, which is a protein expressed on the viral surface. “The biggest advantage of our test kit is that it also checks a human gene [GAPDH] along with the viral gene in the test and thus identifies any sample insufficiency which could have occurred due to improper sample collection, sample transport or RNA isolation,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kochi-firm-rolls-out-rt-pcr-test-kits/article32913814.ece

Home care was started in the district on September 4 and over 10,000 patients were placed in home isolation after that. “Though there was some doubt in the initial days, intensive awareness drives could convince the public about the benefits of home care,” said an official. Usually asymptomatic patients and those with minor symptoms such as fever, cough, and headache are placed in home care based on the recommendation of medical officers. “Along with teleconsultation, the department also provides counselling for family members. Home care was accepted after patients started experiencing the advantage of it.” Study on home care Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) had conducted a study in the district according to which only 16% of the high-risk primary contacts of COVID-19 patients in home care contracted the infection.

22 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Traders hold protest against ‘forcible’ NH widening||Traders owing allegiance to Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Samiti organised demonstrations in 388 locations in Kozhikode district to register their protest against the “forcible widening” of the national highway without addressing the rehabilitation demands of affected people. Considering the prohibitory orders in place, protests were organised by five-member groups in select locations covering both the affected stretches of the national highway and other local roads. They alleged that the proposed widening plan on the Vengalam-Azhiyoor stretch alone would displace around 1,400 shops. ‘Centre indifferent’ “We are not against the highway widening project. But it should be implemented after giving reasonable compensation to the affected traders and building owners. The Union government is least bothered about such demands and sanctioning the required funds to the State government,” said C.K. Vijayan, joint secretary of the Samiti. He claimed that a majority of traders affected by the proposed widening plan were above 50 years of age, and that they would not be able to open new ventures in the absence of a humanitarian rehabilitation offer or financial support. The Samiti expressed solidarity with the protests, as some of their members had already been asked to vacate buildings. Many of them were found approaching building owners with requests to share a portion of the compensation with the traders. Samiti leaders said a few landlords were kind enough to accept the plea. Nadapuram road According to merchant organisation leaders, the proposed widening will affect around 150 shops on Nadapuram Road alone. Even buildings with historical importance will vanish with the implementation of the project, they claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traders-hold-protest-against-forcible-nh-widening/article32913748.ece

22 October 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||An unforgettable virtual moment||COVID-19 scripted an unforgettable virtual moment in the life of T.P. Narayanan, an ex-serviceman from Kozhikode’s Kakkodi village, on Wednesday. The man who was helpless to attend his daughter’s wedding owing to the infection accomplished it the virtual way using the laptop of another patient at a COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTC) in the city. “It was on October 11 that I reached Kozhikode from Goa with the sole intention of organising my eldest daughter’s wedding. As it was the first such event in our family, I had secured sufficient leave from my new employer. We never thought that it would end up like this,” said Mr. Narayanan. The date of the wedding had been rescheduled many times owing to the unexpected challenges related to the stringent COVID-19 protocols and containment zone regulations. Mr. Narayanan had rescheduled his leave in such a way to do the arrangements for the wedding in advance. He said the unexpected test result came last Friday and it was quite a disappointing moment for all. He was least aware of the scope of watching it live, but it was made possible with the help of a youth from Vadakara. Mr. Narayanan said the family members, including the newlywed couple and local friends, contacted him many times over the phone and it somehow helped him manage the situation. There were also a few friends at the FLTC who assisted him to take it in a positive way and enjoy the great moment for the family, he said. Health Department officials said it would take at least a week more for Mr. Narayanan to get discharged from the treatment centre. “I am perfectly alright now with no visible symptoms or health issues. We will celebrate the moment together after the hospital days,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/an-unforgettable-virtual-moment/article32913738.ece

They alleged that because of the new project, the school lost much of its existing electronic equipment. “We already had 40 classrooms with projectors and laptops, and they were removed as part of implementing the new project. And they disappeared from the school,” said Ms. Jomon.

22 October 2020||S.R. PraveenTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Fronts set the ball rolling for Corpn. polls||The announcement of reserved wards in the city Corporation for the upcoming local body elections has set off speculations regarding the candidates for each ward. Discussions have begun at the booth level in all fronts for possible candidates, with multiple contenders cropping up for some parties in some wards. The contest will be keenly watched due to the unexpected result in the 2015 elections when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had increased its tally from 6 to 34 wards, mostly at the expense of the United Democratic Front (UDF), which went down from 42 to 21. The questions regarding candidate selection within the UDF raised then have now been revived, according to UDF sources. KC(M)’s exit The recent shift of the Kerala Congress (M) from the UDF to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has freed up two seats within the UDF. Although the seats are expected to be handed over to the Joseph group, several contenders have come forward from the Congress for the Poonthura ward, where the sitting councillor is with the Joseph group. “We have asked the constituents to put forward their requests, which we will get in two days. Detailed talks will be held from October 23. The final decisions regarding the Corporation, district panchayat and block panchayats will be taken at the district level,” said Beemapally Rasheed, UDF district convener. For the ruling LDF, KC(M)’s arrival raises the question of the wards which the CPI(M) and the CPI will have to give up. Discussions have begun at the CPI(M) district committee for its candidates. Mayor candidates The names of two or three possible contenders for the Mayor post, reserved for woman, are in the air. The LDF, according to sources, is expected to bring in a few fresh, young faces, with those who have contested more than two or three times making way, except in a handful of cases. “The names will be finalised in a week. An understanding has almost been reached within the LDF regarding the seats to be set aside for the new party joining the front,” said CPI(M) district secretary Anavoor Nagappan. The BJP, which had recently suffered a jolt when one of its councillors quit the party and joined the CPI(M), is looking to consolidate the unexpected gains it made in 2015. Winnable persons The winners are making a strong pitch for seats, while the party is scrutinising their performance and chances of a repeat win before taking a final decision. “The booth-level discussions have begun. The suggestions from there will be passed on to the higher levels up to the district. For us, there are many factors to consider, but the ultimate factor will be whether the candidate is winnable. Our aim this time is to capture power in the Corporation,” said M.R. Gopan, BJP’s council party leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fronts-set-the-ball-rolling-for-corpn-polls/article32914344.ece
22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Base prices for 16 farm produce||Base prices for 16 agricultural produce, including vegetables, fruits, and tubers, will come into force in the State from November 1, Kerala Formation Day. The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to introduce the base prices designed to protect farmers from adverse price fluctuations. The government terms the initiative as the first of its kind in the country. The base price has been arrived at by calculating the production cost plus 20% on the basis of a study conducted by the State Agricultural Prices Board. To curb malpractice, the government has also fixed a ceiling for per-hectare productivity for each of the items. In the event of the market prices of the aforementioned items falling below the base price in a district, a district-level committee will declare the base price as having come into force in that district. The quality of produce will be a criterion. To become eligible, farmers have to upload the area of their farmland, data on sowing, expected harvest and harvest time before the season onwww.aims. kerala.gov.in. The Agriculture Information Management System mobile app is downloadable from Google Play Store. They should also avail themselves of crop insurance. A farmer will be eligible for base price for a maximum of 15 acres in a season. The Agriculture Department has joined hands with the Local Self-Government Department and the Cooperation Department to introduce the pricing, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said. The produce will be procured through the outlets of the department, Vegetable and Fruit Pomotion Council Keralam and Horticorp, and the Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/base-prices-for-16-farm-produce/article32913834.ece

22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||e-scooter, e-rickshaw from KAL soon||The public sector Kerala Automobiles Limited (KAL) is to give a big push to State’s e-mobility journey by launching e-scooter, e-goods autorickshaw, and e-rickshaw from its plant at Aralumoodu in the capital. KAL’s foray into personal mobility and other arenas comes in the wake of the demand for three-seater environment-friendly Kerala Neem G autorickshaws launched by it from even outside the country. KAL is the first public sector undertaking in the country to foray into the e-mobility business and the aim is to build on it. KAL has begun steps to roll out e-scooter, e-goods autorickshaw, and the e-rickshaw after carrying out the feasibility. While the e-goods autorickshaw can be rolled out from the existing platform for e-auto, a new platform is needed for the e-rickshaw and the e-scooter. The modern machine shop set up on the KAL premises for Rs. 7 crore will come in handy for the new projects. Efficiency and cost The five seater e-rickshaw, to be rolled out for travel on the level roads and for city ride, is to run 80 km with one charging. While the price of the e-auto is Rs. 2.85 lakh, the e-rickshaw will be sold for Rs. 2 lakh. The e-goods autorickshaw will also run for 80 to 90 km with one charging. It will be able to ferry up to 600 kg of goods and will be priced below Rs. 3 lakh. The State road network would have environment-friendly e-goods autos replacing the conventional autorickshaws in the near future in tune with the introduction of e-autos in three major cities. The e-scooter and e-goods auto are to be launched in two months. KAL is planning two variants of the e-scooter in March 2021, both will cost less than Rs. 75,000, KAL managing director A. Shajahan told The Hindu . The e-scooter will be a good alternative to traditional petrol scooters and it will offer great torque, speed, comfort, and performance. “We are rolling out an e-scooter equivalent to a 100cc conventional scooter and this will address the speed issue,” he said. Indigenously made batteries using German technology can be charged within three hours and 55 minutes. Charging can be done using a three-pin plug in households that have single-phase connection for the upcoming e-scooter, e-rickshaw, and e-goods autorickshaw. KAL’s plant that can now roll out 7,200 e-autos annually will soon be upgraded to manufacture 15,000 e-autos. They will soon hit the streets in large numbers in Kerala as 17 dealers have been appointed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-scooter-e-rickshaw-from-kal-soon/article32913830.ece

The Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules will be amended to include the new reservation norm and it will come into effect from the date of notification.

Guidelines issued by the SEC on Wednesday prescribe postal ballots for COVID-19 patients and voters in quarantine. However, there are procedural difficulties involved in issuing postal ballots to people who test positive or in quarantine on the days immediately preceding the elections. State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran told The Hindu that a solution would be worked out through discussions with the Directorate of Health Services.  At an all-party meeting convened by the SEC on September 18, political parties had shot down a proposal to allow the two groups to assign proxy voters. The parties had asked the SEC to devise a solution. The other option, allowing patients and the quarantined to cast their votes in the last hour of voting also is fraught with difficulties. Many voters who fall in these categories would be hesitant and it would also entail putting polling officials at risk, say SEC officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sec-working-out-norms-for-safe-polling/article32913850.ece

22 October 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD board’s decision to withdraw defamation case triggers row||The decision of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Trust Board to withdraw the defamation case filed during the TDP term against YSRCP Member of Parliament V. Vijaya Sai Reddy and former chief priest A.V. Ramana Deekshitulu has triggered widespread criticism, besides raising question marks over the use of temple funds by the parties to settle political scores. The TDP government had faced a rough weather in the run-up to the 2019 elections with several issues pertaining to the Tirumala temple taking the centre stage. ‘Missing pink diamond’ The political heat had turned intense with the YSRCP highlighting two major allegations levelled in 2018 by Mr. Deekshitulu — a ‘pink diamond’ going missing from the temple treasury and an attempt to excavate the temple, allegedly with an eye on the ‘hidden treasure’. Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy had even accused then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu of taking away the ‘pink diamond’ and demanded a search of his house. Terming the campaign “mischievous and malicious,” the TTD board, led by Putta Sudhakar Yadav, filed defamation cases against Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Mr. Deekshitulu for Rs. 100 crore each. After the change of guard, the incumbent board, led by Y.V. Subba Reddy, recently resolved to file an appeal in the court for withdrawing the case. ‘Pay up court fee’ The board’s decision came in for widespread criticism. BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy flayed the TDP and the YSRC for “turning the board into a sanctuary for party leaders and making it a platform to settle political scores.” “Who will take responsibility for the loss of Rs. 2 crore paid as court fee?” he sought to know at a media conference on Wednesday. Members of both the TTD boards should volunteer to pay up the amount to the TTD exchequer, he insisted. Chittoor district Congress leader P. Naveen Kumar Reddy wondered whether there really existed a ‘pink diamond’ as was alleged by Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Mr. Deekshitulu. “If not, the two should admit in public that they had blatantly lied for political gain,” he demanded. Mr. Naveen Kumar Reddy also flayed the bureaucrats at the helm for trying to save politicians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/row-over-ttd-decision-to-withdraw-case/article32913480.ece

Responding to the issues raised by the industry bodies, Managing Director of AP Tourism Development Corporation and CEO of AP Tourism Authority Pravin Kumar said the department had adopted a strategy for revival of the sector. He said the next two months would be crucial from the standpoint of building confidence in the tourists about safe travel. Aggressive, yet cautious marketing, coupled with adherence to the SOPs for safe operation of hotels, would be critical for revival, he said. Mr. Pravin Kumar said the APTDC had already started operating its 37 hotels across the State. The tourism committee members stressed the importance of resolving the issues impeding the recovery of the sector. They said, though hotels and other establishments had opened, the footfalls were anything but encouraging. They also recommended a unified mobile app to better synergise the efforts being undertaken by various states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-tourism-policy-will-be-flexible-and-aggressive/article32914272.ece

Praveen Kumar of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on Wednesday struck down the quash petition filed by A. Sudheer Babu, retired tahsildar of Thullur mandal in Guntur district, against the probe by the CID into his alleged involvement in the Amaravati land scandal. Mr. Babu allegedly tampered assigned land records and got them registered in the name of some businessmen through fraudulent means, in collusion with some others. He is accused of nudging land owners belonging to SC and ST communities to part with their lands by giving them the impression that the government would acquire their holdings without paying them any compensation and by selling to persons known to him, they could realise the true value. The CID had begun the investigation, but it was previously stayed by the High Court.

In the affidavit, he stated that the SEC was not being provided adequate support and resources needed to discharge its duties, as a consequence of his recent contempt petition against the government’s action of not reinstating him as the Commissioner. Mr. Ramesh Kumar pointed out that the High Court had struck down the AP Panchayat Raj (second amendment) ordinance - 2020 resulting in his restoration as the State Election Commissioner. ‘Funds not released’ He said the process of elections, which were postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic, was still under way and his reminders for the release of Rs. 40 lakh (which was sanctioned through G.O.

22 October 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Visakha Agency a repository of vintage firearms||On October 14, B. Balaram, a 24-year-old tribal, was allegedly shot dead by Poorna Rao, one of his hunting companion, in the Baliaguda forest area in Dumbriguda mandal in Visakhapatnam Agency. Around 20 people from the same village had gone on a hunting expedition and Balaram was reportedly shot dead accidentally by Poorna, who mistook Balaram’s concealed movement behind a bush for an animal. He died on the spot and the police arrested five of the hunting party members including Poorna and seized five country-made firearms. Well, this is not a stray incident. A few months ago one such incident was reported in Parvathipuram Agency in Vizianagaram district. Hunting is considered to be a ritual for tribal people, especially during festivals, and they primarily hunt wild rabbits and wild boars commonly found in this part of the eastern ghats hills. They are generally armed with bow, arrows, spears and guns. Many families living in the interior mandals such as G.K. Veedhi, Dumbriguda, G. Madugula, Munchingput, Koyyuru and Pedabayalu posses at least one firearm. The police term the weapons as ‘natu tupaki’ or country-made guns, but not many know that some of them have vintage value. Experts say some of the guns owned by tribals are from the colonial period and are muzzle-loading, smooth-bore flintlock muskets, which could date back to the 18th and 19th century. “For a tribal, possessing a musket is a matter of pride as they claim that the weapon has been passed down to him from his ancestors. The Agency areas from Rampa in East Godavari to Malkangiri in Odisha, spreading in Visakhapatnam district, have witnessed several violent rebellions against the British in different phases, by the likes Tamanna Dora (from 1839 to 1880) and Alluri Sitaramaraju (from 1922 to 1924). And some of the arms date back to those eras, which were looted from the British garrisons,” says prof. P.D. Satyapal of the Department of Anthropology in Andhra University, ‘No Munger connection’ Meanwhile, some senior police officers ruled out the possibility that the arms do have the Munger connection. Moreover, the tribals who rarely go out of their native mandals, cannot reach Munger to buy a weapon. They neither have the access nor the money to buy the arms , said a police officer. Moreover, Maoists will not allow them to procure modern arms. Visakha Range DIG L.K.V. Ranga Rao, says the police will collect all such arms to avoid recurrence of such incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/visakha-agency-a-repository-of-vintage-firearms/article32913550.ece

People can contact toll-free number 104 in case they suffer breathing problems,” he said. The Collector also asked the officials of APSRTC, Revenue and police departments as well as staff of private offices and PSUs to organise awareness drives on COVID-19. “Managements must make sure that everyone wears a mask without fail. Utilise publicity material, hoarding, messages, cable networks, and FM radios to drive the message home,” he said. GVMC Commissioner G.

Said to be a potent stealth ASW corvette, Kavaratti is indigenously designed by the Indian Navy’s in-house organisation Directorate of Naval Design (DND), and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) in Kolkata. This initiative portrays the growing capability of the Indian Navy, GRSE and the nation in becoming self-reliant, in tune with the national objective of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. The ship has up to 90% indigenously built content and the use of carbon composite for the superstructure is a commendable feat achieved in Indian shipbuilding. The ship’s weapons and sensors suite are predominantly indigenous. Kavaratti has the state-of-the-art weapons and sensor suite which are capable of detecting and destroying submarines. In addition to its anti-submarine warfare capability, the ship has a credible self-defence capability and good endurance for long-range deployments. Combat-ready platform The ship will be commissioned into the Navy as a combat-ready platform as it has completed the sea trials of all the systems on board. The ASW corvette takes her name from the erstwhile INS Kavaratti, an Arnala class missile corvette. The older Kavaratti played a key role during the 1971 war.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/asw-corvette-ins-kavaratti-to-be-commissioned-in-vizag-today/article32914287.ece

They will undertake a two-day visit starting Thursday, informed Mr Kishan Reddy. “The team is being sent despite the rain continuing in Telangana because of the scale of devastation. They will tour the twin cities and districts along with State government officials to estimate the extent of loss and submit a report to the Centre,” he said at a press conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. The Minister, who is also the Secunderabad MP, said as per the revised norms decided by the NDA government in 2015, the money will be released from the National Disaster Response Fund and the State Disaster Response Fund. A sum of Rs. 1,207 each will also be given to the injured, Rs. 1,800 for those who lost their clothes and other belongings and Rs. 2,000 for purchase of household goods in addition to compensation to the deceased and those seriously injured. “The Modi government had revised the relief and rehabilitation norms five years ago and accordingly, funds will be released. The State government has already submitted a preliminary report. It will be assessed along with the report to be submitted by the Central team,” said Mr. Kishan Reddy. The Minister advised the Telangana government to make use of the State Disaster Relief Fund to provide succour to the affected people and said the Centre will reimburse the same as it is meant to be used for emergencies.“The Centre is ready to provide all assistance to the State government This is not the time to do point fingers and criticise as Central teams are being dispatched without even waiting for the rain to subside. Centre or State, the funds will be from the public exchequer, so there is no need for politicking on this issue,” he said. Mr. Reddy, however, took a swipe at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government charging that the encroachments on lakes and stormwater drains continue unabated. “Satellite data will clearly show the extent of encroachments on all water bodies in the last few years. Illegal dumping of debris is continuing and I myself had brought these to the notice of the collectors concerned many a time,” he claimed. The Minister also alleged desilting of stormwater drains is not being done efficiently. “Nothing much has been done to prevent urban flooding despite change of governments over the years,” he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/central-team-to-visit-hyderabad/article32914183.ece
22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bandlaguda Jagir residents on the edge||On Wednesday, a viral video from Bandlaguda Jagir left people alarmed. In that, an employee of Bandlaguda Jagir Municipal Corporation could be seen appealing to people living alongside Musi river to vacate their homes and head to safer places as there were chances of the gates of Gandipet (Osmansagar reservoir) to be lifted the same day. As one drives by Gandhamguda in the Jagir, a row of houses in low-lying localities alongside the river can be seen for a fairly long distance. While some are adjoining the river, some are placed a little away from flowing water. The threat of getting inundated is real for people living on the edge, literally. Dream Homes colony is right on the edge of the river. Some residents of the community kept constant check on the water level on Wednesday afternoon. While children were seen playing in the gated community, the elders started to pack their belongings and leave. “There was no flooding here when it rained heavily on October 13. We were asked to shift to a safer place and are now doing so,” said Kamal Kishore, one of the residents of the locality. Some of his neighbours too were preparing to leave. Along with them, people living in 10 more colonies were asked to shift to a safer place at the earliest. The Municipal Corporation’s Commissioner G. Venugopal Reddy and his team mapped the places alongside the Musi river which are vulnerable to flooding if gates of the Osman Sagar reservoir were to be lifted. The 11 places include Bandalguda Village, KK Phase II, Venkateswara Nagar, Kukkala Manyam, Fort View apartments, Sowbhagya Nagar, Sai Harsha Nagar, Vishal Nagar, Sairam Nagar, Dream Home community and Carry Home community. The Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of the Osmansagar is 1790 feet. By Wednesday afternoon, the water level had touched 1786.787 feet. “If it rains heavily on Wednesday midnight, the FRL will be reached and gates of the reservoir will be lifted. Low-lying areas might get inundated. If the gates were to be lifted, one-hour time will be given. As a cautionary measure, we have already asked people living in the 11 colonies to move to safer places. We shifted some people living in shanties to a government school,” Mr Venugopal said. The municipality employees corroborate that there are definite chances of some homes to get impacted if it rains heavily again. T. Laxman, a 50-plus man who has resided in Bandlaguda Jagir all his life, has witnessed Musi overflow at least thrice and even cycled through overflowing water. On Wednesday afternoon, he was seen at the banks of the river. “We used to catch fish from the river. Now there are homes in that spot. I did not see it overflow in the past 15 years. If the gates are released and the river overflows, these homes will see the impact,” Mr Laxman said, pointing at a few houses seen from the river bank.  Army on standby Nine flood relief teams of Indian Army have been put on standby in Hyderabad and Secunderabad for anticipated rescue operations of people due to heavy rain forecast for next few days, responding to the calls of the State government, said a Defence Ministry spokesman on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bandlaguda-jagir-residents-on-the-edge/article32914169.ece
22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Deluge of claims awaits insurance firms||From damaging automobiles, flooding properties to ripping portions of roads, the havoc wreaked by torrential rain in Hyderabad and its suburbs is set to flood general insurance companies with claims in the days ahead. They have begun in the form of motor claims, said sources in insurance industry, estimating property damage claims arising from the downpour to be around Rs. 500 crore. In case of a flood-like scenario, two lines of business that get impacted are motor and property insurance. Stating this, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Chief Technical Officer T.A. Ramalingam said the number of motor claims are bound to be relatively high and have started coming. “We expect a couple of more days’ time before we get the full impact of the number of claims [as some areas are still waterlogged],” he said. The cost of repairs of automobiles, especially new generation vehicles equipped with electronics, is likely to be an expensive affair. While that is an issue for vehicle owners and how much own damage insurance have they opted, for the automobile service sector the challenge is to handle the increase in the number of vehicles. At the over 50 authorised Maruti Suzuki service centres, the emphasis is on expediting the turnaround, according to a senior executive of the company’s service division. Severely damaged cars, however, require more time to be brought back to running condition, especially those that remained under water for more than 24 hours. Besides authorised centres, a number of private multi-brand garages also are witnessing increase in the number of vehicles coming for repairs following the rain. Bal Reddy of S.K. Motors Bosch Car Service in ECIL said his workshop is receiving 3-4 rain rain impacted cars every day. According to him, workshops in some areas remain shut because of water logging. Most of the cars damaged are those parked on the road, he says, adding there also are likely to be cases where the cost of repairs will be more than the resale value. Not all service centres are willing to undertake repairs on such cars as it is a time-consuming process, sometimes requiring a couple of months. Senior surveyor P. Sowjanya Kumar said the insurance industry is estimating Rs. 500 crore of property damage in the rain. “Usually the reported claims are high, but the net will be less as the insured’s psychology is to report everything as damaged,” he said. Noting that many claims were being reported, he said roads also form part of insurance and are covered, by the road contractors, under operational policy. A clear picture on claims will take sometime. Reliance General Insurance ED and CEO Rakesh Jain said, “We have received 150 motor insurance claims and 21 commercial claim intimations. It is too early to determine the actual count and quantum of claims, as claims related to MSMEs start flowing 10 days after occurrence of the event. Going by the magnitude of the flood and property impacted, the actual claim numbers are expected to be high and we will be able to assess the situation fully only once the flood water recedes.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/deluge-of-claims-awaits-insurance-firms/article32914327.ece
22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Power supply restoration taken up on war footing’||All power utilities, particularly the two Discoms, in the State are engaged in power supply restoration works on war , said chairman and managing director of TS-Transco and TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao. Power supply was either stopped as a precautionary measure or snapped with washing away/damage to transmission and distribution installations. Mr. Rao reviewed the progress of restoration works here on Wednesday and stated heavy rain and floods had caused extensive damage to the T&D network such as distribution transformers, poles, high tension and low tension transmission lines across the State, particularly in GHMC/HMDA areas. The damage was on account of rain and floods during the last two weeks, Mr. Rao said, adding that power utilities had been striving hard to restore power supply to all the affected areas. However, the work had become challenging, particularly in the twin cities as power installations in low-lying areas still remain inundated, posing safety threat in the event of restoration of supply. Besides, water in the cellars of several apartments in such areas had also been a hurdle in restoring power supply, he explained. In GHMC are 15 out of the 286 sub-stations were affected but all of them were restored. Besides, of the 2,927 11-KV feeders, 754 were affected and rectified and among the nearly 1.18 lakh distribution transformers, 1,170 out of 1,215 affected transformers were rectified and 45 were still waterlogged. The transformers to which power supply could not be restored so far include 20 in apartments and 25 in other residential areas. Of 8,73 lakh electrical poles in GHMC, 1,296 were affected but 1,264 of those were repaired/restored. He stated that three nodal officers had been appointed to oversee the restoration works and people could contact on them regarding power supply related problems. The nodal officers were entrusted the duty of monitoring the rectification works across the State. The contact numbers of the nodal officers are: 94408-13856 (TSSPDCL areas), 94408-11210 (TSNPDCL areas) and 94913-98550 (TS-Transco). The regular control room, fuse off call offices numbers would also be available for power supply related issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/power-restoration-on-war-footing/article32914167.ece

22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||EODB parameters extended to two departments||Intensifying the efforts to retain the top slot in the implementation of Ease Of Doing Business (EODB) parameters, the State government has decided to make online submission of applications mandatory in two more sectors. The development assumes significance as Telangana which was placed at the top along with the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has been placed in the third position in the latest EODB ranking after Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The slippage of rank was said to be because of the feedback mechanism where the State lost a few points. The government has accordingly extended the EODB parameters to Agriculture Marketing as well as Health and Family Welfare departments. According to the new guidelines, online submission of applications for all types of Trader Licences to be issued by the Agricultural Marketing department through the websitewww.tsmarketing.inhas been made mandatory. Applicants seeking a new trader licence, renewal of the existing licence, amendments in the existing ones and opting for change of person responsible should forthwith apply online. The Director of Agricultural Marketing had been made the designated authority with the entire State as his jurisdiction. Online mechanism has been introduced as there would be no physical touch point for the activities including submission of application, payment of application fee and tracking and monitoring the application status. Users would be able to download the final digitally signed approved certificate online and the checklist of required documents for these services would be made available on the website. Similarly, online submission of applications and issue of registration/renewal certificates would be mandatory through the websitewww.pcpndt.telangana.gov. infor registration and renewal of establishments. The website would offer services like receiving applications for registration or renewal, integration of payment gateway for payment of requisite fee, granting or rejecting applications for registration/renewal, suspension of registration and appeal against rejection besides ensuring online maintenance of records. The entire process from the date of application to the issue/rejection of registration/renewal certificate should be completed within 70 days. Steps should be taken to ensure that there was no necessity of physical touch points from the stage of submission of application and payment of fee. Applicable procedures, comprehensive list of documents, clear time lines and third party verification of services would be made on the website.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/eodb-parameters-extended-to-two-departments/article32914180.ece
22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC issues notice to govt. on Dharani||Telangana High Court on Wednesday issued notices to State government in a batch of PIL petitions questioning collection of details like caste and Aadhaar numbers of people in Dharani portal. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the government to file counter affidavit in response to the PIL pleas by November 2. The petitioners contended that officials were seeking personal details of individuals in the forms meant for identification of assets. This amounted to gathering personal information and would pose a threat to a citizen’s privacy, they stated. Senior counsel D. Prakash Reddy, representing one of the petitioners, said that government can gather details like Aadhaar number and caste of citizens in case of passing on benefits of a welfare scheme to the people. But Dharani portal would be in public domain and posting personal information of individuals on that website would constitute intrusion into the privacy of a person, he contended. The portal had no statutory sanction and would pose challenge to the security of information posted on it. He told the court that earlier the apex court had ruled that government can collect information of caste and Aadhar of people only in case of welfare scheme beneficiaries. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the bench that there was no specific deadline for uploading details of assets held by individuals in Dharani portal. It was a continuous process, he said. Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from the AG if the court can take on record the statement of Chief Secretary that Dharani portal work was kept in abeyance temporarily. The AG sought time to clarify on that point. The matter was posted to November 3 for next hearing.  Relief to rain-hit The bench headed by the CJ declined to interfere in the matter of government giving relief in the form of cash to families affected by heavy rains in the State capital. A lawyer filed a PIL plea seeking a direction to government to transfer money to affected families online instead of paying them in cash. He contended that the possibility of misusing the money cannot be ruled out while distributing cash. The bench, however, declined to pass any direction on the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-issues-notice-to-govt-on-dharani/article32914181.ece
22 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Temple wall narrates a Swayamvaram||The portrayal of ‘Swayamvaram’ of a royal couple of Kalyani Chalukya dynasty, never documented so far, has come to light with the discovery of a sculptural panel at the Trikuta Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Nellikuduru village of Mahabubabad district. This chance finding of the sculpture reflects the sociological practices of marriage by the members of the royal families of yore. Explaining the architectural significance of the pre-Kakatiya period — late 11th century A.D. — shrine former superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India, Chennai, D. Kanna Babu said that the temple stands on a well-built ‘jagati’ platform of about three feet height. In the main shrine Sri Ranganatha is portrayed in a reclining posture, the southern sub-temple has Ramanujacharya and the northern sub-temple Goddess. A vestibule is positioned before the abode of the presiding deity and the two on either side having only sanctums. The most puzzling aspect of the temple is its decorative walls with sculptural representations. Elaborating on the carved figures, he said that the panel on the northern wall portrays the marriage scene or ‘Swayamvaram’ of a royal couple. The panel contains upper and lower registers. “It is exciting to note that the upper register exhibiting a royal prince, in elegant attire, stood on its right side and he was approached by a princess, wearing a highly fashioned apparel tied with an ornamental waistband, and offering him a flower bouquet and he received it,” Mr. Babu said. An attendant is also seen behind her with some bunch of flowers. In another panel, the prince is seen holding her right hand with his left hand. “This sculptural scene demonstrates the Swayamvaram feature and reflects the noblemen’s style of life in contemporary society,” he said. Since the temple bears the architectural features of Kalyani Chalukyas, it is reasonable to presume that the it was built by a subordinate regional chieftain of sovereign Chalukya king when they were overlords of these provinces before the advent of Kakatiyas of Anumakonda. Mr. Babu said that the prince in the sculptural panel might be Kumara Tailapa, the younger brother of Bhulokamalla and son of Vikramaditya IV. His father made him chief of Kandurunadu province and the bride may be the daughter of a nobleman family of Nellikuduru. “The Swayamvaram might have taken place at this temple complex and the scene is carved on walls by an unknown sculptor of that time. Unfortunately this episode was not mentioned in any of the contemporary literary records,” he said. According to him, the lower register of the panel exhibiting medallions of two swimming fishes and wrestlers and two elephants planting a mango tree indicates a happy sign of marriage. He said that there is a common ‘mukha mandapa’ hall and entry is through doorways at the east.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/temple-wall-narrates-a-swayamvaram/article32914178.ece
22 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Conman who used ‘gold trade’ as bait held||A trickster who duped a man to the tune of Rs. 1.7 crore in the guise of gold business was arrested by Hyderabad Central Crime Police. In August last year, K. Koteswara Rao Gupth from Ameerpet lodged a complaint against Kota Rakesh from Guntur alleging that the latter promised to supply gold at a low price compared to the market, and took Rs. 1.7 crore and failed to supply the yellow metal. The accused, Rakesh (46) alias Komaravelly Harishankar alias Jampana Suresh hails from Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka. “To gain the trust of his clients, he would supply small amounts of gold for a low price two or three times. Once the person trusts him, he will collect the huge amounts and escape,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said. Earlier Rakesh was involved in various offences in Vijayanagaram, Vijayawada in AP and Karimnagar and Nalgonda here. “He was absconding,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/conman-who-used-gold-trade-as-bait-held/article32914192.ece

22 October 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Rs. 25 lakh ex gratia for the affected sought||The Core Committee meeting of the Telangana Congress that met at Pragnapur has demanded that the State government increase the amount for flood relief from Rs. 500 crore to Rs. 5,000 crore and also condemned Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for not visiting the flood-affected areas in the city or the extensive crop damage areas in rural areas. “A number of issues such as huge misery and loss of life, property and agricultural crops and the inadequate response of state and central governments were discussed. The Core Committee unanimously passed resolutions on various issues," Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said. The meeting was attended by AICC Incharge Manickam Tagore, CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and other senior leaders. The meeting also decided to write to the Prime Minister that the present situation in Telangana be declared as a national calamity, a statement said. Mr. Reddy demanded that the amount sanctioned by the State government for flood relief be increased from Rs. 500 crore to Rs. 5000 crore; ex gratia of Rs. 25 lakh be given to each person who has died and Rs. 5 lakh for the houses damaged fully apart from Rs. 2 lakh to partially damaged houses. Mr. Reddy said the government must immediately take up enumeration of crop damage due to rains. "For all farmers where extensive crop damage has occurred, an amount of Rs. 20,000 per acre be given immediately. Damaged cotton, paddy and maize be purchased with relaxed conditions and higher moisture content be accepted. The party leaders argued in the meeting that the Chief Minister had directed the farmers to cultivate finer varieties of paddy and since the farmers are yielding 30% lesser and losing Rs.10,000 per acre the government should purchase paddy at Rs. 2,500 per quintal. Pump house The Congress party also condemned the negligent approach of the TRS government and blamed it to the collapse of the Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme in Mahabubnagar district. This has led to a loss of thousands of crores to the public exchequer and loss of irrigation water to 3.2 lakh acres of parched lands in Mahabubnagar district. It was decided to constitute a TPCC Sub-Committee to look at all aspects of Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme and recommend future course of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rs-25-lakh-ex-gratia-for-the-affected-sought/article32914187.ece

22 October 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Settle flood claims fast, says IRDAI||The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has directed insurers to take steps for expeditious settlement of claims coming from the flood affected areas in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and neighbouring states. Issuing guidelines, pertaining to the claims, to all general insurance and standalone health insurance companies, it said the floods had caused immense loss to property in parts of the states. Towards quick registration and disposal of claims, IRDAI asked the insurers to nominate a senior officer at the company level who would act as a nodal officer for the affected States. The nodal officer is required to coordinate receipt, processing and settlement of all eligible claims. He/she should contact Chief Secretary/officer concerned immediately and be in regular contact thereafter. Similarly, district level nodal officer may be appointed in the affected districts to liaise with Collector/district administration, a circular from IRDAI said. The regulator wanted the insurers to give publicity to contact particulars of the nodal officer, on their websites, through media and the State government channels, to enable immediate filing of claims. In addition, 24/7 helplines may be set up, the Authority said. “It needs to be ensured that all claims are surveyed immediately and claim payments/on account payments are disbursed at the earliest and in any case not exceeding the stipulated time-line.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/settle-flood-claims-fast-says-irdai/article32914182.ece

Jagga Reddy has stated that TRS should lose Dubbak in the interests of the State and it was for the people to decide after the Congress has exposed the ruling party to the hilt in corruption, misgovernance. Speaking to reporters here, he said Finance Minister, T. Harish Rao’s political career was at stake in the by-election and he was misusing the official machinery to campaign for the TRS candidate. He also alleged that Siddipet Collector, Venkatrami Reddy was breaching all norms to support the ruling party while some police officials too were working for the government.

The Chief Secretary held a review meeting with senior officials to review the process of disbursement of assistance on the instructions of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao on Wednesday. The officials were directed to constitute 300 teams in the Greater Hyderabad limits and 50 teams in the neighbouring municipalities for distributing the financial assistance at the doorstep of the affected families without any delay. A control room should be set up in the office of the Municipal Administration commissioner for monitoring the distribution process. The officials should prepare route maps, identify affected localities and mobilise required manpower from the districts as required. Ten teams comprising three members each should be constituted for each circle for disbursal of the amount. Route officers should be appointed in each circle for arranging required cash to the teams. He requested the State Level Bankers Committee to ensure adequate cash in high denominations even on holidays to ensure uninterrupted distribution, the Chief Secrtary said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cs-for-systematic-plan-for-aid-distribution/article32914191.ece

22 October 2020||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Recent floods continue to test Musi Project||Musi project in Nalgonda continues to face one of the biggest tests of flood in its 57 years of service, as torrential rain in upstream Hyderabad threaten to continue heavy inflows. The project which can hold 4.46 tmc ft water at full reservoir level (FRL) of 645 feet and provide irrigation to 30,000 acres in its command area, has set new records this season. Not only has the impounded water crossed the FRL by up to three feet, but also the outflow, on October 14 alone, was an unprecedented 16 tmc ft, 3.58 times the project’s gross capacity. The total discharge for two successive days was 25 tmc ft, say officials. By contrast, the total discharge from the project to downstream between June and October this year was 38 tmc ft. The recent bout of heavy rains is is also one of the rarest times when officials breached a section of the dam to let out up to 25,000 cusecs of water. The dam was breached near the abutting Ratnapuram village in “an emergency move”. According to records at the project office, the 1983 flood saw the maximum inflows of about 2.28 lakh cusecs, in comparison the project received nearly 2.5 lakh cusecs in the past few days. The maximum flood capacity of the project is 4 lakh cusecs. In 2005 and 2013, water levels rose up to the embankment, however, related figures of inflows and outflows were unavailable. Is the current swelling flood a threat to the dam? District Minister and Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy recently dismissed the question of a threat and said: “There is no danger to Musi river or the ayacut. This is an unprecedented flood, from Hyderabad and Bikkeru Vagu, receiving more than 2 lakh cusecs. We breached a section of the dam and officials are now monitoring the levels.” However, the project officials pointed out, “The question of Musi dam’s safety is dependent on the gates and their operation as well as their capacity to withstand the flows and not about the volume of flood received and discharged. The structure is fine.” Maintenance of the project was in question in October 2019, when a regulatory gate got washed away, and more than 4 tmc ft impounded water, at 643 feet, drained in a few days. This brought into focus the maintenance as all the gates had been replaced with new ones at an estimated cost of Rs. 18 crore in 2015. Thankfully, subsequent bountiful rains filled the reservoir, which not only saved face for the administration but also served the needs of the farmers in the ayacut. The recent rains too tested the maintenance of the project. On October 14, when 13 gates (of the total 12 crest gates and eight regulatory gates) were operated to a height of 10 feet, crest gate no. 9 failed to open as its counterweight had snapped in August this year. Fortunately, the 35-ton beam did not break the gate, but fell away. The gate is not working well, the officials agree. On Tuesday, when this correspondent visited the site, workers and welders were busy patching up the foot of regulatory gate no. 2. Other gates also show leakages, or throw up problems at closing and opening, officials said. It is not just the gates, the nearly six-decade-old dam is also visibly old, with the meagre staff that is ready for retirement, and the decrepit stairs and cracked structures. The border railings of the earth dam and the gate columns, braced with sticks and wires like bandages, welcome officials and visitors alike.  The question of Musi dam’s safety is dependent on the gates and their operation as well as their capacity to withstand the flows and not about the volume of flood received and discharged.

Every street in the constituency headquarters witnessed a large number of women, in thousands, taking part in the rally held as part of election campaign on Wednesday. Some of them came with bonalu on their head. The rally and meeting were addressed by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, Lok Sabha member K Prabhakar Reddy, party candidate S Sujatha, MLA Padma Devender Reddy and others. It was held from from bus stand to Ambedkar statue to Telangana Talli statue. “See the crowds of people who attended the rally held today. This is the trust people have on the TRS whereas it was the hired people who attended the meetings organised by both BJP and Congress. Opposition parties do not know the meaning of development. Why BJP leaders are silent over the challenge thrown by me on pensions? Do Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay know the borders of the constituency?” asked Mr. Rao while addressing the gathering. He wondered why the same pension of Rs. 2,000 was not being extended by BJP ruled states or any other schemes implemented here. The Minister alleged that the BJP was indulging in mud-slinging and fake campaign through social media but people are not ready to believe what they said. “Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was born and brought up in Chintamadaka. Can we expect anyone other than him showering love on the people of Dubbak?” he asked adding that people will get deceived if they vote for both BJP and Congress. Mr. Prabhakar Reddy said that leaders of both the parties will be present only during elections and later none of them will be here. He said only TRS was capable of bringing development to the the constituency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-activists-dress-dubbak-in-pink/article32914197.ece

22 October 2020||Bhopal,||‘File cases against leaders for violating COVID-19 norms’||The Gwalior Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court has directed Datia and Gwalior district administrations to register cases against former Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar for the alleged breach of COVID-19 protocol during election campaigns. While issuing the direction on Tuesday, Justices Sheel Nagu and Rajeev Kumar Shrivastava restrained District Magistrates of nine districts under the jurisdiction of the Bench from permitting any political party/candidate to organise physical congregations unless they satisfied the DM that virtual campaigns were not possible. The decision of the DM permitting any political party to conduct physical congregation should become effective only after the EC approved it in writing, the court said, while hearing a petition filed by Gwalior-based lawyer Ashish Pratap Singh. Even if the permission was granted, the Justices added, congregations could be organised only after the political party/candidate concerned “deposits money with the DM sufficient to purchase double the number of masks and sanitisers required for protecting and sanitising the number of persons expected.” Candidates are also required to file an undertaking that they would be personally liable to distribute masks and sanitisers to members of a congregation before it started. Instances pointed out in the last 15 days gave “a clear indication” that functionaries, members of political parties or the person at the helm were taking no steps to avoid physical congregation, the court noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/file-cases-against-leaders-for-violating-covid-19-norms/article32914158.ece
22 October 2020||Kolkata,||Kolkata family tones down Durga Puja celebration||One day in the autumn of 1757, a cannon shot reverberated through the settlement of Shobhabazar, now a part of north Kolkata. It wasn’t a spillover from the Battle of Plassey, which had taken place only a year before about 80 km away, but still, in a way, connected to it. The cannon was fired to mark the slaying of the demon at the Durga Puja taking place at the newly built palace of Naba Krishna Deb, then Calcutta’s wealthiest man — complete with the title of Raja — for having helped Robert Clive in the decisive battle. The chief guest at Naba Krishna’s maiden Durga Puja celebrations was — who else — Robert Clive himself. This grand event set off a trend. Soon, every wealthy Bengali worth his title was organising Durga Puja at home to assert his social standing, which would be directly proportional to the number of sahibs and memsahibs gracing his event. Nautch girls would be in attendance and dinner would include wine and meat. While Naba Krishna had all the wealth, he had no heir, so he went on to adopt his brother’s son Gopi Mohun Deb. Later, though, he was able to father a son, Rajkrishna, through another wife, and in that home he began another Durga Puja, either in 1788 or 1790. Later, he split his wealth between the two homes. A lot of water has flown in the Hooghly since then: Clive is now in the pages of history books and those grand titles are as good as family gold. But the two homes set up by Naba Krishna have been following the tradition of Durga Puja to a T. Except that this year, for the first time, outsiders will not be allowed in due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Every Durga Puja, it is the Shobhabazar Rajbari, where Clive was the chief guest in 1757, that enjoys all the limelight. Not much is written about the second Shobhabazar Rajbari that lies across the road, the one Naba Krishna built for his biological son Rajkrishna. “We are a big family, more than 200 members at present,” said Krishna Rajeshwari Mitra, a homemaker and writer, who is an eighth-generation descendant of Naba Krishna and belongs to the Rajkrishna branch. The 200 she mentions are the present-day members of this branch alone. The one celebrated by the family, according to her, differs from the other Durga Pujas in two aspects. One, sweets and savouries are offered to the goddess instead of cereals; two, only male members are involved in the rituals right from the making of the idols to the immersion. And idols are crafted from moulds that date back to the times when Puja began in the palaces. “Another point worth mentioning is that a band party accompanies the immersion procession. Once upon a time, a bird would be flown just before the immersion, a signal to Lord Shiva that the Mother Goddess was on her way back. Later, we began dropping a mud bird into the holy river. For the past two-three years, we have been releasing a balloon,” Ms. Mitra said. “I definitely feel fortunate to be born in this family,” Ms. Mitra said. “At least in Kolkata we get some importance, especially during Durga Puja. I guess these are things that children of all bonedi families ( bonedi derives from buniyadi , or families that laid the foundations of Kolkata) are taught.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kolkata-family-tones-down-durga-puja-celebration/article32913794.ece

Mr. Kanojia was arrested in August for allegedly posting a tweet purportedly about Dalits, tribals and Backward Castes people being barred from entering the Ram Mandir. He was arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police from his Delhi residence. According to an FIR registered at the Hazratganj police station here, Mr. Kanojia was accused of posting on Twitter the screenshot of a post attributed to Sushil Tiwari, a member of a little known fringe group Hindu Army. In the post, Mr. Kanojia allegedly made a sarcastic remark about barring entry to the Ram Mandir for OBC, SC and ST communities.

22 October 2020||Mumbai,||Khadse’s exit exposes discontent over BJP sidelining OBC leaders||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse’s decision to quit the party, which he served for 40 years, has brought to the fore the discontent within the State unit over the sidelining of leaders from the OBC community, a core voter base of the party. Mr. Khadse was a product of the BJP’s social engineering programme in the 70s and 80s to attract OBC voters, with its Madhav (Mali, Dhangar and Vanjari) formula. Mr. Khadse has categorically put the blame on the Leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, and clarified that he has no ill feelings against the party and its leadership. In the 2019 Assembly polls, Mr. Khadse and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, another OBC leader from Vidarbha and former power minister, were denied party tickets. Mr. Khadse’s daughter was then given the ticket at the last moment. There was also speculation that Pankaja Munde, daughter of the late Gopinath Munde, would switch parties as she was unhappy with the functioning of Mr. Fadnavis, the then CM. With Mr. Khadse joining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the party hopes to regroup its lost strength in north Maharashtra and gain the support of the Leva-Patil community. NCP State president Jayant Patil has said another 12 BJP MLAs are in touch with the party and are likely to switch sides soon. Reacting to the development, Mr. Fadnavis said Mr. Khadse was dealing in half-truths. He said, “I have nothing to comment as he wants to make a villain out of someone. The BJP is a big party and it won’t stop if one person leaves it. Jalgaon is a stronghold of the BJP and its people are with the party.” He added that no MLAs would leave the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/khadses-exit-exposes-discontent-over-bjp-sidelining-obc-leaders/article32913790.ece
22 October 2020||Mumbai,||Court refuses ad interim relief to Hansa Group against Republic TV||In a temporary relief to the Republic TV Group, a city civil and sessions court on Wednesday refused to grant ad interim relief to the Hansa Research Group seeking restraining orders against the channel to air any details of report on Television Rating Points (TRPs) by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). The Hansa Research Group filed a suit against ARG Outlier Media Private Limited and owner and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami. The suit sought a permanent injunction order restraining the channel from broadcasting any internal document. The suit also sought a temporary injunction pending the final disposal of the suit restraining the channel to broadcast the report. The plaint states that the BARC commissioned Hansa in 2014 to be part of TV Audience Measurement Process by installing ‘Bar-o-meters’ viz electronic meters to capture who is watching which channel. “Since the tariffs for advertisement are based on viewership data, there are instances that certain channels attempt to manipulate their viewership data.” The plaint mentions, “In order to overcome this misuse, the vigilance team of BARC and the plaintiff are constantly monitoring for any wrong-doing to influence viewers to watch a particular channel to boost the viewership data of that channel. During investigations by the vigilance team of BARC with Hansa it was found that Vishal Bhandari, former employee of Hansa, was inducing viewers to watch particular channels. Hence, deputy general manager Nitin Deokar filed a complaint on October 6.”  The plea adds, “It appears that the said internal document prepared by Hansa, which was a draft internal document which was not shown to or approved by the Chief Executive Officer of the company for the purposes of filing the said police complaint, could have been accessed by the channel without permission or consent and telecast as ‘Hansa Report’.” The suit states, “After the announcement by the Commissioner of Police on the TRP scam, Mr. Goswami referred to the particular document, showed parts and portions of the document on the screen again and again, and claimed that the name of Republic TV was not mentioned in the said report but the name of some other channel was there.” The matter will be heard on November 21.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/court-refuses-ad-interim-relief-to-hansa-group-against-republic-tv/article32913795.ece
22 October 2020||Mumbai,||HC questions hashtag campaign against Rhea||The Bombay High Court, referring to the probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, on Wednesday asked Republic TV’s lawyer if asking the public who should be arrested in a case was part of investigative journalism. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni posed this question to counsel Malvika Trivedi representing Republic TV with respect to the hashtag campaign ‘#ArrestRhea’ run by the channel. The Bench asked, “The grievance is regarding #arrestrhea. Why is this part of your channel news? When a case is under investigation and the issue is whether its a homicide or a suicide and a channel is saying it is murder, is all this investigative journalism?” The court said, “investigative powers are given to the police under the Cr.PC [Code of Criminal Procedure] and you have become the investigator, prosecutor, judge and you also declare the verdict. Then why are we here?” The court asked why the channel broadcast photos of the body, and speculated on whether the actor’s death was a case of suicide or homicide. The court was hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions against the unfair, malicious and false media campaign against the Mumbai Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-questions-hashtag-campaign-against-rhea/article32913796.ece

Deputy Commissioner of Police Abhishek Trimukhe confirmed this to The Hindu and said, “They have been issued notices after the direction from the court.” On October 17, the Bandra magistrate court ordered a FIR to be registered against the duo for “promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion” through their tweets. This direction came after Munnawarali alias Sahil Ahsrafali Sayyed, a film casting director, filed an application before the court. The application said, “Her [Ms. Ranaut’s] tweets are creating divisions between Hindu Artists and Muslim Artists. I say that she is maliciously bringing religion in almost all her tweets for example lynching of Hindu Sadhus at Palghar, calling the BMC as “BABUR SENA”. I say that she has gone to such an extent that she has also blamed Jamaatis for spreading Corona virus etc. thereby trying to create hatred and communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims deliberately as she is well aware that she is a well known actress and has a big fan base so her tweets will be seen and will reach out to many people.” He urged the court to give a direction to the police to register an FIR against the sisters under Sections 153A, 295A, and 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mumbai-police-issue-notices-to-kangana-ranaut-sister/article32913797.ece

The service was expected to start in May this year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. CIDCO said the Rs. 111-crore project to construct Nerul jetty is in the final stages of completion. The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), the Bombay Port Trust (BPT) and CIDCO are jointly developing the waterway along the east coast of Mumbai, which will connect the city to Navi Mumbai and Raigad. Transport services will first begin on the Nerul-Bhaucha Dhakka route and then on the Nerul-Rewas-Mandwa route in Raigad district. The BPT has built a water terminal at Bhaucha Dhakka, while the MMB constructed one at Mandwa. CIDCO is building the terminal at Nerul. The project will include a Ro-Ro (roll-on roll-off) service. On Monday, Thane MP Rajan Vichare reviewed the project along with CIDCO vice-chairman and managing director Sanjay Mukherjee. “The journey from Navi Mumbai to Mumbai takes around two hours, but once the service starts, it will be reduced to 25 minutes. Plans to connect Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander to Navi Mumbai are also in the pipeline,” Mr Vichare said. CIDCO PRO Priya Ratambe said, “The work on the jetty started in April 2018 and now it is back on track and will be finished in the next five months.

22 October 2020||New Delhi,||Some respite for Delhiites as AQI may improve slightly||The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida deteriorated slightly and was in the ‘poor’ category on Wednesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. However, the air quality of Delhi is expected to improve slightly on Thursday, as per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a government-run monitoring agency. “The overall air quality index [AQI] has marginally deterioratedtoday [Wednesday]. It is forecast that the air quality may improve by tomorrow [Thursday] to the ‘poor’ category due to cleaner easterly wind intrusion. The AQI will be in the ‘poor’ to lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on Friday and Saturday,” SAFAR said in a statement. The AQI of Delhi was 256 and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 263 and 264 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Wednesday, which is an average of the past 24 hours.  Fire count The stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring border regions of Delhi were 849 on Tuesday, said SAFAR. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi is estimated to be around 15% on Wednesday and is likely to decrease due to change in wind direction. The local wind speed is only ‘moderate’ and the wind direction in neighbouring States is favourable for a “moderate” transport of pollutants to Delhi due to stubble burning. In a related development, the Delhi government on Wednesday launched the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign to reduce air pollution. “I appeal to all the residents of Delhi to join the campaign as part of the war against pollution. Till now, the Delhi government and various agencies were involved in the war. Today, we are reaching out to two crore people of Delhi to participate in this fight,” Environment Minister Gopal Rai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/some-respite-for-delhiites-as-aqi-may-improve-slightly/article32913780.ece

22 October 2020||Pune,||Will announce relief package soon, Uddhav tells farmers||The Maha Vikas Aghadi government was committed to restore the livelihoods of farmers hit hard by the retreating monsoon, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday. He said his government would soon announce a relief package. Speaking after touring rain-hit Osmanabad in Marathwada, Mr. Thackeray said he had not come there to announce any random figure merely for the sake of garnering applause. He said the State Cabinet would be meeting in a day or two to decide on the modalities of the relief that would be given to the affected people. 90% spot inspections done “The situation is terrible. Crops and livelihoods have been destroyed… I am aware that you all have come here with a lot of expectations from me about when and how much will be the package that is announced. But I cannot announce anything that I will not fulfil. Today, I have come to reassure everybody that the government is with you... the spot inspections are nearly 80-90% over and we have received an estimate,” the Chief Minister said in Katgaon village. He said the State government is committed to restore normalcy in the lives of the farmers as soon as possible. Mr. Thackeray also said the India Meteorological Department officials had informed him that the threat of heavy rainfall had now waned, with only the possibility of lightning over the next seven to eight days. He said, “This year has been a catalogue of calamities — first COVID-19, then floods in Vidarbha and now heavy rains in other parts of the State… I am here to review the losses and to assure you that the government is with you. The soil has eroded in a number of places owing to heavy rains... help will be given as soon as possible.” Opposition pressure Mr. Thackeray has been under pressure from the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who has been relentlessly targeting the Chief Minister and the State leadership demanding to know why the government has not yet announced a relief package for the ran-hit farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/will-announce-relief-package-soon-uddhav-tells-farmers/article32913789.ece
22 October 2020||Washington,||Trump steps up attack on Biden, Harris||With just two weeks left to go for Election Day, U.S. President Donald Trump and opponent Joe Biden are speaking at rallies in swing States trying to make each day of campaigning count. Among these States, Pennsylvania has acquired special focus. Mr. Trump spent Tuesday evening in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he held a rally at the airport, and former President Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign for Mr. Biden in Philadelphia on Wednesday. In Erie County — an overwhelmingly (87%) white, long-standing Democratic constituency — working class voters, driven by the decline in the manufacturing sector, had turned to Mr. Trump in 2016. The President flipped the county, beating opponent Hillary Clinton by 2 points. Mr. Trump also won Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point in 2016. Mr. Biden had also campaigned in Erie earlier this month — the former Vice President is currently leading Pennsylvania 52% to Trump’s 43% based on polling averages from September 20 to October 5. Mr. Trump, however, is leading in Erie and other western Pennsylvania counties (barring Alleghany counting where Pittsburgh is) by a narrow 50%-47% margin, according to a Washington Post/ABC poll from the end of September. ‘Great victory’ “Hello Erie, remember that great victory we had?” Mr. Trump said at the start of his rally on Tuesday night. “With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, defend our borders, keep jobs and wealth in America, where it belongs,” he said, summing up his standard set of campaign talking points. “This is an election between a Trump super recovery, which is happening right now, and a Biden depression,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Biden would “double, triple and quadruple” taxes. “By the way, Pennsylvania’s been shut down long enough. Get your Governor to open up Pennsylvania.” The President has been banking on his economic record to get re-elected, but the economy has suffered a severe setback due to the pandemic. The country experienced record high joblessness earlier this summer — putting Mr. Trump on shaky ground. Voters are evenly split on which candidate can better manage the economy, the New York Times reported, based on an October 15-18 poll it did with Seina College. Mr. Trump dwelt at length on the economy and the energy sector in particular at his rally on Tuesday. “Joe Biden will ban fracking and abolish Pennsylvania energy,” Mr. Trump said. He also had a clip played — a departure from his rally routine — where Mr. Biden and running mate Kamala Harris had made statements opposing fossil fuels and fracking. Mr. Biden has repeatedly stated he will not ban fracking: he plans to ban new gas and oil extraction permits on federal lands and wants to move the country towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (which would have implications for fracking). Mr. Trump also said a Biden administration would destroy the suburbs . [Mr. Biden and other critics have said Mr. Trump’s messaging on suburbs is racist and a dog whistle]. “No, you don’t like projects being next to your house,” Mr. Trump said. “So much for your American dream.” At one point in his speech, Mr. Trump’s mic stopped working. He joked that it must have been “Crooked Hillary” [Hillary Clinton] who was behind it, quickly moving to Ms. Harris. “But Kamala... Kamala... she will not be your first woman President. You cannot let that happen,” he said. Attack on media Mr. Trump also made repeated attacks on the media during the speech. He listed the media was in cahoots with the Democrats, big tech and the Washington establishment. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden issued a statement on Mr. Trump’s visit. “When candidate Donald Trump visited Erie four years ago, he promised to bring back jobs. President Trump’s visit to Erie today is a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that he broke that promise and has repeatedly failed Pennsylvania’s families over the last four years,” Mr. Biden said. He also said Mr. Trump had incentivised companies to offshore jobs, “waged war on unions” and misled Americans on the severity of COVID-19. Both candidates are acutely aware of what the State could do for them with its 20 electoral college votes. Mr. Trump conveyed this at his Erie rally. “You know if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-steps-up-attack-on-biden-harris/article32913475.ece
22 October 2020||LAGOS,||Unrest flares in Lagos after civilians are fired at||Nigeria’s biggest city Lagos and several states were under curfews on Wednesday as unrest rooted in anti-police protests broke out again following a day of violence, including the shooting of civilians by security forces. Fires burned across Lagos and residents reported hearing gunfire despite President Muhammadu Buhari’s appeal for “understanding and calm”. Armed police tried to enforce a curfew in the commercial capital, setting up checkpoints. But groups of young men blocked a number of major roads with overturned traffic signs, tree branches and rocks. Smoke billowed from buildings that were ablaze. Police — some armed, some wearing body armour and many in plain clothes — set up roadblocks in Lagos, witnesses said. Tuesday night’s incident at a toll gate in Lekki district was the most serious yet in nearly two weeks of nationwide protests fuelled by anger at alleged systematic abuses by police, although details of what happened and the number of casualties remained unclear. 12 dead, says Amnesty The Lagos State Governor said 30 people were hurt in the shooting at the gate, a focal point of the protests. One man had died in hospital from a blow to the head, he said, but it was not known if he was a protester. Rights group Amnesty International said the Army and police killed at least 12 peaceful protesters at two locations in Lagos — Lekki and Alausa — on Tuesday. At least 56 people have died across Nigeria since nationwide protests began on October 8, with about 38 killed on Tuesday alone, it said. The United Nations Secretary-General said there had been “multiple deaths”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/lagos-shut-army-under-lens-after-protesters-are-fired-at/article32913466.ece

Jaishankar. Mr. Pompeo will be accompanied by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper. The third annual ministerial dialogue will take place on October 27, the Ministry of External Affairs said. “In New Delhi, Secretary Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper and their Indian counterparts will lead the third annual U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue to advance the U.S.-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership and expand cooperation to promote stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and the world,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. Mr. Pompeo will then travel to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia. “At every stop I will discuss a broad range of bilateral topics,” Mr. Pompeo said, adding that discussions would also involve looking for the best ways to cooperate to preserve a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. Mr. Pompeo said he was especially looking forward to his talks in New Delhi. “I am sure that my meetings will also include discussions on how free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. “Secretary Pompeo will travel to Colombo to underscore the commitment of the U.S. to a partnership with a strong, sovereign Sri Lanka and to advance our common goals for a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” Ms. Ortagus said in her statement. “Thereafter, Secretary Pompeo will travel to Malé to reaffirm our close bilateral relationship and advance our partnership on issues ranging from regional maritime security to the fight against terrorism,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pompeo-esper-to-travel-to-india-for-22-dialogue/article32914071.ece
22 October 2020||Bangkok,||Thai PM may lift emergency as rival rallies rock nation||Thailand’s embattled premier announced on Wednesday he might lift an emergency decree that has failed to stifle a growing protest movement demanding he steps down and also reforms to the monarchy. After a day of anti-government and rival royalist protests across the country, thousands of angry pro-democracy activists marched on Government House, defying an emergency decree imposed last week banning gatherings of more than four people. As they chanted for him to resign, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-Ocha addressed the nation, saying he would make “the first move to de-escalate” the situation. “I am currently preparing to lift the state of severe emergency in Bangkok and will do so promptly if there are no violent incidents,” he said, without specifying any timeframe. “We must now step back from the edge of the slippery slope that can easily slide to chaos,” he added, calling on protesters to resolve their differences through Parliament. Activists had massed at Bangkok’s Victory Monument, while counter-rallies attracted thousands of royalists in the southern province of Narathiwat and scores more in the capital. Democracy activists have assembled daily in the capital since last week, flouting the emergency edict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thai-pm-may-lift-emergency-as-rival-rallies-rock-nation/article32913473.ece
22 October 2020||Washington,||Need strong alliance to counter China, Russia: Esper||U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper revealed a fresh drive to strengthen U.S. alliances with “like-minded democracies” in part through arms sales in an effort to curb the global influence of Russia and China. Mr. Esper said the Pentagon would systematically monitor and manage its relationships with partner countries, aiming to find ways to coordinate militaries and to advance U.S. arms sales. The initiative, called the Guidance for Development for Alliances and Partnerships (GDAP), comes just two weeks before the presidential election that, if President Donald Trump loses, could see Mr. Esper replaced in January. He underscored the need to build closer ties to “like-minded democracies such as India and Indonesia” adding “they all recognise what China is doing.” Global order It also came after nearly four years of Mr. Trump’s efforts to restructure alliances, including threatening NATO. “America’s network of allies and partners provides us an asymmetric advantage our adversaries cannot match,” Mr. Esper said on Tuesday, calling the network “the backbone of the international rules-based order.” “China and Russia probably have fewer than 10 allies combined,” he added. He said China uses coercion and financial entrapment to build its alliances with weak countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. “The smaller the nation and the greater its needs, the heavier the pressure from Beijing,” he said. He cited visits he has made to build defence relations with Malta, Mongolia and Palau, as well as U.S. plans for a greater presence in Eastern Europe, including basing troops in Poland.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/need-strong-alliance-to-counter-china-russia-esper/article32913467.ece
22 October 2020||Kunduz,||Taliban ambush kills at least 25 Afghan security personnel||At least 25 Afghan security force personnel were killed in an ambush blamed on the Taliban, officials said on Wednesday, as spiralling violence imperils ongoing peace talks. The ambush came despite Taliban assurances to Washington last week that they would reduce bloodshed. Security forces were attacked overnight Tuesday in Takhar province and fighting was ongoing, said Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the governor, who put the death toll so far at 25. “The Taliban had taken positions in the houses around the area. They ambushed our forces who were there for an operation against the enemy,” he said. Takhar provincial health director Abdul Qayoum said 34 security personnel had been killed — including the deputy police chief of the province. Bid to gain leverage The Taliban did not directly take responsibility, but said their fighters had “engaged the enemy” in Takhar to retaliate against security operations carried out against them. Despite joining peace talks with the Afghan government in Qatar last month, the Taliban have only increased violence in Afghanistan in a bid to wield leverage in the negotiations. A major assault by the militants in Helmand province forced thousands of families to flee their homes this month, while a car bomb Sunday near the police headquarters in Ghor blamed on the insurgents left 16 people dead and 154 wounded. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said nearly 40,000 people had fled in Helmand.

22 October 2020||ROME,||In new documentary, Pope endorses same-sex civil unions||Pope Francis endorsed same-sex civil unions for the first time as Pope while being interviewed for the feature-length documentary Francesco , which premiered on Wednesday at the Rome Film Festival. The papal thumbs-up came midway through the film that delves into issues the Pope cares about most, including the environment, poverty, migration, racial and income inequality, and the people most affected by discrimination. “Homosexual people have the right to be in a family. They are children of God,” Pope Francis said in one of his sit-down interviews for the film. “What we have to have is a civil union law; that way they are legally covered.” Civil unions While serving as archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Pope endorsed civil unions for gay couples as an alternative to same-sex marriages. However, he had never come out publicly in favour of civil unions as Pope. “The film tells the story of the pope by reversing the cameras,” said Vatican communications director Paolo Ruffini.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-new-documentary-pope-endorses-same-sex-civil-unions/article32913469.ece

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Potholes on the digital payment superhighway||Digital payments have found strong ground, especially in India, increasingly relegating all other modes of payments to the background. It is through a faster system of simultaneous debits and credits that the money value is transferred from one account to the other across banks. It embraces all kinds of operators (including direct benefit transfer by the government) across the country and even internationally, subject to regulatory forbearance. With such versatility and ease of settling financial transactions, the growth of digital payments is going to be phenomenal, supported by banks and Fin-Tech, or financial technology, companies. Steered by the RBI There is a long and interesting history behind the evolution of digital payments in India, piloted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and succinctly captured in the “Payment Systems in India”, published in 1998 (https://bit.ly/3jmfZF7). A major thrust toward large value payments was effected through the Real Time Gross Settlement System, or RTGS, launched by the RBI in March 2004. The large value payments on stock trading, government bond trading and other customer payments were covered under the RTGS, providing finality of settlement, thereby reducing huge risks such as the Harshad Mehta scam; besides this, it substantially reduced the time taken for settlements. The RBI introduced National Electronic Funds Transfer, or NEFT (https://bit.ly/3kjGAEa), and bulk debits and credits to support retail payments around the same time. Now, NEFT is available round the clock and RTGS will follow from December 2020 — only a few countries have achieved this. Such historical changes brought about by the RBI triggered major changes in the corporate and capital market transactions as well. Today, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the market regulator, is contemplating a T+1 settlement (T is for transaction date) because the underlying consideration of the sale proceeds of the shares get exchanged very fast under the payments system. This is expected to attract more international capital into the Indian market, in turn broadening and deepening the financial market. An umbrella system The sterling contribution of this robust payment system, especially retail payments, was seeded and reinforced with the setting up of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) by 10 lead banks at the instance of the RBI in 2009. The idea for this umbrella retail payments institution emerged in the vision document on payments system, 2005-08 released by RBI in 2005. Very few people know about the unwritten history of the background under which this umbrella organisation was mooted. In 2004, a four-member team including this writer visited the Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, on a study tour. This included a visit to the Bangirocentralen (BGC AB), a not-for-profit organisation owned by eight Swedish banks for providing retail payment and related services. The model appeared as an attractive proposition as payments is basically a public good. Thus the idea of the NPCI as a not-for-profit company has a link from the BGC. The setting up of such an umbrella organisation to build a super highway for digital payments has a strong appeal which was well-appreciated by Dr. Y.V. Reddy, the then RBI Governor, taking a number of policy decisions to spread digital payments and protect consumer interest. However, there were many within and outside the RBI, including in the Indian Banks’ Association, who had apprehensions about the success of such a model for the NPCI. Indicators of success With digital payment being a public good like currency notes, it was necessary that the corporation was fully supported by the RBI and the government as an extended arm of the sovereign. It was also necessary to contain expectations on profits, avoiding gyrations of the stock market along with direct or indirect control by powerful private interests which had the potential to dilute the public good character of the outfit. The NPCI’s success against deeply entranced formidable international players, supported by innovative technology, viz . Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), is well recognised by central banks in many other countries. The Bank for International Settlements’s endorsement of the NPCI model in 2019 is a major accolade. If the NPCI has gained such a rare distinction in just 10 years of its successful and path breaking journey, we should be proud to preserve this precious jewel. There is a demand from some quarters that the NPCI should be converted into a for-profit company to withstand competition. The shareholders of the NPCI can have windfall gains too. But this will be a retrograde step with huge potential for loss of consumer surplus along with other strategic implications. Instead, like the RBI providing free use of the RTGS and other products, the strategy should be to assist the NPCI financially, either by the RBI or the government, to provide retail payment services at reduced price (in certain priority areas). This may also help support expansion of the payment system network and infrastructure in rural and semi-urban areas in partnership with Fin-Tech companies and banks. On merchant discount rate In Budget 2020-21, the government prescribed zero Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), the rate merchants pay to scheme providers, for RuPay and UPI, both NPCI products, to popularise digital payments benefitting both customers and merchants. There is justification in this prescription by the government because depositors implicitly pay around 3% to banks as net interest margin, being the difference between saving and risk free bond rate, for enjoying certain payments services traditionally. When banks enjoy such a huge amount of current account savings account (CASA) deposits, in return, is it not incumbent on them to provide such payment services, costing only a small fraction of such a gain? For reasons unknown, the government left out other providers of digital payment products from this MDR prescription, which is unjustified and had adverse effects. Taking advantage of this dichotomy, many issuing banks switched to mainly Visa and Master cards for monetary gains. As customers were induced by such supplier banks, it created a kind of indirect market segmentation and cartel formation, though there is hardly any quality difference in payment products. It may be noted that even the European Central Bank imposed a ceiling on MDR for all, protecting consumer interest. It is hoped that the government will take corrective action in the next Budget to ensure a level playing field and to relieve the NPCI from such policy-induced market imperfection. Settle the pricing The ideal pricing for digital payments products should be based on an analysis of producer surplus, consumer surplus (i.e. gain or loss of utility due to pricing) and social welfare for which we need cost-volume-price data. A factor which needs to be reckoned is the float funds digital payments allow (cash withdrawal is a drain on the banking system), which is a source of sizeable income for banks. The RBI will do well to study and arrive at a rational structure of pricing including MDR (possibly also penalty on default by customer), given that the digital payment system is like a national superhighway, for which the government has a crucial role to play in protecting consumers against exploitation. This can run into a huge amount when digital payments become all pervasive. It is not the intention to deny a fair amount of return to payment service providers including Fin-Tech companies. But should this be at the cost of huge loss of consumer surplus? Ideally, it should be a case of win-win for all. R.B.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||The manacles of caste in sanitation work||Even in 2020, the Indian government and our civil society continue to grapple with the inhuman nature of manual scavenging. While civil society started a movement in the 1990s to abolish dry latrines, the focus now is on manhole deaths and provision of safety equipment to sanitation workers. The movement has been demanding the abolition of the dehumanising practice of the manual removal of human excreta and calls for the introduction of mechanisation for handling waste. Various State governments and the previous Central governments have responded to these civil society demands by introducing different laws to stop manual scavenging and provide incentives to build toilets. If, on the one hand, the civil society has tended to approach this issue as a collective problem that needs to be addressed by the State, on the other, the current ruling dispensation seems to be framing the issue as a spectacle in the form of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and is addressing the problem in terms of an obstacle in the way of tourism promotion. Problematic descriptions In 1993, the then government promulgated an Act prohibiting the construction of unsanitary dry latrines and employing manual scavengers. The Act defined ‘manual scavenger’ as a person engaged in or employed for manually carrying human excreta. On August 18, 2010, I recorded a video of a sanitation worker entering a manhole without any safety gear, in the English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad, for Dalit Camera, a YouTube channel that documents the experiences of Dalits, Adivasis, Bahujans and other minorities. I also approached various social movements that were campaigning against dry latrines and requested them to include this aspect of manual scavenging to their campaigns, to no avail. The government’s description of dry latrine was a problem, as it defined dry latrine as “latrine other than a water-seal latrine”. Manual scavenging was not just a practice related to dry latrines, but also to insanitary latrines and open defecation. Until the introduction of the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act in 1993, State governments had a post called ‘scavengers’. A scavenger’s job was to manually remove human excreta in households and designated places. The local authorities levied scavenging tax on houses for availing this service. But after the Act was introduced, State governments themselves became agencies that would enforce prohibition of the construction or usage of dry latrines. Ten years later, the Safai Karamchari Andolan, a social movement that campaigned against manual scavenging, along with other organisations, filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court. The demand was to direct State governments and Union Territories to strictly enforce the law to stop the practice of manual removal of human excreta. Mounting pressure from civil society, coupled with the intervention of the Supreme Court, forced the Central government to conduct a survey of manual scavengers in 2013. The survey found that dry latrines and manual removal of human excreta still persisted. In the same year, the government introduced the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act. Though the construction of dry latrines has drastically reduced, the number of deaths in manholes, sewers and septic tanks continues to remain high. The present government had plans to amend the 2013 Act to completely mechanise the cleaning of sewers and manholes and build new sewers. But neither the past nor the present amendment addresses the issue of labour safety. Same is the case with theSwachh Bharat Abhiyan, which skirts the issue of labour rights and the stigma attached to sanitation. As a matter of fact, in Tamil Nadu, all political parties have trade unions for government servants, except for sanitation workers. Bodily wastes are seen as unholy elements that need to be kept away from places of living, cooking, studying, or worshipping. Not only toilets, but even cleaning work is seen as a lowly job in India. Dalit movements have been found wanting in this regard — there have hardly been any organised movements to demand permanent job status for sanitation workers. Most sanitation contracts are given to private contractors or self-help groups, and such staff hardly have ID cards, leave alone the protection of medical insurance policies. Workforce in sanitation departments is recruited via open competition. The local administration usually approaches particular caste members during such hiring. The situation is so dire that while we find volunteers to distribute food and undertake rescue operations during natural calamities, hardly any volunteer offers to do clean-up work or dispose of dead bodies. During the last Chennai floods, sanitation workers from the Nilgiris district were made to travel in garbage trucks to Chennai. This situation has continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Tamil Nadu, sanitation workers are asked to work in newly formed COVID-19 wards. For example, the Gudalur municipality in the State issued an order to six of its staff members to work in COVID-19 wards. Similarly, in Kotagiri town panchayat, officials asked the sons of sanitation workers to work in COVID-19 wards. Question of dignity Unlike other labour forces, sanitation workers do not have a separate rule-book that lays down guidelines for their work timings, holidays, a proper place for roll call, removal from duty, etc. For example, in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu, all the sanitation workers have to stand outside the office during the morning and afternoon roll calls. If they reach early, they are seen sitting on roadside pavements. Even though there are spaces within the office premises, the officers force them to stand outside. The officials claim that the practice is traditional and that for any change, new rules need to be formed. There are no vehicles for sanitation workers to travel to their designated workspaces, and they have to either walk for kilometres or use garbage vehicles . This is a forced choice and is connected to the dignity of a worker. To put this in contrast, no supervisor would stand and travel with the sanitation workers. There are hardly any exclusive trade unions for sweepers, and unlike other sections in government or private workforce, their problems are voiced by only those who are not associated with sanitation work — often NGOs. This, I argue, is because in India, sanitation work is caste-ridden and hence, there is an urgent need to dissociate caste from labour.

26 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||In West Asia, it’s a bleak future amid America fading||When the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed normalisation agreements with Israel in September, under the mediation of the United States, American President Donald Trump hailed it as a “new dawn in the Middle East”. The so-called ‘Abraham Accords’, which saw the first normalisation between Israel and Arab countries in 26 years, was a rare diplomatic victory for Mr. Trump. It was rare because most of the President’s other big foreign policy bets were either disastrous or inconclusive. The U.S.-Taliban deal is largely seen as American capitulation to the Afghan insurgents; the outreach to North Korea failed to produce any result; the maximum pressure campaign on Iran seems to have backfired; the promise to fetch “the deal of the century” between the Israelis and the Palestinians was a non-starter; and the trade war with China failed to produce any structural shift in the way China does business while tensions between the two countries rocketed. Amid this policy chaos, Mr. Trump at least got something in the ‘Abraham Accords’ to present as a breakthrough. But does it bring peace to West Asia, as Mr. Trump has claimed?     It was evident during the Barack Obama years that the U.S. had overstretched itself in West Asia and North Africa, a region America has deeply engaged with since President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s time. The U.S. had been stuck in an unwinnable war in Iraq. In Syria, it was checkmated by the Russians. Its intervention in Libya turned out to be disastrous. Iran continued to be defiant despite threats and sanctions. Israel was uncontrollable. The Arab allies were upset. Mr. Obama realised the historical necessity of resizing the U.S. presence in the region and pivoting to East Asia where China was steadily on the rise. But the U.S. has both allies and rivals in the region. It cannot just pack up and exit. The Obama and Trump years Mr. Obama, in his second term, adopted a realistic approach to address this problem. He made peace with Iran, accepted the Russian lead role in Syria, left Libya burning, ignored Saudi and Israeli sulking over Iran. But, to balance these, he overlooked Israel’s deepening occupation of Palestine and cooperated with the Saudi attack on Yemen. The plan was to let the regional players establish what he called a “cold peace” among themselves. When Mr. Trump came to office, he wanted to undo Mr. Obama’s policy legacy. He demolished the Iran deal, brought Israel back to the centre of America’s policy towards the region and prompted the Arab and Jewish allies of the U.S. to join hands. The plan, as it emerges, was to remake the regional dynamics in favour of America’s allies and push rivals to a corner. Mr. Trump succeeded in bringing the Gulf Arab countries and Israel together, but he failed to escape the historical reality which Mr. Obama faced — America’s dwindling influence in shaping the present and future of West Asia. A policy in which the historical reality is not factored in may not produce the desired outcome. The case of Iran Take, for example, the case of Iran. The acrimony towards Iran was one of the defining factors of Mr. Trump’s West Asia policy. While pulling the U.S. out of the nuclear deal unilaterally and reimposing sanctions on Iran, Mr. Trump thought the Iranians would flinch once again so that he could extract more concessions from them and cut their regional wings. But the perils of that policy were the predictability of the policymaker’s objectives, and the Iranians were determined to defy him at any cost. Iran responded with multiple cuts on the U.S. and allied interests in the region — from targeting Saudi oil facilities and cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz to launching rocket attacks at American troops in Iraq. Mr. Trump’s response was the typical American-style response of the good old days when it was in a position to shape the geopolitical outcome in West Asia. He had Qassem Soleimani, one of the top Iranian Generals, killed and declared that the U.S. had re-established deterrence vis-à-vis Iran. But the use of force did not reflect the ground realities. Less than a year after the assassination of Soleimani, the U.S., faced with continuing rocket attacks by Iran-backed Shia rebels in Iraq, is contemplating shutting down the American Embassy in Baghdad, besides withdrawing most troops from Iraq. Where is the deterrence? Open embrace of Israel While in the case of Iran, misplaced adventurism sabotaged even the available policy options, the Trump administration’s open embrace of Israel — the decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights and the go-head to its annexation of Jewish settlements in the West Bank — sharpened the geopolitical contradictions in the region, instead of bringing peace. The normalisation agreements between Sunni Arab countries and Israel, partly driven by their shared concern of an aggressive Iran in a West Asia sans America, could strengthen the pro-American pillar in the region, but the withdrawal of Arab powers from the Palestinian question would not finish off the Palestinian question. It would rather leave a vacuum in regional politics which non-Arab Muslim countries would seek to fill. This offers new avenues to Turkey, which under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, seeks to re-establish its influence in the region, and Iran, which uses the Palestinian cause to drive public opinion in the Muslim world across the Shia-Sunni divide. In other words, Mr. Trump brought together Gulf Arabs and the Jews, who had had backroom contacts for years, on a public platform. But he also opened the way for the agitated Persians and the ambitious Turks to enhance their weight in the troubled regional politics. Historically, the withdrawal of empires had seen new conflicts arising in their peripheries. In 1911, Italy invaded the Turkish province of Libya, triggering a dangerous competition with the Ottomans in their decline years. A year later, four Balkan states formed the Balkan League to take on the Ottomans in Europe. The collapse of the British empire left ethnic, religious, geopolitical wounds open across the former colonies. Some of the conflicts in the Caucasus, including the ongoing fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, have their roots in the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Given these examples, it is worth asking if the U.S. is prepared to face the geopolitical consequences of the decline of its influence in West Asia. If the four years of the Trump presidency shows any indication, it is not. The new beginning Mr. Trump promised in the region could very well be that of a more troublesome future. stanly.johny@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-west-asia-its-a-bleak-future-amid-america-fading/article32913452.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Back to basics in algorithms||It is heartening to note that the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) envisages putting greater emphasis on mathematical and computational thinking throughout the school years, starting right from the foundational stage of the learning process. Indeed, algorithmics — the abstract process of arriving at a post-condition through a sequential process of state changes — is among the earliest human intellectual endeavours that has become imperative for almost all organised thinking. However, the framing in the NEP appears to put it at the same level of distinction as the more instrumental ‘coding’, and almost as a mere tool towards the utilitarian goals of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. We think this is misplaced. The notions of computation and algorithms are as old as mathematics and date back to the early stages of representing numbers and geometrical figures and manipulating them for various uses. Their origins can be traced back almost to the beginning of the Mesolithic stone age, when the notions of counting and addition began to take form. All early learning of counting and arithmetic is method-based, and hence algorithmic in nature, and all calculations involve computational processes encoded in algorithms. Form of expressions Modern algorithms, almost in the same form as we know them today, began to appear around 300 BC. Some of the earliest examples are procedures to compute the greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers, or the factorial, which appeared in Euclid’s books of Elements, and the descriptions of fast exponentiation and the Fibonacci sequence which appeared around 200 BC in the treatise of Chandah-Sutra by Acharya Pingala. The core algorithmic ideas of modern AI and machine learning are based on some seminal algorithmic ideas of Newton and Gauss, which date back a few hundred years. Though the form of expressions of algorithms — the coding — have been different, the fundamental principles of classical algorithm design have remained invariant. In the modern world, the use of algorithmic ideas is not limited only to computations with numbers, or even to digitisation, communication or AI and data science. They play a crucial role in modelling and expressing ideas in diverse areas of human thinking, including the basic sciences of biology, physics and chemistry, all branches of engineering, in understanding disease spread, in modelling social interactions and social graphs, in transportation networks, supply chains, commerce, banking and other business processes, and even in economic and political strategies and design of social processes. Hence, learning algorithmic thinking early in the education process is indeed crucial. Coding, however, is merely the act of encoding an algorithmic method in a particular programming language, which provides an interface such that the computational process can be invoked in a modern digital computer. Thus, it is less fundamental, and indeed great algorithms have been designed through the ages even without this facility. While coding certainly can provide excellent opportunities for experimentation with algorithmic ideas, they are not central or indispensable to algorithmic thinking. After all, coding is merely one vehicle to achieve experiential learning of a computational process. Learning the fundamentals Rather than the intricacies of specific programming languages, it is more important at an early stage of education to develop an understanding of the basic algorithmic processes behind manipulating geometric figures, computing with numbers, solving systems of equations, modelling road networks and social graphs, and applying algorithmic ideas to everyday problems. In fact, an overemphasis on learning the nitty-gritty of specific programming languages prematurely — even from middle school — may distract from focusing on the development of algorithmic creativity. Indeed, this is a common outcome of the overly utilitarian skills training-based approaches evidenced throughout the country. The devil lies in the details, and, while the NEP guideline of introducing algorithmic thinking early is a welcome step, it must be ensured that it does not degenerate and get bogged down with mundane coding tricks at a budding stage in the education process.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||The battered Puja economy||It is time for dew drops, soft essence of nyctanthes, and the usual holiday season in West Bengal. Most importantly, it is time for the annual extravaganza concerning Durga Puja – the greatest social and cultural feast of Bengal. A few years ago, one of my Malaysian collaborators — a professor in Kuala Lumpur — visited Kolkata during the Puja days. Despite being accustomed to some of the greatest festivities on the globe like Christmas, Chinese New Year, Rio Carnival and Hanami, he found the splendour and magic of Durga Puja astonishing — he was amazed by the hundreds of colourful and thematic pandals (marquees) built temporarily in street-corners and parks, idols of the goddess Durga and her family members prepared in varied styles and depictions, streets flooded with light and the smell of street-food, a riot of colours, with millions of people out for pandal hopping, dressed in their finest clothes, with an average daily footfall of 2-3 lakh in any pandal . Sizeable economy Possibly, the only reasonable estimate of the Puja economy is available in a 2013 ASSOCHAM report, wherein the size of the economy was estimated at Rs. 25,000 crore, at an unbelievable 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The situation might have changed in between, but at this CAGR, the projected size of the Durga Puja economy could be about 2 lakh crore in 2020 — around 13-14% of West Bengal’s GDP. This is in stark contrast to less than 2% contribution of the Rio Carnival to the GDP of Rio de Janeiro, 1.35% sharing of Oktoberfest to the GDP of Munich, slightly more than 1.5% contribution of Mardi Gras to New Orleans’s GDP, and Hanami generating around 2.25% of Japan’s GDP.  However, the economy of Durga Puja needs to be re-evaluated this year as a deadly pandemic has ravaged the world. As a direct impact of shrinking economy, millions of job losses and reduction in income, and amid the fear of contagion, the festivity and economy of the Puja are bound to be curtailed considerably. The Rio Carnival in February and Mardi Gras triggered contagion among the respective communities. And some Indian States saw a surge in COVID-19 cases after Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam. In fact, the Calcutta High Court has ordered that area within a radius of five metres for small pandals and 10 metres for big pandals in West Bengal will be out of bounds for visitors. No wonder, many of the big Pujas will be offering glimpses of prayers and festivity virtually — a remarkable change in the ever-changing history of Durga Puja of Bengal. Large network The ecosystem of community worship inPujahas changed with the economic liberalisation in India. Corporate funding and outdoor advertising, accounting for about 90% or more of the funding, and the traditional five-day festival extending to 10-12 days in the recent years, entail additional business scope, for sure. Also, with the expansion of online marketing, the purchasing pattern has changed remarkably for Puja shopping as well. Furthermore, unlike Oktoberfest or the Rio Carnival, which primarily depend on visitors, Puja economy in Bengal is mostly self-sustained. Puja shopping for apparel, shoes, electronic gadgets, spending over idols,pandals, and tourism, all contribute to the economy. My ‘guesstimate’ is that usually community worship contributes about 15% to the economy, about 10% is spent in pandal hopping, inbound and outbound travel contribute about a quarter, and the remaining half of thePujaeconomy might be attributed to Puja marketing. The COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardised Puja -trips of Bengali people. Assuming that the expenditure on community worship would be reduced to half, and that onpandalhopping would become a quarter, and assuming almost noPuja- trips , about 80% of usual Puja marketing might make the Puja economy half of what it could normally be. My ‘guesstimate’ might be way wrong, but there is no doubt that the Puja economy has been shattered by the pandemic.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||A crucial season||Faced with a potential reversal of gains that India has made in slowing the spread of COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed against weakening the fight during the annual season of festivals. Over the past six months, numerous individual events have enabled the infection to explode and spread. These have ranged from the opening of wholesale markets and political gatherings to big funerals; many were infected when places of worship were allowed to be thronged. Mr. Modi’s appeal, which comes during the Navratri celebrations, and ahead of Dussehra, Deepavali and other festivals, is to be welcomed, although the opportunity to caution the public was not grasped early enough. Also, in spite of the call to “mask up” on October 8, as part of a communication campaign he launched, its visibility has remained low. Moreover, virus estimations remain a mosaic of data, without a standardised system for testing, tracing and isolation across States. Only broad-brush statistics are available, even as the economy has reopened. The Union Health Ministry’s data point to a rising trend in daily cases in Bihar, Delhi, Maharashtra, Manipur, and West Bengal, while Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, with their high levels of incidence earlier, have started showing a decline in test positivity rates, a more reliable metric than absolute cases. Kerala has experienced a wave blamed on lax behaviour during Onam. Health messaging on the dangers of another wave of infections can be effective if it is not drowned by repeated emphasis of massive recoveries. States, anxious to present a picture of near-normality to boost economic activity, highlight recoveries over risk, and people are lowering their guard. Mr. Modi has suggested that the fight must not weaken until there is a vaccine, and experts and WHO want countries to learn to live with an endemic virus. In India, the reality is that even as of October 21, the official death toll in a day stood at 717, a not so inconsequential number, and there were 7.4 lakh active cases. The emphasis, therefore, has to be on preparing for the new normal, adopting acknowledged defences such as masking, distancing norms and hand hygiene. In parallel, the Centre should launch policy reform to transform a predominantly commercialised health system into one providing universal coverage. COVID-19 has meant double jeopardy — a loss of income on the one hand and a steep rise in health insurance premiums on the other, after insurers were asked to provide cover for more conditions. Under such circumstances, the cheapest protection against disease and financial loss is prevention, now and into the future. The Centre says it has a communication strategy centred around the theme of safety until March next year. Its efficacy will be tested immediately, by the festival season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-crucial-season/article32913444.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Return of the socialists||Preliminary results of Sunday’s Presidential election in Bolivia point to an emphatic victory for the former President Evo Morales’s Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party almost a year after he was ousted by protesters and the military. While the official results will not be announced for days, exit polls and independent counts give his hand-picked candidate, Luis Arce 53% of the popular vote against his main rival Carlos Mesa’s 29.5%. Mr. Mesa, who was President between 2003 and 2005, has conceded the election. This is as much a victory for Mr. Morales, Bolivia’s first indigenous leader, as it is for Mr. Arce. Mr. Morales left the country, first for Mexico and then for Argentina, after the Generals asked him to stand down in November 2019. Since then, Jeanine Añez, a right-wing conservative Senator, has been the acting President, rolling back many of Mr. Morales’s policies and going after his supporters. But MAS mobilised its supporters and fought back. Mr. Arce promised voters that if elected, he would carry forward the pro-poor socialist legacy of Mr. Morales, while MAS portrayed Mr. Mesa as a representative of the pre-Morales elites, whose rapid privatisation and pro-market policies had triggered frequent mass protests. The results demonstrate that the voters chose the equity-oriented socialist stability, which MAS offered, over the free-market conservatism of its rivals. The new leader could learn from the achievements and mistakes of Mr. Morales, credited with turning around South America’s poorest country economically. Under his government, Bolivia saw a drop in extreme poverty, from 33% of the population in 2006 to 15% in 2018. He also stepped up public investments, opened more schools and health clinics, built roads and nationalised the oil and gas industry, all while ensuring that the economy continued to expand. These policies helped MAS build a strong connect with the poor, a base which continued to back the party despite last year’s political turbulence. At the same time, his push to stay in power beyond the term limits set by the Constitution helped the Opposition organise itself. He got the ban lifted by a constitutional court after his bid failed in a referendum. This raised questions about the legitimacy of his candidacy in the October 2019 election, which he won but was accused of fraud, leading to protests and his ouster. Mr. Arce’s biggest challenge would be to continue Mr. Morales’s welfare policies, while keeping the battered economy on track. Moreover, the anti-Socialist and mostly white opposition is now more powerful, after ousting Mr. Morales and having run the interim government for a year with the U.S.’s support. Mr. Arce can keep the galvanised opposition at bay only by continuing MAS’s socio-economic “revolution” to expand its support base in a divided country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/return-of-the-socialists/article32913445.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Indira Gandhi not to meet Nixon||India's Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, who arrived here [New York] last night on a four-day visit for the 25th anniversary commemorative session of the United Nations General Assembly now in progress, has passed up U.S. President Nixon's invitation to her to attend the mass dinner he is giving in Washington on October 24 for all visiting Heads of State and Government. While Mrs. Gandhi would perhaps have gone to Washington and met Mr. Nixon if a separate invitation had been issued to her, she felt she should not accept his invitation to dinner, which had been launched by him as a rival show for the U.N. anniversary celebrations here that night, and as a substitute for any individual meetings with the visiting Heads of State. Perhaps the condition of the Indo-American relations currently is best illustrated by the fact that when Mrs. Gandhi left New Delhi, the U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Kenneth Keating, was not present at the airport to see her off and no State Department official was at the airport here either to recieve her. At the New York airport when she arrived by a special Air-India charter flight, she was recieved by the U.N. Deputy Chief of Protocol, New York City's official greeter and Envoy Commissioner, Mr. Palmer, the Indian Ambassador to the U.N., Mr. Samar Sen, the Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Mr. L.K. Jha, and other Indian officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indira-gandhi-not-to-meet-nixon/article32913454.ece
22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Govt. to widen manufacturing PLI plan||The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing investments will soon be extended to eight more sectors, and the government is close to finalising its policy for the strategic sale of public sector enterprises (PSEs), Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday. “In the offing are about seven-eight sectors where the PLI scheme would be extended. Unlike our other schemes, this is an outcome- and output-oriented scheme… incentives will be paid only if the manufacturers make the goods,” Mr. Bajaj said. “This scheme will give cash incentives for five to seven years and all the sunrise and important sectors are proposed to be covered in this,” he added. “I have a lot of confidence and hope in the PLI schemes for mobile phones, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The kind of response we have received on mobile phones gives me a lot of confidence that there is now a demand in the world to have a diversification in your supply chains and India can definitely take advantage of,” Mr. Bajaj said at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Financial Markets summit. Conceding that the policy for privatising PSEs had been delayed, Mr. Bajaj said this would be a major step that would likely get the approval of the Cabinet ‘very soon.’ ‘Green shoots’ Referring to some of the green shoots visible in the economy, such as GST inflows and rail freight in September, Mr. Bajaj said that steel producers had just now informed the Finance Ministry that they were back to using their full capacity. “If steel and cement are doing well, it augurs very well for the economy,” he said. “There are certain things in which we have not only seen improvements, but have also gone up year-on-year. I acknowledge as some of the commentators keep saying, last year itself was not very good, so you can’t compare. But I think I am trying to come out of a very dreadful disease. So I can’t be obese immediately, I have to eat my food before moving up the ladder,” he said, stressing that indicators point to an economy ‘trying to limp back to normalcy’. Taking aim at ‘experts’ who ‘changed their opinions every two months’, the Economic Affairs Secretary said: “Initially, we had this very ‘doom’ kind of a feeling given to us, saying things will only go down. “Suddenly, the festivals have come and the economy is looking up a bit; now the basic point being mentioned is ‘this is the pent-up demand and we will have to see what happens in January and February’,” he added, trying to show the shift in opinions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govt-to-widen-manufacturing-pli-plan/article32913435.ece
22 October 2020||NEW DELHI,||Economy almost at doorstep of revival: Das||India’s economy is ‘almost at the doorstep of revival’, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das asserted on Wednesday, adding that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had raised, or were in the process of raising, capital to ensure adequate credit availability for businesses once the revival took hold. The RBI’s monetary policy and the government’s fiscal policy were working in symmetry with an expansionary focus and an accommodative as well as counter-cyclical stance, Mr. Das said. The government would have to revisit its fiscal roadmap once the worst effects of the pandemic had been contained, he added. Stressing the need for urgent governance reforms in both public and private sector banks and NBFCs, Mr. Das said this had been a lingering concern since the 2008 global financial crisis and needed attention. “At this juncture, reforms in governance of banks and non-banking finance companies, especially in India, are very important. People mostly mix up banking reforms with ownership reforms,” he noted. “Banks with robust governance practices, internal control systems, risk assessment and who do not undertake smart accounting, if I can put it that way, are the ones that are never overleveraged and not only survive, but grow in every crisis,” he said, adding that this was an ownership-agnostic issue. Mr. Das was speaking at an event to release Portraits of Power, an autobiography of N.K. Singh, Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission .  “Post COVID-19, once the pandemic is contained, the government will certainly have to spell out a fiscal roadmap to adhere to the [60%] debt-to-GDP target that Mr. Singh and his committee [to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management law] had set out,” Mr. Das said, pointing out that the general government [Centre and States’] deficit was already exceeding the targets for this year. “India is at the doorstep of revival process after the effects of the pandemic. And it’s very important that financial entities have adequate capital. Many of them have already raised capital, others in public and private sector are planning and would certainly do so in the coming months,” he said. The RBI had asked all banks and NBFCs to build capital buffers so that credit is available to support growth when the economy’s revival phase begins, the central bank chief added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economy-almost-at-doorstep-of-revival-das/article32913433.ece
22 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Two-wheelers headed for strong festival show: ICRA||Two-wheeler sales are expected to grow during festive season despite the pandemic, aided by rural demand, as per an ICRA report. “While the overall consumption and investment demand is expected to remain subdued for an extended period, some growth offshoots are visible from rural markets,” it said. “Buoyed by healthy rabi yields, timely kharif sowing, progressive government support schemes and relatively lower COVID-19 impact, rural (and semi-urban) demand has enabled a sequential growth in sales since the unlocking in May 2020. A shift towards personal mobility in urban areas continues to augur well for demand,” it added. “While the urban markets continue to grapple with rising cases of COVID-19, the relatively less impacted rural and semi-urban markets have enabled a sequential improvement in sales ever since, said Shamsher Dewan, vice-president, ICRA. However, despite the strong performance, the segment will see a volume contraction of 16-18% in FY21, ICRA added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/two-wheelers-headed-for-strong-festival-show-icra/article32913429.ece
22 October 2020||MUMBAI,||Current market rally is broad-based: SEBI’s Tyagi||The current stock market rally, in the backdrop of the challenging times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, has been broad-based with large and mid-cap stocks gaining 55% and small-cap stocks 70% Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said on Wednesday. Stating that the secondary markets reacted adversely in March following the declaration of pandemic, he said the volatility index, or VIX, rose to 84 in March from an average of 15 in the previous three months. Mr. Tyagi said the markets had since recovered with SEBI taking timely surveillance mesures with respect to exposures and margins to curb volatility. “The Sensex/Nifty today is very close to the all-time high hit in January,” he said. “Volatility has also relatively stabilised with the VIX now hovering at around 25,” Mr. Tyagi said at a virtual Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event. On the narrative that liquidity and low interest rates were primarily boosting the markets and that there had been a disconnect between the markets and the real economy, the regulator said the recovery had been broad-based owing to SEBI’s policy measures. “It is not just the large-cap but also mid- and small-cap indices which have recovered since the lows hit in March,” he said. Rising investor interest He said investor participation in the equity market had risen, with the average daily turnover in the cash market in this financial year about Rs. 60,000 crore, or 54% higher than last year. He also said India had received about $11 billion in net FPI investments in the equity markets, till date in this financial year. “While most emerging markets, including Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Malaysia, have witnessed FPI outflows this calendar year so far, India has witnessed net FPI inflows during the same period,” he added. Mutal funds had recorded net inflows of Rs. 1.47 lakh crore in this financial year till September, he said, adding that in the case of primary markets, the total funds raised had touched Rs. 1.54 lakh crore till September, just short of the Rs. 1.58 lakh crore raised during the same period last year. IPOs oversubscribed “Almost all IPOs and rights issues this year have been oversubscribed several times. Further, over Rs. 22,000 crore equity issuances are in the pipeline.” He also said the funds raised through corporate bonds this financial year till September was about Rs. 3.8 lakh crore, or 25% more than the year-earlier period. “SEBI’s policy measures have somewhat contributed in facilitating the rather satisfactory working of both the primary and secondary markets in these gloomy and uncertain times.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/current-market-rally-is-broad-based-sebis-tyagi/article32913431.ece
22 October 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||COVID-19 lockdown hits natural rubber prices||Natural rubber production and prices have been hit hard by the pandemic-induced lockdown; coconut, however, has not been adversely affected. Prices of various grades of rubber fell by 10-20% in the May-August period due to the lockdown’s impact. The contrasting fortunes of natural rubber and coconut — Kerala’s two dominant agricultural commodities — are reflected in a detailed analysis of production and prices by D. Narayana, former director, Gulathi Institute of Finance and Taxation. In January 2020, production of natural rubber was 10% higher compared with a year earlier. But in April, output dropped by 53% largely on account of the lockdown. Though prices of natural rubber witnessed a slight fall in the latter half of 2019, they continued to remain high till March 2020. However, the price of latex shows a different pattern. While the price in 2019 had shown steep increases till October, the fall has been steady since then. The lockdown accentuated the decline, as per the study.  Pandemic proof Unlike natural rubber, coconut was not adversely affected by the pandemic. While the months of May to July 2019 reported prices 20% lower than the peak prices in the year, during the same months in 2020, the prices remained relatively high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/covid-19-lockdown-hits-natural-rubber-prices/article32913436.ece

22 October 2020||Paris,||United’s Rashford sinks PSG again||Marcus Rashford once again sank Paris Saint-Germain after netting the decisive goal in a 2-1 Champions League win in the French capital, while Barcelona sent a message with a thumping 5-1 victory over Ferencvaros. Rashford, who scored the winning spot-kick when United knocked PSG out in 2019, drilled home a low shot three minutes from the end which won a thrilling Group H contest at a near-empty Parc des Princes. United had taken the lead in the 23rd minute when Bruno Fernandes slotted home from the spot at the second attempt, but Anthony Martial inexplicably headed Neymar’s corner into his own net 10 minutes after the break. Ronald Koeman got his first Champions League campaign as Barcelona coach off to a winning start with a confident win over Ferencvaros. The Hungarians, the first team from their country to make the group stage in 11 years, started brightly and even had the ball in the net via Tokmac Nguen only for the powerful 12th-minute strike to be ruled out for offside. Messi won and converted the penalty to give the Catalans a 27th-minute lead and the match was as good as done when Ansu Fati clipped home Frenkie de Jong’s sumptuous pass just before the break. Red for Pique Philippe Coutinho lashed home the third before Ihor Kharatin pulled one back from the penalty spot after Gerard Pique was sent off for pulling back Nguen as he charged towards goal. Pique’s red card means he will miss next week’s game away at Juventus, a greater test of Barca’s capabilities. Pedri and Ousmane Dembele finished the scoring for the 10-man host as it took control of Group G, finishing the opening round top but level on points with Juve.  Andrea Pirlo’s side looked comfortable in its 2-0 win at Dynamo Kiev in what was the Juve coach’s first ever Champions League match in the dugout, with Alvaro Morata scoring twice to take the points for the Italians. Chelsea is still waiting for a £220 million spending spree to pay off as it began its campaign with an uninspiring 0-0 Group E draw with Sevilla at Stamford Bridge.   The results: Group E: Chelsea 0 drew with Sevilla 0; Rennes 1 (Guirassy 86-pen) drew with Krasnodar 1 (Ramirez 59).   Group F: Lazio (ITA) 3 (Immobile 6, Hitz 23-og, Akpa Akpro 76) bt Borussia Dortmund 1 (Haaland 71); Zenit St-Petersburg 1 (Horvath 74-og) lost to Club Brugge 2 (Bonaventure 63, De Ketelaere 90+3).   Group G: Barcelona 5 (Messi 27-pen, Fati 42, Coutinho 52, Pedri 82, Dembele 89) bt Ferencvaros 1 (Kharatin 70-pen); Dynamo Kiev 0 lost to Juventus 2 (Morata 46, 84).

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Destructive Siraj leads Royal Challengers’ rout of Knight Riders||Mohammed Siraj steamrollered Kolkata Knight Riders with a blistering fast-bowling display (4-2-8-3) at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. The 84 runs that KKR managed for the loss of eight wickets was the lowest total in IPL history for a team that wasn’t bowled out. Royal Challengers Bangalore romped home with eight wickets and more than six overs to spare. Pat Cummins was economical in the PowerPlay (3-0-18-0) but KKR needed wickets. Lockie Ferguson, who had impressed against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday, was introduced only in the seventh over, by which point Devdutt Padikkal and Aaron Finch had slashed the target by half and there was no turning around. The win lifted Virat Kohli’s men to second spot (14 points), ever closer to the playoffs, which has eluded the side since 2016. For KKR (10 points), the crushing defeat can potentially drag it into the scrap for the last playoff position. Striking gold Kohli lost the toss, but struck gold with every roll of the dice, right from selecting Siraj in place of Shahbaz Ahmed, to the bowling changes he rang in through the contest. KKR never recovered from Siraj’s opening spell (3-2-2-3). The pacer made full use of the moderate swing, and was aided by some impulsive batting. KKR scored just 17 runs in the PowerPlay for the loss of four wickets. Rahul Tripathi went first, caught by A.B. de Villiers while trying to glide an away-going delivery from Siraj to third-man. Nitish Rana was out next ball when he pushed forward without accounting for the movement, only for the ball to curl in and hit the off-stump. Navdeep Saini, the first-change bowler, excised Shubman Gill, caught off a top-edged pull. Tom Banton, who replaced Andre Russell, drove a half-volley beautifully down the ground and then sent Saini soaring over the deep square-leg boundary. But his counter-attack was short-lived, caught by de Villiers when he swung at Siraj without moving his feet. Siraj’s first two overs were both maidens, the first time in IPL history anyone had done so. These were superb returns for someone who has often attracted criticism for being profligate. Then, the Yuzvendra Chahal-Washington Sundar double act suffocated KKR, with just 16 runs coming off six overs (nine to 14). Chahal trapped Dinesh Karthik leg-before with a googly that spun slightly and then outwitted Cummins with a teaser. When Washington snuffed out Morgan (30, 34b, 3x4, 1x6) in the 16th over, all hopes of a KKR recovery had evaporated.   Siraj’s dream night  Siraj became the first bowler to deliver two maidens in an IPL match His effort restricted KKR to 84/8, the lowest for a team not bowled out||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/destructive-siraj-leads-royal-challengers-rout-of-knight-riders/article32913535.ece
22 October 2020||Chennai,||Leg-spinners have been buzzing||M.S. Dhoni had an important decision to make. Chennai Super Kings had 17 to defend in the final over against Delhi Capitals but his ‘death’ bowler Dwyane Bravo had pulled out unfit. Dhoni had to pick one of the two, left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja or leg-spinner Karn Sharma for the 20th over. Two lefties On strike were two left-handers, the mercurial Shikhar Dhawan, who had just completed a hundred and Axar Patel who can use the long lever. The situation screamed for Karn Sharma but Dhoni opted for Jadeja. After a wide, and then a single by Dhawan, Axar smashed Jadeja for 6,6, 2 and 6 to close out the humdinger in Delhi’s favour. The left-handers simply had to hit Jadeja with the turn, and if they connected, a six was always on the cards. Leg-spinner Karn, who has a googly in his repertoire, could have spun the ball away from the left-handers, forcing them to hit against the turn and a mis-hit was a distinct possibility. The leg-spinners, otherwise, have been buzzing in the ongoing IPL. You could see the joy on legend Anil Kumble’s visage when Ravi Bishnoi and M. Ashwin, both leggies, bowled with craft and heart for Kings XI Punjab. Bishnoi, imparts revs on the ball and gets the sphere to fizz off the pitch. Apart from the leg-break, he has the googly and the top-spinner. M. Ashwin has a slight rock-back and a pause in his action that enables him to spot the batsman’s initial movement. He is a much improved bowler, operating with greater control and turning the ball both ways. Both have not been averse to flighting the ball. While more established stars such as Hyderabad’s dazzling Rashid Khan, with his exotic bag of tricks, and Bangalore’s Yuzvendra Chahal, with his side-spin and the ability to get the ball to skid off the surface — and his wrong ’un to castle Vijay Shankar was a beauty — have been influential, Mumbai’s Rahul Chahar has impressed with his precision and top-spin. These leg-spinners have been humming alright.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/leg-spinners-have-been-buzzing/article32913787.ece

United had taken the lead in the 23rd minute when Bruno Fernandes slotted home from the spot at the second attempt, but Anthony Martial inexplicably headed Neymar’s corner into his own net 10 minutes after the break. At Camp Nou, Lionel Messi won and then scored a penalty before the 17-year-old Ansu Fati contributed to two brilliant goals, volleying in one for himself and then setting up another for Philippe Coutinho. After Ihor Kharatin had converted a spot-kick for Ferencvaros, Pedri and Ousamane Dembele ended any hopes of a comeback by the visitors. Andrea Pirlo’s side looked comfortable in its 2-0 win at Dynamo Kiev in what was the Juve coach’s first ever Champions League match in the dugout, with Alvaro Morata scoring twice to take the points for the Italians. It was a good night for Italy as Ciro Immobile got revenge on his old club Borussia Dortmund by scoring in Lazio’s 3-1 win over the Bundesliga club in Rome, its first Champions League match in 13 years.  The results: Group E: Chelsea 0 drew with Sevilla 0; Rennes 1 (Guirassy 86-pen) drew with Krasnodar 1 (Ramirez 59).

22 October 2020||Dubai,||Sunrisers take on upbeat Royals||The inexperienced young guns of both Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad would like to put their hands up in testing times when both teams square off in a must-win Indian Premier League game on Thursday. Whether it is Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad of Sunrisers or Kartik Tyagi, Riyan Parag of the Royals, the youngsters from both sides will be feeling the pressure of doing something out of the box in case their illustrious seniors fail in that pursuit. Royals would hope to continue with the winning momentum and will expect their foreign recruits to perform like they did against CSK. While Jofra Archer continues to be the backbone of Royals’ bowling attack, the wrist-spinning duo of Shreyas Gopal and Rahul Tewatia were terrific in the middle overs against CSK. In batting, Jos Buttler looked in ominous form the other night, forcing skipper Smith to play the second fiddle but RR would need more consistent partnerships upfront.  SRH, on the other hand, would still be smarting from the Super Over loss to Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday. David Warner and Co. would definitely be hurt by that loss but they need to come out of that shock quickly. The team heavily relies on its batting unit, mainly on the top four comprising Jonny Bairstow, Warner, Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sunrisers-take-on-upbeat-royals/article32913532.ece
22 October 2020||GENEVA,||UEFA warns against breakaway league||UEFA has warned of the damage that would be caused to football by the potential creation of a European Super League of the continent’s elite clubs, potentially usurping its existing Champions League. UEFA, the European governing body, denounced the idea as “boring” after FIFA did not deny taking part in talks about creating a rival league featuring the continent’s wealthiest clubs.  In a statement, FIFA did not push back on a Sky News report that it was developing plans for an 18-team annual European Premier League. Such a competition would directly challenge UEFA and potentially undermine its existing Champions League. UEFA is already involved in talks about potential adjustments to the Champions League format and qualification path from 2024 and strongly resists breakaway threats. “The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable,” UEFA said in a statement on Tuesday. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is one of the driving forces of the reported European Premier League, which Sky said could have $6 billion in debt financing from J.P. Morgan. A carefully worded response from FIFA stands in contrast to recent public comments that have forcibly and clearly denied reports it disputes. “FIFA does not wish to comment and participate in any speculation about topics which come up every now and then,” the Zurich-based governing body said.

Holder, who is member of Sunrisers Hyderabad, made the statement while receiving the prestigious Peter Smith Award on behalf of the West Indies cricket team in a virtual ceremony organised by the Cricket Writers’ Club. The Peter Smith Award is an annual honour which recognises outstanding contribution to the presentation of cricket to the public. “To be honest, I haven’t had one conversation up here around it (BLM). Sometimes it seems it has gone unnoticed, which is a sad thing,” Holder said. “Cricket West Indies has done an excellent job in continuing awareness of it. The women had a series in England where they wore the Black Lives Matter logo,” he added. But it was later discontinued for the subsequent tours of Pakistan and Australia. “It’s a long debate, a long hard challenge, a long road. We as people need to continue to come together and genuinely find ways to fix the inequalities in the world,” Holder said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/holder-sad-that-blm-movement-not-part-of-ipl/article32913417.ece

It was also the kart of choice of Formula One drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen.  Training programme It has also launched a training programme for budding drivers in both the junior and senior class of karting with the aim of finding local talent at a young age and steering their careers forward. Each driver will be chosen through a rigorous, multi-level selection process, which will take into account their skills, driving technique, mental ability and fitness level. The selected drivers will receive extensive support and guidance from Narain Karthikeyan. He will personally assess the performance of the drivers and help them improve their craft.

In an e-mail on Wednesday addressed to some of the top players, TTFI said: “SAI has now agreed for the camp beginning October 28 at DPS School, Sonepat, with the condition that all players must report on the same date (Oct. 28). “Since you all had given your consent we will be asking SAI to issue tickets for your travel to Delhi on the said date.” Speaking to The Hindu on Tuesday, M.P. Singh, secretary TTFI, said: “We are very much eager to start. It will be good practice for the Olympic qualification scheduled to begin next year. G. Sathiyan and Harmeet Desai can join the camp when they return from their respective European leagues. “Earlier the camp was for 15 days with a short break followed by another 15 days. Now SAI and TTFI have decided that it will be for 35 days. If the players agree to it, we can plan accordingly.” India’s top paddler Sharath Kamal said it’s a good start. “All of us have been looking for good practice partners and it is great that we all will be coming under one roof.” However, Sharath wondered on the possibility of players getting stale if the TTFI sticks to its plan of a long camp of 35 days. “If it is a long camp with just four players, it will get stale. We have to keep bringing in new players keeping the [bio] bubble in mind.”  The National camp players: Men: Sharath Kamal, Manav Thakkar, Manush Shah, Sudhanshu Grover and Jubin Kumar.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Complete avataras||Of the many avataras of Lord Narayana, Rama and Krishna avataras are considered complete avataras. What is so special about them? In the case of other avataras, the Lord came for a certain purpose, stayed on the earth briefly, and left the moment the mission was accomplished. But not so in the case of Rama and Krishna avataras, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. Thirumangai Azhvar lists the Lord’s avataras in one of his verses, where he refers to Parasurama as ‘Rama,’ and to Balarama again as ‘Rama.’ But the Rama avatara which is placed between these two, is not referred to as the Rama avatara! Instead, Thirumangai Azhvar uses the word ‘thaanaai,’ meaning He Himself. This indicates the importance of the Rama avatara. Valmiki says Rama lived on the earth for 11,000 years. Krishna lived for more than a hundred years. But why did the Lord come to this earth in the first place? In the Bhagavad Gita, the Lord answers this question. He says it is to protect virtuous people, to destroy the wicked and to establish dharma. But just one action could have accomplished the other two goals. If the wicked, who harmed the good, were killed, then automatically dharma and good people would be protected. The Lord is avApta samasta kAman — there is nothing for Him to experience; nor is there anything that He has not experienced. So why did He come to earth? And if dharma has to be protected, He just has to will the death of the wicked and it will automatically happen, and the rest will follow. Kooratazhvan asks Varadaraja of Kanchi these questions in his Varadaraja Stava. The answer is also there in Kooratazhvan’s verse. He says during His avataras, the Lord is in the company of those who have a humble status. His avataras, thus, show His saulabhya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/complete-avataras/article32913524.ece

DC lost by five wickets after scoring 164 for five in 20 overs. Opener Dhawan continued to be in great form. “This is like a wake-up call for us. Going forward we are going to face tough situations and tougher teams. We have played amazing cricket in the past, but we have to leave that in the past,” Shreyas said at the post-match press conference. One match at a time “We have to come out all guns blazing, play with freedom and take more responsibility. We need one match to qualify and keeping that in mind, we will take one match at a time,” he added. He feels that his batsmen are in a good frame of mind. “I feel that all the batsmen are in a really good frame of mind and few matches can go wrong here and there as fatigue creeps in,” he said. Deshpande was taken to the cleaners by Chris Gayle, who hit him for three fours and two sixes in an over. “Deshpande has been hit by Gayle, who is a world-class batsman and it’s a great learning experience for him. He will go back and analyse his mistakes and come back stronger,” Shreyas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kings-game-a-wake-up-call-for-us-says-shreyas/article32913537.ece

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Over hot coals||There is something meditative about sitting with people who matter and watching food slowly sizzle; especially in these times, when our social lives have shrunk suddenly and painfully. With social distancing in place, cities under successive lockdowns since March, WFH and cooler weather, COVID-19 has inadvertently revived old-fashioned family bonding over barbecues in the garden or on small balconies. “What started as a trial has evolved into a weekend ritual,” says Dhruv Ramachandran, a Law student in Delhi, who has been home in Chennai since the virus outbreak. With time on hand, Dhruv decided to experiment with the barbecue set his father ordered online. He cooks with his dad —a barbecue enthusiast — and the duo has tried out Iranian kebabs and Peshawari grills among a host of other recipes using chicken, beef, mutton and seafood. For Dhruv, the process is more about spending quality time with family on the verandah in his backyard. Delicious food is a bonus. A lot of Indians have been setting up grills at home over the past few years. The equipment, charcoal, accessories, meat and marinade can be bought online. “You learn how to marinate the meat, ignite the coal, and cook the meat… all through trial and error,” says Sayan Majumdar, a manager working with an MNC in Kolkata, who took to grilling during the lockdown, experimenting with what he has learnt from watching American barbecue shows. “For humid Kolkata weather, evenings are the only good time to do this though,” says Sayan, who has his grill on the balcony.  Ever since the lockdown, Shaun George Joseph says his Kochi-based brand Pepe Bbq, has seen a spike in sales. “I’ve been getting a lot of queries about smaller barbecue grills,” he says, adding that this period has been more productive than he expected. He asked a vendor to make stainless steel equipment and now has a range that starts at Rs. 800 and goes up to Rs. 5,000. For lockdown grillers, it is a DIY food adventure. But barbecuing extracts a certain amount of commitment, says Sampurna Gupta Chatterjee, a Delhi-based lawyer whose barbecues are a yearly calendar event for her friends. Every New Year’s eve, she hosts a barbecue on her apartment terrace. “It requires a lot of patience as you need to watch over the meat as it cooks slowly,” she says. Purists point out that barbecuing is often confused with grilling. While the former is smoking the meat in indirect hot air, the latter is cooking the meat on direct heat, says Bengaluru-based Roy Abraham Varghese, a marketing communications professional, who has been barbecuing for the past 15 years. Pitmaster Roy says he learnt the fine art through sheer practice. “It is a vast area. One needs to understand the meats and the cuts. The wood added to the coal embers brings out the entire flavour profile of the meat,” he says. While Roy picks pork butt as his favourite, fillet mignon and tomahawk are his pieces de resistance. While sourcing good meat is a problem in India, pitmasters have found their way around the challenge. Joel Rebbi from Kochi showed his butcher YouTube videos of the specific cuts he wanted. Days of trial and error later, he got the butcher to deliver the right cut. The quality of the meat may not match up to international standards, but to make a brisket in spite of the constraints is rewarding, says Joel, who devoted four years just to master the brisket. “Initially, it felt like chewing on bark, but now it melts in the mouth,” he says. “It isn’t only about mulling over meat; why not some beet?” asks Bijal Hindocha, a homemaker from Chennai, who says vegetables such as zucchini, broccoli, carrots and beetroot work very well in a barbecue. “Let’s think beyond potato and paneer. A char-grilled zucchini tastes just as wonderful,” says Bijal, who tried grilled beetroot recently. Indian spices work very well too, she adds. Eggplant, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms are other vegetarian options.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/over-hot-coals/article32914063.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||The way we were||The courage and robust optimism of Jemishi Mehta’s Gujarati ancestors is bookended by two photographs — the first and the oldest family photograph they possess was taken in 1952, 37 years after Govind Ji Rewa Shankar Mehta, Jemishi’s great grandfather, moved from Jamnagar to Madras in 1915; the second, was taken in 2019. Over the course of a 100 years, the Mehtas survived the upheavals of two World Wars, Partition, the rise and fall of businesses and the death of a son, whose image in the weathered photograph seems to have been obliterated by the passage of time, as much as he has been from the memory of those who knew him. This poignant story was a recent addition to the 300 visual narratives featured in the Indian Memory Project (IMP), an online repository of stories from across the subcontinent. Built on memory and personal archives, the project holds a mirror to where we come from and where we are going as a nation. Anusha Yadav, who helms IMP, established in 2010, was raised in the US, UK and India. A graduate of the National Institute of Design, this portrait photographer and brand culture design consultant’s interest in creating a human tapestry of our times began when she was a child. Her father passed away when she was 12 leaving behind boxes of photographs and Anusha engaged with his memory through them. “For me any photograph then had to have a story,” says Anusha over a phone call from Mumbai. “You never realise when the idea sows its seed. The interest in photography became sharper when NID and advertising happened. The visual offers valuable information about the subcontinent’s people, visitors, cultures, choices, circumstances and, thereby, consequences.” The world over, many have used the lockdown to dust out family albums and catalogue pictures, but Anusha continues to receive the same number of entries for the project per month — two or three. However, she finds there is a growing interest in history design services such as family trees and biography books. IMP is supported by patrons whose funding has kept the portal advertisement-free. One life, many stories A one-woman show, Anusha curates while a floating population of volunteers and researchers unearth stories that have gathered the patina of memories even among the same family. “When you don’t park your monetary hopes on something, you can keep chiselling at it. Some of the stories have helped families trace four-five generations across the world. It’s encouraging to know it is helpful and used for academic research,” says Anusha, underlining how IMP offers western audiences an eye-opener to an India they never knew. Part of the coursework at renowned educational institutions such as Ashoka University, Columbia University, and Yale, Anusha adds, “It changes notions of what India is to the West, that it is not Eat, Pray, Love , that it has one million personalities.” Contributors, whether from India or abroad, are encouraged to send photographs and documents from before 1992 that have a link to the subcontinent. The documents should be owned and the sender should be able to identify those in a photograph. An accompanying text should also be submitted. It is after these criteria are met that Anusha and her team swing into action. “Pictures are sacred; they are colour-corrected for brightness and contrast, nothing more. Aesthetics trump in studio set-up pictures. The text is proofed and edited. Most events mentioned, like war, migration, plague... have been documented and, therefore, can be fact-checked. Very personal facts are stated as ‘we were told’. If there is a discrepancy, we vet and articulate a grey area.” Anusha adds that “Some of the text may need translation. Sometimes, pictures are sent on a whim and the sender may not recommit to investigating facts we may ask for; after much to and fro, there is no response. But quantity is not the issue. It’s not a magazine, it’s an archive. I don’t feel the need to bombard you with stories. I let it simmer.” The tidal shifts that engulfed the subcontinent have resulted in 300 stories, each one a gem, unveiling a smorgasbord of personalities and experiences slotted under headers such as Delhi, Couple, 1920, Headgear, Muslim, ‘Mustache’, World War II and Studio Portraits. Anusha’s favourite is the story of the devadasi who became the maharani of Dewas. “The photograph tells an incredible story of women who reclaimed their identity. Sometimes one story may lead to another more interesting footnote. Like the one on Sukhsampat Rai Bhandari who compiled the first English to Hindi and Marathi dictionaries. It was while researching on him that his involvement in the abdication of Tukojirao Holkar III of Indore after the famous Malabar Hill murder showed up.” Remembrance of things past Other remarkable stories come from Colonial India when young Indians keen to experience the wider world travelled abroad, like Manjerikandy Ramchandran who left Kerala at 16 and found fame as a wrestler in Africa; Lieutenant Laxman Kadle who worked in lonely outposts in Bengal, died and whose body was never found; the Sanghvis of the Wilson Pen Family who designed the pen that was used to write the seminal Constitution of India or the teenage Chameli Jain who participated in the freedom struggle, grew to be the matriarch of a family that has remained in the public eye and after whom is named an eponymous award for women mediapersons. The writing brings alive old world nostalgia, places and institutions that have frayed around the edges; an escape into a time of wingback chairs, potted palms and Delhi University’s first ever girl rock band, Mad Hatter, kitted out in a sari andsalwar kameez. The IMP will never occupy a physical space says Anusha except for the museum store and the occasional pop-up. Its focus continues to underline that memorialisation must be an active practice and not a sporadic indulgence in nostalgia. And that through these visual stories, etched like images on a Grecian urn, we reclaim an almost lost Indian epic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-way-we-were/article32914069.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Return of the old faithfuls||While most Bengalis flock to Kolkata for Durga Pujo, here is a family that unfailingly chooses Chennai over the City of Joy. Every year, idol maker Kishori Mohan Pal of West Bengal, and his team, who have been visiting the city since 1982, camp at Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya in T Nagar where they create idols of Durga from scratch. Kishori’s works are a regular fixture at the many Bengali associations in Chennai, Puducherry and Sriperumbudur on the city’s outskirts. The pandemic outbreak, however, threw his plans into uncertainty. “We usually reach Chennai three months before pujo. This time, we only got here in August,” says Kishori. A team of seven is now working long hours to complete the work at hand. They received a call from the Kali Baari in T Nagar, and the following week were on a flight to Chennai. “Everything worked out to be much more expensive,” says Deben Pal, eldest of Kishori’s three sons, who has been accompanying his father since 1998. “We normally take the train. This time we had to book flight tickets online, something we attempted for the first time,” he adds. Even transporting the raw materials took longer and cost more. “We bring everything from Bengal. The mud with which we create the figurines is from the Ganges,” he adds. Due to lockdown, Deben remarks that they could not scour for raw materials, and had to make do with what was readily available. The demand for idols is also low this time, which also reflects in the size of the idols: five feet, compared to last year’s 10 feet height. “Last year, we received orders for 30 idols of Ma Durga along with her family: Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Ganesh and Karthik. This year, it is only 17. A lot of places are not celebrating. The ones who are celebrating are doing it on a small scale,” says Deben. The price of the idols start at Rs. 25,000. With small budgets but large expenses, not to forget the time spent away from their families, has this trip been worthwhile for the Pals? “We would anyway have been sitting at home. It doesn’t matter if we incurred a loss. What is important is we could make these idols so people can celebrate this festival and pray,” says Deben, and expresses hope: “ Asche bochor abar hobe (again, next year).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/return-of-the-old-faithfuls/article32914058.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||Soy and the city||“I am a very bad cook,” laughs Samta Rohira disarmingly. Fortunately, for the many fans of her soybean and chickpea tempeh , that did not deter her from experimenting to find ways to make and supply the nutrient-dense, fermented food in Chennai. Sought for its unique flavour, tempeh is tough to find in the city since it is relatively unfamiliar. However, this savoury alternative to meat, a traditional staple in Indonesia, is getting increasingly popular especially with vegans and vegetarians. “My mom was born in Surabaya, so we travel to Indonesia every year,” says Samta. “We used to spend our summer holidays there, for two months a year when I was growing up.” Her family was based in Chennai, where she grew up before moving to Jakarta to work for five years after graduating from Ethiraj College for Women. “Then I got married and landed back in Chennai,” she says. Once the lockdowns began, she began to miss Indonesian food. “I could not travel this year. I began to wonder, ‘how can I bring my staple food to the city?’” The experiments began in March, and she was ready to launch by September. “I have to follow certain processes to adjust to the temperature here,” she says, adding that she makestempehtwice a week, and each batch takes about three days. “Whatever I make gets sold out.” To make meal planning easier, she also makes a chilli garlic sambal . “People buy both together — so you can put together a meal in minutes,” says Samta, adding, “I eat like this all the time: steamed rice, sambal , pan fried tempeh and veggies on the side.”  tempehchennai.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/soy-and-the-city/article32914046.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||The at-home pujo season||Family, food, livestream. In 2020, the Durga Puja plans of Chennai’s Bengali community can be summed up in these three words. With social distancing norms in place and large gatherings still being discouraged as a precaution against the COVID-19 pandemic, city pandals are prioritising safety over pomp and show. South Madras Cultural Association (SMCA) in Besant Nagar, Dakshini Society in Anna Nagar and Dakshin Chennai Prabasi Cultural Association (DCPCA) in OMR are known for some of the largest, most joyous traditional Bengali puja celebrations in Chennai. This year, all three organisations are restricting the core worship and rituals to a few volunteers, not inviting walk-ins, and cancelling the community feast-style bhog that would otherwise have been open to anyone wishing to step in. There are other aspects, however, that they hope to continue virtually. Sudip Mitra, president of SMCA, says, “The morning puja, the pushpanjali and the evening arti will be streamed realtime from our Facebook group and YouTube channel. The YouTube stream can be viewed by anyone; the Facebook one is for members only. We have also been holding talent competitions like we do every year, but online. Each participant is sent a link that they can click on when it’s their turn, and perform realtime to a closed audience.” A small idol is being brought in from Kolkata for the rituals, that this time will be held quietly in SMCA’s office within a housing society, instead of the usual public venue, adds Mitra. Dakshini Society and DCPCA are having idols readied by the artisans who come to Chennai for this purpose every year. While DCPCA will be sending a livestream link to its members and usual patrons to view the puja — members will also be deliveredbhogin eco-friendly parcels — Dakshini Society has no plans to stream. Adds Dakshini Society secretary Mukul Dasgupta, “We are bringing in a private company to sanitise the puja venue twice a day.” While pandal-hopping is not an option, feasting on festive favourites still is. Bayleaf will be opening up the first floor of its Gopalapuram restaurant till October 25, to accommodate diners even while keeping alternate tables empty for social distancing. Abhyuday Purkayastha of Bayleaf states, “Our Durga Puja special menu will also be available for delivery till October 25. You can find us on Swiggy or Zomato or order from our own app and website, launched in August.” The menu includes favourites like Radha ballabi (sizeable dal-stuffed puris), kosha mangsho , chingri(prawn)malai curry and more, besides starters like mochar chop (banana blossom croquette) and bhetki kobiraji (sea bass fried in a crisp egg batter). Traditional bhog khichri is part of the menu this year, for those who miss pandal-hopping, as are sweets like mishti doi and malpua, to put you in a festive state of mind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-at-home-pujo-season/article32914051.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||In search of light||In June 2019, standing by the side of an old, indigenous plum tree, amid the deep greenery of Bhandardara, Maharashtra, Aishwarya Sridhar stood stock-still, her camera focussed on the hypnotic illumination unfolding before her: Indian fireflies, by the thousands, moving about harmoniously whilst laying forth their magnificent bioluminescence. This moment, forever etched in the young shutterbug’s memory, would take her to newer heights. What she shot that night in June — the photo titled ‘Lights of Passion’ — fetched Aishwarya the highest recognition in Canon’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards under the ‘Behaviour-Invertebrates’ category. Thrilled as she is, the 23-year-old  is a little upset that she cannot be in person at the Natural History Museum, London, to see her photograph on display. “I have asked a couple of friends in London to visit the museum and take photos of the display for me,” she says, excitedly. Bioluminescent marvel Aishwarya’s interest in fireflies was lit when she came across a newspaper article that spoke of its abundant presence in the Western Ghats. It helped that fireflies, in small numbers, would often fly past the balcony of her home in Panvel, Mumbai. Her research led her to Bhandardara. “Clicking fireflies when the moon is bright is tough because their bioluminescence goes dull,” she says. So, the best time to shoot was in the window before sunrise, just as the moon almost set. With help from locals who guided her to the spot in the jungle, Aishwarya trekked for two-and-a-half-hours in pitch darkness, braving nocturnal species on the prowl. “I spotted a Myrobalan tree which was completely covered in fireflies. It was the first time I had seen fireflies in such huge numbers. I felt like I was standing in the magical world of Harry Potter,” she adds. She initially took snaps using the longer 100-400mm lens, but was not satisfied with the results. “I was missing out on their flashes because the whole tree wasn’t in the frame. It was tough to focus on the fireflies, and using a torch would have disturbed them. I had to rely on my eyesight to get a precisive shot of the tree,” she says. The skies above her were scattered with twinkling stars, and so she decided to create a star trail to frame the fireflies. Using her Canon EOS-1D X Mark II camera and Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8 L II USM lens — at a focal length of 24mm, shutter speed of 24 seconds, f/2.8 and ISO 1000, she snapped 27 consecutive photos, which she later stitched together, post-production. “In other photographs [of fireflies], I didn’t see the juxtaposition of fireflies with the night sky, so that propelled my creative direction,” she says. Aishwarya notes that fireflies in India are not photographed as often as is assumed. “Indian fireflies are pretty different from others in the species with respect to bioluminescence. In other countries, you find fireflies make the grasslands their habitat. Here, they make their home on trees,” she says, adding why she is endlessly fascinated with them: “They are stunning ambassadors of Earth’s natural magic.”  lens view  Aishwarya’s image, ‘Lights of Passion’, was selected from among 50,000 entries sent by participants from over 80 countries.  She, however, is no stranger to wildlife documentation. Aishwarya has filmed two documentaries: Panje — the Last Wetland (2018)  and Queen of Taru (2019).  The latter was awarded at the 9th Wildlife Conservation Film Festival, New York (2019).  Aishwarya is also a recipient of the Diana Award 2019, given to young change-makers aged nine to 25 by the Royal House, London.

22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||What maketh a woman?||It is hard to categorise or guess what Achcham Madam Naanam Payirppu (AMNP) is about. If you have watched the film’s trailer, it is clear that debutant director Raja Ramamurthy does not want you to get even a hint of the plot. Starring Akshara Haasan, Usha Uthup and Malgudi Shubha among others, AMNP follows the story of a 19-year-old girl, Pavithra (played by Akshara), who hails from a conservative family. In a Zoom chat, Akshara and Raja discuss the upcoming film, scheduled to be released on a digital streaming platform soon. Excerpts: Can you tell us what AMNP is about?  Raja: Growing up in our society, girls are brought up by parents with these four values: achcham (fear), madam (innocence), naanam (shy), payirppu (chaste). This is what she is told she requires to be a ‘good woman’. These value systems become the central argument in my storyline. The cast seems unconventional. What made you choose these actors?  Raja: I wanted to cast against type. Like Akshara, whose character is completely the opposite to what she is in real life. With Usha ma’am, she plays a veteran Carnatic singer, but she is a rockstar in real life. Malgudi Shubha ma’am plays a character with evil shades but she is one of the sweetest human beings you will come across. Was it tough playing Pavithra?  Akshara: It is a very contrasting role but Raja had written it so well, and he was clear about what was required of me. Life becomes easier for an actor when that is the case. You are releasing the film on OTT platform. What are your two cents on the OTT vs theatre debate?  Raja: Until we find a vaccine, people will be comfortable watching films from the comfort of their homes. Theatres and OTT will have to co-exist. If a movie like Tenet didn’t do well because people did not want to take a chance with their lives, it speaks volumes. But this is also the time to start making movies for the big screen. I am not talking about the mass films we do with huge market heroes, but films that warrant a big screen watch.  Akshara: We have no choice due to COVID-19 but not everyone watches a lot of content online or subscribe to OTT platforms. However, it has definitely grown, and it is exposing people to newer filmmaking styles because of the wide range of content that is available. What are your upcoming projects?  Akshara: There are a couple of stories under discussion but nothing much I can reveal now. I spent most of lockdown reading, writing and watching a lot of films on OTT platforms. I also kept myself active because it is easy to feel like kids when we have no work, and just sit at home and eat pizza. But as we grow older, we need to be more active. I have also recently started making preserves and jams, and that is keeping me busy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/what-maketh-a-woman/article32914036.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||People of the dawn||Thrice every week, before 5 am, artist Bhavya Desai has his eyes peeled as he travels from his home in Thiruvanmiyur to his karate class in Besant Nagar. He studies every passer-by: the man who sells tea to the watchmen wrapping up their night shift, the sanitation worker sweeping her last lane for the night, the milkman segregating packets into crates, and the newspaper man about his route. Each of these people makes their way into Bhavya’s latest series, When You Were Asleep. The characters, in his trademark style, are cartoonish, with wide eyes, spindly arms, and in goofy situations. Since he picked up his pen to draw in 2015, Bhavya’s work has often reflected the spirit of Chennai — from colourful bustling tea stalls to porters scooting across the platforms of Central Railway Station. He says, “All these years, I have been drawing whoever I see around me. This time, I wanted to draw those that we don’t see on a regular day ,” the ones who worked under the cloak of night. “These are the people who make a big difference in our society before we have even begun our day. Our economy starts with them,” he says. The characters he draws are imaginary, although they are inspired by real people. “I exercise my own imagination in creating narratives, but I try and take characteristics from them: their body language, and expression.” He prefers to observe the people he caricatures without interacting with them. “For this series, I didn’t want to intrude upon them while they were working, I want to see them as who they are, naturally.” This was not the case in his previous series, where he was commissioned to illustrate the pre-Independence heritage eateries of Calcutta. “I would ask the cooks if I could take 15 minutes of their time and speak to them about their work, families, and backgrounds. They gave me their 100% while speaking to me, but after that it sounded fake if I asked them to go back to what they were doing. They would become very conscious, so that’s why I didn’t want to do that this time,” he says. His first sketch, that of an egg-seller, received immense response especially from late risers, with people suggesting what other professions he could cover. This motivated him to continue the series. He chose 12 in total in case the sketches could one day be turned into a calendar. “I think practising karate also gave me that discipline to stick to a project and not get distracted by other ideas,” he muses. Bhavya is happy he is developing the skill of giving a theme and context to his caricatures. “When I started, I was just drawing everything in sight, without any backstory, like a headless chicken!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/people-of-the-dawn/article32914067.ece

One life, many stories A one-woman show, Anusha curates while a floating population of volunteers and researchers unearth stories that have gathered the patina of memories even among the same family. “When you don’t park your monetary hopes on something, you can keep chiselling at it. Some of the stories have helped families trace four-five generations across the world. It’s encouraging to know it is helpful and used for academic research,” says Anusha, underlining how IMP offers western audiences an eye-opener to an India they never knew. Part of the coursework at renowned educational institutions such as Ashoka University, Columbia University, and Yale, Anusha adds, “It changes notions of what India is to the West, that it is not Eat, Pray, Love , that it has one million personalities.” Contributors, whether from India or abroad, are encouraged to send photographs and documents from before 1992 that have a link to the subcontinent. The documents should be owned and the sender should be able to identify those in a photograph. An accompanying text should also be submitted. It is after these criteria are met that Anusha and her team swing into action. She says, “Pictures are sacred; they are colour-corrected for brightness and contrast, nothing more. Aesthetics trump in studio set-up pictures. The text is proofed and edited. Most events mentioned, like war, migration, plague... have been documented and, therefore, can be fact-checked. Very personal facts are stated as ‘we were told’. If there is a discrepancy, we vet and articulate a grey area.” Anusha adds, “Some of the text may need translation. Sometimes, pictures are sent on a whim and the sender may not recommit to investigating facts we may ask for; after much to and fro, there is no response. But quantity is not the issue. It’s not a magazine, it’s an archive. I don’t feel the need to bombard you with stories. I let it simmer.” The tidal shifts that engulfed the subcontinent have resulted in 300 stories, each one a gem, unveiling a smorgasbord of personalities and experiences slotted under headers such as Delhi, Couple, 1920, Headgear, Muslim, ‘Mustache’, World War II and Studio Portraits. Anusha’s favourite is the story of the devadasi who became the maharani of Dewas. “The photograph tells an incredible story of women who reclaimed their identity. Sometimes one story may lead to another more interesting footnote. Like the one on Sukhsampat Rai Bhandari who compiled the first English to Hindi and Marathi dictionaries. It was while researching on him that his involvement in the abdication of Tukojirao Holkar III of Indore after the famous Malabar Hill murder showed up.” Remembrance of things past Other remarkable stories come from colonial India when young Indians keen to experience the wider world travelled abroad, like Manjerikandy Ramchandran who left Kerala at 16 and found fame as a wrestler in Africa; Lieutenant Laxman Kadle who worked in lonely outposts in Bengal, died and whose body was never found; the Sanghvis of the Wilson Pen Family who designed the pen that was used to write the seminal Constitution of India or the teenage Chameli Jain who participated in the freedom struggle, grew to be the matriarch of a family that has remained in the public eye and after whom is named an eponymous award for women mediapersons. The writing brings alive old world nostalgia, places and institutions that have frayed around the edges; an escape into a time of wingback chairs, potted palms and Delhi University’s first ever girl rock band, Mad Hatter, kitted out in a sari andsalwar kameez. The IMP will never occupy a physical space says Anusha except for the museum store and the occasional pop-up. Its focus continues to underline that memorialisation must be an active practice and not a sporadic indulgence in nostalgia. And that through these visual stories, etched like images on a Grecian urn, we reclaim an almost lost Indian epic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-way-we-were/article32913761.ece
22 October 2020||October 22 2020 00:00 IST,||In search of light||In June 2019, standing by the side of an old, indigenous plum tree, amid the deep greenery of Bhandardara, Maharashtra, Aishwarya Sridhar stood stock-still, her camera focussed on the hypnotic illumination unfolding before her: Indian fireflies, by the thousands, moving about harmoniously whilst laying forth their magnificent bioluminescence. This moment, forever etched in the young shutterbug’s memory, would take her to newer heights. What she shot that night in June — the photo titled ‘Lights of Passion’ — fetched Aishwarya the highest recognition in Canon’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards under the ‘Behaviour-Invertebrates’ category. Thrilled as she is, the 23-year-old  is a little upset that she cannot be in person at the Natural History Museum, London, to see her photograph on display. “I have asked a couple of friends in London to visit the museum and take photos of the display for me,” she says, excitedly. Bioluminescent marvel Aishwarya’s interest in fireflies was lit when she came across a newspaper article that spoke of its abundant presence in the Western Ghats. It helped that fireflies, in small numbers, would often fly past the balcony of her home in Panvel, Mumbai. Her research led her to Bhandardara. “Clicking fireflies when the moon is bright is tough because their bioluminescence goes dull,” she says. So, the best time to shoot was in the window before sunrise, just as the moon almost set. With help from locals who guided her to the spot in the jungle, Aishwarya trekked for two-and-a-half-hours in pitch darkness, braving nocturnal species on the prowl. “I spotted a Myrobalan tree which was completely covered in fireflies. It was the first time I had seen fireflies in such huge numbers. I felt like I was standing in the magical world of Harry Potter,” she adds. She took snaps using the 100-400mm lens, but was not satisfied with the results. “I was missing out on their flashes because the whole tree wasn’t in the frame. It was tough to focus on the fireflies, and using a torch would have disturbed them. I had to rely on my eyesight to get a precisive shot of the tree.” The skies above her were scattered with twinkling stars, and so she decided to create a star trail to frame the fireflies. Using her Canon EOS-1D X Mark II camera and Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8 L II USM lens — at a focal length of 24mm, shutter speed of 24 seconds, f/2.8 and ISO 1000, she snapped 27 consecutive photos, which she later stitched together, post-production. “In other photographs [of fireflies], I didn’t see the juxtaposition of fireflies with the night sky, so that propelled my creative direction,” she says. Aishwarya notes that fireflies in India are not photographed as often as is assumed. “Indian fireflies are pretty different from others in the species with respect to bioluminescence. In other countries, you find fireflies make the grasslands their habitat. Here, they make their home on trees,” she says, adding why she is endlessly fascinated with them: “They are stunning ambassadors of Earth’s natural magic.”  lens view  Aishwarya’s image, ‘Lights of Passion’, was selected from among 50,000 entries sent by participants from over 80 countries. She, however, is no stranger to wildlife documentation. Aishwarya has filmed two documentaries: Panje — the Last Wetland (2018)  and Queen of Taru (2019).  The latter was awarded at the 9th Wildlife Conservation Film Festival, New York (2019).  Aishwarya is also a recipient of the Diana Award 2019, given to young change-makers aged nine to 25 by the Royal House, London.

22 October 2020||CHANDIGARH,||CM hits back after Oppn. ‘U-turn’ on Punjab Bills||A day after the Punjab Assembly ‘unanimously’ passed three amendment Bills to negate the Central farm laws, Opposition criticism prompted Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to express “amazement” at their “double standards”. He said they [Shiromani Akali Dal and Aam Aadmi Party] spoke in favour of the Bills in the Assembly, and even went with him to meet the Punjab Governor, but said different things outside. “It is more than clear that these parties are not interested in securing the future of the farmers or protecting the State’s agriculture and economy,” said Capt. Amarinder. He said the SAD and AAP were playing to the gallery by pretending to back the Bills in the Assembly on Tuesday. “Their lack of sincerity towards the farmers’ cause has been totally exposed by their statements thereafter. If they thought we were fooling the people of Punjab, why did they not say so in the House? Why did they support and vote for our Bills?” said the Chief Minister. Reacting to Arvind Kejriwal’s tweet raising doubts about the effectiveness of the amendment Bills, Capt. Amarinder said it smacked of total ignorance on the part of the Delhi Chief Minister. He said instead of questioning his government’s Bills, it would be better for Mr. Kejriwal to “get out of the IT mindset” and ask AAP’s Punjab unit to back the State government in its fight for the rights of the farmers, unless their support to Bills was just a façade. “The ball is in your court — are you with farmers or against them,” he asked the Delhi Chief Minister, challenging him to come out with a categorical stand on the issue of the Punjab amendment Bills. SAD leader and former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia said that the Bills, and the manner in which they had been brought and passed on Tuesday, were “clearly an orchestrated and foxy move by the [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi-Captain duo to completely destroy the farmers’ cause by throwing the responsibility for purchase of crops up in the air between the State and the Centre”.  ‘Farmers betrayed’ Mr. Majithia said that the Assembly session had been convened with only two objectives and on both, the farmers had been stabbed in the back. AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann said the State government Bills were not enough to safeguard the interests of farmers and the only way forward was that it should enact its own law guaranteeing the purchase of all crops, including wheat and paddy, at minimum support price.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cm-hits-back-after-oppn-u-turn-on-punjab-bills/article32913777.ece
22 October 2020||New Delhi,||Plea for witness statement in ex-CS case gets HC nod||In a major boost to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders in the former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash alleged assault case, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed a trial court here to also consider the statement of a former adviser to the Chief Minister who was present at the 2018 meeting pertaining to the case. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait directed the trial court here, which is seized of the case, to consider the statement of V.K. Jain at the time of passing the order. The High Court’s order came with a stern message to the police that it was their duty “to do free and fair investigation by bringing to the notice of the court all the evidences collected during the investigation without picking and choosing the one which does not support them”. “The accused has been provided with a definite right under the provisions of CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and the constitutional mandate to face the charge against him by a fair investigation and trial,” the HC said. Withholding statement Mr. Kejriwal and his Deputy Manish Sisodia, represented by senior advocates N. Hariharan and Dayan Krishnan, had alleged the prosecution of withholding the statement of witness Mr. Jain recorded on February 21, 2018, because it did not suit the prosecution case and helped in falsely implicating him, his Deputy Manish Sisodia and other AAP leaders including Prakash Jarwal and Amanatullah Khan. Mr. Jain, in the 2018 statement, which was reproduced in the judgment, stated that on the night of February 19, there was a meeting that took place between the AAP leaders and Mr. Prakash on the issue of ‘Door Step Delivery of Ration’, ‘Advertisement Funds Release’ and slow processing of files. During the meeting, Mr. Jain stated that he went to the washroom and upon returning saw former Chief Secretary Prakash leaving. Mr. Jain stated that he could not say anything about what transpired while he was in the washroom. The trial court had in its order, which was contested by the AAP leaders, noted that since it was a record of oral examination of Mr. Jain by the Investigating Officer (IO) and was noted in the ‘Case Diary’, the said examination did not take the place of a statement made under Section 161 CrPC (Examination of witnesses by police). It had declined to supply this “crucial document” to the AAP leaders. Justice Kait, however, observed that if a situation arose wherein an accused sought documents which supported his case and do not support the prosecution and the IO ignored these documents and forwarded only those documents which favoured the prosecution, in such a scenario, it would be the duty of the IO to make such documents available to the accused. “The investigating agency has no power to appreciate the evidence, it rests with the court,” Justice Kait remarked.

22 October 2020||New Delhi,||HC raps govt. for ‘starving’ district court||The High Court on Wednesday expressed extreme displeasure at the Delhi government for “starving” the district courts of finances for the basic facilities required to run the courts efficiently. A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subromanium Prasad remarked that despite the district courts generating revenue to the tune of around Rs. 482 crore over the past three years, the Delhi government has been procrastinating when it comes to releasing of funds. “Any obstruction in the discharge of constitutional function of the courts must be viewed seriously,” the Bench remarked. Fines collected It highlighted that in 2018-19, the district courts had collected fines to the tune of Rs. 80 crore, which was remitted to the Delhi government and court fee worth Rs. 96 crore was sold in the same year. In 2019-20, fines worth Rs. 89 crore was collected by the district courts and court fee worth Rs. 102 crore was sold. “Between July 1, 2019 to October 12, 2020, traffic fines to the tune of Rs. 115 crore have been collected by the virtual traffic courts and deposited with the Delhi government,” the High Court said. It said several directions were issued in the recent past to the government to clear the pending files relating to sanctions or revalidation for providing facilities to the district courts for efficient discharge of judicial obligations. Adequate support staff The pending sanctions include providing adequate support staff, including group ‘C’ staff and official vehicles for the judges to commute to court. “All the said issues have been hanging fire for a fairly long time,” the High Court said. Keeping in mind that 150 judicial officers are due to be posted in the next couple of months and their courts cannot be made functional without adequate support staff, the Bench directed the High Court registry to release Rs. 2.52 crore from its budget to the district court. “The said amount shall be returned to the Delhi High Court immediately on funds being made available by the Delhi government to the district court, which exercise shall be completed on or before December 31, 2020,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-raps-govt-for-starving-district-courts/article32914142.ece
22 October 2020||New Delhi,||Give FIR copy to Umar Khalid, police told||A court here ordered Delhi Police to supply former JNU student leader Umar Khalid a copy of the FIR, remand application and remand order of the case related to the north-east Delhi riots in which he was arrested. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purshotam Pathak noted that it was a settled proposition of law that no person shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds for such arrest. The court said that the remand application, the remand order and medical reports of his examination conducted during police custody “does not contain any material which may not be disclosed due to sensitivity of the matter or for any other reason”. It also highlighted that the chargesheet in the case has already been filed. Mr. Khalid in his plea, seeking the documents, said he was arrested in an FIR registered by Crime Branch on September 14, and remanded to police custody for 10 days. Thereafter, he has been remanded to judicial custody till October 22. Requests were ignored During the judicial custody period, Mr. Khalid was arrested again in an FIR registered at Khajuri Khas police station, which is being investigated by the Crime Branch. He stated that during the course of the remand proceedings, he made categorical requests to the duty magistrate at Tihar jail for the presence of his lawyer. However, the request was not entertained, he said. On the other hand, special public prosecutor vehemently opposed Mr. Khalid’s plea saying that there was no provision in CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) to supply the documents before taking cognisance by the court. The SPP further submitted that if the documents are supplied to Mr. Khalid at this stage, it will open a Pandora box and he will be moving a number of applications for supplying one or the other document. The court, however, rejected this contention saying, “An accused must be informed of the bare necessary facts leading to his arrest”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/give-fir-copy-to-umar-khalid-police-told/article32914141.ece
22 October 2020||Gurugram,||Swaraj India report highlights deficiencies in crop procurement||Delayed payments, grossly insufficient numbers of farmers scheduled for sales per day, arbitrary quantitative limits on procurement and the lack of a grievance redress system are some of the problems highlighted by Jai Kisan Andolan and Swaraj Abhiyan in their report on deficiencies in the ongoing procurement process for kharif crops in Haryana. The 10-page report also offers 17 suggestions to the government for improvement. Titled ‘Deficiencies in Procurement System and Difficulties Faced by Farmers in Haryana,’ the report has been handed over to Haryana Agriculture Minister Jai Prakash Dalal in Bhiwani by a delegation of Swaraj India led by its national president Yogendra Yadav. Referring to the inconvenience faced by the farmers due to the new software and alleged wrong policies of the government, Mr. Yadav attracted the attention of the minister to the fact that none of farmers was paid for the crops procured so far. He said that Swaraj India would be forced to launch an agitation if the government failed to address the farmers’ grievances. ‘No payment’ Based on the Swaraj Abhiyan team’s visit to a dozen mandis across six districts in South Haryana, the report claimed that notwithstanding the government’s claim to make payment within 72 hours, they “did not come across any farmer or trader who supported this claim”, adding that “the impression we gathered is that yet no farmer has received the payment in their account. This is putting farmers to great distress in this festival and wedding season. This delay acts as severe disincentive for the farmers and pushes them towards the private traders at severe losses”. The report pointed out that only 5-11% of the total registered farmers in four districts — Bhiwani, Mahendragarh, Charkhi Dadri and Rewari — had managed to sell their crops in the first two weeks of the six-week procurement session. The slow procurement process forced the farmers to sell their crop to private traders at a price much lesser than Minimum Support Price and the commission agents were also forced to work much below their capacity. It suggested that 500-600 farmers be scheduled per day and all registered farmers cleared by mid-November. “Purchase must take place on all days, without any break for holidays,” the report said. The report argued that the eight quintal and 33 quintal per acre limit on procurement of bajra and paddy respectively was irrational and punished the farmers for producing more. It said the limit fixed using the arithmetic average of the production in the State defied logic and the ceiling, if imposed, should be the upper end of statistical range. The report said the online registration at “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” had increased, but in backward areas like Mewat, many farmers were still not aware about the requirement of registration and thus lost out on this opportunity for a fair price for their produce. “In the previous years we had noticed a clear system of grievance redress...this time we did not find public notification of grievance committee in any of mandis we visited,” said the report. Voice message, SMS alert Among important suggestions, the report demanded that the farmers are sent a voice message along with an SMS to inform them of their scheduled date for procurement at least two days in advance, the schedule for the entire period of procurement must be prepared and made public, penal interest be paid at 18% per annum to farmers in case of delayed payment and commission agents must be authorised to purchase cotton on behalf of Cotton Corporation of India in those mandis where there are no corporation centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/swaraj-india-report-highlights-deficiencies-in-crop-procurement/article32913775.ece
22 October 2020||BHUBANESWAR / MUMBAI,||Opposition parties call for repeal of UAPA||Major Opposition parties have joined forces to demand the repeal of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), charges related to which were slapped against activists in the Bhima Koregaon case. Condemning the arrest of Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old tribal rights activist, leaders of the Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Nationalist Congress Party emphasised the need for building a strong movement against the misuse of harsh laws like the UAPA. ‘Illegal arrests’ The People’s Union for Civil Liberties organised a press conference on Wednesday to condemn the role of investigating agencies in carrying out “illegal” arrests and to demand the release of all 16 activists arrested in the case. PUCL general secretary V. Suresh quoted data presented by the Home Ministry before the Parliament, and said, “There has been a steady increase in the number of those arrested under the UAPA — from 999 in 2016 to 1,054 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018.” “The NDA government at the Centre is trying to gag people who raise voice against atrocities against Dalits, tribals and weaker sections,” said Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren. Speaking over a virtual media platform, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “I would appeal to all political parties and civil society organisations not to see this as an isolated single law issue. We have UAPA, National Security Act and sedition laws.... This UAPA must go.” DMK leader Kanimozhi said political parties and civil society organisations must decide if the present arrests should be accepted silently or they should all stand up and fight against it. CPI secretary D. Raja said his party had been opposing the arrest of all Opposition leaders, intellectuals, students and activists. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor urged the government to release Fr. Swamy immediately. NCP MP Supriya Sule said the arrests in the Bhima Koregaon case seemed to be about “dirty political vendetta”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/opposition-parties-call-for-repeal-of-uapa/article32913773.ece
