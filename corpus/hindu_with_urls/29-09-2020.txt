29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||COVID vaccine likely in early 2021: Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday said the first vaccine for COVID-19 is likely to be available in the first quarter of 2021. “Research to develop a vaccine is being done expeditiously. There are at least three viable such vaccine candidates that are in the phase of clinical trials right now in the country. We’re hopeful that within the first quarter of 2021 it will be available,” Dr. Vardhan was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI. The Minister was speaking at the launch of a dedicated online vaccine portal by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that details research studies, COVID-19 vaccine development in India as well as abroad and a history of vaccine development in India. Commenting on the launch of the portal, Dr. Vardhan said, “ICMR has always been at the forefront of health research in the country and is now leading the country in tackling the unprecedented pandemic through scientific rigour and innovation. To disseminate the vaccine-related information, the exclusive portal will be helpful in creating awareness among the masses. I hope all query of common people on the vaccine development process would be addressed through this portal.” The three leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates in India — Covishield, Covaxin and ZyCov-D — are mentioned in the portal with information on the underlying technology used to make them, the trials that have so far been completed and current progress on the trials. A section on international vaccine candidates being researched leads to a link on the World Health Organisation website. There are links to the research publications which inform on how vaccine trials in India are conducted and what the studies so far show. The portal also has information on vaccines for the Human Papilloma Virus, Shigella, hepatitis, cholera and typhoid. A section on the use of BCG — a vaccine for childhood tuberculosis — for COVID-19, links to an opinion paper on the Indian Journal of Medical Research , the ICMR’s in-house medical journal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-vaccine-likely-in-early-2021-vardhan/article32720135.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,||Ready for changes to legislation, says CM||Amidst protests by farmers, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday said he was ready for changes to the legislation to help farmers if its leaders came for consultations. “I appeal to farmers’ leaders not to push members of their fraternity into unnecessary confusion, and instead come for talks with me again,” he told a press conference here. He alleged that farmers’ leaders who met him earlier did not offer any suggestions. “They were not willing for discussions as they had already made up their mind to hold a protest,” he said. “Let them come for consultations at least now.” At the same time, he maintained that both the legislation had been amended in the interest of farmers. ‘Will remove restrictions’ “The amendments to the APMC Act would remove restrictions that farmers should sell their produce only at APMCs. They are free to sell anywhere and to anybody for remunerative prices,” he said. He said farmers were “in the clutches of middlemen” in APMC yards. However, APMCs would not be abolished, he said, and reiterated that the payment of minimum support price through revolving fund operated from the cess collected from APMCs would not be affected. Similarly, amendment to the Land Reforms Act had ensured that anybody could take up farming, the Chief Minister said. He pointed out that the government had retained the earlier land ceiling. The amendments had imposed conditions, such as not using irrigated land for other purposes, barring purchasing of land belonging to SC/ST communities for non-agricultural purposes, he said. Using the land, which is unfit for agriculture, to set up industries would help provide employment to thousands of people, he said. He alleged that it was the Congress that had allowed private companies such as Reliance to sell farmers’ produce at their stalls. He appealed to farmers to wait for six months to a year to see the positive impact of amendments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ready-for-changes-to-legislation-says-bsy/article32720150.ece
29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||AIADMK rift over CM face widens||The much-awaited meeting of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) executive committee on Monday witnessed dramatic moments with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister and party coordinator O. Panneerselvam engaging in a wordy exchange. The sharp verbal duel came over differences on who should be the party’s Chief Minister candidate in the 2021 Assembly election. The executive committee meeting, which went on for over four hours at the party headquarters in Chennai, ended without a decision on the crucial issue. “We will announce our [Chief Minister] candidate on October 7,” K.P. Munusamy, deputy coordinator of the party, told The Hindu after the meeting. Exactly 10 days ago, senior functionaries of the party had met for over an hour and held an intense discussion on the subject. According to several members of the executive committee, the deliberations at the meeting gave the impression that Mr. Palaniswami was “way ahead” of Mr. Panneerselvam, and his nomination as the Chief Minister candidate looked a mere formality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aiadmk-rift-over-cm-face-widens/article32720131.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,||No bail for actors Ragini, Sanjjanaa in drugs case||The special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Court, on Monday, rejected the bail pleas of actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani, who were arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in connection with a drug racket linked to the Kannada film industry. The bail hearing for the other accused in the case was adjourned to September 30. The special court also rejected the anticipatory bail applications filed by prime accused Shivaprakash and Vinay Kumar, who are on the run. The defence, while presenting the bail pleas, argued that the CCB did not have any evidence to substantiate the role of the accused. The defence accused the CCB of not following the due procedure while arresting the accused and said they had not recovered any material to prove their involvement. However, the prosecution stated that the investigation is still on and granting the accused bail would hamper it. “There is ample evidence that the accused not only consumed drugs, but also helped the other accused to peddle it through parties they organised. There are many other accused who are part of the racket who are still absconding and bailing out the accused would hamper investigation,” the prosecution argued. Meanwhile, the two actors, who were in a special cell, have been shifted to a regular cell after their quarantine term was over.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-bail-for-ragini-sanjjanaa-in-drug-case/article32720149.ece
29 September 2020||Pune,||COVID-19: Maharashtra breaches 13.50 lakh mark||In its lowest case surge in days, Maharashtra reported 11,921 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, taking its total case tally to 13,51,153 of whom 2,65,033 are active ones. Recoveries outweighed the spike with 19,932 patients being discharged to take the cumulative recoveries to 10,49,947. As many as 180 more deaths took the State’s fatality toll to 35,751. However, the relatively low case surge has to be viewed in the context of a lower number of samples tested (57,000) in the last 24 hours as opposed to the daily average of over 85,000 samples. At the same time, there has been a heartening trend of more recoveries than daily cases for the better part of the last seven days. “Of a total 66,22,384 laboratory samples tested thus far, 13,51,153 (20.40%) have returned positive with around 57,000 samples across the State being tested in the last 24 hours. The State’s recovery rate has risen to 76.91%,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the State’s case fatality rate was currently 2.65%. Pune reported nearly 2,000 cases to take its total case tally to 2,87,444 while 19 deaths saw its death toll climb to 5,689. As per the Pune district administration, the number of active cases stands below 42,000. Mumbai reported 2,055 cases to take its total tally to 2,00,901 of whom 26,784 are active. As many as 40 fatalities saw the city’s death toll rise to 8,834. Nagpur district recorded 778 cases, taking the district’s total case tally to 75,603 of whom 15,146 are active. Two deaths saw the death toll jump to 1,963. In western Maharashtra, Satara reported 12 fatalities to take its death toll to 904. As many as 460 fresh cases saw the total case tally touch 35,616 of whom 8,194 are active. Sangli reported nearly 500 cases to take the district’s total case tally to 37,066 of whom 9,624 are active. With eight deaths, the fatality toll has risen to 1,128. Kolhapur reported 10 deaths as its death toll rose to 1,311. More than 300 cases took its total case tally to 42,614 of whom 8,274 are active. In north Maharashtra, Nashik district reported 506 cases as its total tally reached 73,432 of whom 15,853 are active. With three deaths, the district’s fatality count has climbed to 1,264.

29 September 2020||HUBBALLI,||Mixed response to bandh call in Dharwad||The bandh call opposing the recent amendments to the farm bills evoked mixed response in Dharwad district on Monday with only a few localities remaining shut, particularly during the time of protest marches and agitations, while others had an almost normal day. In Hubballi, it seemed as if the bandh call was restricted only to the central business district and the landmark Kittur Chennamma Circle was the epicentre of all protests and demonstrations. Shops and commercial establishments in and around Kittur Chennamma Circle, Durgad Bail and other areas of the central business district remained closed during the initial hours of the bandh. Although public transport operated with fewer commuters, the services were suspended for a few hours after a large number of protestors congregated at the circle and staged a protest against the NWKRTC authorities for allowing buses to run. A series of protests and demonstrations were witnessed in front of the equestrian statue of the Kittur queen with members and office-bearers of various organisations, including a few political parties, marching to the circle and holding demonstrations. The former Navalgund MLA N.H. Konaraddi and Rajanna Koravi of the Janata Dal (Secular), Congress leaders Anil Kumar Patil, Altaf Halwoor, Altaf Kittur, Rajashekhar Menasinakai, Anwar Mudhol and Babajan Mudhol, and Santosh Naragund and Vikas Soppin of the Aam Aadmi Party, Mahesh Pattar and others of the Left parties, office-bearers of various Kannada and Dalit organisations, including Amrut Ijari, Siddu Teji, and others took part in the agitation. In fact, early in the morning, some protestors offered roses to shopkeepers who had opened their shops and requested them to support their cause, following which most businessmen downed their shutters. Following the protests, the Kittur Chennamma Circle, which connects seven arterial roads, remained shut till around 3 p.m. and vehicles were diverted through alternative roads. In Dharwad city, the bandh call was restricted to sit-ins, road blocks and demonstrations. Under various banners, the protestors marched to the Jubilee Circle and staged a rasta roko. There were protests by Congress and Janata Dal(S) leaders. Bigger hotels remained shut in the city as the hoteliers association extended support to the bandh call. However, smaller eateries functioned as usual. City buses in Dharwad operated as usual but with reduced frequency, while autorickshaws were seen operating as normal as the autorickshaw drivers union was divided over extending support to the call. Vehicular movement was, however, affected for over an hour on the Hubballi-Dharwad bypass road as farmers organisations staged a road blockade. Meanwhile, there was mixed response to the bandh call in Haveri and Gadag districts and various organisations took out protest marches. In Haveri, Hosamani Siddappa Circle was blocked for hours as farmers staged a protest over the amendments to the farm bills. In Uttara Kannada, there was lukewarm response. Meanwhile, the response to the call in Belagavi and Vijayapura districts was mixed. In Belagavi, police arrested a group of protesters who wanted to lay siege to the Suvarna Soudha.  Similar protests were held in Chikkodi, Athani, Khanapur, Bailhongal, Yamakanamaradi and other towns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mixed-response-to-bandh-call-in-dharwad/article32720295.ece

29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Stage set for NSD’s first play since lockdown||With a larger-than-usual stage, spaced-out seating for a masked audience and actors armed with negative COVID-19 test results, the National School of Drama is preparing for its first production since the pandemic shut down all public spaces in March. Three shows of ‘Pehla Satyagrahi’, a play about the life of Mahatma Gandhi written by Ravindra Tripathy, have been planned this week in commemoration of Gandhi’s birth anniversary, NSD director-in-charge and the director of the play, Suresh Sharma, said on Monday. The shows, one each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, will be at 6.30 p.m. in an open-air auditorium at the NSD’s Bhagwan Das Road premises. Only 100 tickets Mr. Sharma said the shows this week would be the first since March 16. He said all actors were tested for COVID-19 and only those who tested negative were allowed to participate. Following the government’s Unlock 4 guidelines, Mr. Sharma said only 100 tickets would be sold for each show. “The stage will be sanitised regularly and distance will be maintained. We have increased the size of the stage. The sitting gallery will be made in such a way as to maintain distance between seats,” Mr. Sharma said. All audience members will have to wear face masks and buy their tickets online, starting Tuesday. He added that if all goes well, the NSD would organise performances every other weekend. Mr. Sharma said since there has been no performance for over six months, he expects the response to be positive. Following orders of the Culture Ministry, classes at NSD were suspended on March 13 and online classes as well as webinars for the general public were organised during the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/stage-set-for-nsds-first-play-since-lockdown/article32720278.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||UPSC reluctant to postpone civil services exams due on October 4||The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Monday expressed its reluctance to postpone the civil services exams due on October 4. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, advocate Naresh Kaushik, for the UPSC, said it would not be possible to defer the exams as they had earlier been postponed due to the pandemic. He said any further “deferment may nullify the objective of holding the exams”. The Bench asked the UPSC to file an affidavit by September 29. It agreed to hear the case again on Wednesday. The petition, filed by some aspirants, had said the conduct of the exams in the midst of a public health crisis was a violation of their fundamental right to life. About six lakh candidates are expected to take the exams. With the rate of infection peaking, many students may opt to not take the exams for fear of the contracting the virus, they apprehended. Thus, the right of students to fulfil their professional aspiration in the civil services is being curtailed, said the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/upsc-reluctant-to-postpone-civil-services-exams-due-on-october-4/article32720282.ece
29 September 2020||Kolkata,||Police complaint against BJP leader for remarks against Mamata||Bharatiya Janata Party leader Anupam Hazra has courted a controversy by saying he “will hug Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee if he is infected by the COVID-19” to make her feel the pain of the families of the pandemic patients. Mr. Hazra, newly appointed national general secretary of the BJP, is a former Trinamool Congress MP, who had represented the Birbhum Lok Sabha seat. The remarks made at a party programme in Baruipur in the South 24 Parganas on Sunday evening triggered an outrage on Monday. Mr. Hazra was speaking to media persons on the COVID-19 situation and how bodies have been denied any respect when he went a little too far. Mr. Hazra, who taught social work at the Visva Bharati University, was TMC MP from Bolpur from 2014 to 2019. He was expelled from the TMC in January 2019 and joined the BJP. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Jadavpur seat and lost to TMC’s Mimi Chakrborty. The police complaint was filed by the TMC in Siliguri and the party leadership condemned the remarks . The BJP State leadership has distanced itself from the remarks. Senior TMC leader Saugata Roy said the remarks reflect the “mindset” of the BJP. Minister Indranil Sen used harsher words to criticise the BJP leader. “And such uncouth people are office bearers of @BJP4India! Shame on you @tweetanupam, you are not just an insensitive leader but also a disrespectful human being,” Mr. Sen tweeted. The political rhetoric has hit a new low over the past few years with the war of words between the BJP and the ruling party. Among other leaders, State BJP president Dilip Ghosh has often courted controversy by his public remarks directed at the TMC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-complaint-against-bjp-leader-for-remarks-against-mamata/article32720331.ece
29 September 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||As COVID cases surge, CM calls all-party meet||An all-party meeting to be convened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday will weigh the public health benefit against the economic and social risk of a proposal to reintroduce lockdown-like curbs on life, travel, and trade to fence in the worrying increase in COVID-19 cases in parts of the State. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala indicated on Monday that the United Democratic Front (UDF) would back the government’s COVID-19 control measures. The UDF has suspended anti-government street protests and party programmes requiring mass attendance given the gravity of the situation, he said. Mr. Vijayan blamed the “surge” on the mass assembly of persons, a general lack of compliance with wearing masks, and maintaining a physical distance in public. Funerals and marriages had become giant Petri dishes for the virus to multiply and spread. Well-attended social settings and assemblage of people in large numbers had spawned outbreaks and clusters across the State. Curbs likely The government might be constrained to impose restrictions on non-essential activities and non-emergency travel. The goal was to slow down the pandemic without going in for a debilitating lockdown. The government had limited the number of persons who could attend a funeral to 20 and wedding to 50. It had increased the penalty for not wearing masks in public places. The administration would shut down shops and establishments which allow crowding. The government would send gazetted rank officers with special powers to panchayats, corporations, and municipalities to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 protocol, he said. Mr. Vijayan had conferred via video link with heads of departments, district magistrates, and District Police Chiefs earlier. The contagion had whittled down the number of doctors, health workers, and emergency responders available for active duty. The State could ill afford to squander away the gains it had made in keeping the contagion at bay. Any further dropping of guard against the disease would accelerate its spread and cause the plague to overwhelm the State’s finite healthcare resources. Taluk level curbs An official said taluk level curbs were on the table for discussion. A total lockdown was unlikely. The local-level curbs proposed would act as a safety measure, a kind of electric circuit breaker, to stop the surge of infections. A total State-wide lockdown was unlikely, he said. The pandemic had also come close to the heart of the governance. Ministers, the CM’s press secretary, and private secretary of Mr. Chennithala were among those infected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-covid-cases-surge-cm-calls-all-party-meet/article32720360.ece
29 September 2020||Pune,||Fire breaks out in trauma care unit of Kolhapur’s CPR hospital; no casualties||A fire broke out in the trauma care unit of the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) Civil Hospital in western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur district in the early hours of Monday. The prima facie cause of the blaze, which erupted a little after 3 a.m., was said to be an electrical short circuit. CPR authorities claimed that there was no loss of life or injury to the patients, all of whom were critical COVID-19 cases. Sources said that two of the rescue personnel suffered burn injuries. “A fire broke out this morning due to a short circuit in an electric board in a room in CPR’s trauma intensive care unit. There was no loss of life or injury as the 15 patients inside were evacuated on time and shifted to other wards with critical care equipment,” Dr. Chandrakant Mhaske, dean, CPR, said. He said that fire brigade personnel, senior doctors, nurses, class IV personnel, and jawans from the Maharashtra Security Force had succeeded in getting the fire under control after a few hours. The hospital is a dedicated COVID-19 care centre, with over 400 patients undergoing treatment there. Kolhapur, along with neighbouring Satara and Sangli districts, has emerged as the new virus hotbed in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fire-breaks-out-in-trauma-care-unit-of-kolhapurs-cpr-hospital-no-casualties/article32720681.ece

He also said if someone thinks the “office of Governor is an ornamental post office that is not so. This office it has enough power to protect and defend the Constitution”. Mr. Dhankar said, “West Bengal has been turned into a police state” and that “electronic surveillance by the TMC government” has forced him to communicate over WhatsApp voice calls. “A police state is the first enemy of a democracy. Police state and democracy don’t go hand in hand.” The Governor touched on a host of issues. “What is amiss if the Governor wants the DGP to elaborate on the deteriorating law and order in the wake of political violence, political vendetta and ruthless quelling of opposition,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-act-if-constitution-is-not-protected-governor/article32720332.ece

All the three south Bengal districts are near the forests of Jharkhand and Odisha from where herds of elephants come in search of food. “We have plans to install barriers on the West Bengal side of the elephant corridor bordering Odisha and Jharkhand in the Junglemahal belt to stop damage to life and property by depredating pachyderms coming from those States,” a senior forest official told PTI . In the last four-five months, there had been at least 12 incidents of jumbos straying into human habitations in Salboni, Goaltor and Lalgarh.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Bring new farm laws, Sonia tells Cong. CMs||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has directed the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry to explore the possibility of passing laws to override the three agricultural laws passed recently by Parliament. A statement issued by party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal said that these States have been told to pass laws under Article 254 (2) of the Constitution that allows State legislatures to pass law to negate the “anti-agriculture” central laws encroaching upon the States’ jurisdiction under the Constitution. Article 254 (2) essentially enables a State government to pass a law, on any subject in the Concurrent List, which may contradict a central law, provided it gets the President’s assent. In late 2014, the BJP government in Rajasthan took this route to make changes to the central labour laws – the Factories Act, the Industrial Disputes act and the Contract Labour Act — which subsequently got the President’s assent. “This would enable the States to bypass the unacceptable anti-farmers provisions in the three draconian Agricultural laws including the abolition of MSP and disruption of APMCs in Congress-ruled states. This would also alleviate the farmers from the grave injustice done by the Modi Government and BJP,” the statement said. Punjab’s move The Punjab government, led by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, had started work on these lines. It had been contemplating to amend the Agriculture Produce Market Committee Act and declare the entire State as a principal mandi yard. This would circumvent the provisions in The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which was passed in Parliament. The declaration of mandi yards ensures that any procurement outside their ambit is considered illegal, farmers do not get a price less than the MSP, and the State gets its mandi fee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bring-new-farm-laws-sonia-tells-cong-cms/article32720089.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Offset clause goes for IGAs||The Defence Ministry has removed the offset clause requirement in Inter-Governmental Agreements (IGA) in the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP), 2020, which was released on Monday. It also introduces a new category for leasing of military equipment. Last week, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) observed that French defence majors Dassault Aviation and MBDA have till date “not confirmed” the transfer of technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under the Rs. 60,000 crore deal for 36 Rafale fighter jets. The deal has a 50% offset clause to be executed by the French companies. “Not working” “We removed some of the offset requirements as they are not working. From now on there will be no offset clause in government-to-government, single vendor and IGAs,” Director General Acquisition Apurva Chandra said. Under offset clause, foreign companies are required to invest part of their deal value in the country and meant to improve the domestic defence manufacturing. Stating that no offset has led to a transfer of technology and many of them had to do with product purchase, Mr. Chandra said these observations have been brought out in a recent CAG report. “The offset guidelines have also been revised, wherein preference will be given to manufacture of complete defence products over components and various multipliers have been added to give incentivisation in discharge of offsets,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Twitter. Other proposed measures include making after sales support part of capital acquisition contract, higher indigenous content in acquisitions and incentives for local material and software and emphasis on product export under offsets. The draft was finalised by a committee headed by Director General Acquisition, MoD, that was set up in August 2019. Lease option Leasing has been introduced as a new category for acquisition in addition to the existing ‘Buy’ and ‘Make’ categories to substitute huge initial capital outlays with periodical rental payments. This will be useful for military equipment not used in actual warfare like transport fleets, trainers, simulators, among others. “A new procedure has been included as a new chapter in DAP and structured as an enabling provision for Services to procure essential items through Capital Budget under a simplified procedure in a time bound manner,” Mr. Singh said. He said the DAP 2020 has been aligned with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/offset-clause-goes-for-igas/article32720095.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||Probing all aspects in Sushant case, says CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday said it had not yet ruled out any aspect of the probe related to the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, whose body was found at his Mumbai residence under mysterious circumstances on June 14. “The CBI is conducting professional investigation related to death of Sushant Singh Rajput, in which all aspects are being looked at and no aspect has been ruled out as of date,” said the agency spokesperson. The statement came days after Vikas Singh, the lawyer of Sushant’s family, expressed frustration over the delay on the part of the agency in arriving at a conclusion. He also said that a doctor with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had earlier told him that photographs of Sushant’s body indicated that it was a case of strangulation. A team of forensic experts from the AIIMS is assisting the CBI in the probe and it has not yet submitted the final report to the investigating team. Based on a complaint lodged by Sushant’s father, the Patna police had registered a case on July 25, alleging abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy, cheating, breach of trust, theft, wrongful restraint and confinement.  The CBI took over the case in the first week of August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probing-all-aspects-in-sushant-case-says-cbi/article32720076.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||Land acquisition order gifted govt. laxity: CJI||Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Monday questioned the infallibility of a land acquisition judgment delivered by a Constitution Bench, led by his former colleague, Justice Arun Mishra, saying the verdict had left things “unsaid”. The CJI, heading a three-judge Bench, said the order gifted the government “laxity” in several aspects, which even Parliament did not bother to provide under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013. For one, the verdict did not specify for how long the government could possess a land acquired without paying compensation. “When does the acquisition lapse?” The verdict made it look as if the acquisition did not lapse “forever”, the CJI said. “The government takes possession [of a property] but has not paid compensation. The acquisition does not lapse. But for how long will the acquisition not lapse? Five years is the time given under the parliamentary law... but if the compensation is not paid, then how long will the acquisition continue? Forever?” he stated. “The judgment has given the government laxity, which Parliament did not want the government to have. Parliament had said the government cannot do this, the law said the compensation should not be kept pending... the government cannot just take over land and not pay compensation,” the CJI voiced the court’s apprehensions. His expressions of doubt about the March judgment came as soon as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta pointed out that about 600 cases were pending in the court and in various High Courts. Mr. Mehta had suggested these cases may now be dealt with in accordance with the law laid down by the Constitution Bench judgment. ‘Give us two weeks’ But the CJI said the judges needed some more time to study the verdict. “There are some things which we want to talk about. We will talk among ourselves... Give us two weeks... We are not talking about one individual case. We are talking about the judgment of a five-judge Bench,” he addressed Mr. Mehta. The 319-page judgment of the Constitution Bench was interpreting Section 24 (2) of the 2013 Act, which dealt with payment of compensation for land acquired by the government. It said acquisition would not lapse as long as the government earmarked the compensation money by paying it into the treasury. In short, the money need not actually reach the farmer or the landowner. Acquisition would also not lapse just because the farmer refused the compensation and claimed higher. Similarly, there was no lapse in acquisition if the compensation had been paid but possession not taken of the land. The judgment had declared that acquisition would only lapse if the government had neither taken possession nor paid the compensation due to the landowner for five or more years prior to January 1, 2014.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-acquisition-order-gifted-govt-laxity-cji/article32720082.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Loan moratorium plan to be ready by Oct. 1||The Union government informed the Supreme Court on Monday that complexities concerning the way forward following the expiry of the loan moratorium were under “active consideration” at the highest level. The moratorium was in place during the lockdown. Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said “the issues are under active consideration of the Government of India and only after decision is taken, an affidavit along with decision can be filed”. Mr. Mehta said an affidavit explaining the government’s plans would be ready by October 1. The court listed the case for October 5. In the last hearing on September 10, the court had given into the persistent plea made by the government for two more weeks to brainstorm with the Reserve Bank of India and banks on crucial issues such as sector-specific loan restructuring and charging borrowers interest on interest for loans deferred during the moratorium. Mr. Mehta had even then said deliberations were on at the “highest level” in the government. Individual borrowers and various sectors of commerce and industry, including traders, power and real estate, had urged the court to pass an interim order extending the loan moratorium, which expired on August 31. They had said loan restructuring would not help as the banks had already started debiting interest on interest. Their credit ratings and asset value had dipped. This had seriously affected the confidence of account holders. The worst hit were the individual borrowers, who had come out of the moratorium period only to find that they were supposed to pay interest on loan interest deferred during the moratorium. But the court merely recorded the government submission that “expert committees” had been formed and they would file reports. The government had promised action. “We are going into the problem in a holistic way,” Mr. Mehta had assured the court. “You must have a complete and clear policy. Whatever is there, it should be very clear,” Justice M.R. Shah, on the Bench, had told him. Mr. Mehta had said it would be a “self-contained policy”.  You must have a complete and clear policy.

29 September 2020||Bengaluru,||Mixed response to Karnataka bandh||The call for a Karnataka bandh, by various farmers’ organisations opposing the recent farm Bills, received a mixed response in the State on Monday. Bengaluru city saw protests by several groups but there was little impact on daily life, with most shops and establishments open, though traffic remained relatively thin. In contrast, the bandh was more pronounced in Kalyana Karnataka, where shops were shut and transport not plying. The call also received no response in the coastal districts. Mandya, Mysuru, Hassan, Tumakuru, Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi, and other districts saw a mixed response. At Bengaluru, while cabs and autorickshaws mostly did not ply, all other public transport and commercial establishments worked as usual. However, the city witnessed massive protests by farmers, Kannada organisations, and the Congress against the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the Karnataka APMC (Amendment) Bill, 2020, recently passed in the Assembly. As traffic was sparse, the protests did not lead to any traffic chaos. Farmers blocked key highways across the city, while Kannada organisations tried to gherao railway stations and the Kempegowda International Airport, but were taken into preventive custody. Multiple protests held across the city congregated in front of Town Hall. Farmers held a mock funeral procession of a large plough to indicate the farm Bills piloted by the government will cause immense harm. Farmers elsewhere in the State held similar protests. A.T. Ramaswamy, JDS MLA, sat alone with a placard that read “Down with laws that are anti-farmer and anti-poor” at Arkalgud taluk office in Hassan. The Congress held a public rally in support of the protesting farmers in the city, and met Governor Vajubhai Vala and urged him to reject the Bills. “Both the Union and the State governments have to withdraw the farm Bills that will pave way to the corporatisation of agriculture and kill small and medium farmers,” farmers’ leader Badagalpura Nagendra said in Bengaluru, adding that there was no consultation with stakeholders before the Bill was tabled in the Assembly. A senior police official said that the bandh passed off peacefully without any untoward incident reported from the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mixed-response-to-karnataka-bandh/article32720056.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||Cong. misleading farmers: Javadekar||Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday slammed the Congress following the incident of a tractor being set on fire by protesters at India Gate here, alleging that the Opposition party has been misleading farmers on the three new farm laws aimed at liberalising the agriculture sector. Mr. Javadekar said, “Congress stands exposed and is misleading the farmers. They are doing drama in the name of farmers and politics on it.” He also charged the Congress with duplicity. “In their 2019 manifesto, they promised a similar law. In fact, Manmohan Singh ji has over the years, spoken many times about these laws. So their manifesto and Manmohan ji will say one thing and they will do the opposite,” the Minister alleged. Eish Singhal, Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi), said about 15 to 20 persons gathered at Rajpath near India Gate around 7.15 a.m. and set a tractor on fire. The fire was put out and the vehicle removed. Five held “We have detained five persons. An SUV used in the incident has been seized. Those held are natives of Punjab. We are verifying their identities,” Mr. Singhal said. The Punjab Youth Congress had livestreamed the incident. According to the police, witnesses said the protesters brought the tractor on a truck, and after reaching Rajpath, they pushed it on to the road and set it on fire. The protesters were holding pictures of Bhagat Singh and raised slogans against the farm laws. Earlier in the day, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in a tweet said the three agricultural laws are a death sentence for farmers and that their voice had been crushed within and outside Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-misleading-farmers-javadekar/article32720084.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||LJP simmering, but yet to boil over||After months of belligerent campaigning against JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the Lok Janshakti Party has not made a formal announcement of severing ties with the NDA, three days after the Bihar Assembly election schedule was announced, though the party unofficially maintains that it will contest against the JD(U) in 143 seats. Absence of party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan, who is currently undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital, has made the situation precarious for the party. So far, between Ram Vilas Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan, who also heads the party, they were able to maintain a balance. If Chirag Paswan strikes out, then a third front could emerge in the Bihar election, which till now, is a bipolar fight between the NDA and the Opposition parties’ Mahagatbandhan or grand alliance. Sources said on Monday that the party had decided that it would fight on 143 seats. They also said that the party would not go into the election on the agenda of “Saat Nischay” or “Seven Promises,” which originally was the agenda on which the JD(U) and the RJD had come together in 2015. There has been speculation that party president Chirag Paswan, who is currently Lok Sabha MP from the Jamui constituency, may himself contest the Assembly election. This will be a culmination of nearly a year-long campaign, in which Chirag Paswan managed to pitch himself against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. “We have been consistent in our stand. Since last November, we have maintained that we will remain with the NDA only if there is a common minimum programme agreed upon by all the allies and if there is a constant channel of communication between the allies,” a senior LJP leader said. Barring a series of tweets on his father’s absence on Friday when the election schedule was announced, Mr. Paswan has kept mum on Bihar polls. “I am a part of Papa and I have learned to win by fighting in adverse conditions. Thank you to all of you for standing with me in this difficult time...,” Mr. Paswan had tweeted on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ljp-simmering-but-yet-to-boil-over/article32720100.ece
29 September 2020||Hassan,||Child killed in attempt to ‘ward off evil forces’||A three-year-old baby girl was killed on Sunday, allegedly while a self-claimed godman at Ajjikyatanahalli in Holalkere taluk of Chitradurga district attempted to “ward off evil forces”. Rakesh, who claimed to have the skills to ward off evil by invoking a local deity, allegedly beat up the girl, killing her in the process. Poorvika, the victim, was the daughter of Praveen and Shalini. Recently, the couple apparently noticed some behavioural changes in her. Praveen, who runs a grocery shop in the village, shared his worry about his daughter’s health with another villager, Parashuram. Parashuram suggested that Praveen seek the help of his brother, Rakesh, to treat the child’s “problem”. Praveen, in his complaint to the police, said that on Parashuram’s advice, he and his wife took the baby to Rakesh’s place on Sunday morning. The accused took the baby inside his thatched hut after asking the parents to wait outside. They could hear the baby cry inside. A few minutes later, Rakesh came out with the baby on his shoulder and took her to a nearby tank, where he performed a puja before handing her over to the parents. The couple took the baby home and noticed that she was not responding. They took her to a hospital, where she was declared brought dead. G. Radhika, Superintendent of Police of Chitradurga, told The Hindu that accused Rakesh, 19, and Parashuram 25, have been arrested. For the last three or four months, the brothers had been telling the locals that they could resolve many problems related to “evil forces” by invoking the deity. “The brothers have built a thatched hut near their house to perform such rituals,” she said. Chikkajajur police have booked a case under provisions of Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Practices and Black Magic Act, 2017, besides the relevant sections of the IPC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/child-killed-in-attempt-to-ward-off-evil-forces/article32720162.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,||Kerala student clinches 18 gold medals at NLSIU||The virtual convocation ceremony of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, which was held on Sunday, saw history being made. By clinching 18 gold medals, Yamuna Menon, who was among the 576 students who graduated, became the student with the most number of medals ever received in the history of the university. Of the 48 gold medals awarded to graduates from different academic programmes as recognition of their achievements, Ms. Menon, who hails from Kochi in Kerala, and graduated with a BA LL.B (Hons) degree, received 18 medals at the 28th annual convocation. Ms. Menon is a recipient of a scholarship from the university, in association with Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access (IDIA), a non-profit organisation which aims to empower underprivileged children by giving them access to quality legal education. She said that IDIA also put her in touch with a mentor who was from the corporate law area who guided her about opportunities in the legal field. She was drawn towards law as it is an instrument that creates a difference in every walk of life, she said. She wrote the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) in 2014, but did not get admission in NLSIU. She then took a gap year and wrote the CLAT again in 2015, securing the 28th rank, and subsequently admission into NLSIU. Her family has no background in law. “I think I was systematic in my approach towards academics. I would set personal goals for myself and then try to achieve that to the best of my abilities. I think paying attention in class helped me the most,” she said. She now plans to pursue her postgraduation from Trinity College, University of Cambridge. Talking about her long term plans in law, she said, “I would like to gain international exposure, especially with international organisations in the area of sustainable development goals and then make use of these skills in our nation building.” Ms. Menon also headed the academic support initiatives in the university and was part of various research assignments with centres in the university, which included competition law, labour law, and environmental law. She said that these responsibilities in the university and the diverse internship opportunities played a key role in moulding her. She wrote a paper on the Sumangali system in the Tamil Nadu textile industry which was published in the Cambridge Law Review.  I would set personal goals for myself and then try to achieve that to the best of my abilities.

The codes, it said, did not enable a “hire and fire” policy and the rights of workers and unions had been protected. Parliament passed the Code on Social Security, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code and the Industrial Relations Code, 2020 amid an Opposition boycott. Workers’ unions, including the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, hit out at the move. They termed the codes, which merge 25 laws, anti-worker. In its statement, the Ministry said the codes were a historic game changer and the criticism was unfounded. The IR Code increased the threshold beyond which companies have to take prior approval from the government to terminate employees from 100 workers to 300 workers. The Ministry said the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour, to which the 2019 versions of the Bills had been referred to, also recommended increasing the threshold to 300. “It is only the aspect of prior permission of the appropriate government which has been removed and other benefits and workers’ rights have been kept intact. The workers’ rights, such as notice before retrenchment, compensation at the rate of 15 days wages per completed year of service, and pay in lieu of notice period, have not been compromised,” the Ministry stated. The IR Code also introduced a new Reskilling Fund to be created to give monetary benefit equal to 15 days of wages, it said. “There has been no empirical evidence to suggest that higher threshold promotes hire and fire,” the Ministry said. It said the Economic Survey 2019 had pointed out the problem of “dwarfism” in Indian firms, as the companies were not increasing the number of employees beyond 100, the threshold under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Rajasthan had increased the threshold to 300 workers in 2014 and the “average number of factories in Rajasthan having more than 100 increased significantly as compared to the rest of India.” Fifteen other States had followed suit, it added. The Ministry said fixed-term employment had already been notified by the Central government and 14 States. It was “pro-worker” and such employees would be eligible for all benefits and service conditions that a regular employee enjoyed, the Ministry said. “Non-availability of fixed-term employment implied that an employer had options to either employ on regular basis,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-codes-dont-promote-hire-and-fire/article32720092.ece
29 September 2020||MYSURU,||Tobacco auction to begin in Karnataka from tomorrow||The Tobacco Board has announced that the auction of tobacco will start in Karnataka from September 30. Board chairman Y. Raghunadha Babu said this in a statement on Wednesday, days after he met tobacco growers at Chilkunda auction platform in Mysuru and assured them that the auctions will start by the end of the month. To begin with, auctions will commence at the platforms in Periyapatna and Chilkunda. The process of auction will start in the remaining nine auction platforms from October 7. Regional Manager of Tobacco Board, Mysuru, Manjunath said the SOPs will be in place during the auction process. In Karnataka, the auction season for tobacco starts in September-October every year and continues till February-March by when all the produce is exhausted. Earlier this year, auction of tobacco was suspended abruptly in March following the outbreak of COVID-19 even though more than 2.5 million kg of the produce remained unsold. However, auctions resumed towards end of May, after the lockdown was lifted, and the remaining tobacco was sold. More than 80% of the tobacco grown in about one lakh hectares of Mysuru and parts of adjoining Hassan district is classified as superior Flue Cured Virginia variety that is exported to various cigarette manufacturing companies abroad. In view of an anticipated dip in global demand for tobacco due to COVID-19, the Tobacco Board, earlier this year, had reduced the crop size from 99 million kg to 88 million kg. The reduction in crop size had also correspondingly reduced the ceiling for each of the estimated 56,000 licensed tobacco farmers from 1,700 kg to 1,552 kg. Tobacco is grown in around one lakh hectares in Karnataka, mostly in Periyapatna, Hunsur, K R Nagar and H D Kote taluks of Mysuru district, besides Arkalgud and Holenarsipur in neighbouring Hassan district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tobacco-auction-to-begin-in-karnataka-from-tomorrow/article32720163.ece
29 September 2020||JAIPUR,||83.5% voting in Rajasthan village panchayat elections||A total of 83.5% of the 31.95 lakh voters cast their votes in the first phase of village panchayat elections in Rajasthan on Monday. The highest polling, 94.66%, was reported from Dhorimanna panchayat samiti in Barmer district. The polling was held for Sarpanches and Ward Panches of 947 village panchayats. Polling was held peacefully at all the panchayat headquarters, with no untoward incident reported from anywhere. However, the voters did not adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing at a large number of polling stations. An electronic voting machine, which developed snag at Neemrana in Alwar district, was promptly replaced, while some defective EVMs in Dholpur district’s Bari region were repaired. The number of voters was reduced from 1,100 to 900 at each polling station to maintain social distancing. Dungarpur violence Elections in 55 village panchayats of Sarada and Gogunda panchayat samitis in Udaipur district was postponed in view of the recent violence in the adjoining Dungarpur district. The police force from Udaipur was sent to control law and order in Dungarpur and the polling parties were finding it difficult to reach the panchayats. Sikar MP Sumedhanand Saraswati, who had tested COVID-19 positive, cast his vote at Piprali while wearing a personal protective equipment kit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/835-voting-in-rajasthan-village-panchayat-elections/article32720289.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Draconian laws foisted on people’||Draconian laws such as the National Security Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act are being foisted upon people in “cooked-up” cases to keep them detained for a couple of months, former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, said in a webinar on Sunday. The webinar, ‘Our Article 21 Fundamental Right Not To Be Framed By The State’, organised by academic Mohan Gopal saw several former judges and prominent personalities take part. Former top court judge, Justice A.K. Patnaik, said there is “at present a fear among many that they may be falsely framed.”  Akshardham attack case Justice Patnaik said motives for framing a person might be many, but laws had sufficient safeguards. The court should not take cognisance of cases mechanically. An innocent person might be deprived of his life and liberty. Justice Patnaik referred to how the accused persons, all belonging to one community, were acquitted by the Supreme Court in the 2002 Akshardham terror attack case after 12 years. Justice Lokur referred to how Dr. Kafeel Khan was detained for his speech under the National Security Act. The Allahabad High Court set aside his detention, saying a complete reading of his speech showed he deprecated violence and called for national integrity and unity of citizens. “A person says don’t indulge in violence and he is put under detention for endangering the unity of the country. If you talk about national security, you are endangering the security of the country,” Justice Lokur said. “It is alright to say compensation will be given. Compensation, according to me, must be given. But that is not the answer. There is a lot of mental trauma involved,” Justice Lokur said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/draconian-laws-foisted-on-people/article32720080.ece
29 September 2020||Srinagar,||Dangerous LeT militant, active since 2015, killed: J&K police||A longest surviving wanted militant was among two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants killed in south Kashmir on Sunday, Director-General of Police Dilbagh Singh said on Monday. “The slain militant, Aijaz Ahmed Reshi, was the longest surviving militant commander of the LeT outfit. He was working as an over ground worker in 2015 and joined militancy before [slain militant ‘commander’] Burhan Wani,” he said at a press conference at the District Police Linesin Awantipora, Pulwama. Describing Reshi as a “dangerous militant”, Mr. Singh said he carried out deadly attacks on security forces inflicting heavy casualties. “He took part in an attack at EDI Pampore in which eight CRPF men were killed. He had transported the Lashkar men to the spot. He had fired at the Army party killing three soldiers at Kadlabal, Pampore,” he said. The police said Reshi had recruited many youth into militancy like Towseef Khanday, Rafiq Dar and Adil Ahmed, all killed in encounters. Reshi was killed along with another local militant Sajad Ahmed Sofi. “Sofi was also recruited and trained by Reshi,” Mr. Singh said. The police said the bodies would be sent to Baramulla for burial. “The nearest family members of the killed terrorists would be allowed to participate in the last rites,” the police said. Mr. Singh said the “unfortunate” murder of advocate and TV analyst Babar Qadri was being investigated “at a very fast pace with good progress so far. The police would be able to crack the case very soon”. On the alleged staged encounter in south Kashmir’s Shopian on July 18, he said the investigation has been taken up and is in the final stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dangerous-let-militant-active-since-2015-killed-jk-police/article32720096.ece

29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Maradu fallout: SC asks State about illegal constructions||The Supreme Court on Monday gave the Kerala government four weeks to place on record a “concrete plan” to prevent illegal constructions in violation of the coastal zone regulations that protect the fragile and eco-sensitive areas of the State. It has been a year since the apex court, on September 23, 2019, ordered the State to submit the plan, which has to also detail the action intended against the violators. The direction was an aftermath of the court ordering the demolition of luxury apartments at Maradu. On September 23, the court had also directed the State to provide details of existing constructions in violation of coastal zone regulations. “Tell us exactly what steps have you taken following our orders on September 23, 2019,” a Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman, on Monday, asked the State. Contempt petition The court ordered the State to file its affidavit. It said the September 23 order of last year has to be followed in “letter and spirit”. The court order came on a contempt petition filed, alleging that the September 23 order was not being complied with. The State counsel informed the court a new State Chief Secretary, Vishwas Mehta, had been appointed and needed to be impleaded in the case. On September 23, a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra (now retired) had slammed then Chief Secretary Tom Jose for “patent breach of law” by the State in allowing illegal structures to come up along a fragile coastal zone. The court had even declared an affidavit filed by Mr. Jose as a reflection of the State’s intention to not have a concrete plan to prevent encroachments along the coastal zone. “We are shocked. Devastations are taking place in entire Kerala. In Kerala, this is a colossal loss. But see their (State government) attitude... Instead of protecting, you are permitting these structures. If this is your attitude, you are facing a tough court,” Justice Mishra had observed orally in the September 23 hearing last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maradu-fallout-sc-asks-state-about-illegal-constructions/article32720631.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,||‘No evidence against Sekar Reddy’||The Central Bureau of Investigation has found no evidence to prosecute industrialist and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) member J. Sekar alias Sekar Reddy and five others in the sensational cash seizure case of 2016. Almost four years after registering the case, the agency filed a closure report in the trial court, stating that “nothing incriminating surfaced” against the accused persons. The case relates to the seizure of Rs. 33.89 crore in the then newly printed Rs. 2,000 denomination currency from the business premises of Mr. Reddy and his partners in SRS Mining Company by Income Tax officials in December 2016. The CBI’s Anti-Corruption Branch registered three separate First Information Reports relating to the seizure against the trio. While the Madras High Court quashed two FIRs, the third has now been closed for want of evidence. The CBI had said in the FIR that the Reserve Bank of India sent huge quantities of new Rs. 2,000 denomination currency across the country to be distributed in lieu of the demonetised Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It alleged that Mr. Sekar Reddy and his business partners, with the help of unknown public servants of different banks, converted the unauthorised cash held by them in old currency notes, thereby depriving the public in enforcing their right. The CBI also accused officials in different banks of colluding with the accused persons for a consideration. However, after examining hundreds of persons, including bank officials, and perusing volumes of documents, the CBI found no evidence on record to launch a prosecutable case against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt to establish that they fraudulently converted the unauthorised cash held by them in old currency notes. S. Jawahar, XIth additional special judge for CBI cases, allowed the CBI’s plea, seeking closure of the case due to lack of sufficient evidence.  Not substantiated “As per the oral and documentary evidence, the allegations in the FIR to the effect that the accused persons have caused wrongful loss to the Government of India to the tune of approximately Rs. 247.13 crore and obtaining corresponding wrongful gain to themselves is not substantiated with prosecutable evidence. Hence, the final report has been filed for recommending closure of the case,” the agency said in its final investigation report. Mr. Reddy, who was on the Board of Trustees, TTD, was removed by the Andhra Pradesh government from the post soon after the CBI raids in December 2016. However, he was nominated again as TTD Board member and also president of Local Advisory Committee, Tamil Nadu, in September 2019.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-evidence-against-sekar-reddy/article32720237.ece

Pointing out that 150 terrorists had been nabbed in Punjab in recent months with huge caches of arms and ammunition, the Chief Minister said he will not let anyone disturb the State’s peaceful atmosphere, which the new legislations had the potential to do. AICC general secretary in charge of Punjab affairs, Harish Rawat, accompanying Captain Amarinder, announced a signature campaign beginning October 2 to collect 2 crore signatures of farmers against the laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-fight-new-farm-acts-legally-says-punjab-cm/article32720070.ece

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||AIADMK rift over CM face widens||According to sources, during the meeting, the Chief Minister shot down the idea of constituting an 11-member steering committee as sought by Mr. Panneerselvam, saying such an arrangement would not be suitable to the AIADMK. The setting up of a steering committee was one of the issues agreed upon in August 2017, when the two factions of the party had merged. Mr. Palaniswami recalled that Mr. Panneerselvam and 10 other MLAs had voted against his ministry in February 2017 during a trust motion, even though he [Mr Palaniswami] came from the ranks of the party. “Had we lost power then, what would have been the plight of our party,” the Chief Minister was quoted as having said. The Deputy Chief Minister replied that there was nothing personal in his opposition to the Chief Minister. He had voted against Mr. Palaniswami as the latter was the nominee of V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the party and now serving a four-year prison term. Pointing out that he was then running “Dharma Yudham,” a campaign against the domination of Sasikala and her family in the affairs of the AIADMK, Mr. Panneerselvam said his group had merged with the Palaniswami camp subsequent to the latter freeing itself from the clutches of the Sasikala family. Mr. Palaniswami responded that just as he was selected by Sasikala, Mr. Panneerselvam was too handpicked by her after the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in December 2016. While Mr. Panneerselvam said he did not hanker after any post, the Chief Minister explained how challenging his job had been. The issue of a chief ministerial candidate was raised by K.A. Sengottaiyan, School Education Minister and a long-standing face of the party in the Erode district in the western belt, immediately after the executive adopted 15 resolutions. The Minister had urged that the issue be thrashed out immediately. Mr. Sengottaiyan’s call was supported by several members, including Minister for Forests Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, veteran MP M. Thambi Durai, and Electricity Minister P. Thangamani. S. Semmalai, another veteran and considered a member of the Panneerselvam camp, pressed for the resolution of the issue and supported the demand for setting-up a steering committee. Backing the demand, party veteran and MGR confidante Panruti S. Ramachandran, who attended a party event after a considerable time, explained that such a steering committee would be akin to the polit bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Besides, this idea was approved by the party general council in September 2017, he said. However, another veteran J.C.D. Prabhakar chided his colleagues for focusing on the issue of a chief minister candidate and not discussing matters covered in the resolutions. The AIADMK’s minorities wing secretary A. Anwhar Raajhaa suggested that if the size of the steering committee came in the way of its formation, it could be increased to accommodate several sections of society. However, some ministers chose to play it safe and did not join the discussion. P.H. Manoj Pandian, former Member of Parliament, said the two leaders were like “two leaves” [which is the symbol] of the party, C.Ve. Shanmugam, Law Minister, felt that the two leaders should sort out the issue between themselves. As soon as the formal deliberations of the executive committee were over, Mr. Palaniswami, Mr. Panneerselvam, Mr. Munusamy, R. Vaithilingam, another deputy coordinator, and Mr. Thangamani had a brief closed-door meeting, after which Mr. Munusamy told the media that the party would name its CM nominee on October 7. Asked whether the steering committee issue would be addressed then, Mr. Munusamy replied, “You will find it out in the announcement.” He asserted that notwithstanding the day’s discussion, the party would remain “united.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aiadmk-rift-over-cm-face-widens/article32720068.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,||States told to strengthen security in communally sensitive districts||The Centre has alerted all States to strengthen security arrangements in communally hyper-sensitive and sensitive districts to prevent possible clashes post the judgment in the Babri Masjid demolition case by a special court for CBI cases in Lucknow on September 30. In an alert, the Union Government said that the judgment could have an impact on the law and order situation, as fringe elements on both sides might communalise the verdict. According to the alert, many Muslim organisations, unhappy with the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit case, were hoping that justice could still be done by convicting the accused in the demolition case. They might resort to protests if the verdict was not what they were hoping for, it said. The alert claimed that while some radical groups were looking for an opportunity to revive the anti-CAA/NRC/NPR agitations in the country, Hindu organisations were hopeful that the accused in the demolition case would be acquitted. Since the situation was under strain in some States owing to communal issues, State governments should intensify security in sensitive districts and keep a close watch on provocative content in the social media, the Centre said. In a separate development, the Ministry of Home Affairs has sanctioned three new branches of the National Investigation Agency, to be established in Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Imphal (Manipur) and Ranchi (Jharkhand). The MHA, in a note, said that the branches would help in ensuring quick response to any emergent situation in the concerned States by the premier anti-terror investigation agency. “It will strengthen NIA’s capability in investigation of terrorism-related cases and other nation’s security-related matters. It will also facilitate timely collection of crucial information and evidence related to such offences.” Presently, the NIA has nine branches, located in Guwahati, Mumbai, Jammu, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kochi, Lucknow, Raipur and Chandigarh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-told-to-strengthen-security-in-communally-sensitive-districts/article32720086.ece

The public transport services were affected in interior tribal pockets with the TSRTC suspending its night bus services to Charla and beyond the district boundary towards Wajedu and Venkatapuram Agency mandals in the adjoining districts as a safety precaution. In the wake of spurt in Maoist activities in the border areas of Charla in the recent past, the police have bolstered surveillance at the river crossing/ferry points at Peddipalli, Subbampeta and other remote riverside tribal hamlets in an effort to thwart attempts, if any, by the ultras to gain entry into the tribal heartland of Telangana from Chhattisgarh, police sources said. Combing operations Sources said that the area domination and combing operations besides the surprise vehicle checks are being conducted by the police in coordination with the CRPF along the porous routes in the border areas to ward off any trouble from the rebels.

Mishra, one of the defence lawyers, told The Hindu that they did not produce any witness in court as it was difficult to find one from among the group [that had gathered in Ayodhya].   The CBI judge has directed all 32 accused persons in the criminal conspiracy case to be present in court in person on Wednesday. Senior BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L.K Advani, his colleagues Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti and Kalyan Singh are among the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/babri-case-verdict-tomorrow/article32720087.ece

29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Koyambedu market sees high vehicle traffic on reopening day||The Koyambedu Wholesale Vegetable Market Complex received a huge influx of vehicles on Monday as it reopened after nearly five months. While traffic around the market was regulated, the area inside was congested as several heavy vehicles of both wholesalers and retailers shared the space till 8 a.m. The market complex was closed on May 5 after it became a COVID-19 hotspot. Wholesalers noted that the market received an additional 500 retailer vehicles, instead of the usual 2,000 vehicles, because it had opened after a holiday. Earlier this month, traders had declared that the Thirumazhisai market would remain closed on Sundays till they moved back to Koyambedu. With plenty of arrivals on Monday, wholesale prices of several vegetables dropped by as much as 20%. However, it may take a few more days for the rates to reflect in retail stores, said merchants. P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said the temporary market in Thirumazhisai used to receive around 300 trucks of vegetables. In contrast, about 400-450 vehicles came to Koyambedu on Monday. This would likely decrease in the coming days, he said. Stocked up Vegetables such as beans and broad beans, which were sold for Rs. 70 and Rs. 80 per kg, went for Rs. 60 and Rs. 40 per kg respectively on Monday. Many shops have also stocked truckloads of vegetables, which was not possible in Thirumazhisai, he said. Parking space was allotted to retailer vehicles in the yet to be reopened flowers and fruits market sections. They were allowed inside in batches. D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders’ Association of KWMC, said about 15,000 retailers had visited the market on Monday, and this number would drop from Tuesday as more restrictions would be in place. There were more vehicles in the market area as some retailers’ vehicles were allowed inside as early as Sunday night and heavy vehicles took time to unload produce. “We managed to finish sales by 10 a.m. The issues will be sorted out in one or two days,” Mr. Rajasekaran added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/koyambedu-market-sees-high-vehicle-traffic-on-reopening-day/article32720208.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work with unity, single-minded conviction: AIADMK cadre told||The ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)’s executive committee on Monday called upon its cadre to work with a “single minded conviction and unity” for the success of the party in the forthcoming election for the continuance of the “Puratchi Thalaivar MGR [former Chief Minister M. G Ramachandran] — Puratchi Thalaivi Amma [former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa]’s golden rule.” A resolution to this effect was adopted at the party’s executive committee meeting held in the headquarters here. Besides, 14 resolutions were passed by the panel. The text of the resolution was worded in such a manner that it had allusion to former interim general secretary V.K. Sasikala. It said: “Some individuals, for their selfish gains and progress of people belonging to them, may have used the party as an instrument, by remaining in and out of the organisation. But, the party, which has been like a millennial crop and a banyan tree that has provided support to all, has been in the safe hands of selfless workers.” Presided over by chairman of the party presidium E. Madhusudanan, the committee’s meeting was attended by Chief Minister and co-coordinator of the party Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister and coordinator O. Panneerselvam, K. P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam, both Members of Parliament and deputy coordinators, a host of Ministers, senior office-bearers and members, totalling 280. As many as 15 members were reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 and they did not make it to the meeting. Three others cited other health issues for their absence. While around 120 members sat on the first floor of the building housing the party headquarters, the remaining 160 were accommodated on the ground floor in the space surrounding the building, said a party source. Special arrangements were made with CCTV cameras for those who sat on the ground floor. With adherence to personal distancing, all the participants wore face masks and were provided with hand sanitisers, a release of the party stated. The party, through another resolution, reiterated its stand on the two-language formula and stated that it was against imposition of any language, while being not against any language. On the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to courses in medicine, it called upon the Central government to abolish the NEET and condemned the DMK and its allies for their “duplicity”. Several resolutions commended the State government generally, and the Chief Minister in particular, on a number of matters, including the way the COVID-19 crisis was being handled. In the first resolution, pertaining to COVID-19, the Deputy Chief Minister too, along with the CM, was lauded. Urging the Centre to re-constitute the committee on culture, the party wanted the GST arrears settled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/work-with-unity-single-minded-conviction-aiadmk-cadre-told/article32720235.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ready to challenge farm laws in court’||The DMK will, on behalf of the people of the State, challenge in court the three Bills on agriculture reforms that were passed in Parliament and received Presidential assent if the Tamil Nadu government fails to do so, party president M.K. Stalin said on Monday. Leading a State-wide protest by Opposition parties in Kancheepuram against the legislation, Mr. Stalin said both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami were wrecking the livelihoods of farmers. “The Prime Minister calls himself the son of a poor mother. But after the poor mother’s son became Prime Minister, a lot of Indians have become poor. He is creating new poor persons every day. In Tamil Nadu, the Chief Minister calls himself a farmer but farmers lost their livelihoods after he came to power. No poor person or farmer has received any benefit from this so-called farmer,” the DMK leader said. He said farmers across the country were protesting against the legislation. “In Punjab, Haryana, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan and Delhi, various farmers’ organisations and political parties have been protesting against the Acts,” he noted. Due to these laws, farmers would be driven out of their land. “That’s why we are opposing them,” Mr. Stalin said, adding that the party would oppose any law that is against the welfare of the people. “Are we alone opposing [the laws]? The whole country is opposing and fighting against these [laws],” he said. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri led the protest at Korukkupet in Chennai. The CPI(M) held a protest at Valluvar Kottam in the city. MDMK leader Vaiko led a demonstration on the outskirts of Chennai. The DMK and its alliance partners staged protests across Tamil Nadu, including in Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Erode, and nearly 150 areas in the eight districts of the Central region, over 50 places in Salem and 40 places in Namakkal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ready-to-challenge-farm-laws-in-court/article32720220.ece

29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Assembly Secretary, Privileges Committee challenge stay||The Assembly Secretary and the Committee of Privileges have preferred individual writ appeals before the Madras High Court, challenging an order passed by a single judge on September 24 staying the breach of privilege proceedings initiated against DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 other MLAs belonging to his party. The appellants said the Assembly Secretary alone was represented before the single judge when the new writ petitions filed by the 18 MLAs were listed for admission on September 23. But the judge mistook it as though the Committee of Privileges and its chairman Pollachi V. Jayaraman were also represented before the court, they said. Even on merits, the single judge’s order was erroneous, contrary to law, and had been passed on complete non-appreciation of facts, the appellants claimed. They said the judge ought not to have entertained the writ petitions which had challenged the show cause notices issued in accordance with the liberty granted by the first Division Bench of the court. The breach of privilege proceedings were initiated against the DMK MLAs for displaying gutkha (chewing tobacco) sachets in the Assembly on July 19, 2017. The first batch of show cause notices was issued to them by the Committee of Privileges in August 2017. Immediately, they moved the High Court and obtained interim relief, which was in operation for three years.  Foundational error After taking up the cases for final hearing last month, Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on August 25 held that the 2017 show cause notices suffered from the foundational error of presuming that the MLAs’ conduct was against the government ban on manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution and sale of gutkha. The Bench left it open to the Committee of Privileges, if it so chooses, to deliberate on the matter further and issue fresh show cause notices if it was still of the opinion that a breach of the privileges of the House had been committed by the MLAs. It also gave liberty to the MLAs to raise any objections available in law before the Committee. Despite such a clear finding by the Bench, the single judge had stayed the fresh show cause notices issued on September 7. “The learned judge had erred in rendering nugatory the conclusions of the honourable Division Bench. The learned judge, by entertaining the new writ petitions had, in fact, acted contrary to the orders of the Bench,” the appellants said. The Committee of Privileges also stated that its proceedings were actually a part of the proceedings of the House and hence, the courts should respect the doctrine of separation of powers of the legislature and the judiciary, and thereby refrain from interfering in its proceedings, especially at the preliminary stage of issuance of show cause notices.  Even on merits, the single judge’s order was erroneous, contrary to law, and had been passed on complete non-appreciation of factsAppellants||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/assembly-secretary-privileges-committee-challenge-stay/article32720218.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Armed Reserve constable killed by gang in Chengalpattu||A 29-year-old constable of the Armed Reserve Force was hacked to death by a gang of unidentified persons on the Pazhaya Seevaram-Kancheepuram Road in Chengalpattu. The police identified the victim as Inbarasan, a resident of Pazhaya Seevaram village, who worked as a constable in the Armed Reserve Force and served at the Puzhal Central Prison. The police said Inbarasan left his home on Monday morning after receiving an anonymous call. While the victim was on his bike, four persons waylaid him. Inbarasan attempted to flee but was attacked with knives. On receiving information, police personnel rushed the victim to the Government General Hospital in Chengalpattu, where he was declared brought dead. A senior police officer said, “Our initial investigation revealed that he was killed as a result of a family dispute. Investigation is on.” Police sources added that he had previous enmity with a former panchayat president Perumal and his son Rajan. Deputy Inspector General of Police B. Shamoondeshwari and Chengalpattu SP D. Kannan conducted a preliminary enquiry. Police presence in the locality was enhanced to avert further incidents. Functionary murdered In another case, six suspects were arrested by the Chengalpattu taluk police in connection with the murder of a 45-year-old AIADMK functionary on Sunday. Around noon on Sunday, a gang of six on three bikes intercepted Sekhar, the AIADMK functionary from Selvi Nagar in Chengalpattu, and hacked him to death before fleeing. Sekhar, previously a DMK functionary, joined the AIADMK a few months ago. He was part of the gang that murdered Vijayakumar, the panchayat president of Ponvilaintha Kalathur, in 2012. The gang murdered him in retaliation for Vijayakumar’s killing. “Suresh, one of the suspects, is the brother of Vijayakumar,” said a police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/armed-reserve-constable-killed-by-gang-in-chengalpattu/article32720205.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. challenges verdict against criminal defamation||The State government has preferred writ appeals before the Madras High Court against a single judge's much-acclaimed verdict that public servants and constitutional functionaries cannot be allowed to misuse the law of criminal defamation by using the State as a tool to initiate defamation proceedings against their adversaries. Justice Abdul Quddhose passed the judgment on May 21 this year while quashing a number of criminal defamation proceedings initiated against a host of Editors, publishers and journalists by the erstwhile Jayalalithaa government. “The State cannot use criminal defamation cases to throttle democracy,” he observed in his common judgment on the batch of cases. Now, preferring writ appeals against select respondents who included S. Selvam of DMK’s official organ Murasoli and Sunil Nair, former Resident Editor of The Times of India, Chennai, the government claimed that the judgment of the single judge was against law, weightage of evidence and probabilities of individual cases that were before him. When the writ appeals were listed for admission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Monday, a government advocate urged the court to adjourn the matter by a week so that he could engage the Advocate General to argue the matter. ‘Luxury litigation’ Not finding any necessity to grant a short adjournment or an urgent hearing in what he described as a “luxury litigation,” the Chief Justice directed the Registry to list the case after six weeks. In his 152-page judgment, Justice Quddhose had said the State must act like a parent of all its citizens when it came to invocation of the law of defamation. “It is normal for some parents to face vituperative insults from their children. Despite those insults, parents don’t disown their children quite easily.” “An individual or a public servant/constitutional functionary can be impulsive but not the State which will have to show utmost restraint and maturity in filing criminal defamation cases… The law cannot be misused by using the State as a tool to settle scores of a public servant/constitutional functionary over his/her adversary,” he had added. Taking objection to such observation, the State in its writ appeals said that an offence committed against the functionaries of a State was actually an offence committed against the State and hence, the government would be perfectly justified in launching prosecution against the offenders before a court of sessions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-challenges-verdict-against-criminal-defamation/article32720241.ece

29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AI tool will help fans predict results of limited-overs matches||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) have found a way for fans to analyse limited-overs cricket matches, like experts. The researchers have used ESPNcricinfo’s ball-by-ball data to develop a method for fans to analyse the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. The AI tool was developed in 2019 through a collaboration between IIT-Madras, ESPNcricinfo and Gyan Data, a company incubated at the institute. The collaboration led to the development of a tool that uses a set of metrics to assess performances of teams in limited-overs T20 and ODI matches. Statistical and machine-learning models are used to forecast the final score of an ongoing innings. Factors such as current run rate, number of overs, remaining wickets, and the quality and form of players are considered. ‘Luck index’ The analysts have included a “luck index” to quantify the impact of events, such as dropped catches and umpiring errors, on the final score and match result. Three metrics — smart runs, smart wickets and impact score — that affect the players’ performance and the opposition’s batting quality and bowling performance have also been used for the analysis. Superstats is a key ingredient of the 2020 plan, as it was in IPL 2019, according to S. Rajesh, stats editor at ESPNcricinfo. “Since it is a bouquet of offerings, these stats metrics will enhance all aspects of coverage prior to, during and after the game,” Mr. Rajesh said. Raghunathan Rengaswamy, dean of Global Engagement, who leads the team with Mahesh Panchagnula, dean, alumni and corporate relations, said: “These kinds of projects also reaffirm our faith in the universality of machine learning and data science techniques that we develop and its application potential in multiple fields.” Data-driven journalism ESPN India and South Asia vice-president Ramesh Kumar said the use of data-driven tools in sports had given them an edge in presenting content, “bringing various nuances of the game in the right context and providing the complete picture to the users”. Maheshwarran Karthikeyan, lead data scientist and a cricket enthusiast who worked on the project, said, “Thanks to the increasingly popular field of data science and ESPNcricinfo’s rich ball-by-ball data, it has been possible to develop complex data-driven algorithms that analyse a cricket match just like an expert.”  Thanks to the increasingly popular field of data science and ESPNcricinfo’s rich ball-by-ball data, it has been possible to develop complex data-driven algorithms to analyse a cricket match like an expert Maheshwarran Karthikeyan Lead data scientist||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ai-tool-will-help-fans-predict-results-of-limited-overs-matches/article32720225.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||SC/ST committee has not met since 2013, concedes govt.||The State government on Monday conceded before the Madras High Court that the State-Level High-Power Vigilance and Monitoring Committee, headed by the Chief Minister, for reviewing implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989, did not meet even once between June 25, 2013, and September 8 this year. In a counter affidavit filed before Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha, Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Secretary Otem Dai said the meetings could not be held due to “administrative reasons”. The judges, however, pointed out that it was mandatory for the committee to meet at least twice a year, as per statutory rules framed under the Act. They directed the government to comply with the rules, in letter and in spirit, at least in the future and make sure that the meetings were held every January and July. The direction was issued while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by N. Panneerselvam of Coimbatore, through his counsel S. Kumara Devan, seeking a direction for convening the meetings regularly. ‘Task carried out’ Filing a counter to the petition, Mr. Dai said that though the committee, headed by the Chief Minister, did not meet for nearly seven years, the task entrusted to it was successfully carried out by the Chief Secretary and other officials, through monthly and quarterly meetings. Hence, the review of cases of atrocities against the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes was in no way affected.

29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro reduces service frequency||Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL) has reduced the frequency of trains from five minutes to seven during peak hours (8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.). The frequency of one train every 10 minutes during non-peak hours remains unchanged. These changes came into effect on Monday. For the last three weeks, ever since Metro Rail was opened to the public after the lockdown relaxations came into place, commuters got a train every five minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes during non-peak hours. As the passenger turnout has been very low, the CMRL decided to reduce the frequency of trains. In the stretch between Washermenpet and the airport, there will be one train every seven minutes during peak hours and one every 10 minutes during non-peak hours respectively. From Chennai Central, direct trains will be run alternately to St. Thomas Mount and the airport. CMRL will continue with the present arrangement until there is a significant improvement in passenger turnout.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-reduces-service-frequency/article32720210.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||ECR residents form coalition, oppose stormwater drains||Residents in areas along East Coast Road (ECR) have formed a coalition to oppose the construction of a stormwater drain network and raised concerns on them becoming an obstacle for groundwater recharge. Members of associations in 30 residential colonies have joined the coalition to protest against the project from Kottivakkam to Panaiyur. Residents of Palavakkam said there were plans for the construction of stormwater drains in areas along the seaside, which have sandy soil acting as a natural filter for rainwater. Recharge wells The Greater Chennai Corporation could instead provide recharge wells on road corners to help groundwater recharge as residents depend on it for their needs, they said. Sushma Ereveles, a resident of Panaiyur, said “Roads are being dug up at Seashore Town just ahead of the northeast monsoon. Our area was not waterlogged even during the 2015 floods. The concrete structures will only block natural percolation of rainwater and reduce groundwater recharge. It may lead to draining of water into the sea. Several representations have been given to the Corporation and the German development bank KfW on the issue.” ‘Concerns unfounded’ Sources in the Corporation said the stormwater drain work along the ECR was being carried out as part of the Kovalam Basin works and it was funded by the German development bank KfW. It had been taken up after due study. Another official explained that the matter was sub judice since residents had gone to court. “If we do not have a proper drainage system, the ECR and many residential areas will suffer since there are no open plots to allow natural percolation. Around 80% of the rainwater runs onto the roads and stagnates since the groundwater table gets saturated during rains. Last year, we used 48 motors to pump out water from the ECR. We are not planning to just let the water run into the sea. The system will ensure percolation of groundwater,” the official explained.  If we do not have proper drainage system, ECR and many residential areas will suffer since there are no open plots to allow percolation Corporation Official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ecr-residents-form-coalition-oppose-stormwater-drains/article32720206.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Retain Anna varsity’s name, Balagurusamy to CM||Former Vice-Chancellor of Anna University E. Balagurusamy has appealed to the Chief Minister “not to change the name of the present Anna University” as it would result in the ‘mother university’ losing “not only its name but also its fame and reputation built over several decades.” Traces history Mr. Balagurusamy traced the history of the institution, pointing out that when in May 1794 the British set up a School of Survey Engineering, “it became the oldest engineering school in India and the first modern technical school established outside Europe” . Since it became a College of Engineering in 1858, it has been producing “hundreds of stalwarts in engineering and technology who have contributed immensely to the socio-economic development of our nation”, he said. The academician also pointed out that the university is among the two State-run universities that were chosen for the Institute of Eminence status. “Today Anna University is ranked within top 10 among all institutions, fourth among all universities and first among all technical universities in India. In the latest QS World Ranking, it has been placed among the top 150 young institutions in the world,” Dr. Balagurusamy wrote. Top class technical institution He added that the institution was established by the former Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran and later nurtured by another former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa “into a top class technical institution in the country”, he said. Moreover, changing the name could also be construed as a disrespect to both the former CMs “who were primarily responsible for the present status of Anna University”, Mr. Balagurusamy said. Sentiments of people The colleges were affiliated to the university only in 2002 and they may be affiliated to the new university which could be named as either ‘MGR Technical University’ or ‘Jayalalithaa Technical University’ as an honour to their contribution to the technical education in the State. “This would also satisfy the popular sentiments of the people of Tamil Nadu,” he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/balagurusamy-urges-cm-to-retain-anna-varsitys-name/article32720243.ece

The ongoing fight against COVID-19 notwithstanding, the civic body has engaged 3,500 workers, comprising clinical field assistants, sanitary inspectors, sanitary officers, entomologists and domestic breeding checkers, in the exercise. With the northeast monsoon imminent, the civic body is taking no chances. Unlike previous years, the Corporation has mapped various hotspots and hidden sources of mosquito breeding. A senior health official said vacant lands, open wells and overhead tanks had been enumerated in the city’s 200 divisions this year. He said staff were engaged in keeping watch on as many as 7,000 construction sites in all 15 zones to prevent stagnation of fresh water, which is one of the main sources of the dengue-causing Aedes aegypti mosquito. The official said the civic body, which was previously hampered by a shortage of machinery, had been strengthened with the addition of 46 modern vehicles which could carry out both fogging and spraying, 250 fogging machines, 1,000 battery-operated sprayers and 250 petrol-operated sprayers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vector-control-measures-against-dengue-started/article32720200.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Presence of EOs in many temples illegal’||The Madras High Court on Monday sought the response of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department to a public interest litigation petition which claimed that the presence of Executive Officers in as many as 60 popular temples in the State is illegal since they had not been appointed in accordance with law. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha ordered notice to the State Government after hearing senior counsel G. Rajagopalan representing the PIL petitioner, T.R. Ramesh, of Indic Collective Trust. The litigant claimed that information obtained by him under the Right to Information Act of 2005 proved that the presence of Executive Officers even in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, Kapaleeswarar Temple at Mylapore in Chennai and Subramaniaswamy temples in Tiruttani and Tiruchendur was clearly illegal. Mr. Ramesh pointed out that the Supreme Court had, in the Dr. Subramanian Swamy versus State of Tamil Nadu (2014), held that every order of appointment of an Executive Officer to a temple must disclose reasons for such appointment and that those appointments should be made only for a specific period and not for eternity. It was only after that judgment the State government notified the Conditions for Appointment of Executive Officers Rules of 2015 and gave retrospective effect to them, the petitioner said and contended that they could not have been given retrospective effect at all in the absence of an enabling provision in the HR&CE Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/presence-of-eos-in-many-temples-illegal/article32720246.ece

Palaniswami not to allow field trials of BT brinjal in Tamil Nadu, which is one of the eight States selected by the Centre for the exercise. “There is a fear among farmers that BT brinjal will pose a danger to traditional farmers and cause severe consequences in the farm sector. It is highly condemnable that the Centre is trying to impose genetically-modified crops on farmers,” he said in a statement. Recalling the decision taken by the erstwhile UPA government to ban BT brinjal, Mr. Stalin accused the BJP government of reversing the decision. “The Centre is conniving with multi-national companies to convert farmers into slaves.” Mr. Stalin said the decision not only exposed the Centre’s insensitiveness to farmers’ welfare but also its arrogant attitude that farmers did not even know about cultivation of brinjal. “The BJP government, which had already released the draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2020, has now introduced dangerous proposals in the farm sector,” he said. While urging the Centre to withdraw its permission to the field trials, Mr. Stalin said the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister also should not grant permission for the project. Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government had announced the minimum support price for paddy procurement after supporting three farm bills in the Parliament. “The State should announce Rs. 3,000 per quintal,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-allow-bt-brinjal-trial-stalin/article32720240.ece
29 September 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||NE monsoon may be below normal in southern parts of the State: IMD||The northeast monsoon this year may be below normal in the southern parts of Tamil Nadu. However, western and northern parts of the State are likely to have normal rainfall, according to the Meteorological Department. This was part of the climate outlook for the season (October-December) in South Asia, which was released during the 17th session of the the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum held online on Monday. The outlook was jointly prepared by experts of the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in nine countries and several regional and global experts from organisations, such as the World Meteorological Organisation. Citing the outlook, S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the southern region below Cuddalore is likely to have below normal rainfall during the upcoming monsoon. Weather models indicate that easterlies, which usher in the monsoon, may set in over the southern peninsula around October 14 or 15. Normally, the northeast monsoon sets in over the State around October 20. On average, the State receives around 44 cm of rainfall during this period. Noting that the forum discussed prevailing and emerging global climatic conditions to arrive at the statement, Mr. Balachandran said the global weather parameters — La Nina and Indian Ocean Dipole — were not favourable for monsoon rainfall this year. The prevailing weak La Nina and neutral IOD are likely to continue through the monsoon. Thunderstorms to continue On the thunderstorms experienced in some parts of the city on Monday, Mr. Balachandran said they were triggered by an upper air circulation at the lower level of the atmosphere and convective activity. Scattered rainfall over the State is likely to continue for two days and districts like Salem and Nilgiris may see heavy rain in one or two places. While areas such as T. Nagar and Palavakkam experienced light rain, the city weather stations did not record rainfall. As the southwest monsoon is retreating from some parts such as Rajasthan and Punjab, thunderstorm activity may continue. Chennai may experience thundershowers till Wednesday, officials said. Meanwhile, the Meteorological Department signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Institute of Ocean Technology to set up the city’s second weather radar at Pallikaranai on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/northeast-monsoon-may-be-below-normal-in-south-tn-says-imd/article32720202.ece

Balasubrahmanyam, on Monday rubbished rumours of MGM Healthcare not allowing his father’s remains to be taken due to a dispute regarding payment of hospital bills. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Charan said such reports were not true. “We were paying the hospital bills regularly and insurance too has covered a part of it. When I asked them if I had to pay anything after dad passed away, the chairman of the hospital told us not to worry about it and that we did not have to pay anything,” he said. He added, “There was no issue about the clearance of hospital bills.” Mr. Charan also said the hospital management had consulted the family throughout the late singer’s treatment. “All treatments given to dad and the statements issued by the hospital were done after consultation with myself and the family,” he said. Mr. Charan said he had spoken to the Health Secretary a few days before his dad’s demise. He also appealed to the media not to report such rumours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/charan-denies-mistreatment-rumour/article32720222.ece
29 September 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||No more home quarantine in Coimbatore||Residents of Coimbatore, who test COVID-19 positive but are asymptomatic, will no longer have the option of remaining at home in quarantine. They will have to compulsorily spend some time in COVID-19 Care Centre. Sources said, based on instructions from Collector K. Rajamani, the administration had decided to stop giving home quarantine as an option for asymptomatic persons. But the decision would not apply to the 950-plus COVID-19 positive asymptomatic persons, currently in home quarantine. The decision to do away with the home quarantine was taken after it came to the district administration’s knowledge that several asymptomatic persons, who were supposed to remain home, violated the safety norms. Their moving within or in and around the house or outside posed the risk of them spreading the infection to others and the manpower required to monitor such persons’ adherence to safety protocol was nearly becoming impossible, given the rise in positive cases, the sources explained. Henceforth, all asymptomatic persons would spend time in a nearby COVID-19 Care Centre for at least a week, after which the administration would lift swab samples for test. Only if they turned negative, would it let them out. After returning home, they would have to remain indoors for another week to complete the 14-day quarantine period, the sources added. The administration would allow home quarantine only for those who had the written approval of either the Collector or Corporation Commissioner, the sources added. In a COVID-19 related development, the district administration had asked all approved testing labs to calibrate their testing equipment to a standard to ensure that there was no variation in test results. Sources said Mr. Rajamani asked the lab managements to do so and directed the Joint Director, Public Health, to help them calibrate the equipment to the required standards, as per government norms. The administration was forced to do it because the test result declared by a lab was overturned by another and this led to members of public who had given samples getting agitated over the varied results. The Collector also asked the labs to make a distinction between samples of those persons from Coimbatore and other districts to ensure that other district samples were not added to Coimbatore’s tally. He also asked them to declare both positive and negative results the same day so that the administration had a clear picture of the infection spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-more-home-quarantine-in-coimbatore/article32720263.ece

His resignation comes more than a fortnight after Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit renominated him to the syndicate. Mr. Kanagasabapathi’s renomination became an issue as sections of the academic community took objection to him being a State-level office-bearer of a political party. That Mr. Kanagasabapathi participated in the syndicate meeting that granted delayed approval to a few colleges to start new courses did not help matters either. Mr. Kanagasabapathi‘s role in the syndicate meeting, coupled with the objections to his nomination, could have led to the resignation, sources in the academic community said.

Palanisamy to resolve the problems of fisher folk of both countries, Sri Lanka’s Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda said on Monday. Addressing a press conference in Colombo, along with two of his ministerial colleagues, Mr. Devananda — who represents Jaffna district in Parliament — said both India and Sri Lanka were committed to addressing the long-drawn Palk Bay Fisheries conflict. Sri Lanka’s northern fishermen have raised concerns over Indian fishermen — originating from Tamil Nadu — trespassing into their waters and using destructive fishing methods, such as bottom trawling which is banned in Sri Lanka. The issue was discussed in the recent virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa. “As the leaders talked about ways to resolve this problem, a possible discussion with Tamil Nadu was considered,” Mr. Devananda, who was present at the virtual summit, said. Over the years, there have been several bilateral meetings between the governments and fishermen leaders from both countries, but a mutually agreeable solution has been elusive. However, some Jaffna-based fishermen have noticed a reduction in the number of Indian trawlers entering Sri Lankan waters in the last couple of years after Sri Lanka introduced tougher laws and huge fines. The Sri Lankan Navy has so far arrested 34 Indian fishermen this year, compared to 210 arrested last year. But some fishermen have noted that the Navy might have avoided arresting poaching fishermen from India fearing they could be carrying the coronavirus, according to northern fishermen leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ready-to-hold-talks-with-tamil-nadu-cm-says-sri-lankan-fisheries-minister/article32720238.ece

The petitioner, Vinod Kumar, son of Ellamal of Sanachandiram here, was employed in a private online trading company in Hosur for the last three years. His family alleged that Vinod Kumar had roped in two other neighbours with the trading company. The company had closed down during COVID-19 lockdown. Following this, Vinod Kumar’s friends forced him to settle the outstanding dues. Their house was allegedly ransacked and robbed. Vinod Kumar, his parents and brother arrived at the Collectorate, doused themselves with kerosene and threatened to immolate themselves.

29 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporates will decide prices of commodities: MP||Opposition parties staged demonstrations in various places across the southern districts on Monday against the farm Acts. Leaders and cadre of opposition parties, including Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC), participated in the protests that were held at six locations in Madurai and 29 locations in rural areas of the district. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan, who took part in the protest at Jeeva Nagar in Jaihindpuram, said the bills had paved way for corporates to exploit farmers and decide the prices of essential food commodities. “None of the Acts have any provisions which will allow the farmers to fight the companies that violate the contract,” he said. The Centre cannot pass them as agriculture falls under State list. The bills were passed in violation of parliamentary rules, he added. The protesters demanded the government to withdraw the farm Acts “that are against the interests of farmers.” Tirunelveli There were demonstrations at 30 places in Tirunelveli district. In Jothipuram ground near Palayamkottai bus stand, DMK’s Tirunelveli city district secretary Abdul Wahab led the demonstration. In Tenkasi district, the DMK and its allies organised demonstrations in more than 30 places. In Thoothukudi, there were demonstrations at 30 places. Tiruchendur MLA and DMK’s Similar agitations were staged in more than 20 places in Kanniyakumari district. Nagercoil MLA Ramanathapuram Amendment to Essential Commodities Act, 1955, will lead to hoarding of foodgrains by corporates and lead to artificial demand forcing consumers to pay more for basic foodgrains, said Ramanathapuram MP K. Navas Kani. Addressing the all-party protest in Ramanathapuram, he said that the amendment gave corporates the right to stock unlimited quantity of foodgrains. “They will buy foodgrains from farmers at a cheaper rate and stock them in huge quantities and create an artificial demand. The consumers would be forced to buy foodgrains at an exorbitant cost,” he warned. He wondered how would a small farmer in Paramakudi be able to sell his small quantity of foodgrains to the farthest corner of the country as boasted by the Centre. Contract farming will slowly make the farm lands infertile and eventually render them useless.  Dindigul  Athoor MLA and DMK functionary I. Periyasamy, in a protest staged at M. Panchampatti in Dindigul district, warned people not to take these Acts lightly. “In future, similar bills will be introduced to privatise Tamil Nadu Electricity Board as Adani Group is involved in power sector too. In future, direct procurement centres would not function, he said. Virudhunagar Over 1,700 cadre took part in protests held in 16 places in Virudhunagar district. In Sivaganga district, MLA KR. Periyakaruppan took part in the protest held at Tirupattur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporates-will-decide-prices-of-commodities-mp/article32720676.ece
29 September 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||COVID-19 likely to trigger heart complications, say cardiologists||“COVID-19 may spark cardiac trouble in multiple ways. It is an infectious pulmonary illness that causes stress on the heart in both healthy people and those with pre-existing heart disease,” said R. Sivakumar, Senior Consultant, Cardiology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre. Speaking to the press ahead of World Heart Day, the doctor said people may experience heart damage that mimics heart attack even if their arteries do not have blockages. “This can occur when the heart muscle is starved of oxygen, which in the case of COVID-19, may be triggered by a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand,” he said. A team of doctors from the hospital came together to discuss various precautions to be taken by patients with cardiovascular diseases. Senior Consultant M. Sampath Kumar said most COVID-19 positive patients recovered without any problem but a small number experience severe, exaggerated inflammation through the body known as a cytokine storm. “It affects the entire cardiovascular system at an advanced stage of the illness, leading to widespread blood clotting, organ failure or damage to the heart. Drug-related heart damage during COVID-19 treatment is also a concern. In particular, the use of antiviral drugs should be monitored,” he said. Common features Consultant cardiologist P. Jeyapandian said inflammation of the vascular system and injury to the heart appear to be common features of COVID-19, occurring in 20% to 30% of patients and contributing to 40% of deaths. Senior Consultant N. Ganesan said 355 patients were admitted with heart ailments in the last three months of the lockdown, compared to 820 cases during the corresponding period last year. “Our data concurs with European and American heart surveys, both of which have shown a 50-60% reduction in cases of acute heart attack in their countries,” he said. Commenting on a drop in the number of acute heart attack cases, Senior Consultant S. Selvamani said there could be a number of reasons. “Less stress due to staying at home, reduced air pollution, people not seeking hospital care for fear of the infection and absence of transport facility. However, there has also been a parallel increase in out-of-hospital sudden deaths during the lockdown, as patients delay seeking care after suffering a heart attack,” he said. The doctors said patients with cardiovascular diseases must practise social distancing, wear face masks and wash hands regularly. They must take their medication, monitor their blood pressure in case of hypertension or heart failure and take advantage of telemedicine.  As drug-related heart damage during treatment is also a concern, use of antiviral drugs should be monitored M.

If the dog is not vaccinated, both the owner and the dog are at risk. Since it is life-threatening, it is better that the vaccination is administered,” he said. While the first injection can be provided on the 100th day after the dog's birth, booster shots must be given once a year. “We will hold similar campaigns every year.

In this component, which is an addition to the existing four packages, the Corporation plans to construct a new water distribution system in 57 wards. A Corporation official said they received a positive reply for the approval of the fifth component during a recent meeting with ADB officials. “The ADB is appraising this component and we are waiting for their formal approval,” said City Engineer S. Arasu. The project will bring drinking water directly from Mullaperiyar dam to Madurai city. No more shortage  Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said there will be no drinking water shortage once the project is completed. “The city will receive an additional 125 million litres (mld) of drinking water,” he said. The Corporation supplies around 150 MLD of drinking water to the city through Vaigai Pipeline 1 and Pipeline 2, Cauvery Integrated Drinking Water Scheme and from riverbed sources. The Corporation provides only around 105 litres per capita per day (lpcd). But, according to the Bureau of Indian Standards IS: 1172-1193, a minimum water supply of 135 lpcd must be supplied to residents. “This shortage can be covered after the completion of the project,” said Mr. Visakan.

In the first component, a 96-km-long pipeline will be laid to transport water from Lower Camp to Pannaipatti. Construction of a water treatment plant with a capacity of 125 MLD at Pannaipatti is the second component. In the third component, a 54-km-long pipeline will be laid from the water treatment plant at Pannaipatti to Madurai city. Thirty-six overhead tanks will also be constructed under this component. The establishment of a new water distribution system in the 28 wards that were annexed to the Corporation in 2011, is the fourth phase. Work orders were issued for the first and third component in May. The second component was approved much earlier and construction of a water treatment plant is under way. “For the fourth component, we are waiting for the no objection certificate (NOC) from the ADB,” said a Corporation official. New drinking water pipelines are being constructed in 15 wards around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple through a separate project under Smart Cities Mission programe at an estimated cost of around Rs. 80.79 crore. “So, the fifth component was proposed under the Mullaperiyar drinking water project, so that new pipelines can be laid in the remaining 57 wards in the city. This new system will ensure that drinking water is provided round-the-clock to the residents,” said the Commissioner.

When an armed gang unleashed a murderous attack on two houses in Marukaalkurichi near Nanguneri on Saturday last with country-made and petrol bombs, two women – Shanmugathaai and Shanthi – were brutally murdered on the spot. Subsequently, the Nanguneri police registered a case against 12 persons and deployed police personnel in the village after Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan visited the hamlet. The forensic experts, who had scanned the scene of crime immediately after the murder, they recovered a couple of unexploded country-made bombs and a machete. Anticipating further attacks, Mr. Manivannan deployed armed policemen in front of the houses. On Monday, the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad members visited Marukaalkurichi again following information about an unexploded country bomb lying on the terrace of a house of one Sudalaikannu. The experts retrieved the improvised explosive and defused it. Police suspect that a couple of assailants might have camped on the terrace of the house to unleash the attack.

29 September 2020||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Probe on into alleged irregularities in PMAY||The district administration has launched an inquiry into complaints of alleged irregularities in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) in Pongalur Block, officials said on Monday. In a petition submitted to District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan, Pongalur Block committee secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) S. Sivasamy claimed that though 14 beneficiaries from Pongalur Block received Rs. 1.2 lakh in their respective bank accounts for construction of pucca houses under the scheme, no work has started. The beneficiaries received the money in 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. The petition accused officials of complicity in the irregularities.

29 September 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Native flora planted at housing unit in Udhagamandalam||Grasses, shrubs and trees native to the Nilgiris were planted at the Gandhi Nagar housing unit in Udhagamandalam on Monday. The initiative to restore native flora to the grassland-wetland area where the housing unit stands, will involve the planting of over 1,000 native grasses belonging to the genera Andropogon , Chrysopogon and Themeda . “Hardy native shrubs belonging to the genera Crotalaria and Osbeckia , four varieties of Strobilantes , as well as 30 Shola trees will be planted,” said Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist and the lead conservation gardener of ‘Upstream Ecology,’ which is providing the expertise as well as supplying the grasses and other flora which are being introduced at the restoration site. The site, measuring almost an acre, is currently populated by exotic Pennisetum clandestinum (Kikiyu) grass and also by Cestrum plants, which had to be removed from the site prior to the planting of the native flora. The inauguration of the native flora restoration project was attended by the Nilgiris District Collector, J. Innocent Divya, Field Director of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, K.K.Kaushal, District Forest Officer (Nilgiris Division), D. Guruswamy and N. Ram, Director of The Hindu Publishing Group (THG). “There is a fine balance between development and ensuring the protection of the environment. I am very happy to see that this area, which is in the middle of the town, is being restored,” Mr Ram said. The Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya commended the initiative shown by local residents in establishing the ecological park, which, she said, would serve to highlight the unique biodiversity of the Nilgiris. M.N. Sagayaraja, president of the Gandhi Nagar Housing Unit Residents’ Welfare Association, thanked the district administration as well as Mr. Ram for their assistance in the project. “We are all extremely grateful for all the support from Mr. Ram, who sponsored the planting of the native species as well as the district administration, who have funded the fencing and associated infrastructure to ensure that the site is protected,” said Mr. Sagayaraja, who called on the residents of the Nilgiris to grow native trees and grasses in their backyards. “Many of the Nilgiris’ endemic plants and grasses are all highly endangered. I hope people see this initiative and get inspired to grow native plants inside their own homes,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/native-flora-planted-at-housing-unit-in-udhagamandalam/article32720259.ece

They have petitioned Collector R. Kannan seeking security so that they can go back to Ulakkudi and ensure their livelihood there. According to the 60-year-old petitioner, M. Panchavarnam, after her husband Mari’s death four years back, her son-in-law, Raja, has been running a saloon. Raja, who had returned from abroad, had started to serve the Scheduled Caste people too. “We have to meet our rising expenses and hence my husband cut the hair of SC people also which was objected to by the caste Hindus for long,” Raja’s wife, Saraswathi (35) said. After Panchavarnam’s nephew eloped with a caste Hindu girl, the villagers passed a diktat and the family was not allowed to fetch water from the public tap and could not buy provisions in the local shop, the petition said. “When we decided to leave the house and my daughter went to a local shop to buy a lock, they even refused to give the lock. Now, our house has been left unlocked,” she said. The petitioner also blamed Ulakkudi panchayat president Rajammal and her husband Thennarasu, who is a Village Administrative Officer, among others for ostracising them. The Collector has promised to look into the issue and directed the police to provide them security, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hairdressers-family-complains-of-ostracism/article32720677.ece

The CBI had filed the chargesheet before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Madurai, on September 25, within 90 days of the arrests made in the case. A copy of the chargesheet will be submitted to the court, she said. The policemen Murugan, Muthuraj and Thomas Francis were filing their second bail petitions before the High Court.

According to official statistics, the number of fresh cases has been on the rise over the past week in the district, which recorded 155 cases last Tuesday. The daily tally went up to 186 and 190 on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, 150 more persons tested positive. On Saturday, it was 179 and 190 on Sunday.

Multiple cases have been recorded in Nanjikottai, Krishnapuram, Vilar, Annai Agraharam, Kumbakonam and peripheries of Thanjavur and Kumbakonam. “It is observed that there has been increase in fresh cases due to impact of lifting lockdown restrictions. Resumption of public transport, reopening of shopping complexes, returning of 100% employees to work places and crowded markets have been contributing factors to the rise in cases,” Mr. Rao told The Hindu . Strict implementation of social distancing norms and imposition of fine on those failing to wear face masks are among the key elements in controlling the spread of virus. Circle-level flying squads have been formed to make people to adhere to social distancing norms and wearing masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flying-squads-to-impose-penalty/article32720706.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru contributes 4.5% of active cases of COVID-19 in the country||With the second highest number of active cases in the country after Pune, Bengaluru contributes over 4.5% of India’s 9,60,969 active cases (as of September 26). Among the mega cities – Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Chennai – where the total active case load shot up from 93,404 on August 29 to 1,21,341 on September 26, Bengaluru accounts for 36%, followed by Mumbai and Delhi (24% each), Chennai (9%) and Ahmedabad and Kolkata (4% each). Bengaluru (active cases 37,315 on August 29) saw the highest growth in case load in September, adding 6,063 active cases in four weeks, taking the number to 43,378 as on September 26. From 34,224 active cases on August 22, cases jumped to 37,315 on August 29, which amounts to a 9% rise in the seven-day moving growth rate (MGR). Subsequently, on September 5, the number of cases further rose to 41,479 (11.2% MGR). In the week ending on September 12, the number of active cases came down marginally to 40,929 (-1.3% MGR) only to rise to 41,434 (1.2%) on September 19. As on September 26, the number of active cases is 43,378 (4.7%). According to an analysis by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Medical Association and Proxima, a management consulting firm, among the mega cities, only Kolkata saw cases declining in the last one month. According to epidemiologists, an increase in MGR will lead to a decrease in the number of days taken to double COVID-19 cases. A decrease in MGR will increase the doubling period, indicating that the infection is spreading at a slower pace. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad attributed the rise in the number of cases in Bengaluru to increased testing. “From around 4,000 tests per day earlier, we are now conducting an average of 25,000 per day. By next week, we are planning to increase the number of tests to around 40,000 per day. What is important is that the test positivity rate (TPR) and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has almost remained the same since August,” he said. Mysore Sanjeev, convenor of Jeevan Raksha, said an increase in active cases indicates that the containment management strategy is not effective enough to control the spread of the virus. “This also reflects that the recently infected are needing more time to recover. This will further increase the burden on the healthcare infrastructure. One of the serious aspects of an increase in active cases is that mortality will also increase,” he said. Since August 29, Bengaluru has witnessed 910 deaths, which is the second highest among the six mega cities behind Mumbai (1,154 deaths).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-contributes-45-of-active-cases-of-covid-19-in-the-country/article32720169.ece
29 September 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Ministerial expansion back on table as CM decides to visit Delhi||Ministerial expansion has come to the forefront again with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday stating that he would visit Delhi in two or three days to meet the party central leaders. Though Mr. Yediyurappa had gone to Delhi just before the commencement of the recently-concluded legislature session to consult over ministerial expansion, he could not secure an early nod from the high command. According to sources in the party, the central leaders were unable to spend much time with Mr. Yediyurappa then. Also, there were not many instances of the ministry being expanded just before the legislature session. Mounting pressure Now, after the completion of the session, pressure from ministerial aspirants is said to be mounting again on the Chief Minister. A leader close to Mr. Yediyurappa was of the view that the expansion exercise may be completed in the next 10 to 14 days. Presently, there are six vacant ministerial berths. However, it will touch seven as Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi is likely to quit the ministerial post in the wake of the party elevating him as national general secretary. Sources said it was question of time before he quits the ministry as his new role requires full time attention. While clarity on expansion and its nature is expected to emerge only after the Delhi meeting, the present indication is that Mr. Yediyurappa may opt for filling five ministerial posts and retain the remaining two as a strategy to douse heartburns among disappointed aspirants. The names of R. Shankar and N. Nagaraju (MTB), MLCs, who migrated from the Congress to help the BJP form its government, and C.P. Yogeshwar, MLC, who is said to have played a prominent role in wooing MLAs from the rival parties, are being heard as probables. Umesh Katti and Arvind Limbavali, senior MLAs, are also said to be strong probables. Though there is speculation about dropping some Ministers, sources in the party said it is unlikely.  Double-edged sword Sources said that it will be a tight ropewalk for Mr. Yediyurappa as the expansion is turning out to be a double-edged sword. While party old-timers are upset over “newcomers” cornering a large number of berths, the proposed expansion would add to it as a few more newcomers are bound to be inducted. ‘But the Chief Minister cannot afford to delay expansion as pressure is building on him, sources noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministerial-expansion-back-on-table-as-cm-decides-to-visit-delhi/article32720176.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Reopening of colleges further delayed||The reopening of colleges for the 2020-21 academic year has been delayed further following directions from the University Grants Commission. The State government had announced that physical contact classes will commence on October 1 and online classes will commence on September 1 for the 2020-21 academic year. However, the UGC has said that 1st semester classes can begin on November 1. Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwathanarayan said that the re-opening of colleges will be delayed further following the UGC guidelines and also keeping in mind the rise in COVID-19 cases in the State. He said that a decision on reopening of colleges would be taken soon, and added that classes would not commence from October 1. H.M. Sithara, Bengaluru district president, All India Democratic Students’ Organisation, welcomed the decision and said that offline classes should not commence until the number of COVID-19 cases reduce. Principals of colleges and officials of universities pointed out that re-opening of colleges even from November 1 would be a challenge with the rise in number of cases in the State. “Irrespective of whatever precautionary measures we take, nothing will be sufficient. It is very difficult to expect students to maintain physical distance in a class,” said the Vice Chancellor of a State-run university. The UGC has also said that all universities and colleges will have to follow directions from the Union and State governments, the Ministry of Education and University Grants Commission from time to time. Universities need to follow a six-day week for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years to compensate for the loss of academic days. They have also been told to curtail breaks and vacations so that students are awarded their degree on time. S. Japhet, V-C, Bengaluru Central University, said that online classes for students from intermediate semesters had begun from September 1. However, he said that many students were finding it difficult to access gadgets and also facing Internet connectivity problems. But Amaresh Kadagada, State president, Students’ Federation of India, said that many students were facing trouble with online classes. “We hope that the government will commence classes soon in the interest of students from rural areas. However, they need to ensure that all precautionary measures are taken,” he said.  We hope that the government will commence classes soon in the interest of students from rural areas.

The test is a gateway to admissions into 22 National Law Universities across the country. In Karnataka, students appeared for the test at 18 centres across the State. The final results will be announced on October 5. The number of candidates who attended the exam was affected by the pandemic and bandhs in several States including Karnataka. Students had to write the test amidst a slew of safety measures. A few students with symptoms of COVID-19 wrote the test in isolation labs at these centres. Moderately difficult Students who appeared for the test said it was of moderate difficulty, and that the paper was lengthy. “I was unable to complete the test as there were several passage-type questions. There were also several questions based on COVID-19,” a candidate said. The numbers of test centres was increased to 300 this year. A press release issued by the Consortium of National Law Universities stated that 100% attendance was recorded at four centres and none of the centre observers appointed reported technical glitches. Fee payment The consortium has said that instead of collecting the fees for the entire year, only 50% should be paid at the time of admission in different universities, owing to the pandemic. Although it decided to provide a test centre at Kavaratti (Lakshadweep) for one candidate, the candidate did not appear for the test. The release also states that they had six centres where there were 10 or less than ten candidates and as many as 10 centres had 11 to 20 candidates.  Number of questions The number of questions for CLAT UG was reduced from 200 to 150. A grievance committee under the chairmanship of Justice Rajendra Babu, former Chief Justice of India, has been set up to look into the grievances. NLAT 2020 Several candidates who had appeared for the National Law Aptitude Test 2020 earlier this month for admissions into NLSIU Bengaluru, had to once again appear for CLAT on Monday. This was following the Supreme Court order that quashed NLAT 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/78-of-registered-candidates-show-up-to-write-clat/article32720179.ece
29 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Literary critic G.S. Amur no more||Noted literary critic G.S. Amur, 95, passed away in his sleep at his residence in Bengaluru on Monday morning. He was suffering from age-related illness and was not keeping well for sometime now. It was just over a week ago that Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) announced this year’s Nrupatunga award for lifetime’s work in literary criticism to G.S. Amur. He passed away before receiving the award. Amur was born in Bommanahalli in today’s Haveri district in 1925 and went on to become an English professor and had a long career in various universities of Karnataka and Maharashtra. A noted critic of English literature, he has extensively written about the works of R.K. Narayan and Raja Rao, both from the State. However, in the latter part of his career he took to writing in Kannada about Kannada literature and is regarded as one of the finest literary critics of the language. “He was respected by one and all, because he never fell prey to either camps or even literary movements. He wrote criticism on all kinds of literature without any favour and was a dispassionate critic that gave his opinion gravitas in the Kannada literary world,” remembers another writer and critic K.

29 September 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||SOP framed for school reopening||Once schools reopen, classes will have to be run in shift systems if the strength of the school is high, and students need to maintain a minimum distance while sitting in the classroom. These norms are part of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) chalked out by the Department of School Education Research and Training (DSERT) for reopening schools in Karnataka. The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is, however, yet to take a call on when schools will reopen for the 2020-21 academic year. Schools have been closed since March on account of COVID-19. An official said instructions have been given for different stakeholders to follow. “We have suggested a shift system if the strength of the school is high. Schools that have low student strength can continue as they did previously, but will have to follow social distancing norms,” an official said. The official also added that all schools would have to be sanitised every day and restrictions have to be placed on allowing students to play sports on campus. In the coming week, department officials will convene a meeting with different stakeholders, including teachers, school management representatives, parents, and School Development and Monitoring Committee members. Although the Centre had allowed States to reopen schools from September 21 and allow students to come to school to get their doubts clarified, the State government had said it would not be allowed as the number of COVID-19 cases was on the rise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sop-framed-for-school-reopening/article32720172.ece

Buses operated by North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation remained in depots and bus stands as activists associated with different organisations took to the streets and blocked major roads.

Leaders of Indian National Congress also participated in the agitations in some places. Holding banners and placards and raising slogans against the Union and State governments, the activists took out a protest march from the APMC market yard to Jagat Circle where they held a public meeting. “The recent farm bills are the continuation of the BJP’s anti-farmer and pro-corporate policies that it has been implementing ever since it assumed power. These policies would impoverish the farming community by deepening the agrarian crisis. The very purpose of the bills is to help a few corporate giants to make more profit at the cost of the vast majority of farmers. We will not rest till the governments step back from implementing these policies,” Maruti Manpade, a leader of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha, told the public meeting in Kalaburagi. The bandh was almost complete at Hosapete in Ballari district as a conglomeration of 22 organisations representing different sections, including farmers, Dalits, pro-Kannada and Left wing, called for the bandh. Most of the business activities came to a standstill as people voluntarily downed shutters of their establishments. The agitating activists targeted Forest Minister B.S. Anand Singh and Health Minister B. Sriramulu, who hail from the district, for not raising their voices against the anti-farmer policies of the State government. In Koppal, protesting activists burnt some tyres outside Koppal Bus Stand to register their opposition to what they said anti-farmer bills. The protesters on motorcycles were found convincing the shopkeepers to close their business establishments for the day.

A team from KSCPCR led by its president Antony Sebastian visited the site on Saturday and issued notices to officials of various departments for their alleged negligence that led to the tragedy. Children of migrant labourers belonging to the Lambani community, who had been brought from Ballari to work in sugarcane fields here, had died by drowning on September 22. The police had booked a case after the bodies of Kaveri, 2, Rohit, 3, and Sanjay, 4, were found floating in the pond behind the migrant labourers’ settlement and assured the parents that the sugar factory management would provide them Rs. 1 lakh compensation each, but the commission representatives, during their visit on Saturday, found that the migrant labourers were not only denied basic amenities, but also exposed to dangerous living conditions with live wires around their tents. Also, several children of the labourers were allegedly found engaged in labour in the field. Notices have been issued to the Deputy Tahsildar of Bannur, Block Education Officer, Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC), besides officials from the Labour and Revenue Department for the glaring lapses, commission member Parashurama M.L. said .

29 September 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Brother of slain youth disputes encounter claim||The ballistics report of the State Forensic Science Laboratory regarding the death of C.P. Jaleel, a suspected Maoist, has disproven the encounter claim of the police, his family claimed on Monday. Jaleel, 26, was shot dead in a police encounter at a resort at Vythiri in Wayanad on March 6 last year. The police had claimed that Thunderbolt commandos fired at him while he was extorting money from the resort staff. ‘Fake encounter’ According to the ballistics report, submitted to the district and sessions court here, all cartridges used for firing were from service rifles and not from a smooth-bore breech loading gun allegedly found on the body of Jaleel, C.P. Rasheed, Jaleel’s brother told The Hindu . The report says that signs of firing could not be detected in the gun barrel. The police had claimed that commandos killed him in retaliatory fire but the findings pointed to a fake encounter, he said. ‘No gunshot residue’ Gunshot residue could not be detected in material objects such as the swabs collected from Jaleel’s hands, he said. If Jaleel had shot first as per the police report, the residue must be in his hands, Mr. Rasheed said. Video clip As per a police report, the Station House officer of the Vythiri police station and six commandos had participated in the operation but 14 rifles were produced for the ballistics test. Circumstantial evidence showed that a firefight had never occurred and his brother was shot at sight. A video clip of the encounter submitted by the police in the district court indicated that the police had shot Jaleel dead while he was trying to escape, he added. The police were yet to conduct a probe in this regard, he said. According to a recent Supreme Court decree, details of the magisterial inquiry into a fake encounter should be given to the Chief Magistrate Court or District Court but it had not been done in this case, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brother-of-slain-youth-disputes-encounter-claim/article32720660.ece
29 September 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||‘Water Metro to adhere to Dec. deadline’||The first ferry of Kochi’s Water Metro project will roll out in December as scheduled and will begin operating in January from the city to Kakkanad after a month-long trial, sources in Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) have said. KMRL Managing Director Alkesh Kumar Sharma said the contract with Cochin Shipyard was going ahead as scheduled. The resetting of the deadline from November to December was necessitated on account of the pandemic. There would be no price escalation either since the contract was to design and build twenty-three 100-seater ferries, he said. “The progress of construction is being continuously monitored, while I convene weekly meetings to take stock of the progress of works,” said Mr. Sharma. The contract amount remained at Rs. 175 crore, despite delay caused by the pandemic, sources in the agency said. The price of each 100-seater ferry as per the Water Metro’s detailed project report was estimated to be Rs. 4.50 crore. This has increased to Rs. 7.60 crore since the technical and safety specifications have been rewritten, to keep up with the times. The hull material was changed from steel to aluminium and a decision was taken to have electric, battery-driven ferries. Similarly, an advanced air conditioning system has been chosen. Moreover, safety and security aspects have been rewritten, based on inputs from experts and KfW, the German agency which is providing soft loan. Night navigation facilities are another addition. “The cost increased due to our decision to further customise the boats,” they added. Spare parts Responding to concerns that dependence on components from abroad, especially Europe, might cause delay in sourcing spare parts, they said that Water Metro would have a sound inventory management system, just like Kochi Metro. Adequate quantity of spares would be stocked, foreseeing possible delay in delivering spares, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-metro-to-adhere-to-dec-deadline/article32720633.ece
29 September 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Traffic plan ready for bypass junction||The City Traffic Police have readied a traffic regulation plan to streamline traffic flow and ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians when the Palarivattom flyover is reconstructed during the next eight months. This follows a joint inspection of roads and allied infrastructure in the area, conducted on Monday by a team comprising officials of the traffic police, DMRC and ULCCS - stakeholders engaged in flyover reconstruction, and NHAI which owns the Edappally-Aroor NH bypass. “DMRC, ULCCS and NHAI have agreed to contribute their mite to fill potholes on service roads of the NH bypass, and to ready infrastructure within a week to divert traffic. A trial run will be held for another week, following which the plan will be finalised,” said G. Poonguzhali, DCP (Traffic, Law and Order), who was among those who inspected roads that lead to the flyover. Traffic can proceed as usual during this week, since only the tarred layer of the flyover is being dismantled now. The portion beneath the central beams of the flyover will be barricaded in a week, since work to dismantle the concrete portions of the flyover will follow suit. This would necessitate diversion of vehicles through U-turns that will be created on either side of the flyover on the NH bypass. Timer-based signal systems and high-mast lights will be installed at these two U-turns by agencies that have taken up the flyover work, to regulate traffic and to increase visibility in order to prevent accidents. On its part, the NHAI has agreed to repair and resurface potholed parts of service roads. All these works would be completed within a week, she said. Put short, the flyover will be something like a round about, around which vehicles will flow in different directions. Light vehicles coming from Vyttila and proceeding to Kakkanad could take diversion before reaching the Palarivattom NH bypass junction and take byroads that lead to Kakkanad. Similarly, light vehicles coming from Edappally could use Pipeline Road and other alternative roads to skip the bypass Junction, which could encounter traffic snarls when barricades are installed beneath the flyover. “Our aim is to minimise inconvenience to traffic,” police sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/traffic-plan-ready-for-bypass-junction/article32720638.ece
29 September 2020||Kochi,KERALA||88% of rural poor households indebted||Eighty-eight per cent of the rural poor households in Kerala, constituting 44% of the population, are at various stages of indebtedness, says a pre-COVID-19 study by the Kochi-based Centre for Socio-Economic and Environmental Studies (CSES). The percentage of total rural household in debt in the State is 49.5% and the national average for rural indebtedness is 31.5%, say CSES researchers. The study covered households with yellow and pink ration cards and the primary survey was conducted among 540 households in 12 districts (36 wards) with three wards and 45 households drawn from each panchayat on random sampling basis. A structured pre-tested questionnaire, interviews, focus group discussions, and case studies were carried out to discover the borrowing pattern made up of credit choices and purpose of borrowing, extent and magnitude of indebtedness, and strategies adopted by families to manage debt pressure and address issues related to indebtedness. The level of indebtedness is nearly the same across social categories, the study says, underlining the finding that 93% of the indebted households depended on formal sources of loans while 56% had also borrowed from informal sources. Cooperative financial institutions topped the list of sources fulfilling credit requirements but the Kudumbashree Mission has emerged as a major source for formally borrowings. About half of the indebted households have borrowed from primary agricultural cooperative credit societies. It was found that the number of loans in the name of a female member of the household was 2.5 times the number of loans in the name of a male member. “This wide difference could be mainly attributed to the fact that certain loans such as Kudumbashree loans and micro-finance institutional group loans are available only to women,” the study says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/88-of-rural-poor-households-indebted/article32720636.ece

Of them, 525 people contracted the infection through local contact. Nine health workers were among the newly infected, including an ASHA worker and one health worker each at the Kothamangalam taluk hospital and the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery. Positive cases of the infection were reported from areas including Udayamperoor, Kottapady, Payipra, Moovattupuzha, Kadungalloor, Kothamangalam, Thoppumpady and Vengola. About 38 people from Thrikkakara, 44 from Fort Kochi and 35 people from Mattancherry have also tested positive. As many as 220 people have tested negative, while 23,208 people remain in quarantine. Of the 6,432 active cases in the district, 3,342 people remain in isolation at home. For testing, 1,262 samples were sent from government facilities and 554 from private labs and hospitals. ICU beds set aside Discussing the district’s COVID-19 management at a meeting with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, District Collector S. Suhas said that 70 ICU beds were set aside for COVID patients at the Government Medical College Hospital besides 120 ICU beds being readied at PVS Hospital. All hospitals have been asked to set aside 20 beds for patients with serious symptoms, and 10,000 beds have been readied at first-line treatment centres, according to a release from the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/537-more-test-positive/article32720643.ece
29 September 2020||Kochi,KERALA||Flyover work begins||Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) began work to scoop out the tarred layer of the Palarivattom flyover on Monday morning, prior to reconstructing its pier caps, girders and deck. A pooja was conducted prior to beginning the work. Sources in Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), to which DMRC entrusted the work, said that the entire tarred surface of the four-lane structure located on the Edappally-Aroor NH bypass would be scooped out in three days. The material will be taken to DMRC’s concrete pre-casting yard at Muttom, for possible reuse. This will be followed by work to cut the concrete structure into pieces, using diamond cutters. The cut pieces will be brought down using crane and crushed beneath the flyover, while taking care to prevent dust from affecting motorists and others passing through the junction. Simultaneously, steel will be extracted from the concrete, as was done with the debris of apartments that were demolished at Maradu, for recycling. The crushed concrete material too would most likely be taken to the yard, they added. Sea-wall plan dropped The proposal to slice the concrete into specific shapes for being used as sea wall in Chellanam and other coastal areas severely affected by raging seas, has been dropped. This is because lorries cannot negotiate through the area, it is learnt. It might take up to four months to dismantle the pier caps, girders and deck of the four-lane structure. Reconstruction work, scheduled to take up to nine months, will be done simultaneously. A total of Rs. 18 crore is estimated to be the cost to dismantle and rebuild the structure. Piers (pillars) will not be touched, since they are strong enough. They would be strengthened using concrete jacketing, sources said. Sources in DMRC reiterated that the reconstruction-cum-reinforcement work would ensure that the flyover had a 100-year life span. This is in contrast with less than 20-years life, if it were to be strengthened through carbon-fibre wrapping.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-to-reconstruct-crack-ridden-palarivattom-flyover-begins/article32720641.ece

29 September 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Tense moments at council meet||The council meeting of the Kozhikode Corporation on Monday witnessed tense moments, as a few councillors came to blows. Minor altercations between LDF and UDF councillors over postponement of certain items on the agenda soon escalated into a verbal fight after Deputy Mayor Meera Darshak refused to put off an item recommended by the UDF councillors. Subsequently, the UDF members asked Ms. Darshak as to why the report on Mahila Mall was not tabled in the council, to which she replied it would be tabled at a future meeting, but refused to set a date. This irked the UDF councillors who moved to the well and demanded a reply. Congress councillor P.M. Niyas and health standing committee chairman K.V. Baburaj came to blows, and other councillors tried to appease them. The Deputy Mayor called for an impromptu all-party meeting amid the council meeting and settled the matter temporarily, following which the council proceedings resumed. However, after the meeting, Mr. Niyas told the media that the attack on him was pre-planned, and that the ruling front had a fascist attitude. He alleged that the ruckus was an attempt to cover up corruption. Meanwhile, MYL activists took out a march to the council venue (Tagore Centenary Hall) protesting against the corporation’s alleged inaction in the Mahila Mall issue. They were arrested and removed by the police. Later, Youth Congress activists turned up and raised slogans in favour of Mr. Niyas along with the UDF councillors. The police intervened and asked the activists to vacate the scene, thus dissolving tension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tense-moments-at-council-meet/article32720388.ece
29 September 2020||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Over 200 barred from travelling at Kozhikode, Kannur airports||Over 200 passengers bound for different destinations in the Gulf were barred from travelling on Monday from the Calicut and Kannur international airports as they had produced RT-PCR test reports showing COVID-19 negative status from a laboratory blacklisted by the governments of the UAE and Dubai. The airline authorities told the passengers who had arrived at the Kannur airport that they would not be allowed to board the 3.30 a.m. flight as the Dubai regulatory body had asked the airline to reject the RT-PCR reports issued by four laboratories in the country, including a private lab based in Kerala. In the UAE, as per a new rule, all passengers under 12 must carry a negative COVID-19 test conducted a maximum of 96 hours before the departure, prior to boarding the flight. The lab in Kerala was banned by the Dubai government after several persons who were issued the RT-PCR test report were found to be positive on their arrival in that country. K.P. Manzoor, a resident of Panoor, who was returning to Dubai from Kannur after eight months of stay in Kerala due to the COVID-19 outbreak, felt cheated and disappointed. He said there was no information from Air India Express of any such ban on the private labs and even the lab authorities had told the passengers that they would face no problems. “When we tried to contact the lab after we were barred from boarding, their phones were switched off and this clearly indicates that they were aware of the ban,” he claimed. The development created chaos at the Kannur airport. The passengers said that they were unaware of the ban and neither was any information regarding it reported anywhere, including the official social media page of the airline. When contacted, the airport and airline authorities in Kannur denied the charges against them. The information was available on the Arogya Sethu app, they said. Officials said that those who couldn't board the Air India Express flight would be allowed to travel in the next flight with the report validated by the approved labs. Responding to the issue, a lab official said they were unaware of the ban while issuing the reports and that there was no intention to cheat the passengers. She said that to help passengers they were collecting the samples afresh and testing them at other labs and providing them with reports.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/over-200-barred-from-travelling-at-two-airports/article32720398.ece
29 September 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Pets are company amid pandemic blues||At least five people surround a small table on the roadside at Karaparamba in Kozhikode. On the table are kept small plastic cups with fighter fishes in myriad colours. Beside them is a small aquarium and a few fish bowls, all in great demand these days. “I started this business two months ago, as my light and sound business has been temporarily shut down due to the lockdown. This one helps me earn a livelihood,” said roadside vendor Siraj amid handling customers. He is just one among hundreds who have taken up ornamental fish business post-lockdown. Small stalls similar to that of Siraj can be found almost anywhere in the city. “The fighters are in great demand. Some buy them as pets, while some breed them. Anyway, there is huge demand for fish in general,” said Siraj. The fighter fishes, being imported from Thailand, are very attractive thanks to their colour and shape. Children find them quite fascinating and hence the demand. They are available at prices as low as Rs. 120 per fish. “The breeding techniques are available online. So, it is easy for anyone who wants to earn some quick bucks,” he added. Sreekumar C., who runs a pet shop in the city, feels that the lockdown-induced loneliness is tempting many people to get a pet home. Parents purchase pets to keep their children inside homes, thus preventing them from getting infected. Then, there are the new breeders. “It is not just fish, but dogs, kittens, parakeets, and pigeons are all in great demand, he said. “We often do not have enough stock of pets in demand. But customers who drop in do not go back without purchasing something,” he added. Pomeranian dogs that were available at Rs. 3,500 a year ago are now sold at Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 8,000. Labradors are scarcely available. But customers are ready to pay up to Rs. 15,000 for a Lab puppy these days, while they were sold at Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 7,000 just a few months ago. “Some people do not admit defeat if they fail to get a desired breed from shops. They search online platforms and purchase pre-owned pets,” Mr. Sreekumar said, adding that the business was flourishing these days. Abhilash Sukumaran, a breeder and trainer for eight years, is all set to cash in on this new-found interest in pets among all classes of people, through the first pet supermarket that will be opened in the city next week. However, the difficulty in importing from China and Thailand, major manufacturers of pet-related products, is a damper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pets-are-company-amid-pandemic-blues/article32720382.ece

29 September 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||In tribute, SPB’s gems rendered non-stop for four hours||Anoop Sankar’s life revolves around two of Indian music’s biggest idols. Last year, he paid a unique tribute to one of them. His 10-hour non-stop show featuring only songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja was unique in many ways. The maestro himself was impressed. S.P. Balasubrahmanyam too would have appreciated what Anoop, a playback singer in Malayalam cinema and a television host, did on Sunday night. He sang many of SPB’s timeless songs in a four-hour live show on YouTube, backed up by orchestra. It was a homage most melodious to the immensely popular singer who died in Chennai on Friday. It probably was the first show of its kind in memory of SPB. With COVID-19 ruling out any show in the real world in the near future, Anoop was forced to opt for the virtual one. “I wanted to conduct a programme in memory of my idol and I felt social media was the right platform in these times,” he told The Hindu . “I was pleasantly surprised by the number of people who logged in to watch the show.” The video attracted nearly 70,000 views within a day of its streaming. “There was another surprise when Rewant Vikram Singh, Director of the ICCR (Indian Council of Cultural Relations) in Sri Lanka, sought my permission to stream the show on the organisation’s Facebook page,” Anoop said. “SPB has a big fan base in Sri Lanka, and I would have performed there last month but for COVID-19.” He kicked off his online show with Ilayanila pozhigathare... , the Ilaiyaraaja melody from the 1982 film Payanangal Mudivathillai and moved on to other evergreen songs from SPB’s vast repertoire such as Mannil indha kadhal... (Keladi Kanmani), Nilave va... (Mounaragam), Maanguyile... (Karakattakkaran), Sundari kannal... (Thalapathi), Malare mounama... (Karna)..., Tere mere beech mein... (Ek Duuje Ke Liye) and Jotheyali... (Geetha).   “There were several requests from viewers and I obliged them too,” said Anoop, who has performed along with SPB on several stages. “He appreciated my singing. Once in Mumbai he introduced me to the audience: ‘Anoop sings like me but looks like Sonu Nigam’.”Sunday’s show was hosted by the Calicut Music Circle, which has been conducting an annual show by Anoop for the last 11 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/in-tribute-spbs-gems-rendered-non-stop-for-four-hours/article32720648.ece

29 September 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Containment zones point of contention||The continuing containment zone status in a few wards for months on end was a major point of discussion at the Kozhikode Corporation Council meeting on Monday. It was Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) councillor U. Abdurahman who first drew the council’s attention to difficulties faced by residents of Mukhadar ward, which has been a containment zone for almost three months. He said the rapid response team’s decision to revoke the containment zone status and instead declare micro containment zones in select areas was not implemented, as the district administration did not agree to it. “The rapid response teams have been asked to take such decisions, but they are often kept out of the loop in major matters,” Mr. Abdurahman alleged, pointing out that the present arrangement would destroy the livelihood of Mukhadar residents. LJD councillor Kishan Chand demanded that ration kits be distributed to families in Kattuvayal colony who are in containment zone. IUML councillor Beeran Koya said more camps should be opened to accommodate COVID-19 positive persons poor families. Deputy Mayor Meera Darshak said the issues would be brought to the notice of the district administration, and that arrangements would be made to distribute ration kits to the needy. Health officer R.S. Gopakumar said more first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) were being opened in the city. BJP councillor E. Prashanth Kumar’s demand to set up traditional cremation facilities at the Mavoor Road crematorium after its renovation led to a minor altercation between councillors.

29 September 2020||MALAPPURAM,KERALA||‘Treatment denial’ widely condemned||Anger and protest intensified against the Health Department following the death of twin babies during childbirth after their mother was denied treatment at four hospitals in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts in the name of COVID-19 on Sunday. Sahala, 20, who entered labour in the early hours of Saturday, was first denied treatment at Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri. After knocking in vain at the doors of three other hospitals, she was finally admitted to Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, after 14 hours. But both the twins died in childbirth. Medical officials said the babies could have been saved had Sahala been given timely treatment. Probe ordered Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has ordered an inquiry into the incident, which evoked severe criticism against the Health Department. Expressing regret over the incident, Ms. Shylaja said that stern action would be taken against those responsible for the tragedy. The Principal Secretary (Health) will investigate the case. Organisations such as the Youth Congress, the Vanitha League, the Muslim Youth League and the Muslim Students Federation took out protest marches to Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri, on Sunday and Monday. T.V. Ibrahim, MLA from Kondotty, said the incident destroyed the credibility and trust of the State’s Health Department. The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) demanded exemplary action against those responsible for the death of the newborn twins. Husband’s version Sahala’s husband N.C. Shareef, in a social media post, said: “They killed my babies. My wife is in an intensive care unit. Please pray for her.” “We reached Medical College at Manjeri at 4.30 a.m. on Saturday, and she entered the labour room. After some time, she was expelled from the hospital, saying that they would treat only COVID-19-positive patients,” he said. Sahala had tested positive for COVID-19 early this month, but tested negative on September 15. The other hospitals Sahala and Shareef approached did not admit her on the ground that she had not produced a PCR test result for COVID-19-negative status. “It is an insult to a State that boasts high standards of health care,” said Mr. Shareef.

29 September 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Ban on Pampa bath suggested||Pilgrims usually take a dip in the Pampa before trekking up the Sabarimala hills during the annual pilgrimage to the temple. However, this year, the tradition is likely to be cancelled because of the deepening COVID-19 fears. A ban on bathing of pilgrims at the Pampa and the Valiyathodu at Erumeli is among the key measures proposed by M. Manoj, Sabarimala Special Commissioner and District Judge, to ensure a safe season. In a report submitted to the High Court regarding the safety protocol for Sabarimala, the commissioner has also suggested restricting pilgrim entry via virtual queue, producing COVID-19 certificate to apply for queue slot, and screening of pilgrims at Nilakkal. Prasadam distribution It further calls for distribution of ‘prasadam’ by following COVID-19 guidelines, besides dispensing with the ‘kettunira’ facility at Pampa for the season. Further, all staff, including those involved with Annadanam, and hotel employees should be asked to produce COVID-19-negative certificate 36 hours prior to joining duty. It also seeks a directive to the Travancore Devaswom Board to set up adequate number of ghee exchange centres at Sannidhanam for collecting ghee coconuts and distributing the offering. Private vehicles should be permitted only up to Nilakkal to avoid crowding at Pampa. “Checkpoints should preferably be set up near every parking lot and the bus stand at Nilakkal so that pilgrims can finish health check-up and document formalities at one place. These points should have health care personnel to check for fever, KSRTC bus conductor for issuing bus ticket, and police personnel for verifying virtual queue registration,” it said. The commissioner also calls for establishing antigen testing facilities at Nilakkal, Pampa and Sannidhanam, besides early completion of works at hospitals at Neelimala, Appachimedu and Sannidhanam. It then raises doubts about allowing pilgrims through the traditional pathways from Erumeli and Pullumedu as it involved overnight staying in crude facilities near forests. Safety protocol The commissioner has also requested the court to direct the Directorate of Health Service to formulate a COVID-19 safety protocol in coordination with the police, TDB and other stakeholders and pass on the details to the other southern States. Besides, the police must be asked to effectively utilise the queue complex along the Saramkuthi route to contain the pilgrims.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ban-on-pampa-bath-suggested/article32720701.ece

29 September 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cong. registers protest with Governor||Congress leaders in Kerala on Monday sought the intervention of Governor Arif Mohammed Khan to convey to President Ram Nath Kovind the “grave concern aired by the farmers and agricultural workers of Kerala” over the agricultural Bills. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran met Mr. Khan to hand over a memorandum which registered the party’s protest against the “outrageous move” of the BJP government in passing the Bills. The pro-corporate actions of the Centre have left the farmers in the lurch. The Bills were passed through voice vote defying all Parliamentary norms, noted the memorandum signed by the two leaders and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy. “This is murder of democracy. The Centre has shown scant consideration for the aspirations of the farming community who are already under immense stress due to natural calamities and COVID-19,” it said. A demand to refer the Bills to the Select Committee was not heeded by the government. “It is unfortunate that the government, instead of safeguarding the interests of the common man, is falling prey to the lure of the corporates,” it said. RS members’ suspension The memorandum also objected to the suspension of eight Rajya Sabha members. “The Shiromani Akali Dal, one of the oldest allies of the BJP, has already submitted its resignation from the government. This shows the resentment at the grassroot level which cannot be ignored by political parties working,” it said. Later, inaugurating a protest outside Raj Bhavan, Mr. Chennithala said the Bills would ruin farmers. The Narendra Modi government is attempting to scuttle the measures introduced by the Congress to guarantee food security in the country. The Bills are an open challenge to the farmers and seek to enslave them to corporates, he said. Mr. Ramachandran described the Bills as ‘draconian.’ Former KPCC president M.M. Hassan said the Congress would continue to protest against the Bills until they were withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-registers-protest-with-governor/article32720657.ece

Three proposals had been suggested for the revamp of the GST laws at a webinar on ‘COVID-19 Pandemic and Fiscal Federalism in India’ held on Monday and attended by the Finance Ministers of over half-a-dozen States. Higher share Instead of sharing the GST revenue equally between the State and the Centre, 60% of the GST should to the States and 40% to the Centre. The States should be given the authority to increase or decrease the SGST (State GST) component of the GST by 1 or 2%. Thirdly, the term of paying GST compensation to the States should be increased as the GST administration has failed to take off. Chief Minister of Puducherry V. Narayanaswamy, Finance Minister of Chattisgarh Singh Dio, Finance Minister of Punjab Manpreet Singh, Finance Minister of West Bengal and Chairman of the Empowered Committee of Finance Ministers on GST Amit Mitra, Finance Minister of Kerala T.M. Thomas Isaac, former Finance Minister Jammu and Kashmir Haseeb Drabu and officials from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Kerala and eminent scholars participated.

While the district recorded 8,300 COVID-19 during the last 10 days (September 18-27), the COVID-19 test positivity rate (TPR) stood at 16.34, considerably higher than cities like Chennai and Mumbai. Besides the laxity in adopting precautionary measures, demonstrations and uncontrolled crowds in markets are viewed as factors threatening containment efforts. While suggesting restriction of commercial activities to essential services alone, the authorities have also reportedly urged the government to review its decision to permit the functioning of government offices and private establishments in full swing. Lockdowns or tight restrictions could be imposed in various taluks such as Thiruvananthapuram and Neyyattinkara. A strict ban on gatherings and demonstrations has also been recommended.

Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 but might be experiencing lingering effects of the viral infection will be followed up at these clinics. Even though Kerala’s COVID-19 case fatality rate is contained at 0.4%, the number of deaths can go up in proportion to the steady increase in the number of new cases in the days to come, unless stringent vigil is maintained to keep disease transmission down, Mr. Vijayan said. A week-long campaign is being planned by the Health Department from October 1 to 7, to create awareness on the need for protecting the elderly. Mr. Vijayan warned people against taking COVID-19 lightly and said even healthy people were being affected by the disease.

The intelligent e-governance system provides access to the the public to more than 200 services through its online platform. The services available include applications for various certificates, payment of taxes and filing of complaints and appeals. The public so far had to queue up at their panchayat or municipality offices to get certificates or to pay taxes. Now all of these can be accessed online from home or through Akshaya centres. The documents required for a particular application can be scanned and uploaded. In case of discrepancies, notifications will be sent online and as SMS. The software sets the time for processing each application at a particular employee’s desk. The details regarding the delayed files will be available at the department head’s as well as the employee’s dashboard. The applicants will thus have an option to track and raise complaints, in case action is delayed. The trial run had been conducted at the Chemmaruthy grama panchayat here for the past four months. Since the pilot run was found to be a success, it was decided to expand the same to 150 more panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/e-governance-system-for-local-bodies/article32720593.ece

Nair was attacked by a group of women activists over his vulgar and derogatory videos targeting women, the Museum police here on Monday arrested him from his house at Kalliyoor in the district. He has also been charged under Section 67 and 67A of the Information Technology Act, non-bailable offences pertaining to the publishing or transmitting of material containing obscene material or a sexually explicit act in electronic form. The Museum police had on Saturday registered a case against him under Section 509 of the IPC (use of word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and Section 120(O) of the Kerala Police Act. Another case has been registered by the Thampanoor police against him under Section 354 of the IPC, pertaining to assault or criminal force on women with intent to outrage their modesty.

The State stands with the women who were targeted,” said the Chief Minister in the statement. WCC flays action The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) had criticised the police’s action of initially charging only bailable offences against Nair, while charging non-bailable offences against the women who attacked him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/youtuber-who-posted-vulgar-videos-arrested/article32720664.ece

Shylaja has ordered an inquiry into allegations of medical negligence levelled against Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, after a 55-year-old patient was discharged with maggot infestation on his body. Anil Kumar of Manikanteswaram was found in a pitiable condition when he was taken home by his family on Sunday after undergoing treatment for spinal injuries he had sustained after a fall on August 21. Positive for COVID While he had initially tested negative for COVID-19, he was later diagnosed with the disease on September 6 shortly after a few staff and patients in the same ward had tested positive. The authorities asked his family to remain in quarantine in their house, maintaining that Mr. Kumar was in good health, his family claimed. On testing negative on September 26, Mr. Kumar’s family was asked to arrange for his discharge. His wife and children were in for a shock when they arrived to pick him on Sunday. While he was in a famished state, Mr. Kumar also had bedsore and unhealed wounds on various parts of his body. Alleging that he was maltreated during his stay in the hospital, the family wrote to the Health Minister seeking action against those responsible for the incident. On the basis of the complaint, Ms. Shylaja ordered the Director of Medical Education to institute a probe into the matter. She also added that specialised treatment would be ensured for Mr. Kumar. Treatment at home After the family of Mr. Kumar refused the offer for treatment in a hospital of their choice, District Medical Officer K.S. Shinu arranged for medical assistance in their house.

In a letter addressed to the President, Dr.Chinta Mohan observed that the three agriculture Act brought out by the BJP-led NDA government would only endanger the interests of the farmers and hamper agriculture economy in the country, serving the corporate sector. The Congress leader maintained that it was India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who had ushered in agriculture revolution by initiating mega projects of Bhakra-Nangal, Hirakud and Nagarjuna Sagar. Before Independence, and several years after it, India used to depend heavily on rice from Myanmar and wheat from America. He said that in 1970s, it was Indira Gandhi who had introduced the high quality rice seeds in India, importing them from Taiwan. In the later years, green revolution was in place, and the country could get surplus produce suffice to make exports.  Meanwhile, the AP Congress Committee secretary, K. Prameelamma along with party cadres staged a protest in front of the RDO office at Tirupati on Monday, opposing the three agriculture Acts of the Central government.

Chandrababu Naidu has been treating the Backward Classes as a vote bank and the former Chief Minister did not implement a single scheme for the uplift of BCs. Speaking at a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Venkataramana said that the opposition had been repeatedly taking the BCs for a ride and had done nothing for their welfare during the TDP regime. Stating that Mr. Naidu had failed to deliver his promises made to BC welfare during his regime and never bothered about the BCs while in power, Mr. Venkataramana said that it was evident that Mr. Naidu has been treating BCs as a vote bank and for playing caste politics. “Mr. Naidu had always limited the BC welfare activities to providing cattle or a milk can or a fishing net or an iron box to the community. Mr. Naidu had even misused Aadarana funds. It is Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who is committed to providing equal opportunities for BCs and has established 57 BC corporations. Unlike Mr. Naidu, who wanted to gain profit by filling the Rajya Sabha seat, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had sent two BC candidates to Rajya Sabha out of the four vacancies. The Chief Minister spent Rs. 19,750 crore for the welfare of BCs in a span of just 16 months,’’ said the Rajya Sabha member.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-did-nothing-for-bcs-alleges-mopidevi/article32720716.ece

Accompanied by Ongole MP Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy and Prakasam District Collector P.Bhaskar, he said with the launch of the scheme, designed to provide irrigation to farmers pursing rain-fed agriculture in the absence of flood irrigation, the ruling YSRCP had fulfilled a major poll promise made by Chief Minister Y.S.Jagan Mohan Reddy during the padayatra. The scheme to dig up borewells and give electric motors free of cost would benefit 4.1 lakh small and 1.77 lakh marginal farmers, he said. The State government had taken responsibility to fully back the farmers from the stage of sowing to marketing by providing investment subsidy, interest-free loan, technology transfer through Rythu Bharosa Kendras and market intervention to make farming profitable, the Minister said. ‘Groundwater level will go up’ The groundwater levels could go up significantly in the western parts of the district from this rabi cropping season as Krishna water would be released from the multi-crore Veligonda project by December, he said. All major reservoirs, which had remained bone dry during the previous TDP regime, had been filled to the brim under the farmer-friendly Jagan Mohan Reddy regime, pointed out the Ongole MP. In Nellore, District Collector K.V.N.Chakradhar Babu said 16,000 to 17,000 farmers in each of the 10 Assembly constituencies in the district would be benefited by the scheme. Farmers could submit applications to the village secretariats or village volunteers and the District Water Management Agency(DWMA) would arrange for scientific survey by a geologist and take responsibility for not only drilling of borewells but also install electric motors free of cost. If a bore well did not yield water another one would be sunk, he said, adding the drill bore wells would be geo-tagged and social audit conducted to ensure transparency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysr-jala-kala-to-benefit-about-six-lakh-farmers-in-prakasam/article32720146.ece

29 September 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM promises free motors to small and marginal farmers||The State government will provide motors to farmers free of cost, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said here on Monday, after launching the ‘YSR Jala Kala’ scheme in virtual mode. As part of the scheme, borewells will be dug for small and marginal farmers in arid and upland areas in the State free of cost. “An estimated 5 lakh acres will be brought under cultivation in four years at a cost Rs. 2,340 crore. The ‘YSR Jala Kala’ will be implemented in 144 rural and 19 semi-urban constituencies across the State,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The sites for drilling the borewells, he said, would be selected on the basis of the findings of hydro-geological and geo-physical surveys. Farmers can avail of the benefits of the scheme second time in case of failure to draw water in the first attempt. How to apply “Eligible farmers need to apply either online or through their respective village secretariats. They can monitor the status of their applications at every stage of scrutiny. The expenditure entailed by free motor scheme would be about Rs. 1,600 crore,” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. The Chief Minister maintained that the new electricity meters would not burden the farmers. Rather, the devices would provide the data on power consumption and the required load of feeders. This new system will ensure transparency. 10,000 MW solar plant The electricity bill amounts will be transferred to the bank accounts of the farmers which they, in turn, will pay to the DISCOMs. A 10,000 MW solar power plant is on the anvil and it will exclusively cater to the needs of nine-hour free power scheme for the next 30 years, said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Feeder capacity The Chief Minister further said that the previous TDP government had ruined the free-electricity scheme by incurring a debt of Rs. 8,655 crore and it had paid no attention to strengthening of the feeders. “Only 58% of the feeders can provide free power during the day time. The YSRCP government has increased the capacity of these feeders by spending Rs. 1,700 crore. This move will enable the farmers in the State to avail free power supply for nine hours in the day time in hassle-free manner,” the Chief Minister said. Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and his Roads and Buildings M. Sankara Narayana were among others who took part in the event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-promises-free-motors-to-small-and-marginal-farmers/article32720725.ece

29 September 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||47,359 places of worship in State mapped, says DGP||As many as 19 cases pertaining to attacks on places of worships were reported in the State, after the burning of chariot at Antarvedi temple on September 6, and all these incidents occurred with different motives and were unrelated, Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang has said. Speaking on the series of attacks and thefts reported from the places of worships in the State in the last 20 days, Mr. Sawang on Monday clarified that the incidents were not orchestrated and committed with superstitions, treasure hunt and other motives. ‘Cases are not linked’ “The police have arrested the accused in 12 of the total 19 cases reported in the State, while the remaining cases are in different stages of investigation. All the accused will be brought to book. All these cases are stand-alone incidents and it is not correct to link one to the other,” said Mr. Swanag. Citing the case reported from Srikakulam, the DGP said some people alleged that the arm of an idol was desecrated. Investigation revealed that the arm was broken and fell off last year as the idol was exposed to sun and rain. Various other attacks were committed by the gangs who were hunting for treasures supposedly hidden under idols, Mr. Sawang said. Giving the data on number of thefts reported in the State in the last six years, the DGP said 290 thefts occurred at temples in 2015, which went up to 322 in 2016 and 318 in 2017. As many as 267 cases were reported in 2018 and 305 last year. About 228 cases have been registered this year till date. Giving details about the measures to ensure the safety of places of worship, the DGP said as many as 47,359 places of worships, including 28,567 temples, have been mapped and CCTV cameras have been installed in 880 locations. Police have bound over 8,204 offenders allegedly involved in thefts at places of worships and attacks in the last six years. Surveillance Notices have been served on the managements of the shrines to step up security on their respective premises, he said. Stating that 10 % of the places of worship are equipped with CCTV surveillance, Mr. Sawang said that a comprehensive social audit has been done across the State in the last three weeks. “I appeal to the people not to get carried away by rumours and cooperate with the police in maintaining the law and order,” the DGP added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/47359-places-of-worship-in-state-mapped-says-dgp/article32720728.ece

Krishna, A.P. and TS Coordination Committee member of the Human Rights Forum (HRF). He was addressing a dharna by local farmers and adivasis who have for three days been blocking the transportation of granite slabs by the company near the reservoir in Ravikamatham mandal of Visakhapatnam district on Monday. The 195 granite blocks quarried by the Stone Plus company were seized by the Forest department on May 1. He said the Visakhapatnam Divisional Forest Officer in a letter on March 16 to the Director, Mines and Geology, urged “to cancel the mining lease granted erroneously in favour of Stone Plus since the lease area falls in the notified forest block.”  Earlier the DFO had written to the Assistant Director, Mines and Geology, stating that no transit permit be issued without clearance from the Forest department. “Both these requests went unheeded. The DFO had stated that some revenue officials had created false survey numbers to grab forest land and sought action against them by the District Collector. No action has been initiated till date,” said Mr. Krishna, displaying the letters of the DFO. Mr. Krishna sought an investigation into the matter. “It is high time the entire area is declared a no mining zone,” he stated. District secretary, Adivasi Hakkula Sangam, Nalli Kalyanam said that the Forest personnel who had stood guard to the seized granite slabs and machinery had suddenly left the place on September 25.

29 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||TRS indulges in double-speak, says AICC State in-charge||AICC in-charge for Telangana Congress, Manickam Tagore has said that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) party speaks in two different languages in Telangana and New Delhi, citing the stand taken by them on various bills brought in by the NDA government. Our effort will be to expose how this party works in tune with the Bharatiya Janata Party, and will work with a mission to bring back the Congress party to power in Telangana in 2023. In an informal chat with the reporters here after this three-day visit to Telangana, he said local leadership will be given a freehand and they should fight it out with the government here. Representatives of the high command will only assist them and not boss over, he maintained. Arguing that difference of opinion is not groupism, he said ultimately everyone’s aim is to bring Congress back to power. “Despite the differences, we will fight as a team,” he said. Mr. Tagore was confident that defeating the TRS is not a big challenge despite the ruling party’s financial muscle and said while the TRS is confident of money politics, Congress is confident of voters. Just like Tamil Nadu, people of Telangana are emotional and the party has an emotional connect with the people. Opportunities for youngsters will be given, he said adding that the party is working on developing young leadership at the lower level. Though the TRS snatched away the leaders systematically, the party has enough reserve strength, he felt. On the leadership change in the State, he refused to reveal any details saying the TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and AICC president Sonia Gandhi know better about the issue. “I am yet to speak to madam after being appointed as in-charge,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-indulges-in-double-speak-says-aicc-state-in-charge/article32720611.ece

The leaders consisting of TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy; AICC incharge Manickam Tagore, TPCC working presidents A. Revanth Reddy, Ponnam Prabhakar, AICC secretaries Bose Raju and Sreenivaasan among others were prevented from going to the Raj Bhavan and shifted to Goshamahal police station. Mr. Tagore later told reporters that denying an appointment was surprising when most Governors in the country had given appointment to Congress delegations on the same issue. In fact, Tamil Nadu Governor, who has recovered from coronavirus infection, has never refused to meet the opposition leaders, he said. Mr. Uttam Reddy said if the Governor was unavailable she could have sent any of her officers to receive the memorandum from the Congress delegation. ‘Bad practice’ Citing COVID-19 not to meet the Congress delegation was not in best democratic practices, he said. He announced that the Congress party would organise protests across the Telangana State on October 2 in protest against the new agriculture laws and demanded that they be withdrawn immediately as they would push entire agriculture sector into crisis damaging the farm economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-leaders-denied-entry-into-raj-bhavan/article32720613.ece
29 September 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Focus on stabilisation of drinking water supply||After initiating steps for safe drinking water supply to all households through Mission Bhagiratha, the State Government has focused attention on stabilising the supply system across the State. Panchayat Raj Minister E. Dayakar Rao directed the officials concerned to take steps to ensure that 80% of the supply system is stabilised by October 15 and the remaining by next month-end. In addition, steps should be taken to cover 126 isolated habitations not covered under the Mission Bhagiratha so far utilising solar energy sources before November-end. Efforts should be made to provide drinking water to schools, anganwadi centres, places of worship, prakruti vanams and vaikunta shamans under the Mission. The Minister held a detailed review meeting on the progress of the works with senior officials on Monday. He said though supply of safe drinking water had been ensured through Mission Bhagiratha on the instructions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, stabilisation of the system was not completed yet. Accordingly, works on completion of construction of overhead tanks should be expedited. The project won appreciation from the Centre, and Telangana won accolades as the only State that is supplying zero-flouride water to all households. The Centre as well as 13 other States are working out modalities to replicate Mission Bhagiratha, albeit in different names. Of the 23,804 habitations across the State, safe drinking water is being supplied to 21,478 habitations. In all, 1,607 habitations are dependent on Singur project while some other habitations could not be covered due to technical issues. As of now, stabilisation of supplies had been completed in 10,682 habitations, amounting to 43% of the total habitations, had been completed and the government had set October-end deadline for completing works in the remaining areas too. It was, therefore, decided to focus on taking up repairs to the existing/old tanks, ensuring effective functioning of the new tanks, taking steps to ensure hygienic surroundings around the overhead tanks and providing underground pipelines among others as part of stabilisation works. Besides, steps are also being taken to upload the details of the beneficiaries on the website. He instructed senior officials, including the superintendent engineers and chief engineers, to ensure timely completion of works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/focus-on-stabilisation-of-drinking-water-supply/article32720620.ece

29 September 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC imposes Rs. 1.5 lakh fine on LIC||The Telangana High Court on Monday imposed a fine of Rs. 1.5 lakh on the Life Insurance Corporation of India, finding fault with the latter’s action of filing appeals against a single judge’s order to regularise services of temporary sub-staff members. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy observed that LIC had filed the appeal to evade the contempt of court petitions that were coming up against it for not complying with the single judge direction. The bench imposed a fine of Rs. 50,000 each in three petitions against LIC for wasting the time of the High Court and directed it to deposit the money in Lawyers Welfare Trust. The amount should be deposited in two weeks and the receipts should be handed over to the HC Registry. Otherwise, contempt of court proceedings would be initiated against LIC, the bench said. On July 19, 2019 the single judge instructed the LIC to regularise persons working as peons temporarily after hearing petitions filed by them. As the LIC failed to comply with the direction, the temporary workers moved the HC and filed contempt petitions. Meanwhile, LIC had filed appeals over the single judge direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-imposes-rs-15-lakh-fine-on-lic/article32720161.ece

On Wednesday, two cases of electrocution were registered in Sangareddy and Medak districts. One Rinku Choupal, 25, from Bihar, working at a seed company located on the outskirts of Kalivemula, came in contact with a live wire and was electrocuted. At Chetla Gouraram of Manoharabad mandal of Medak, a 65-year old farmer, Ganta Mallesham, died while repairing power lines that were connected to his farm from a far off place with the help of bamboo sticks. He reportedly tried to connect the wire which got disconnected. On September 22, at Dultabad, farmer Ramul died while repairing power lines. The lines were without power but when he tried to connect them, the supply was restored, and he was electrocuted. On August 2, a couple – M. Venkatesh Goud and Revathi - were electrocuted in Chowdaripally village in Wargal mandal. “The power supply lines hang very low and one can hold them easily. Fearing electrocution, even labourers are not ready to work in our fields. Naturally, there is no question of using machinery,” was what one Rajamallu of Gonepally village in Chinnakodur mandal said. He says his repeated appeals to authorities have failed to get the issue addressed. When contacted, an official said that he will be in a position to provide the details tomorrow as he is out of station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/low-lying-power-lines-pose-threat-to-life/article32720614.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||City can do 19K RT-PCR tests a day, reveals Delhi govt. review||Labs in Delhi have a capacity to conduct around 19,500 RT-PCR tests a day to detect COVID-19, a review by the Delhi government has shown, said officials. Till now, the Delhi government had maintained that the capacity was around 14,000 RT-PCR tests a day and that an average of 9,626 such tests were done daily in September. The review was done after the Centre last week informed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government that Delhi has the capacity to do 27,000 RT-PCR tests daily. “After the Centre sent a list which said that city labs can do 27,000 tests, the Delhi government reached out to the labs individually. According to data from the labs, Delhi can do around 19,500 RT-PCR tests a day, which is much less than the Centre’s figures,” a government official told The Hindu . Earlier this month, the High Court had asked the Delhi government to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and pointed out that the accuracy of rapid antigen tests, on which the Delhi government is heavily dependent, was low. Two types of tests are done to test for COVID-19 in the city: RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test (RAT). RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard and gives more accurate results compared to RAT. Results of RT-PCR take 24 hours, while RAT takes only 30 minutes. Expert committee The Delhi government on Monday also held a meeting with an expert committee headed by V.K. Paul, member NITI Aayog, on increasing RT-PCR testing.     “The expert committee will prepare a revised COVID strategy, which will have details of how to increase RT- PCR testing, and also a new plan for containment zones. The government is currently doing around 10,000 RT-PCR tests daily... this has to be increased by around 10,000 to reach 20,000,” a second official said, confirming the reviewed data. In a related development, the Delhi government, following a High Court order, has sent a map with locations of all COVID-19 testing centres in the city to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation so they can be put up in metro stations. The public will be able see these maps at the stations from later this week, according to officials. The map has been developed by Geospatial Delhi Limited, a Delhi government company, and it will be uploaded on government websites too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-can-do-19k-rt-pcr-tests-a-day-reveals-delhi-govt-review/article32720574.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||BJP’s twofold agenda: drum up support for farm Acts, attack AAP||In the middle of nationwide protests against the farm Acts passed by Parliament, the Delhi BJP has quietly begun drumming up support for them on one hand and on the other utilising the opportunity to gather political munition against the Aam Aadmi Party government across the Capital’s rural belt. According to sources, the initiative would allow the BJP to bide time till the “monetary benefits” of the Acts manifested themselves as farmers went about the retail of this current season’s harvest. At a party meeting on Sunday, it was decided that the party would undertake a three-day programme to educate Delhi’s farmers on the three farm Acts, led by Leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri. “The party will hold several meetings and events across 360 villages in Delhi. The farmer community settled in these villages is connected to States such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan through family ties,” Mr. Bidhuri said. “The rumours and the propaganda of the Opposition against the Acts, which we dispel here, will be relayed across several hundred kilometres in the other three States with significant rural belts,” he also said. ‘Double income’ Addressing a farmers’ conference in South Delhi’s Tajpur village on Monday, Mr. Bidhuri said that while the provisions in the new agricultural Acts will double the income of farmers, new techniques will help in agricultural production. There will, he said, also be a guarantee of payment of crop sold by farmers in three days. If a farmer gives his land on contract, the buyer will also bear the risk of loss to his crop. Mr. Bidhuri said, the farmers he interacted with also demanded that the Arvind Kejriwal government fulfil the promises made by it to them. “Under this, the MSP of wheat and paddy in Delhi should be Rs. 600 more than the Central government, free electricity should be supplied to farmers on the lines of Haryana,” he said. Mr. Bidhuri further alleged Delhi was the only State where there had been no increase in the amount of compensation given to farmers against land acquisition. Farmers are being compensated Rs. 17 lakh to Rs. 53 lakh per acre, he claimed, adding the rates have not been raised since being determined over a decade ago.  The rumours of the Opposition against the Bills, which we dispel here, will be relayed across several hundred kilometres in the other three States  Ramvir Singh Bidhuri Leader of the Opposition||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjps-twofold-agenda-drum-up-support-for-farm-acts-attack-aap/article32720564.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Delhi Congress leaders detained ahead of protest against farm Acts||The Delhi Congress on Monday was scheduled to hold a “Kisan-Mazdoor Nyay March” to protest against the ‘anti-farmer’ Acts, passed by the Modi government, from Rajghat to Raj Niwas but its leaders and party workers were detained before they could begin their march. The party alleged that the Delhi police used brutal force to roundup its workers and farmers who had gathered for the protest despite the crowd being peaceful and protesters following social distancing norms. Memorandum to L-G “The Congress workers and a large number of farmers who wanted to submit a memorandum to the Lt. Governor to be forwarded to the President of India demanding withdrawal/repeal of the anti-farmer Acts, were assembling at Rajghat, when at the behest of the Modi government, they were detained and taken to different police stations in the Capital,” the party said. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar later submitted the memorandum to the Lt. Governor. He said that it was murder of democracy and violation of human rights as the Delhi police acted in a draconian manner to prevent the Congress workers and farmers from holding a peaceful march in support of the farmers in a land from where the iconic slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” had resonated across the world. “The Modi government seems determined to hand over the farm sector, too, to a handful of corporate companies by abolishing MSP, to deny the farmers just prices for their agricultural products,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-congress-leaders-detained-ahead-of-protest-against-farm-acts/article32720569.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||UN expert raises concerns over eviction of slum dwellers in Delhi||The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, on Monday raised concerns over the eviction of slum dwellers along railway tracks in Delhi. In a statement issued in Geneva, Mr. Rajagopal said it did not appear that those affected by the decision were consulted. The Supreme Court had on August 31 issued an order to evict around 48,000 households living along the tracks, giving residents three months to leave, the statement said. Denial of justice “This amounts to a full-fledged denial of justice for the low-income people living along the railway tracks. If this is maintained, India will squarely violate Article 2.3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights containing the core human rights principle that everyone can seek judicial relief against any decision she or he considered arbitrary.” Relocation plan He welcomed the second ruling of the court to temporarily stop the evictions, but added that the four weeks’ time given was not enough for a formulating a reasonable rehabilitation or relocation plan that would meet standards of international law in consultation of the large number of households. He asked the government to stop all evictions during the pandemic to prevent community spread of COVID-19. “While the relocation of some residents living in very close proximity to a railway track may be needed to protect them from potential railway accidents, any such eviction would only be compatible with international human rights law after a relocation plan is developed in consultation with the affected households and after alternative land or housing is made available to them in proximity to their current place of residence,” said Mr. Rajagopal. He “called on the Supreme Court to reconsider the case in light of India’s international human rights obligations, noting that the court has a strong reputation of having delivered several landmark human rights decisions”, the statement said. The statement added that Mr. Rajagopal had contacted the government to clarify the matter and asked that his concerns be shared with the the court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/un-expert-raises-concerns-over-eviction-of-slum-dwellers-in-delhi/article32720572.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||BJP criticises AAP govt. over board exam fees||The Opposition BJP on Monday accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government of backing out from depositing board exam fees for students in schools administered by it. Alleging that the Delhi government’s “double face” in this respect had been exposed, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said that in 2019, the Kejriwal government had attempted a “publicity stunt” by making a promise to this effect. “The government should pay the exam fees of students Class 10 and 12 in government schools. They had said they would do so just before the election for the sake of vote bank,” Mr. Gupta alleged. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) charges examination fees every year for board exams from its recognised schools. Fees are charged up to Rs. 2,500 per student. On September 17, 2019, Mr. Gupta said, the government had announced that it will deposit the examination fees of 3.5 lakh students of Class 10 and 12 for the 2019-20 session. “Around Rs. 57 crore were deposited to the CBSE. The Kejriwal government has refused to pay the examination fees this year, due to which the burden will now be on the families of the students,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bjp-criticises-aap-govt-over-board-exam-fees/article32720566.ece

Taking suo motu cognisance of the reported incident, State Commission for Women chairperson Shobha Oza appealed to the government to take strict action, including registration of a case, against him. “If those tasked with ensuring the maintenance of law and order violate it themselves..., the government need not require a complaint to act,” she said.

29 September 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||‘Odisha govt. downplaying virus death figures’||It has been nine days since his grandfather passed away of COVID-19 and five days since his uncle died. But Ayush Panda has found their names missing in the death list put out by the Odisha government. Similarly, Soumya Mishra said her grandfather passed away on September 24, but the government had not bothered to reflect the death in the bulletin circulated daily for the general public. At a time when the Odisha government claimed to be among the few States having low COVID-19 fatalities in the country, ground reality tells a different story. Social media is flooded with concerns raised by people who accuse the government of downplaying death figures. Responding to the State Health and Family Welfare Department on Twitter, Mr. Panda and Ms. Mishra rued that their information was not mentioned in the bulletin. The State’s death toll crossed the 800 mark with 16 deaths reported on Monday. The fatalities have reached 813. However, going by reports, there is a huge mismatch between the State’s total death toll and deaths being reported from districts. According to the State dashboard on COVID-19, Nuapada district has reported only one death of the total of 813 deaths that have occurred in the State. When asked, Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) Kali Charan Behera said, “We have already reported 19 COVID-19 deaths. I have no idea as to why deaths have not been reflected in the information put out by the government at State level.”  Mismatch of figures As per the CDMO of Kalahandi, the district has so far registered 25 COVID-19 deaths. The State dashboard has put Kalahandi’s death toll at eight, including one death reported on Monday. Similarly, Kendrapara CDMO office has reported 20 deaths. The State government’s bulletin says 10 persons have died of COVID-19 in Kendrapara while one died due to non-COVID-19 reasons. Recently, Congress leader Manas Choudhury indicated that the number of bodies being cremated in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack were not proportionate to the death figure being made public by the government. On September 22, the government issued a direction for conducting State-level death audit to determine the cause of death. It ordered all hospitals to record all pre-existing disease with signs and symptoms to the State-level committee accompanied with the name and contact number of treating physicians.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/odisha-govt-downplaying-virus-death-figures/article32720584.ece

As per the list released by the JJM, 29 persons belonging to tribal, tribal Christian and Muslim communities have either been lynched or beaten up by mob on suspicion of cow slaughter, sale and consumption of beef and religious hatred in Jharkhand between the year 2016 and 2020. At least 10 of them have faced mob violence under the present JMM-Congress government rule. “As per media reports and our fact-finding teams, we have prepared a list of 29 persons who were attacked by mobs espousing Hindutva ideology. We have taken up the matter with the Chief Minister and Director General of Police M.V. Rao. In some cases, we have moved court,” said JJM lead member Bharat Bhushan Choudhary. The JJM also demanded Rs. 25 lakhs compensation as per the Supreme Court guidelines for the victims and swift judicial and police action against the accused. “In many cases, the police was complicit in the violence or in protecting the perpetrators. Growing communalisation and violence by Hindutva groups in the State is deeply worrying,” said Mr. Choudhary. “In the recent case on September 16, seven tribals belonging to Christian community in Simdega district were beaten up and tonsured after they were blamed for cow slaughter. They were subsequently forced to chant Jai Shri Ram,” said another JJM member Siraj Dutta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mob-lynching-continues-even-during-sorens-rule/article32720587.ece

The delegation included Vivek Bansal, in-charge of party affairs in Haryana, State party chief Kumari Selja and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda among other leaders. Mr. Bansal said the Congress will continue its protest against the Acts. “The President should use his office to undo the three black Acts which are endangering the existence of the farmers, labour and ‘arhtiyas’ (commission agents),” Mr. Bansal said. Earlier, at a party meeting, Mr. Bansal asked the party cadre to stand as one team to lodge a strong protest against the three Acts. “The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) passed these black Acts treacherously, while violating all the Constitutional norms, and is forcing them on the people of the country. We will start a signature campaign beginning October 2 and hold Kisan Sammelans (farmer meets) across the State against these Acts,” he said.  ‘MSP the dire need’ Ms. Selja said the Minimum Support Price is the dire need to save the farmers, labour and commission agents, but the BJP government was deliberately going to restrict the role of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). “In Bihar, the abolition of the APMC had resulted in disastrous situation as farmers have been reduced to labours and most of them are going to other States to work as farm-hands,” she said||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/haryana-congress-asks-president-to-repeal-acts/article32720579.ece

The people of Punjab have been the sword arm of India and always been on the forefront of protecting the security of the nation. When the territorial sovereignty of the nation was under threat, the people from Punjab rose to the occasion and fought bravely on the front-lines,” they said in a statement. The MPs added that in the 1950s when food security was under threat, and the Government of India pushed for the Green Revolution, the farmers of Punjab and Haryana led the battle to ensure that India would become a food-surplus nation. Punjab and Haryana became the food bowl of the nation. These sacrifices made by the farmers of Punjab and Haryana had gone for nought now that these Bills had been signed into law. “The Government of India has signed the death warrant of the farmers. Our farmers who fought the British for Independence, will never be free again,” the MPs added.  ‘We must unite’ “We believe it is important to reiterate our support for our farmers who have been braving the heat and coming out to protest despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The spirit of Bhagat Singh lives on in Punjab and we must unite to ensure that these Acts are repealed at the earliest,” they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sacrifices-made-by-farmers-have-gone-waste-say-congress-mps/article32720581.ece

29 September 2020||Mumbai,||Maharashtra govt. gives nod to reopen restaurants in October||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday agreed in-principle to reopen restaurants in the State in the first week of October. In an interaction with representatives of associations of restaurateurs from Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur via videoconferencing, Mr. Thackeray said all restaurants will be initially allowed to operate at 50% capacity and they will have to follow the standard operating procedures (SOP). Mr. Thackeray said, “Strict following of the SOP once finalised, and maintaining physical distancing, sanitation and safety is the formula to reopen restaurants.” He said the government is aware of the financial troubles faced by the industry and its demands for waiving various fees. Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association, said, “We are happy with the decision of reopening restaurants from the first week of October. On the SOPs, the government has listed them and sought our suggestions. Safety of our customers is of prime importance and we will ensure that the SOPs are followed. The government is working on our demands to waive the license fee.” Sherry Bhatia, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India, said the government has brought the industry relief by extending the deadline for payment of the first instalment of the Excise License fee to September 30. Sitaram Kunte, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), said the SOPs will soon be made available to hotel owners’ associations in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-govt-gives-nod-to-reopen-restaurants-in-october/article32720348.ece
29 September 2020||Mumbai,||Make ED’s functioning transparent: PIL in HC||A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Bombay High Court on Monday seeking directions to bring about transparency in the functioning of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to facilitate citizens’ participation in the campaign against money laundering. The criminal PIL filed by advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay stated, “The ED is a multi-disciplinary organisation mandated with the task of enforcing the provisions of two special fiscal laws — the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, (PMLA). Besides directly recruiting personnel, the directorate also draws officers from different investigating agencies, viz. Customs & Central Excise, Income Tax, Police on deputation.” The plea added, “A group of advocates came across several instances with documentary evidences wherein the functioning of the ED appeared to be suffering from a complete lack of transparency and accountability, whereby huge loss is being caused to the national exchequer and there is apprehension of defeating the very purpose with which the PMLA was enacted.” The petition also mentioned, “It would be further just and necessary to make it mandatory for the ED to register an Enforcement Case Information Report even on the basis of a complaint/information given by a person/citizen, if such a complaint/information discloses scheduled offences.” Stressing on the need for transparency, the PIL pointed out, “It is difficult to believe that after a lapse of more than 20 months, the ED has “material” only to arrest the husband of Chanda Kochhar, former managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, Deepak Kochhar, who is one amongst several accused persons allegedly involved in a scam of over Rs. 1,700 crores.” The plea sought to bring about coordination among agencies, encourage whistle-blowers, put an end to abuse of powers by public officers who take shelter under the veils of undue secrecy and protect the liberties of victims of witch-hunting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/make-eds-functioning-transparent-pil-in-hc/article32720355.ece
29 September 2020||Mumbai,||Something fishy in BMC demolition of Kangana’s house: HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday said, “there is something absolutely fishy here”, while referring to the manner in which portions of actor Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow at Pali Hill in Bandra were demolished by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and R.I. Chagla had summoned Bhagyawant Late, the designated officer of BMC’s H West Ward, and questioned him about the demolition drive. Mr. Late said there was no report prepared on the site. When Justice Kathawalla asked, “Why didn’t you take photos to show that work was being done on the site?” The officer had no answer. Referring to other cases where notices were issued days before demolition. Justice Kathawalla said, “Here [Ms. Ranaut’s] notice was sent on September 8 and demolition on September 9,” Justice Kathawalla asked Mr. Late for the demolition register and he said the online system shows the demolition was carried out on September 8. Justice Kathawalla replied, “But you have no proof to show the demolition was carried out on September 8. There are no photographs to show that.” Justice Kathawalla said, “There is something absolutely fishy here. There are no photographs. No date of demolition. No demolition report. No date and time.” The Bench heard the matter the entire day, with senior advocate Birendra Saraf representing the actor, playing an audio clip of Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut’s comments on Ms. Ranaut. Mr. Saraf contended that the demolition was vitiated by malice and a vindictive action against his client for her remarks on the Maharashtra government. He said Mr. Raut used derogatory language against Mr. Ranaut and called her, “haraamkhor” and said she needs to be “taught a lesson.” He said Ms. Ranaut had been at loggerheads with the government and criticised the State on Twitter. Mr. Saraf submitted all the tweets by Ms. Ranaut after the court directed him to do so. Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, appearing for the BMC, said there has been “stunning silence on how the renovations took place”. He said large alterations and additions were carried out by Ms Ranaut and construction work was going on. He said, “She was obligated to tell us [BMC] on September 7. You [Ms. Ranaut] deliberately chose not to tell us.” He said the BMC officials saw five workmen and one supervisor on the site with gunny bags and plywood. Advocate Pradeep Thorat will file an affidavit on behalf of Mr. Raut on Tuesday and present arguments at 3 p.m..||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/something-fishy-in-bmc-demolition-of-kanganas-house-hc/article32720357.ece

Shailendrakumar Yadav (32), owner of a dairy and sweet mart at Sector 18 in Ulwe, said in his complaint that the accused reached his shop in a drunken state at 7.30 p.m. and threatened to post a video on his YouTube channel, Navi Mumbai Ulwe News, about him violating lockdown rules if he doesn’t pay up Rs. 2,000. “When Mr. Yadav turned him away, the accused fired his gun. People panicked and Mr. Yadav hid inside his shop. Mr. Chowdhary then fled the scene,” senior police inspector Pramod Jadhav said. The police said the accused, a resident of Sector 18 in Ulwe, had fired an air gun. “When fired, the gun produces sound and smoke. We have sent the gun for forensic examination. We are also trying to find out from where he got the gun,” Mr. Jadhav said. The accused has completed his BA in mass communication and claims to have acted in a crime series. Mr. Chowdhary has been arrested under Sections 384 (extortion) and 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. He was produced before the court on Monday and remanded in police custody till October 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/man-held-for-extortion/article32720351.ece

29 September 2020||Pune,||Possible to overthrow JD(U)-BJP alliance in Bihar polls: VBA chief||Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar on Monday said the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar could be overthrown if the Ambedkarite, Muslim and Adivasi communities came together. Mr. Ambedkar, who had experimented with a new political equation in Maharashtra by allying with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, said the VBA was looking to form similar regional alliances in the upcoming 243-seat Bihar Assembly election as well. “In Bihar, Muslims, Ambedkarites and Adivasis together constitute 40% of the State’s population. This combined force can bring down any government. If the NDA [Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)-BJP coalition] in Bihar falls, then it is possible to overthrow the NDA at the Centre as well… the Modi government has shown itself to be against citizenship… I urge educated Muslims to think before exercising their franchise this time,” said Mr. Ambedkar, the eldest grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. Remarking that the VBA was eager to usher in a new equation in the country’s politics, he said the first step in this experimentation was undertaken in Maharashtra, where his party had forged an alliance with the AIMIM. “That alliance was successful in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. While I had hoped to take it further, that did not happen. But what did not happen here [in Maharashtra] can take place in Bihar… our avowed objective of contesting the Bihar Assembly election is to defeat the NDA,” he said. The VBA chief, who recently toured the poll-bound State, said he would announce his party’s strategy for the Bihar Assembly election in the next few days. The Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (the original name of Mr. Ambedkar’s party) had, amid great fanfare, forged an alliance with Mr. Owaisi’s AIMIM in November 2018. At the time, the coalition was projected — and perceived — as a possible ‘game changer’ in Maharashtra politics with its aim to capture the Dalit-Muslim votes traditionally held by the Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The VBA-AIMIM alliance queered the pitch for the Congress and the NCP in at least 10 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats by cannibalising the latter parties’ traditional Dalit-minority votebank. Despite winning only one seat (that of Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad), the alliance managed several major upsets in the State by splitting votes that helped ensure the defeats of Swabhimani Paksha leader Raju Shetti in Hatkanangale (Kolhapur), and senior Congressmen Sushilkumar Shinde (in Solapur) and Ashok Chavan (in Nanded) among others. However, the VBA-AIMIM political honeymoon soon turned sour by the time of the Assembly poll in October last year, degenerating into bitter mutual recrimination over seat-sharing. Mr. Jaleel, the AIMIM’s most formidable representative in Maharashtra, claimed that Mr. Ambedkar had offered his party a paltry eight of the 288 Assembly seats. Mr. Ambedkar defended himself by claiming that neither he nor his party had ever slammed the door on alliance talks.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||‘Political parties have used Mahadalits as vote bank for decades’||As political parties in Bihar are vying with each other to woo the Mahadalit votes, The Hindu caught up with Fr (Prof.) Tomy Nishaant , a Jesuit priest of the Patna Province of the Society of Jesus, who has written a book on Musahars, “Musahars: a Noble People, a Resilient Culture”. Excerpts:  How are the Musahars significant in a State like Bihar? The Musahars are the third largest Scheduled Caste group in Bihar, after the Chamars and Dusadhs. According to Census 2011, they are about 27.25 lakh... they must be 35-40 lakh by now. Former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi is of the opinion that they will not be less than 60 lakh. They are densely populated in districts like Gaya, Madhepura, Khagaria, Purnea. In reserved Assembly constituencies here, the Musahars have a big say in the election. In 2015, six MLAs were from this community. The Musahars and Rajwars are offshoots of the Bhuiya tribe and if we put all of them together, they will be the largest SC group in Bihar who can bargain for a bigger share of the political cake. Who was the first member from Musahar community to contest election in Bihar and how politically conscious is this community today? Kiray Musahar was the first one to contest the first Lok Sabha election in 1952 from Madhepura on a Socialist Party ticket. He fought and won against the Congress. After that we had many prominent leaders like late Misri Sada, late Naval Kishor Bharati, late Bhagawati Devi, Jitan Ram Manjhi. There were 6.5% SC MLAs in 1952 but in 2010 and 2015, there are 23% and 15.4% respectively. Have the successive State governments done something for their upliftment? All the governments keep promising and announcing schemes. But when we look at the ground reality, it is a dismal picture. However, one good thing that happened in the previous RJD government was that many benefited from the Indira Awas Scheme. This is due to Lalu Prasad Yadav, who asked them to build their own houses in three stages instead of asking the contractors. This ensured the participation of people’s labour and construction of rather liveable houses. In the last 15 years, the Nitish government did start schemes in the name of the Mountain Man, Dashrath Manjhi. But I do not think that the Musahars benefited much as the middlemen looted quite a big percentage. Lack of enlightened and empowered leadership among the Musahars is also a big drawback. Do you think political parties use Musahars as a vote bank? No doubt at all. This has been happening for decades. Have the Musahars been deceived even by leaders from their own community? As far as I know, Misri Sada, Naval Kishore Bharati and Bhagawati Devi lived a very simple life and cared for their people. The modern leaders are absorbed by the present system. Despite so much focus on Musahars, why has their condition remained the same? Lack of empowering and enlightening education. No political mobilisation as it happened in the case of Paswans (Ram Vilas Paswan). Centuries of oppression resulting in a rather dead consciousness and lack of motivation. Caste oppression: the dominant castes conferred the name Musahars which is derogatory. They are victims of severe caste discriminations and exclusions. No effective land distribution. Almost 95% of Musahars are landless labourers. If they were given land, they would have been much stronger. What prompted you to write this book? I lived with the Musahars of Sikandarpur village, Danapur block, for 10 months in 1989-1990. What I could not understand was that though these people were subjected to abject poverty, illiteracy, landlessness, alcoholism, malnutrition, ill health, they did not show much interest in the developmental schemes of the government as well as the initiatives of Manthan, an NGO, of which I was part of. I wanted to find out the reasons for their apathy, their exclusion from mainstream. I believe that this will accelerate their integral liberation.  No political mobilisation as in the case of the Paswans hampered growth of the Musahars||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/political-parties-have-used-mahadalits-as-vote-bank-for-decades/article32720589.ece

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Trump’s tax returns show chronic losses||President Donald Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750. He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made. As the President wages a re-election campaign that polls say he is in danger of losing, his finances are under stress, beset by losses and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt coming due that he has personally guaranteed. Also hanging over him is a decade-long audit battle with the Internal Revenue Service over the legitimacy of a $72.9 million tax refund that he claimed, and received, after declaring huge losses. An adverse ruling could cost him more than $100 million. The tax returns that Mr. Trump has long fought to keep private tell a story fundamentally different from the one he has sold to the American public. His reports to the IRS portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes. Now, with his financial challenges mounting, the records show that he depends more and more on making money from businesses that put him in potential and often direct conflict of interest with his job as President. Two decades’ data The New York Times has obtained tax-return data extending over more than two decades for Mr. Trump and the hundreds of companies that make up his business organisation, including detailed information from his first two years in office. It does not include his personal returns for 2018 or 2019. This article offers an overview of The Times’ findings; additional articles will be published in the coming weeks. In Mr. Trump’s nearly four years in office,journalists, prosecutors, opposition politicians and conspiracists have, with limited success, sought to excavate the enigmas of his finances. By their very nature, the filings will leave many questions unanswered, many questioners unfulfilled. They comprise information that Mr. Trump has disclosed to the IRS, not the findings of an independent financial examination. They report that Mr. Trump owns hundreds of millions of dollars in valuable assets, but they do not reveal his true wealth. Nor do they reveal any previously unreported connections to Russia. In response to a letter summarising the findings, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organisation, said that “most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate” and requested the documents on which they were based. After The Times declined to provide the records, in order to protect its sources, Mr. Garten took direct issue only with the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid. Personal taxes “Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,” Mr. Garten said in a statement. With the term “personal taxes,” however, Mr. Garten appears to be conflating income taxes with other federal taxes Mr. Trump has paid — Social Security, Medicare and taxes for his household employees. Mr. Garten also asserted that some of what the President owed was “paid with tax credits”, a misleading characterisation of credits, which reduce a business owner’s income-tax bill as a reward for various activities, like historic preservation.NY Times||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trumps-tax-returns-show-chronic-losses/article32720054.ece
29 September 2020||COLOMBO,||Tamil parties hold hartal in north and east Sri Lanka||Following a call from Tamil political parties and civil society groups for a hartal, Sri Lanka’s Tamil-majority north and east shut down on Monday to protest against the Rajapaksa administration’s “undemocratic actions” and attempts to “stifle dissent”. The development comes days after a magistrate court barred a memorial event to remember Thileepan, a political leader with the LTTE who fasted unto death in 1987, while urging the Indian government to keep its promise to the Tamils. Protesting against the court order, Tamil leaders across political parties and activists observed a fast on Saturday, calling for a hartal to assert their right to remember Thileepan and to resist the order banning the memorial event. Local Tamil media reported that Monday's hartal witnessed a near-total shutdown in the island's Northern and Eastern Provinces, where many schools and shops remained closed all day. Thileepan’s resistance [from September 15 to 26, 1987] centred on five main demands, including the release of Tamils detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, Sinhala “colonisation” and withdrawal of Sri Lankan troops from schools. In a speech in front of Jaffna Fort, shortly before commencing his fast, Thileepan said: “Accords have been brought about by our enemies to dampen national fervour whenever this shows signs of boiling over. Today, the Indo-Lanka accord is meant to suppress the thirst of the people for liberation,” according to Broken Palmyra¸ authored by academics Rajan Hoole, Daya Somasundaram, K. A. Sritharan and Rajani Thiranagama. Indian intervention during the civil war years came under sharp criticism, especially around the time the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 was signed, and the subsequent arrival of the Indian Peace Keeping Force, which was present on the island on a “peace keeping” mission until 1990.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tamil-parties-hold-hartal-in-north-and-east-sri-lanka/article32720045.ece
29 September 2020||Washington,||TikTok gets reprieve in U.S. as judge halts download ban||A U.S. federal judge on Sunday halted a politically charged ban ordered by the Donald Trump administration on downloads of the popular video app TikTok, hours before it was set to take effect. District Judge Carl Nichols issued a temporary injunction at the request of TikTok, which the White House has called a national security threat alleging that its Chinese parent firm is tied to the Beijing government. The opinion was sealed, so no reason for the decision was released in a one-page order by the court in Washington. The Trump administration order sought to ban new downloads of the app from midnight but would allow use of TikTok until November 12, when all usage would be blocked. The judge denied TikTok’s request to suspend the November 12 ban. Judge Nichols heard arguments on the free-speech and national security implications of the ban on the Chinese-owned app. TikTok lawyer John Hall said a ban would be “punitive” and close off a public forum used by tens of millions of Americans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tiktok-gets-reprieve-in-us-as-judge-halts-download-ban/article32720052.ece
29 September 2020||Yerevan/Baku,||Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes enter second day, toll rises||Fierce fighting raged between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces on Monday, sparking bellicose rhetoric from regional power Turkey despite international pleas for a halt in fighting between the longtime enemies. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a territorial dispute over the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorny Karabakh for decades, with deadly fighting flaring up earlier this year and in 2016. The region declared its independence from Azerbaijan after a war in the early 1990s that claimed 30,000 lives but is not recognised by any country — including Armenia — and is still considered part of Azerbaijan by the international community. Fighting between Muslim Azerbaijan and majority-Christian Armenia could embroil regional players such as Russia, which has a military alliance with Armenia, and Turkey, which backs Azerbaijan. Karabakh's Defence Ministry said 27 fighters were killed in fighting Monday — after previously reporting 28 — bringing their total military losses to 58. The overall death toll rose to 67, including nine civilian deaths: seven in Azerbaijan and two on the Armenian side. Azerbaijan has not reported any military casualties, but Armenian separatist officials released footage showing burnt-out armoured vehicles and the bloodied and charred remains of soldiers in camouflage it said were Azerbaijani troops. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on Monday ordered partial military mobilisation. With each side blaming the other for the latest fighting, world leaders have urged calm as fears rise of a full-scale conflict. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was monitoring the situation closely and that the priority was to “stop the hostilities, not to deal with who is right and who is wrong.” But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded Armenia end its “occupation” of Karabakh. In addition to the EU and Russia, France, Germany, Italy and the United States have urged a ceasefire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/armenia-azerbaijan-clashes-enter-second-day-toll-rises/article32720044.ece
29 September 2020||RALEIGH,||Suit filed over postal ballot rule changes||President Donald Trump’s campaign committee and the Republican National Committee sued on Saturday to block North Carolina election officials from enforcing rule changes that could boost the number of ballots counted in the presidential battleground state. The Republicans’ lawsuit claims a new system adopted by the State Board of Elections will allow for absentee ballots to be cast late and without proper witness verification. The elections board on Tuesday issued new guidance allowing mail-in absentee ballots with deficient information to be fixed without forcing the voter to fill out a new blank ballot for November’s general election. The change means absentee voters, who don’t provide complete information on their envelope about a witness who saw them filling out the ballot, won’t have to complete a new ballot and locate another witness. A voter will just have to turn in an affidavit confirming they filled out the original ballot. ‘Backroom deal’ North Carolina is one of eight states with witness and/or notary public requirements for absentee ballots, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. North Carolina General Assembly leaders announced late Saturday they had also filed a similar lawsuit in federal court against board members. They asked a judge to block enforcement of the board’s absentee ballot alterations, which they contend would wrest away from the legislature its constitutional job to set the rules for federal elections. The national Republicans’ federal lawsuit claims the state elections board made a partisan “backroom deal” that undermines state lawmakers’ “carefully-considered, balanced structure of election laws.” The suit claims the board’s guidance usurps a law that says a ballot may only be accepted if it has a witness signature on it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/suit-filed-over-postal-ballot-rule-changes/article32720049.ece
29 September 2020||ISLAMABAD,||Pak. SC accepts appeal by Daniel Pearl’s family||Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Monday accepted an appeal by the family of slain American journalist Daniel Pearl seeking to keep a British-born Pakistani man on death row over the beheading of the Wall Street Journal reporter. The court delayed until next week hearing the appeal over the lower-court acquittal of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been on death row since his conviction in 2002 over Pearl’s killing. Sheikh had been convicted of helping lure Pearl to a meeting in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi, in which he was kidnapped. Pearl had been investigating the link between Pakistani militants and Richard C. Reid, dubbed the “Shoe Bomber” after trying to blow up a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden in his shoes. The lower court’s April ruling acquitted Sheikh and three other accomplices, who had been sentenced to life in jail for their role in the plot. The lower court found Sheikh guilty on a single lesser charge of abduction, which he is also appealing. The acquittal stunned the U.S. government and Pearl’s family. “We felt like (it was) a thunderstorm that is about to reopen our pains of 2002,” Pearl’s father Judea Pearl told in an email Monday. “Pakistan’s judicial system caved to either inside or outside pressure to send a message of impunity to extremist elements worldwide.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-sc-accepts-appeal-by-daniel-pearls-family/article32720048.ece
29 September 2020||Islamabad,||Shehbaz Sharif arrested ahead of protest launch||Pakistani anti-corruption officials arrested the country’s opposition leader on Monday, days after he vowed to help lead efforts to dislodge Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government. Shehbaz Sharif — who heads the Opposition in the country’s National Assembly — was arrested in Lahore after the eastern city’s high court rejected a bail plea in a money-laundering case. “We are not scared of these arrests,” said Marriyum Aurangzeb, spokeswoman for Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N). Mr. Sharif is the brother of three-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted over corruption allegations in 2017 and is currently residing in Britain after being released from prison earlier this year for medical treatment. The arrest comes as Opposition parties have reignited efforts to remove Mr. Khan from office, vowing earlier this month to launch a protest movement in the coming weeks demanding the government’s resignation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/shehbaz-sharif-arrested-ahead-of-protest-launch/article32720047.ece

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Imperatives after India’s September virus peak||India’s COVID-19 epidemic curve appears to have peaked during the middle two weeks, in September 2020, followed by a downtrend since then — if we work backwards for four weeks from September 26, 2020. Let the numbers tell the story. What the data reveals The weekly totals of reported new infections in those middle two weeks, namely, September 5 to 11 and September 12 to 18, were 6,37,136 and 6,48,096 cases, respectively. The week before the peak (August 29 to September 4), the total was 5,58,999. And the week after the peak (September 19 to 25), the number was 5,96,096 cases. During the two peak weeks, the weekly average was 642,616 cases, and in the two flanking weeks, the average was 577,547 cases. The mean daily numbers in the pre-peak week were 79,857; on no day did the number reach 90,000. During the two peak weeks, the mean daily number was 91,801; on 12 days, the number had exceeded 90,000. In the post-peak week, the mean daily number was 85,156; only on the first day of that week did the day’s number cross 90,000 cases. As the numbers of documented infections are determined partly by the daily volume of tests, which had declined during the last several days, there cannot be too much reliance on these numbers alone. We need additional supportive evidence. Lab tests, herd immunity What is the hidden burden of infections in India? The report of the sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in May-June and published in September, gave us some surprises. It showed that the number of infections detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR testing was a small fraction of the total burden in the community that remained undetected. For every laboratory-diagnosed infection, there were 80 to 100 undocumented infections in the country. As of September 26, when we analysed the numbers, the cumulative total of laboratory-proven burden of infection for India was 5,990,581, a mere 9,419 short of six million. Using the correction factor of 80-100 proposed by the ICMR, India’s total burden of infection was between 480 million and 600 million. In India’s population of 1,380 million, the proportion infected — in other words the herd immunity — was in the range of 35% and 43%. Since about 30% herd immunity is sufficient to reach the peak of the epidemic curve, we can be confident that India indeed has reached the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. In an epidemic of a directly human-to-human transmitted microbe, graphically represented by the more or less symmetric bell-shaped epidemic curve, about equal numbers of people will be infected before the peak and after the peak. That is during the epidemic phase. For the pandemic influenza of 2009 which had about the same degree of infectiousness, a proportion of individuals remained uninfected, constituting the pool of susceptible people who sustained its endemic phase. Annual birth cohorts, about 27 million in India, add to the susceptible pool. The true addition will be about 25 million, the rest deducted for premature mortality.  Post-peak scenario If 35% of the population was infected pre-peak, another 35% will be infected post-peak, for a total of 70% during the epidemic. The residuum of 30% is sufficient to sustain the microbe in the human population, but not as an epidemic but as low numbers, which is the endemic phase of infection. The endemic phase is perpetual, unless interrupted by vaccination. As more people are infected, new cohorts of children replace them to make the numbers up. By simple arithmetic we can foresee some 20-25 million infections annually. The logic is that input and output have to be balanced in any steady state system, endemic prevalence included. In short, we must anticipate 15-18 infections per 1,000 population every year — more in some years and less in others. When can we expect the epidemic to settle down and become an endemic phase? Our epidemic began in mid-March and peaked after six months, in mid-September. So it is reasonable to assume that the epidemic will continue for a further six months, until mid-March 2021, before it turns endemic. Vaccination and antibody test The steady state is over the long term, not the short term. So, unless interfered with using vaccination, we can expect low seasons and high seasons; low years and high years. That is what influenza has taught us. However, the risk of severe disease and death will remain among senior citizens and those with chronic diseases. Vaccination is the ready answer to prevent death in these vulnerable subjects. How will a vaccine modulate these numbers? As we had said in this daily on August 13, 2020, in an article (Editorial page; https://bit.ly/36f2DaP), “More than a vaccine, it is about vaccination”, a vaccination programme is necessary to protect life and reduce the disease burden. If a vaccine becomes available during the epidemic phase, the epidemic can be cut short quickly. During the endemic phase, vaccination can protect vulnerable individuals. Protection is important for those who are susceptible to severe disease and death, namely senior citizens and those with comorbidity. Identification of susceptible subjects is possible using an antibody test. Ideally, the immunoglobulins, IgG, IgA and IgM, should be tested, as in Iceland where country-wide screening was done. If 70% of the population is infected, vaccination is required only in the remaining 414 million people and also the ~7,50,000 new additions per day by birth. The number that needs the antibody tests is about 1,368 million, assuming that nearly 12 million would have had confirmed infection by the time a vaccine is available. Known infected and antibody positive persons need not be vaccinated. Since an antibody test will be cheaper than a vaccination with two doses, funds can be conserved if the need for vaccination is determined first. The government should create facilities for large-scale antibody testing with indigenous production of test reagents. These steps, large-scale total antibody testing and vaccine delivery for those who are antibody negative will entail expenses that must be accommodated in the budgetary allocation for health. They can be more than recovered by the liberation of the economy from COVID-19 constraints. Using India’s strength at WHO We also have a unique opportunity to eradicate COVID-19 altogether if we prepare now for the strategic use of vaccines globally. Judging by the speed with which Phase 3 trials are progressing, we can expect a few vaccines emerging before March 2021. Eradication is a global need, for which India can provide leadership, with Indian officials of influence in the World Health Organization.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||UN and the retreat from multilateralism||The United Nations commemorated its 75th anniversary on September 21, 2020 by adopting a Declaration. The anniversary comes at a time when the world is witnessing a retreat from multilateralism. It also faces an unprecedented pandemic. In his address to the UN on September 22, the UN Secretary-General called the pandemic “the fifth horseman”. No one could have predicted it. It has also brought in its wake the deepest recession the world has seen since the 1930s. This has made it more difficult to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the UN had adopted. The Secretary-General said the world is “careening off track” in achieving the SDGs. Challenge to multilateralism The challenge to multilateralism is coming not from the have-nots, but the main stakeholders of the system. The U.S. is not alone in withdrawing from multilateralism. Brexit has shown that nationalism remains strong in Europe. It has delivered a blow to the idea of Europe, united and whole. Nevertheless, the most important development is the position of the U.S. As French President Emmanuel Macron remarked in his speech at the UN General Assembly, the U.S., which created the international system as we know today, is no longer willing to be its “guarantor of last resort”. U.S. President Donald Trump stressed “America First” in his speech, and suggested that others too should put their countries first. China has stepped in to take advantage of the West’s retreat from multilateralism. But China’s assertion of a role on the world stage is not an embrace of the idea of multilateralism. Its flagship Belt and Road Initiative consists of a series of bilateral credit agreements with recipient countries with no mechanism for multilateral consultation or oversight. Curiously, President Xi Jinping’s speech at the UN General Assembly did not mention it. The European Union’s and U.S.’s sanctions against Russia have driven it closer to China. The rift between the permanent members of the Security Council has already started affecting the work of the UN Security Council. The speeches at the regular session of the UN General Assembly on September 22 brought out the clashing perspectives of the U.S. and China. President Trump highlighted China’s culpability in the spread of the pandemic. He pointed out that China had banned internal flights but allowed international flights from Wuhan to continue. This set the stage for the spread of COVID-19. The World Health Organization also failed to provide early warnings. President Xi’s speech sought to project the fight against COVID-19 as a matter of collective responsibility of the international community. He said China will “honour” its commitment to provide $2 billion assistance to the developing countries over two years. This was clearly a reference to existing pledges without bringing additional resources to tackle a crisis which has tipped the world economy into recession. This is not a large amount considering the scale. The actual assistance committed to the UN COVID-19 response fund was a paltry $50 million in addition to a similar amount pledged earlier. President Macron pointed out that while the U.S. is withdrawing, the world faces China’s projection beyond its frontiers. He also highlighted problems nearer home posed by Turkey’s intervention in Syria, Libya, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which is a breach of international law. The last was a reference to Turkey sending a drilling ship in Greek and Cypriot exclusive economic zones. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made a detailed reference to the Jammu and Kashmir issue. Though otherwise Mr. Erdogan’s statements may not matter, Turkey has assumed the position of UN General Assembly President. Several hurdles The UN Secretary-General’s report on the work of the organisation highlights some of the achievements and challenges the world body faces. Over 40 UN political missions and peacekeeping operations engage 95,000 troops, police, and civil personnel. To be effective, they have to be put on a sound financial basis. The UN peacekeeping budget, a little over $8 billion, is a small fraction of the $1.9 trillion military expenditure governments made in 2019. Yet it suffers from a paucity of resources. There was an outstanding assessed contribution of $1.7 billion for peacekeeping activities by the end of the financial year. Similarly, there was an outstanding $711 million in the assessed contribution for the general budget. Most of the humanitarian assistance, developmental work, and budgets of the specialised agencies are based on voluntary contributions. There are calls for increasing public-private partnerships. This is not a satisfactory arrangement. The UN provides ‘public goods’ in terms of peace and development often in remote parts of the world. There may not be enough appetite on the part of corporations. The UN remains an inter-governmental body. Most world leaders spoke of climate change. President Trump mentioned that China’s emissions are nearly twice of those of the U.S., and despite its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. has reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the world. President Xi said that after peaking emissions by 2030, China will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. President Macron said that he was determined to see the EU agree on a target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, in his speech made an extensive reference to Jammu and Kashmir. Though this is customary for Pakistani leaders, he brought a particularly uncivil tone to the discourse. Meanwhile, his country has slid to the 134th rank in the UN SDG index, the lowest for any country in South Asia. Prime Minister Narendra Modi focused on UN reforms and India’s contribution to UN Peacekeeping for which we can be justly proud. What does the UN bring to the developing countries? It gives them greater political space. We need to support reform not only to expand the permanent members’ category of the Security Council but also to revitalise the role of the General Assembly. The retreat from multilateralism would undermine the UN’s capacity to face diverse challenges. D.P. Srivastava is former Ambassador to Iran.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||A soldier, diplomat, politician and mentor||I first met Jaswant Singh in the days following India’s nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, 1998. As the Ministry of External Affairs official dealing with nuclear issues, I was to draft Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee’s address to Parliament due to open on May 27 while handling the flood of communications with our Embassies and outreach with Delhi-based Embassies and media. Every few days, Mr. Vajpayee would convene a meeting to take stock of the international fallout and Jaswant Singh, then Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, was a permanent invitee. As the draft speech and the nuclear policy paper went back and forth, Mr. Vajpayee’s trust and regard for him soon became evident. Jaswant Singh had spent under a decade in the Indian Army but clearly had studied and thought deeply about India’s security dilemmas and challenges. He also had a vision of 21st-century India that Mr. Vajpayee shared. Hardly surprising, then, that the following month, he was entrusted with the responsibility of opening dialogue with the United States, a daunting task because the Clinton administration had come down heavily on India, taking the lead in the UN Security Council in drafting a highly critical resolution and imposing sanctions. The American negotiations U.S. President Bill Clinton had originally planned a visit to India in early 1998, postponed to late 1998 because of the elections that brought the Vajpayee government to power. The nuclear tests left the U.S. administration stunned and embarrassed. Jaswant Singh was visiting New York for a UN meeting in early June; a message was conveyed to the White House that he would be available to come to Washington for talks. While he was not Foreign Minister, he held cabinet rank as Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was travelling, so it was appropriate that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott (who would be acting Secretary) could engage the visitor. And thus began the dialogue between India and the U.S., an engagement that is best described as the most intense, the most inconclusive and yet, the most productive. After 16 meetings between June 1998 and September 2000 in seven cities, the tide turned with the highly successful Clinton visit in March 2000 and Mr. Vajpayee’s return visit in September 2000 when Mr. Clinton hosted his largest state dinner at the White House. From “estranged democracies”, India and the U.S. became “natural partners for the 21st century”. I was privileged to be a part of the team and consider it a masterclass in diplomatic negotiations. The U.S. position was guided by progress on five benchmarks for India that were also part of the UN Security Council resolution — sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that had been concluded in 1996; join the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty negotiations being pushed in Geneva; accept a freeze on developing nuclear arsenal; tighten export controls on sensitive materials and technologies; and engage in dialogue to reduce tensions with Pakistan. Jaswant Singh took Mr. Vajpayee’s speech and the nuclear policy paper tabled in Parliament as his reference frame. He elaborated on India’s security concerns, elements of credible minimum deterrence as evidence of India’s restraint, adoption of a no-first-use use policy to ensure stability, voluntary declaration of a moratorium on further nuclear testing and India’s continuing commitment to responsible non-proliferation despite not being party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). While both agreed that neither was looking for short cuts, Strobe Talbott emphasised compliance with the benchmarks while Jaswant Singh focused on securing better appreciation of India’s security compulsions that would compel any democratic government to do what India had. What brand Jaswant was Ramrod straight, beetle-browed, wearing his trademark army-style khaki bush shirt, Jaswant Singh’s most distinctive feature was his resonant baritone that he used equally skilfully, to make a short, decisive point and close a discussion or to spin long, complex sentences to stymie an inquisitive journalist or leave his interlocutor pondering. Another hallmark was his recourse to homespun aphorisms. In the early days of his dialogue with Strobe Talbott, Jaswant cited an old saying, “There is merit in asking for directions only if we know the village we are going to.” As Strobe Talbott later acknowledged, “Jaswant’s strategy was more directional than destinational” and laid the grounds for the lifting of sanctions, introducing the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership leading to the 2008 U.S.-India civilian nuclear deal. The China meet On another occasion in Manila in July 1998, we had our first meeting (since the tests) with the Chinese on the margins of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum. The meeting began frostily, with China’s Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan blaming India for its provocative actions. He added, “There is an old Chinese saying — he who ties a knot must untie the knot.” Jaswant Singh arched his eyebrows and said, “In my village in Rajasthan, we too have a saying — it takes two hands to untie a knot”. The meeting with Tang Jiaxuan, scheduled to last for 20 minutes lasted an hour. Before the end of the year, I was in Beijing to lay the ground for a new security dialogue between the two countries. Rest in peace, valiant soldier, for you did your country proud.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Dalit politics at a crossroads||In the 1990s, when Hindutva forces launched the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Dalit-Bahujan movement and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), invoked subaltern myths and icons to counter it. Kanshi Ram gathered Dalit icons from oral and folk narratives and reinvented minor characters of the Ramayana and Mahabharata in the process of developing a counter-Hindutva narrative. The icons he invoked included Shambuka, Eklavya, Uda Devi, Jhalkaribai, and Rabidas. This helped mobilise the Bahujans in Uttar Pradesh and resulted in a BSP-led government in U.P. four times. The myths and icons of the Dalits questioned and ruptured the dominance of one narrative. Invoking Lord Parshuram Contrast this to what is happening now. In August, when the ‘bhoomi pujan’ for the Ram temple took place in Ayodhya, attended by the Prime Minister, BSP leader Mayawati supported it. At the same time, Ms. Mayawati promised to pay respect to the memory of Lord Parshuram by building hospitals in his name and even a statue of him bigger than the 108-feet tall statue that the Samajwadi Party (SP) promised to erect. The two opposition parties in U.P. seem to be competing with each other to influence a section of the Brahmin community which is unhappy with the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party regime in U.P. Lord Parshuram is worshiped by various Brahmin sub-castes as their kulpurush (progenitor of a clan). Parshuram is not a subversive icon; he is, like Lord Ram, an avatar of Lord Vishnu. He appears for a brief moment in the story of the Ramayana to strengthen the moral authority of Lord Ram. Though he is seen in some narratives as contesting the myth of Lord Ram, in the Tulsikrit Ramayana, he is seen in a supportive role. In short, while in the 1990s Kanshi Ram successfully countered the Lord Ram-centred Hindutva narrative, now Ms. Mayawati’s effort to invoke Lord Parshuram may blur the effort of building a radical Dalit consciousness. One may justify her current symbolic act as a process of reinvention. Perhaps she is trying to subvert the myth of Lord Parshuram to sharpen contradictions within the Hindutva base. But this could be beneficial only in the short term. In the long term, it may be counterproductive for the politics of the marginalised. It may diminish the assertion of their identity against dominant power and culture. If we analyse the making of Dalit consciousness in north India, we see that it is mainly inspired by Bhakti saints such as Sant Kabir, Sant Ravidas and Swami Shivnarayan. They were saints who emerged progenitors of reform movements within the structure of Sanatana Hindu religion, but they added many radical elements in the process. These saints did not inspire Dalits to aggressively depart from Sanatana Hinduism. The Adi Hindu movement In the 19th century, Dalits were deeply influenced by Swami Achhootanand, the founder of the Adi Hindu movement. Swami Achhootanand inspired Dalits to get educated and launched a movement for this around the 1920s, even before B.R. Ambedkar did. He established a Dalit printing press in U.P. He published a magazine in U.P. for Dalits which gave space to them to write and publish their articles. Ambedkar used to refer to Swami Achhootanand as ‘Swamiji’. Swami Achhootanand is a popular icon for a section of the Dalit communities in U.P.; yet, no political party has projected him as a Dalit hero in their attempt at mainstreaming the icons of the marginalised. But while on the one hand, Swami Achhootanand’s efforts evolved a radical consciousness which responds to Brahminical dominance, on the other, it also led to the idea of a Hindu identity in another form. His Adi Hindu movement proposed that Dalits, Adivasis and the marginalised are ‘Adi Hindu’. Ambedkar’s inspirational campaign urging Dalits to turn to Buddhism has slowly faded. The movement urging Dalits to convert to Buddhism has not gained momentum in the community, especially in north India. The longing among Dalits for a Hindu identity is growing stronger. This means that there is space both for improvisation of radical Dalit consciousness and to assert a sense of belonging to Hinduism. It is the leaders who decide the direction they want to take and the direction they want the community to take. Ms. Mayawati, who doesn’t seem to see much potential for her electoral politics by asserting a radical Dalit consciousness, seems to want to play Hindutva’s game on their own turf. How this game will play out will only be known in the long term. Badri Narayan is Director of the G.B.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||The missing postwomen||The Prime Minister has publicly stated that his government will give priority to women, especially physically challenged women, while providing government jobs in rural areas. But sadly, the Department of Post seems to still have a 19th century mindset. A dismal track record Village post offices all over the country are crying for want of attention. They are characterised by low morale, poor monetary incentives and a hierarchical management system that dates back to pre-Independence times. In the age of computers, emails and the Internet, the village postman is still highly respected. Nothing can replace face-to-face contact. He writes letters for illiterate mothers to their sons serving in the border areas and makes sure these letters are posted. He delivers money through money orders to poor families at their doorstep. Where else in the world do you have a letter delivered every day by hand in 6,00,000 villages? This happens only in India. However, the Department of Post still has very few village postwomen. Out of the 1.3 lakh post offices in rural areas, including the 24,000 sub post offices located in villages with a population between 5,000 and 10,000, one can count the number of postwomen on one hand. And to be sure, there are no physically challenged women posted in rural areas. This dismal situation needs to be rectified. The Minister for Communications must ask the Secretary of the Department of Post why India has such a dismal track record and rectify it. In February 2020, such an attempt was made. The Secretary of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment wrote on February 10, 2020 to the Secretary of the Department of Post requesting that well-trained physically challenged women be allowed to run the Aadhaar Enrolment Centres. In a letter dated February 19, the Secretary of the Department of Post replied that no “outsourced agent” can operate Aadhaar Enrolment Centres. It was forbidden by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to outsource these jobs, he said, so he was helpless. When a Member of the Postal Board was approached to speak to the Secretary, he said there was no point. On May 21, 2020, UIDAI sent a notification to the Secretary of the Department of Post that read: “UIDAI do not have any objection if DoP either appoints Divyang on its roll or hire them from any manpower outsourcing agency for carrying Aadhaar enrolment/ update work in post offices subject to availability of DoP official as verifier at the centre.” Despite this notification, he remained unmoved. Further, the Director General of Post sent a circular asking other senior postal officers whether this would be a wise move. The Department of Post seems to really need a crash course on gender sensitivity. Unexplained resistance It is the end of September; yet the Secretary of the Department of Post has not issued any orders for physically challenged rural women to operate the Aadhaar Enrolment Centres. The sub-post office in the village of Tilonia in Ajmer district of Rajasthan has an Aadhaar Centre. A qualified physically challenged woman is ready to operate the Aadhaar Centre. But it has been many months now and there seems to be great resistance from the Department of Post to break this glass ceiling. Can the Minister please personally intervene? When in doubt, set up a Committee. The mandate of this Committee should be to explore the practical possibilities of immediately hiring the daughters, some physically challenged, of village postmen who have retired or are about to retire looking for employment and security. That would indeed be a great achievement for the Department of Post.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Two speeches||The speeches at the UN General Assembly, by Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan, and a day later by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were a study in contrasts. Mr. Modi focused on India’s own role on the world stage and the need to reform the UN and expand the Security Council to give India more representation. Mr. Khan focused less time on Pakistan, launching a broadside against India. Mr. Modi made no reference to Pakistan, and spoke about terrorism only in broader terms. A reply to Mr. Khan’s speech was left to an Indian diplomat, who described it as an “incessant rant” and “lies, misinformation and warmongering”. Mr. Khan’s references to India, which formed more than a third of his text, repeated the vilification in his previous speeches: accusing the Modi government of “state sponsorship of Islamophobia”, of following an “extremist ideology” of the RSS, which he claims is “inspired” by Nazi concepts of “racial purity and supremacy”, and of planning to “cleanse” the country of minorities. Extreme comparisons were made between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the Nuremberg laws, as well as between detention camps in Assam and the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Next, he launched into a diatribe on Jammu and Kashmir, more or less mirroring his speech of last year, which included accusations that the government’s moves to dilute Article 370 and reorganise J&K State into Union Territories were akin to a “final solution” of “genocide” for the State, and contravenes UN laws. He concluded with a reference to LoC tensions, where ceasefire violations have risen, ending on an exaggerated note that referred to Kashmir as a “nuclear flashpoint”. Mr. Khan’s speech can be easily countered, and dismissed, as the government has. Pakistan’s own record on minorities, including its own laws that even prevent minorities from holding high office, completely demolish Pakistan’s credentials to attack India, which is a constitutionally declared secular democracy. Mr. Khan’s accusations of Indian “state terrorism” come even as his country faces a decisive moment at the Financial Action Task Force in October, where Pakistan has been kept on a “grey list” since June 2018. His accusations on the reorganisation of J&K, and of attempting “demographic changes” are equally strange, given Pakistan has itself just declared Gilgit Baltistan a province and has carried out the resettlement of non-Kashmiris in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir for decades. Even if some of the concerns that were raised by Mr. Khan are also being debated inside India, sans the overdramatic characterisations, they are certainly not within the purview of another country, and not a legitimate subject for his address at the UN. While India can safely disregard his barbs, it must not underestimate their intent, as part of a larger strategy to consistently hurl these allegations against India, in the hope that some of it will stick.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/two-speeches/article32720022.ece
29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Making amends||India’s appeal to Sri Lanka to address the aspirations of its Tamil minority will certainly find resonance among the Tamil-speaking populace on both sides of the Palk Strait, but it is doubtful if it will have any effect. A joint statement by both countries after a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart, Mahinda Rajapaksa, on September 26, not only reiterated India’s stated policy of seeking to ensure “equality, justice, peace and respect within a united Sri Lanka” for Tamils, but explicitly mentioned the need to carry forward the reconciliation process through the implementation of the 13th Amendment to Sri Lanka’s Constitution. It said Mr. Rajapaksa expressed confidence that Sri Lanka would work towards “realising the expectations” of all ethnic groups, including Tamils. However, he appeared to qualify the commitment by linking it to “reconciliation nurtured as per the mandate of the people of Sri Lanka”. Significantly, a separate statement by Mr. Rajapaksa’s office issued later made no reference to the 13th Amendment, which envisaged power-sharing with the provinces based on the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord of 1987. The omission is unsurprising. Mr. Rajapaksa has the required two-thirds majority in Parliament to amend the Constitution as his party pleases, but the gulf between the sort of devolution that would fulfil Tamil aspirations and what his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, would want to prioritise is quite large. India’s interest in the matter is undoubtedly related to speculation that far from implementing the 13th Amendment, Sri Lanka may heed calls to roll back the provincial council system itself. The trajectory of relations, in which India is keen on limiting Sri Lanka’s exposure to China’s sphere of influence, may not afford the country much leverage over its smaller neighbour. When India was backing Sri Lanka after the war resumed in 2005-06, it chose to ignore the de-merger of the northern and eastern provinces. Now, when there is little global interest in holding Sri Lanka to its past promises on ethnic reconciliation and justice for war-time excesses, there is room for considerable scepticism about how effectual any appeal to the Sri Lankan regime would be. The Rajapaksas are aware of their mandates and are unlikely to do anything that does not have the approbation of the majority Sinhala community. While announcing steps on bilateral cooperation and a $15 million grant for Buddhist cultural exchanges, India held back its decision on Sri Lanka’s request for a currency swap and a deferment of debt. It would be watching developments on the legislative front, as the Rajapaksa administration plans to undo legislation that had curbed the President’s powers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/making-amends/article32720023.ece
29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||The true issue (From an editorial)||There seems to be still a considerable amount of misapprehension among the public as to the views which prevailed in the Special Congress session among political leaders in the country respecting the question of Non-Co-operation. The want of a full and accurate report of the proceedings of the Subjects Committee is one of the chief reasons for this misunderstanding. There was one section of leaders among whom were Sir Ashutosh Chandari, Mrs. Besant, Dewan Bahadur Govindaraghavier and others who were against the principle and programme of Non-Co-operation and urged the acceptance of the Reform Act as a partial instalment of Swaraj. It is this view which has found expression in the manifesto issued by Sir A. Chandari and others, as will appear from our telegraph columns. The exponents of this view formed however a very small minority in the Congress. The great majority of the delegates were decidedly in favour of the principle of Non-Co-operation. They were agreed as to the basic grounds on which the Congress should proceed to shape its future policy and action. They were firmly of opinion that constitutional methods of agitation have entirely failed to achieve our object.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-true-issue-from-an-editorial/article32720034.ece

Cairo television and radio abruptly halted regular programmes at 8-30 p.m. (24 hours I.S.T.) and began broadcasting verses from the Koran for 30 minutes after which Vice-President Anwar Sadat announced the death of President Nasser. President Nasser, who was 52, had been treated in the Soviet Union for diabetes and a circulatory ailment. He was the most powerful and controversial Arab leader in modern history. It was under his influence that Jordan’s King Hussein and Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian commandos, met in Cairo this week-end to sign a peace treaty ending the Jordanian civil war. There had been no indication of any serious illness which Nasser might have suffered from. He went to Moscow in July this year for treatment of diabetes, but doctors there said he returned to Cairo in good health. Sadat said, in the death announcement, that he could not “find the right words to express the deep sorrow which befell the U.A.R. and the Arab nation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/nasser-dead/article32720035.ece
29 September 2020||MUMBAI,||RBI postpones policy meeting||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has postponed the announcement of its monetary policy scheduled for October 1. The tenures of the three external members of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will end on September 30, a day before the policy is announced. The MPC, which must have a quorum of four, cannot meet unless the Centre appoints new independent members. This is the first time that the bimonthly policy announcement has been deferred since the establishment of the MPC in 2016 through the RBI Act. The three external members appointed by the government — Chetan Ghate, a professor at Indian Statistical Institute; Pami Dua, director at Delhi School of Economics; and Ravindra Dholakia, professor at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad — are not eligible for reappointment. The rest of the members of the MPC come from the RBI — Governor Shaktikanta Das, Deputy Governor Dr. Michael D. Patra and Executive Director Dr. Mridul K. Saggar. According to analysts, new external members should have been named by the government well before the deadline as monetary policy carries significance at a time when the economy is witnessing challenges. Without specifying a reason, the RBI said in a statement, “The meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) during September 29, 30 and October 1, 2020... is being rescheduled. The dates of the MPC will be announced shortly.” Review of MPC in 2021 The MPC is scheduled for a review in 2021 when it completes five years.

29 September 2020||Chennai,||‘Shareholder dissent not a setback to LVB-Clix merger’||Despite shareholders voting out seven directors, including the MD and CEO, at the AGM of Lakshmi Vilas Bank on Friday, the merger of the private sector lender with Clix Group will take place sooner than expected, asserted top bank officials. On Sunday, the RBI approved a committee consisting of three independent directors to manage the day-to-day affairs of LVB. The committee, comprising chairperson Meeta Makhan, Shakti Sinha and Satish Kumar Kalra, has been vested with the discretionary powers of the MD and CEO in the interim. “It is not a setback to the merger talks,” two top bank officials said, requesting anonymity. “In fact, it is a blessing to the bank as the current situation has been noticed by the Reserve Bank, which has now appointed a Committee of Directors to manage the bank,” they said. “The bank has kept the RBI notified about the merger talks at every stage. Shareholders have opposed the continuation of old directors and appointment of certain new directors,” they added. “Shareholders don’t have anything against the merger or raising of funds,” the two officials said. As on date, the bank has four independent directors and two RBI nominees. In a statement Mr. Sinha said the interests of deposit holders, bond holders, account holders and creditors are protected as the bank had a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of about 262% on September 27, against a minimum 100% required by the RBI. ‘Merge with a PSB’ All India Bank Employees’ Association general secretary C.H. Venkatachalam mooted the idea of merging Lakshmi Vilas Bank with any south-based public sector bank, “to ensure that public depositors’ money is secured.” Shares of LVB climbed 5.2% to Rs. 20.20 on the BSE on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/shareholder-dissent-not-a-setback-to-lvb-clix-merger/article32720001.ece

(BPCL).  Addressing a post-annual general meeting media conference, Arun Kumar Singh, director, marketing, BPCL, said, “We expect the demand for diesel to reach pre-COVID-19 level in October or November, while the demand for petrol is expected to increase further.” He said during the lockdown, LPG demand rose by 5% to 6%. As the Union Government has finalised plans to disinvest its stake in BPCL this fiscal, the company recently announced a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for workmen.  As many as 1,200, or 10%, of the employees, have opted for VRS, according to K. Padmakar, CMD. Now, BPCL has a little less than 10,000 employees. Stating that the disinvestment plan was on track, he said the government should complete all the formalities by the end of this year. Due diligence by perspective bidders was already over. “This (divestment) is expected to unlock tremendous value through sharpening of professionalism, improvement in efficiencies and increased investment, propelling future growth.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/petrol-consumption-rises-diesel-at-pre-covid-19-level/article32720007.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Realty looks up in July-Sept. quarter as buyers come calling||In some relief to the severely hit real estate sector, homebuyers seem to be returning to the market. Sales in the residential market grew 34% during the July-September 2020 period over the previous quarter, according to JLL Research. However, new launches were restricted, with just 12,654 units unveiled in the quarter under review — a decline of 14% quarter-on-quarter — as developers were focussed on completion of under-construction projects and clearing existing inventory. JLL Research said sales volume across markets such as Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune, rose to 14,415 units as compared to 10,753 units in the April-June 2020 quarter. Mumbai accounted for 29% of the total sales (4,135 units) in the quarter, while 22% of sales (3,112 units) was contributed by Delhi NCR. Growth in sales activity was also driven by stronger demand in Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune, it said. “A combination of favourable factors such as low mortgage rates [and] attractive prices combined with developers’ lucrative payment plans together reinforce the longer term potential of the sector. For end users, the next 12 months are ideal to buy a house,” Ramesh Nair, CEO and Country Head, India, JLL, said. The company said residential market activity is also being supported by renewed interest from NRIs in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in more pent-up demand in the market and increased enquiries received by developers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/realty-looks-up-in-july-sept-quarter-as-buyers-come-calling/article32720018.ece

As a temporary measure, the RBI had increased the borrowing limit for scheduled banks under the marginal standing facility (MSF) scheme from 2% to 3% of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) with effect from March 27, 2020. The facility, which was initially available up to June 30, 2020 was later extended up to September 30, 2020 in view of the disruptions caused by the pandemic. “With a view to providing comfort to banks on their liquidity requirements as also to enable to continue to meet LCR requirements, it has been decided to continue with the MSF relaxation for a further period of six months, i.e., up to March 31, 2021,” the RBI said in a statement. This dispensation, it added, provides increased access to funds to the extent of Rs. 1.49 lakh crore, and also qualifies as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). Under the MSF, banks can borrow overnight at their discretion by dipping into the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-extends-enhanced-borrowing-limit-for-banks-till-march-31/article32720011.ece

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||RCB pips MI in a Super Over thriller||Royal Challengers Bangalore edged out Mumbai Indians in a thrilling IPL encounter at the Dubai International Stadium which was decided in the Super Over. From a precarious position, MI had roared back into contention following an incredible late assault from Ishan Kishan (99, 58b, 2x4, 9x6) and Kieron Pollard (60 not out, 24b, 3x4, 5x6). It was Pollard who pulled seamer Isuru Udana to the fence off the last ball to force a Super Over after MI had needed five off the final delivery. Saini sizzles RCB pacer Navdeep Saini did very well to concede just seven — there was a bye — in the Super Over. With a single needed off the last ball, bowled by Jasprit Bumrah, skipper Virat Kohli flicked a full toss to the square-leg fence to script a tense win. Faced with a huge target of 202, MI was staring down the barrel at 78 for four. Ishan and Pollard started quietly, before launching an offensive with 80 needed off the final four overs. Pollard took Adam Zampa apart for 27 runs in the 17th over. Fellow leggie Yuzvendra Chahal was the next to face the music, going for 22. With the equation down to 31 off 12 balls, fast bowler Saini was called into action. He started brilliantly, conceding singles in the first four deliveries, before Ishan cut loose with a straight six. MI needed 19 runs off the 20th over bowled by Udana. Ishan belted two sixes over long-on before holing out one short of a well-deserved century. Pollard, however, ensured that the contest spilled into the one-over shootout. RCB nearly paid a big price for two dropped catches. Substitute fielder Pawan Negi put down Pollard on 11, while Ishan was given a life by Gurkeerat Mann in the 20th over. Earlier, enterprising knocks from Aaron Finch (52, 35b, 7x4, 1x6), Devdutt Padikkal (54, 40b, 5x4, 2x6), A.B. de Villiers (55 not out, 24b, 4x4, 4x6) and Shivam Dube (27 not out, 10b, 1x4, 3x6) powered RCB to 201. Padikkal made up for a slow start with two big sixes off pacer James Pattinson in the 14th over. de Villiers and Dube gave the innings a blazing finish, smashing 65 off the last four overs. One maximum struck by de Villiers into the fine-leg stand, off a slower delivery from left-arm pacer Trent Boult, stood out. The South African did not spare Bumrah either, clubbing low full tosses straight and swatting length deliveries over mid-wicket. Dube got into the act with three big sixes in the last over, bowled by Pattinson. The only dampener in RCB’s innings was the failure of Kohli, who was prised out by leg-spinner Rahul Chahar for three (11 balls). Kohli and RCB, however, had the last laugh.

We want to have a domestic season. So we have all the combinations and situations ready. But we are keeping in mind the number of COVID cases as well.

First and foremost priority is to hold the series in India.” Bio-secure IPL Ganguly sounded confident about the smooth conduct of the IPL. “Nobody was sure how much we could do... But we were determined to host IPL because we wanted life to be back. “If you look at England, they had Test cricket and lots of county cricket and women’s cricket. It’s a similar sort of situation, a lot of players on different grounds. That’s why it’s similar to having matches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah inside the UAE. “It was possible in England, so we were confident that if we could create the bio-bubble and everything properly, it's possible. “But the only challenge is that for IPL only there are about 300 people in a city… The more the people, the harder it becomes to organise. Touch wood, so far it has been good... I must congratulate the players for the way they have behaved in the bio-bubble because it is not easy just staying in your hotel room. It is a 57-day tournament, so we have some distance to cover. But fingers crossed, surely we will get there.” On M.S. Dhoni’s lack of form, Ganguly said it was never easy for anyone to play a match after more than a year. “He will take some time to get back to rhythm,” said Ganguly.  We are planning to host our domestic season and there is another IPL after that.

29 September 2020||Abu Dhabi,||Capitals look to sustain momentum||Two wins on the trot under its belt, Delhi Capitals will hope to keep the momentum going when it takes on winless Sunrisers Hyderabad here on Tuesday. The Shreyas Iyer-led Capitals first edged past Kings XI Punjab in a thrilling Super Over before thrashing Chennai Super Kings. Sunrisers are the only side yet to register a win, and David Warner and his men will be desperate to turn things around. Despite Jonny Bairstow (61) and Manish Pandey (34) putting Sunrisers in a good position in a chase of 164 against Royal Challengers Bangalore, the team failed to cross the line. Against Kolkata Knight Riders, the middle-order failed to fire and the team settled for a below-par total which the bowling unit couldn’t defend. For Capitals, the South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje has looked sharp, while spinners Axar Patel and Amit Mishra have performed splendidly. An injured Ravichandran Ashwin is likely to miss the match against Sunrisers. In batting, the onus will be on seniors such as Shikhar Dhawan, and he will have the talented Prithvi Shaw for company. Rishabh Pant and Shreyas have also looked in good nick. Williamson may play Sunrisers will need to look beyond Warner and Bairstow. They may consider bringing in Kane Williamson, who has recovered from an injury. The spinners led by Rashid Khan continue to impress, but the side lacks an out-and-out pace bowler. Australian fast bowler Billy Stanlake is an option but with only four overseas slots available, his inclusion looks unlikely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/capitals-look-to-sustain-momentum/article32720115.ece
29 September 2020||Madrid,||Fati, Messi give Koeman era a winning start||Lionel Messi scored in his first game since trying to leave Barcelona as Ronald Koeman began his tenure as coach by overseeing a 4-0 LaLiga demolition of Villarreal on Sunday. Messi converted from the spot 10 minutes before half-time and then the Argentine’s cross forced Pau Torres into scoring an own goal, after an early double from the 17-year-old Ansu Fati had already put Barca in charge. It meant Barcelona’s past, present and future were all among the goals on the same afternoon as Luis Suarez, whose departure was confirmed on Thursday, marked his Atletico Madrid debut by scoring twice in a 6-1 win over Granada. In a farewell message to his best friend last week, Messi took another swipe at the Barca board by saying he was not surprised by the clumsy way Suarez’s exit had been handled. Koeman insisted on Saturday that Messi had been “leading by example” in training and his confidence was repaid at Camp Nou, where the striker, and club-captain, delivered an excellent display. Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to salvage a point for 10-man Juventus in a 2-2 draw at Roma in Serie A on Sunday. Champion Juventus was trailing 2-1 and was a man down at the hour mark following Jordan Veretout’s brace for the hosts and Adrien Rabiot's sending off. Towering header But a towering Ronaldo header earned the equaliser in the 69th minute to avoid handing new Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo a first defeat.  The results: LaLiga: Eibar 1 (Kike 48) lost to Athletic Bilbao 2 (Lopez 40, 87); Osasuna 1 (Torres 38) lost to Levante 3 (Melero Manzanares 41, Roger 77, Morales 81); Atletico Madrid 6 (Costa 9, Correa 47, Felix 65, Llorente 72, Suarez 85, 90+3) bt Granada 1 (Jorge Molina 87).

29 September 2020||KOZHIKODE,||Tewatia did a terrific job: Smith||Rahul Tewatia kept his promise. He had told his captain Steve Smith that he would hit three sixes off Sheldon Cottrell. He hit five in fact, all in one over. Stunning onslaught That stunning onslaught on the West Indies left-arm pacer turned Sunday night’s IPL match on its head. Tewatia’s 53 (31b, 7x6) powered Rajasthan Royals to a historic, four-wicket win over Kings XI Punjab at Sharjah. The 27-year-old from Haryana may have taken the world by shock, but not his teammates. “We have seen in the nets what we saw in the Cottrell over,” said Smith. “We had a competition to determine who would hit most sixes in an over and Tewatia hit four or five,” said Sanju Samson, whose 42-ball 85 set up Royals’ audacious chase. When Samson fell at the start of the 17th over, it had looked virtually curtains for Royals, whose fans would have rather preferred to see the back of Tewatia.  The left-hander was batting on 14, after consuming 21 balls, and Royals needed 63 off 3.1 overs. Then, Tewatia took a liking to Cottrell. “Credit to him,” said Smith. “He did a terrific job in the end.”   Tewatia said Samson had pepped him up during their third-wicket stand. “He told me that if I managed to hit one six, I will hit more,” he said. The day after, Royals posted a three-year old tweet by Tewatia that made interesting reading. “Keep the faith,” Tewatia had tweeted. “The most amazing things in life tend to happen right at the moment you’re about to give up hope.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tewatia-did-a-terrific-job-smith/article32720124.ece
29 September 2020||MILAN,||When Totti’s voice worked a miracle!||Roma legend Francesco Totti on Monday visited a teenage girl in hospital who emerged from a nine-month coma after hearing a recording of the former Italian football star’s voice. Ilenia Matilli, an 19-year-old footballer with Lazio’s women’s team but a great fan of city rival Roma, was left in a coma last December by a car accident in which her friend was killed. Former World Cup winner Totti had recorded a video message a few months ago, urging: “Ilenia don’t give up, you’ll do it, we are all with you”. “She smiled at me, hugged me and started crying,” Totti said after a long meeting. “It was very exciting to meet Ilenia. When she comes out of hospital we will meet again.” Matilli can still not speak, but makes herself understood by gestures and expresses herself through a tablet on which she writes. “Don’t give up, you’ll make it,” said Totti. “Hurry up and get well. I’ll come and visit you at home when you can talk and walk.” “Francesco accepted immediately, you can see that he is a person with a good heart, talking to him today in the hospital was like talking to a brother,” said Ilenia’s father Stefano.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/when-tottis-voice-worked-a-miracle/article32719980.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Need to plan according to the pitch: Mishra||“Compared to Dubai and Sharjah, the pitch in Abu Dhabi is slower. It gives batsmen more time to play their strokes. They plan accordingly. Bowlers, too, have to strategise considering the slowness of the pitch.” Leg-spinner Amit Mishra was talking at a virtual press conference about the playing surface ahead of table-topper Delhi Capitals’ clash on Tuesday with Sunrisers Hyderabad. “Since the boundaries are shorter in Sharjah, the bowlers have to plan differently. He maintained that Capitals' two straight wins notwithstanding there was no question of taking any team lightly. “Every team has great potential and can bounce back from any stage, like we saw last night in the match involving Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals. “We have to focus on our strength and look to execute our plans,” he said. Asked about his Haryana teammate and fellow leg-spinner Rahul Tewatia who turned the match on its head for Royals on Sunday night, Mishra said, “Tewatia has concentrated a lot on his batting and all the hard work paid off. Initially, he struggled to get the ball away, but then those five sixes in an over (from Sheldon Cottrell) proved decisive. His success is also good news for Haryana cricket.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/need-to-plan-according-to-the-pitch-mishra/article32720121.ece

The side’s two key cricketers, Ambati Rayudu and Dwayne Bravo, are back fit and firing. CSK CEO K.S. Viswanathan told The Hindu , “Rayudu has recovered well from a hamstring strain and will play in the next game. He ran and sprinted during training and batted without any discomfort at the nets.” Rayudu had donned a key role with the willow in CSK’s victory over Mumbai Indians in the IPL opener. And Bravo, whose clever changes of pace, yorkers, awareness of situations and power-hitting down the order have been deeply influential for CSK, has regained fitness after injuring his thigh that kept him away from bowling. “He bowled well at the nets,” said Kasi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bravo-and-rayudu-fit-and-raring-to-go/article32720216.ece
29 September 2020||LONDON,||Handball rule in EPL draws flak||The fulltime whistle had yet to be blown but the Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho stormed down the tunnel — his head down and hands in his pockets — after seeing his team fall foul of a handball ruling that has become the biggest talking point of the Premier League season. The Premier League has fallen in line with the rest of European football this season and applied the ruling in a stricter way rather simply than judging it on intent. Dier was adjudged to have made his body unnaturally bigger by having his arm out when it was hit by the ball, leaving the referee little option but to award a penalty, which Newcastle converted to draw 1-1. Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson said the newly adopted rule was killing the game after his team lost 2-1 by conceding a handball penalty for the winning goal. “This penalty nonsense is ruining the game,” tweeted former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/handball-rule-in-epl-draws-flak/article32719981.ece

The decision was taken during MOC’s virtual meeting, held to discuss financial proposals of over Rs. 1.5 crore in six sports — shooting, badminton, boxing, para sports, weightlifting and hockey — which are part of the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). The committee also approved the proposal of shooters to procure ammunition so that they can train at their home ranges. Anjum Moudgil and Mairaj Ahmad Khan’s proposals for equipment and training were also cleared. In boxing, the committee ratified the three-month overseas training programme (effective from September 7) of Vikas Krishan and his personal coach Ron Simms Jr. in the USA. The committee also cleared the participation of shuttlers K.

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Invaluable legacy||All the divine avatars that the Lord takes are for reinstating the Sanatana Dharma. But these are also rich with His innumerable auspicious qualities that have endeared Him to humanity. These avatars have taken place in the earlier Krita, Treta and Dwapara yugas. But in Kali Yuga, it is believed that He takes the avatar of Bhagavatottamas to inspire and instil bhakti among the people, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. In the Bhagavata Purana there is mention about the advent of devout saints in Kali Yuga. It is foretold that great Mahans steeped in Narayana bhakti will be born in South India on the banks of the rivers Tamparaparani, Vaigai, Palar, Kaveri, Mahanadi, and so on. It is an interesting fact that the surge in bhakti in South India has grown on parallel lines, with the Azhwars and Nayanmars who have propagated Vishnu and Siva bhakti respectively. The Nalayira Divya Prabandha of the twelve Azhwars and the Panniru Tirumurais of the Nayanmars are ecstatic outpourings in praise of God and are an invaluable legacy for posterity. Though the Lord is Supreme and transcendent, He is seen to be easily accessible to these bhaktas. They not only feel His presence in their inner selves but also behold Him in close proximity in the form of deities in the temples. Among these bhaktas, many similarities are to be seen in Kulasekhara Azhwar and Cheraman Peruman Nayanar. Both hail from Kerala and have been reputed rulers and devout saints in their own ways. Kulasekhara Azhwar belongs to the category of raja rishis like Janaka who evinced exceptional realisation in spite of bearing the burden of kingship. Cheraman Peruman Nayanar ruled the kingdom but never ceased to be the ardent devotee of Siva and His Adiyars.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/invaluable-legacy/article32720107.ece

29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Bring on the music, Master||Jerusalema Ikhaya Lami / Ngilondol loze / Uhambe Nami/ zungangishiyi Lami (Guard me, walk with me, do not leave me here) If there is one thing that the pandemic-hit world needs, it’s this song, ‘Jerusalema’. The astounding composition is by 24-year-old Master KG, a South Africa-based DJ and producer. Sung by Nomcebo Zikode, the Zulu number has been unofficially labelled an ‘African Anthem’ and is now a global hit. The official music video was released at the end of 2019 on YouTube, and caught the fancy of people at the beginning of 2020 and is now making waves beyond South Africa with views crossing 158 million at the time of going to press. The Gospel-influenced House fusion got elevated further when a dance challenge under the hashtag JerusalemaDanceChallenge was started by a group of young Angolans in February this year. The world erupted in a dance to the challenge and what followed was an unprecedented frenzy with healthcare staff in hospitals, prison officials, monks and nuns, Latino dancers, fire safety workers, lawyers, cops, school students across Africa, the U.S., the U.K., Europe, Russia and Australia participating in the challenge. The dance challenge got its endorsement when South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, while addressing the nation ahead of Heritage Day, urged his countrymen to live up to the spirit of the ‘Jerusalema’ challenge. It all started with the dance group ‘Fenomenos do Semba’ in Angola releasing a video of their members dancing to ‘Jerusalema’, to celebrate their fifth anniversary in February this year. Their candid air while holding plates of food and dancing flawlessly in a modest neighbourhood struck a chord. The foot-tapping rhythm and the enticing yet simple steps became irresistible for dancers. Speaking to us from Luanda, Angola, dancer-choreographer Adilson Maiza from Fenomenos do Semba says, “We made the video as a joke and didn’t expect this worldwide success or the video to go viral.” Explaining the reason for holding the plates that’s become the signature of the dance, Adilson says, “We wanted to convey that we should be happy even with the little that life offers us, despite the difficulties we face every day. The important thing is to be happy even with little food to eat and little water to drink.” Dance for all For those with two left feet, there are tutorials. Melbourne-based Zumba and fitness expert Keren Green is one among many who put up their tutorial videos of the dance on YouTube. Her video hit more than two million views in no time. “My father is from South Africa and my mother, from Israel, so I was interested in traditional African dance. I realised this might be of interest to people and an opportunity for me to help people learn the steps correctly.” A single mother of two children, Keren is wistful that she could not monetise her views on YouTube as the song she used is copyrighted. “But there’s so much positive feedback and responses from people, it’s beautiful and touching. And to reach people all across the world is humbling,” she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bring-on-the-music-master/article32720325.ece
29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||Welcome back, birds of winter||The greenish warblers have arrived in millions, after flying thousands of kilometres from the mountains of Central Asia. The forested areas of the Indian peninsula are now aflutter with high-pitched sounds of this wispy little, olive green bird that goes sti-ti-ti-ti-ti-si... “These birds arrive singing,” says Ganeshwar S.V., founder of Salem Ornithological Foundation. “These are territorial songs staking claim to their trees or little segments of forest as they settle down. The songs echo across the foothills, plains, plateaus, and hill ranges now,” he adds. Every year, between September and October, one can witness movement of birds in large numbers, signifying the start of migration. It is the annual dispersal of birds from the northern hemisphere to the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka. “Like our highways, we have nine flyways in the world the waterbirds use for migration,” says S. Sivakumar, scientist at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). “For Asia, it is the Central Asian Flyway that covers 30 countries, including India at the tail end, with huge landmass and habitat variations, especially the wetlands.” When daylight shrinks and there is shortage of food supply at the breeding sites, the birds take the cue and start migrating towards wintering sites in the South. The return journey begins in March or April. While the shorebirds like waders and ducks, and raptors come from Siberia and Russia, birds like the European flycatcher, brown-breasted flycatcher, and barn swallow come from Europe. “India receives birds from 29 countries during migration. In Tamil Nadu, Point Calimere Sanctuary on the East Coast sees migratory birds in lakhs. The ‘little stint’ that breeds in Siberia — a small bird that weighs just about 20 grams — crosses 8,000 kilometres to get here,” says Sivakumar. Another common migratory bird that has kept its date is the grey wagtail. “It comes from Central Asia and Russia and has already landed at forested areas of South India,” says Ashvin Viswanathan, a bird watcher for two decades, and a research associate at the Nature Conservation Foundation based in Bengaluru. At Valparai in Anamalai forest range of the Western Ghats near Coimbatore, a team of Young Birders Network welcomed this visitor with posters that carried a thank-you note for making the trip. “For the past five years, every September we wait for the call of the grey wagtail,” says K. Selvaganesh, who teaches at Cinchona Government School and mentors his students in bird watching. “It can be seen easily in wooded areas, elevations, and at streams near hills. It feeds on insects and maintains the balance of the food chain.” Birders aflutter The arrival of migratory birds has cheered up the birding community in the Nilgiris. “The black-and-white Japanese flycatcher, Asian brown flycatcher and verditer flycatcher can be easily spotted at common places like Sim’s Park in Coonoor, Botanical Garden in Udhagamandalam, and Doddabetta, the highest peak in the Nilgiris,” says Aggal Shivalingam, who has been into bird watching for over 15 years and guides tourists on the same. Some birds are passage migrants, like the spotted flycatcher, rufous-tailed scrub robin, and European roller. They migrate through a large part of Western India and go to Africa to spend the winter there. The amur falcons pass through India in December. “A small population of European bee-eaters believed to be a passage migrant stayed put in Tamil Nadu for six months,” says Ganeshwar. S. Senthil Kumar, a school headmaster and member of the Salem Ornithological Foundation, has tracked the arrival and departure of the European bee-eater for three years at Stanley Reservoir near Mettur Dam in Salem, one of South India’s largest dams. “It’s a vibrant and colourful bird that can be spotted anywhere in India. Mettur Dam wetlands attract thousands of marsh sandpipers, Caspian and white terns, green shanks, red shanks, and gulls. We noticed that the brown shrikes have a high rate of fidelity towards location and keep returning to the same spot every year,” says Ganeshwar. This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, bird watchers are documenting migratory birds from their backyard. “There is an increase in the number of bird watchers. They are documenting their observations on e-bird online platforms, as a result of which we are able to see migration in action, for example, in the form of maps on the migratory route of birds,” says Ashvin, as he waits to catch a glimpse of a small brown bird called Blyth’s reed warbler. He says, “The first bird will arrive in Bengaluru soon. It is exciting to welcome these birds that will be a part of our world for the next six or eight months.” Says Sivakumar, “We have to conserve our wetlands to ensure that the birds get enough food, gain weight, and are healthy enough to make a safe return flight.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/welcome-back-birds-of-winter/article32720321.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||End stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana: plea||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Union government to respond to a plea seeking an end to stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notices to the respective State Pollution Control Boards on the plea by Sudhir Mishra, an advocate, seeking urgent steps to curb stubble burning. Senior advocate Arvind Nayar, representing Mr. Mishra, argued that in the current pandemic situation, the stubble burning would lead to massive increase in the number of emergency cases. “The high level of pollution caused due to stubble burning also affects the respiratory functions in human beings, making the immune system weaker,” the application filed through advocate Ritwika Nanda and Petal Chandhok stated. The application cited various news reports of recent stubble burning in parts of Punjab and Haryana. However, very little was being done to curb the escalating situation of constantly rising air pollution, it said. Next hearing The High Court has listed the matter for hearing on October 22 and asked the Centre to find out if any similar matter was pending before the Supreme Court. The application was filed in an already pending case to curb air pollution in the Capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/end-stubble-burning-in-punjab-haryana-plea/article32720339.ece
29 September 2020||GURUGRAM,||Woman called out in FB post for dumping pet dog on road||A woman was left red-faced after a Facebook post called her out for abandoning her dog on Sunday. While the woman now claims to want her pet back saying that there was a “big misunderstanding”, the dog’s rescuer is mulling a criminal case on charges of atrocities against the animal. The woman, travelling in a sedan, stopped briefly in the middle of Southern Peripheral Road on Sunday evening to dump her fully-grown German Shepherd, with a muzzle on, and hurriedly drove away, said Sector 5 resident Akshima Jhajhria, who happened to notice the act and also managed to take down the vehicle’s registration number. She then rescued the dog and decided to keep it. Akshima then along with the car’s registration number, put out a post on Facebook. “You could have put the dog for adoption or surrendered him to a shelter but the only thing that you could think of was leaving him muzzled in the middle of the flyover? Kutta chod toh diya, usko muzzle bhi lga do takki bechara bin khaana paani k marr jaaye ? ABSOLUTELY SHAMELESS. [SIC],” read the post. Akshima told The Hindu that the woman contacted her through direct message after the post, asking her dog back. The woman told her that the dog had bitten a few people in her society and therefore she had given it to someone. However, Akshima, argued that the car belonged to the woman and she was even spotted her dumping the dog. Meenakshi Rajagopalan, an animal rights activist, said people should do some research before buying a pet since it was a commitment for 14-15 years. “Just because people have money, pets have become a ‘commodity’. Most of these pets are bought from illegal pet stores from breeders without a license. Many think of pets as disposable commodities and end up dumping them on the road where these pets absolutely do not know how to survive. Least if they want to rehome their pet, they need to approach an NGO or adoption coordinators who can help find a better family,” said Ms. Rajagopalan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/woman-called-out-in-fb-post-for-dumping-pet-dog-on-road/article32720342.ece
29 September 2020||September 29 2020 00:00 IST,||An unforgettable interview with SP Balasubrahmanyam in Coimbatore when the singer also sang a few lines exclusively for a scribe||July 28, 2006, was a lucky day for me. My favourite singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam was in town for a concert and I reached the venue at Perks School grounds in Coimbatore early enough, hoping to get an exclusive interview with him. The event organisers turned down my request, but I was not going to let go. I sat in the front row, mesmerised, as he sang some of his gems like ‘Sangeetha Megham’, ‘Idhu Oru Ponmalai’ and ‘Kaeladi Kanmani’. During a break between the songs, I clambered on to the stage and whispered my request to him. SPB promised to meet me at his hotel after the concert. He kept his word, and greeted me with his trademark smile and a “Thanks for your patience.” That was the start of my 40-minute conversation with the legendary singer. “Even today, I have a thousand butterflies in my stomach before every song,” he told me. He spoke of his favourites — the National-award winning, ‘Omkaara Naadhanu’ from Shankarabharanam and the Ilaiyaraaja composition, ‘Sundari Kannaal’, composed in Mumbai with late music director R.D. Burman’s orchestra. SPB smiled as he remembered how after the recording, the troupe gave the composer a standing ovation. ‘Kaeladi Kanmani’ from the film Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal is one of his top-100 favourite songs. He said it was an ‘extraordinary composition’ of Ilaiyaraaja and described it, “a thesis that can be presented at the Trinity College for learners.” I made it a point to be at as many concerts as possible when he was in town. And every time, the experience was thrilling and moving at the same time because he had such a cheery presence and powerful performance on stage. His banter with his co-singers, appreciation to the members of the orchestra, and his ready wit, made the concert a complete entertainer. His stage performances mostly began with ‘Sangeetha Megam’ from Udhaya Geetham . During a concert once, much to the consternation of the gathering, it began drizzling. SPB just smiled and assured the audience, “It’s His blessings; don’t worry, it will rain only after 9.30 p.m. after the show is over.” There are many memories, but there’s one in particular that is special. On the evening of my interview with him, SPB’s team kept urging him to have dinner and rest. But he continued speaking to me. At the end of the interview, I asked him if he would sing a few lines and... he did. The melodious ‘Nilavey Vaa’ exclusively for me.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/an-unforgettable-interview-with-sp-balasubrahmanyam-in-coimbatore-when-the-singer-also-sang-a-few-lines-exclusively-for-a-scribe/article32720323.ece
29 September 2020||GURUGRAM,||50 active fires detected in Haryana||The Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), which has been monitoring stubble burning in the State since last Friday, has managed to detect nearly 50 active fire spots. Last year, around 6,600 incidents of stubble burning were recorded in Haryana. Karnal, known as the rice bowl of Haryana, has recorded the maximum 19 spots followed by Kurukshetra (11), Kaithal (8), Fatehabad (6), and three each in Hisar and Ambala. Besides, Panipat and Yamuna Nagar have recorded two spots each and a lone spot in Jind. Speaking to The Hindu , Haryana State Pollution Control Board member-secretary S. Narayanan said the information regarding the active fire spots received from HARSAC was passed on to the Deputy Commissioners concerned for putting up strict vigilance. He said all these spots might not necessarily be farm fires and the cause of the fire would be confirmed from field officers. “A few of these could be accidental fires,” said Mr. Narayanan. He said action would be initiated as per the law after the confirmation. Mr. Narayanan added that 30 “red villages” were identified in each of these districts with a history of frequent farm fires and the list was shared with the Deputy Commissioners to focus on them. “So far, the incidents are sporadic,” he said, adding that it was “too early” to comment on the trend this year but expressed hope that there would be fewer incidents this time. The stubble burning by the farmers in Haryana and Punjab in the first fortnight of October aggravates the pollution situation in the National Capital Region and the problem has come to acquire serious proportions over the past couple of years disrupting the normal life. Mr. Narayanan said the agriculture department provided eco-friendly equipment to the farmers and held demonstrations to dissuade them from stubble burning, but the role of the pollution department was more of an enforcement agency. “But we too have put up hoardings and conducted programmes and webinars to spread awareness. The farmers are law-abiding and if assisted properly the incidents of farm fires could be easily reduced,” said Mr. Narayanan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/50-active-fires-detected-in-haryana/article32720340.ece
29 September 2020||New Delhi,||HC warns it can stay release of UPSC preliminary exam results||The Delhi High Court on Monday warned that it could stay the release of results of the civil service examination (preliminary), scheduled to be held on October 4, over the Department of Personnel and Training’s (DoPT) response on reservation for people with disabilities. An HC Bench also came down heavily on the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) over the submission that the reserved seats for the disabled category are fixed but the total seats are “fluctuating”. “How will you keep one figure constant and another fluctuating,” the Bench queried, adding: “We will immediately give a stay [on the prelims result] and a lot of difficulty will be created because of lack of arguments from the side of the respondents [UPSC and DoPT].” The HC was hearing a petition by Sambhavana, a registered society for disability rights, claiming that the UPSC has reserved only 24 places for persons with disabilities out of a total 796 “expected approximate vacancies”. 4% quota A petition, filed through advocates Krishan Mahajan and Ajay Kumar Chopra, said the figure was below the 4% mandatory reservation under Section 34 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016. The plea said that 4% of 796 vacancies worked out to 32. The DoPT, in its affidavit, stated that out of 24 participating services, some of the Cadre Controlling Authorities of services like IPS, DANIPS and RPF have not reserved vacancies for PwBD (Persons with Benchmark Disabilities) candidates. The DoPT said this was on account of the fact that these services are exempted from reserving vacancies for PwBD candidates as per functional requirements of these services. Thus, 4% vacancies for PwBD candidates should be calculated individually for each service, the DoPT said. Additionally, some of the services have taken a conscious decision to exclude some sub-categories of PwBD like IRTS (Indian Railway Traffic Service) which has not been found suitable for visually impaired and hearing impaired PwBD, the DoPT said. The Bench posted the case for further hearing on October 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-warns-it-can-stay-release-of-upsc-preliminary-exam-results/article32720336.ece
29 September 2020||NEW DELHI,||Four policemen fired for misreporting drug seizure||Four policemen, including two Sub-Inspectors, were dismissed from service after they allegedly misreported the quantity of marijuana seized from a local drug peddler during a raid earlier this month, said a senior police officer. On September 11, a raid was conducted by a team from Jahangirpuri police station at a house under their jurisdiction during which approximately 160kg of marijuana was seized.

The accused officers officially reported that only 960 grams of drug was seized and later sold off the remaining quantity, he said. The officer confirmed that after the incident came to light, the matter was forwarded to vigilance cell for inquiry. Based on vigilance report against the policemen, all four were dismissed from the service with immediate effect and a case has been registered against them under Prevention of Corruption Act and several other Sections of IPC. “The accused policemen are absconding and their mobile phones are switched off. A team has been formed to arrest them,” said the officer. The officer added that the role of ACP and SHO has also come under the scanner.

29 September 2020||New Delhi,||Bail expiry: are there enough isolation wards in jails, asks HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked prison authorities here whether they have sufficient number of isolation wards to accommodate all prisoners, who would surrender, if the bail extension orders issued due to the pandemic are recalled. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Talwant Singh also sought the details regarding the number of COVID-19 cases in the three jails in the Capital, the number of prisoners who are out on bail and need to surrender in the next month and the number of isolation wards in each of the three jails. The court was hearing an application seeking modification of the High Court’s July 13 and July 24 orders by which it had clarified that its orders extending interim bails/paroles would be applicable to everyone granted the relief before or after March 16. Misuse of orders The application has alleged that the two orders were being misused by prisoners by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or such other reasons, instead of seeking regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the High Court’s direction. The court said it will not permit misuse of its orders and it will recall its extension order if it was being misused. It also issued notice to the Director General (DG) Prisons, who is in-charge of the all three jails — Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli — in the Capital and sought his stand before the next date of hearing on October 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bail-expiry-are-there-enough-isolation-wards-in-jails-asks-hc/article32720345.ece
